MAS survey shows economists raising 2025 growth forecast","snippet":"Economists have raised Singapore\u2019s 2025 economic growth forecast to 4.1%, up from 2.4% in the previous quarter, according to a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) survey. This optimism is driven by stronger-than-expected third-quarter data and a robust global tech cycle. However, growth is projected to slow to 2.3% in 2026. Major downside risks include geopolitical tensions and the possibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble burst\u2014an emerging concern not previously highlighted. On the upside, continued AI-driven technological advancements and resilient global demand are seen as supportive factors.\n\nInflation projections remain stable for 2025, with core and headline inflation forecasts at 0.7% and 0.9% respectively, though both are expected to rise to 1.3% and 1.5% in 2026. Monetary policy is anticipated to remain unchanged in upcoming MAS reviews, with only a small fraction of economists expecting tightening by July 2026. The optimistic growth outlook aligns with the trade ministry\u2019s revised GDP estimate of around 4.0% for 2025. The survey, completed by 20 economists on November 21, followed data showing a 4.2% year-on-year GDP increase in Q3 2025.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1765944181.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/dbs-expects-singapore-gdp-double-by-2040-singapore-dollar-parity-with-greenback-2025-10-22/","title":"DBS expects Singapore GDP to double by 2040, Singapore dollar parity with greenback","snippet":"DBS Group Research projects that Singapore's GDP will more than double by 2040, rising from $547 billion in 2024 to between $1.2 trillion and $1.4 trillion. The bank forecasts an average real GDP growth rate of 2.3% annually over the next 15 years, which would outperform other advanced economies. Additionally, DBS anticipates the Singapore dollar reaching parity with the U.S. dollar and the Straits Times Index (STI) climbing to around 10,000, breaking a long-standing plateau.\n\nKey drivers behind this growth include disciplined policy-making, capital inflows due to Singapore\u2019s safe-haven status, productivity gains, and a consistent current account surplus. The STI\u2019s recent move past 4,000 in 2025 signals a bullish medium-term market outlook. \n\nNational Development Minister Chee Hong Tat emphasized Singapore\u2019s commitment to staying competitive and connected globally, noting the country\u2019s financial sector expanded 6.8% last year, with over S$6 trillion in assets under management. The Monetary Authority of Singapore's S$5 billion equity market development programme aims to boost liquidity in small- and mid-cap stocks.

Unlike traditional interest rate targeting, MAS manages policy through the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). MAS announced a slight reduction in the slope of the policy band, while keeping its width and center unchanged. This adjustment aligns with a gradual appreciation of the S$NEER to maintain medium-term price stability.\n\nThis policy shift comes as core inflation continues to moderate, falling from a peak of 5.5% in early 2023 to 1.8% in December. As a result, MAS revised its 2025 core inflation forecast down to 1.0%-2.0%, from 1.5%-2.5%. Headline inflation projections remained at 1.5%-2.5%. Singapore\u2019s GDP grew 4% in 2024, surpassing expectations, but is projected to slow to 1%-3% in 2025. Since October 2021, MAS had tightened policy five times due to pandemic-related and geopolitical inflation pressures. Market responses were modest, with the Singapore dollar stabilizing and the domestic stock index rising 0.7% following the announcement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1737679820.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.forecasts.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.forecasts.org/singd.htm","title":"Singapore Dollar to US Dollar Exchange Rate Forecast","snippet":"Current Detailed Forecast of Singapore Dollar to US Dollar Exchange Rates with chart of SGD/USD and historical data.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1765866481.0,"attribution":"www.forecasts.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"coincodex.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://coincodex.com/forex/usd-sgd/forecast/","title":"USD to SGD Forecast: US dollar vs Singapore Dollar 2025 ...","snippet":"The USD to SGD exchange rate is forecasted to decrease by -1.90% in the next month, dropping from the current rate of $ 1.29 to $ 1.26.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"coincodex.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"longforecast.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://longforecast.com/singapore-dollar-forecast-2017-2018-2019-2020-2021-usd-to-sgd","title":"DOLLAR TO SINGAPORE DOLLAR FORECAST 2025, ...","snippet":"USD to SGD forecast for March 2026.

The MAS announced it would reduce the rate at which the Singapore dollar appreciates against a basket of major currencies, helping to lower borrowing costs in the trade-reliant economy. This move comes amid uncertainty linked to Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency and possible trade frictions. Unlike most central banks, the MAS manages monetary policy via exchange rate adjustments rather than interest rates. December's core inflation rose 1.8% year-on-year, below 2% for the second straight month, prompting the MAS to lower its 2025 inflation forecast to 1-2%. The central bank also predicted slower GDP growth, from 4% in 2024 to between 1% and 3% in 2025.

If the Fed eases faster than Singapore\u2019s policy bias, the USD could weaken relative to SGD.\n\n**Implication:** Structural tendency for SGD to strengthen if Singapore\u2019s NEER policy remains stable or tightening relative to the U.S. stance.\n\n---\n\n### 2) **Macro Growth & Trade Flows**\n- Singapore\u2019s **current account surplus and export strength** support SGD demand long-run.
