The legislation aims to empower courts to order the removal of \"synthetic abuse\" and address the growing issue of AI-generated deepfakes, which overwhelmingly target women and girls. In 2023, 98% of the 95,820 deepfake videos online were sexually explicit, most depicting women. Opposition leader Mark Speakman and shadow attorney-general Alister Henskins emphasized the emotional harm caused by these abuses and the need for modern laws to reflect technological changes. The initiative follows the tragic suicide of 15-year-old Matilda Rosewarne, a victim of cyberbullying involving fake images. A report by the NSW Parliamentary Research Service highlighted the inadequacy of existing intimate image laws to address deepfakes. The eSafety Commission reported a 550% increase in explicit deepfakes since 2019. Opposition spokeswoman for women Felicity Wilson underscored the widespread impact of AI abuse in schools, sports, workplaces, and homes, and called for unified political and societal support to combat the issue and protect women from digital exploitation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751948340.0,"attribution":"www.news.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_pornography","title":"Feminist views on pornography - Wikipedia","snippet":"In this instance, both against and pro-pornography feminists recognize that \"exploitation ...

19-year-old student from Margate, met for a vegetarian meal as part of the \"Dining across the divide\" series to discuss their differing views, particularly around sex, gender expectations, and feminism. Jo supports sex before marriage, emphasizing communication and compatibility, while Ruby is critical of a hypersexualized culture and advocates for more meaningful sexual connections. They both agreed that sex work should be decriminalized but expressed skepticism about its liberating potential, noting its male-dominated nature and the societal pressures it reflects. They also delved into issues such as feminist sex parties, self-awareness, and how women navigate gendered expectations, including plastic surgery. While Ruby views cosmetic procedures as reinforcing stereotypes, Jo believes they can help some women reclaim confidence, especially after childbirth. Despite their differences, both appreciated each other's openness and commitment to women's issues, with Ruby admiring Jo\u2019s work in education and Jo impressed by Ruby\u2019s wisdom.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752404438.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview","title":"Stoya: 'I thought female sexuality was an OK thing?' - The Guardian","snippet":"The porn star says her book, Philosophy, Pussycats and Porn, is an attempt to find a 'serious language' for sex.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1530144000.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Lust","title":"Erika Lust","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751244145.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porn_for_women","title":"Porn for women","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749136975.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Girl_%282004_film%29","title":"The Good Girl (2004 film)","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751605119.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_pornography","title":"Feminist views on pornography","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751924419.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6875d36db5bc8007935f89db00299457","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"95f660c66e279d24-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"2ad1f603-d6a0-458b-bb86-3035ea54f61e","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2ad1f603-d6a0-458b-bb86-3035ea54f61e","children":["7b7ed471-4f56-47a0-b74e-bb609ae617ef"]},"7b7ed471-4f56-47a0-b74e-bb609ae617ef":{"id":"7b7ed471-4f56-47a0-b74e-bb609ae617ef","message":{"id":"7b7ed471-4f56-47a0-b74e-bb609ae617ef","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752552323.991428,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering sources for deeper analysis","content":"I already have sources on the existence of ethical porn, deepfake regulation, and the impact of banning on sex workers.

Replacing all porn with synthetic images risks:  \n\n- dismantling livelihoods of consenting adults who choose sex work,  \n- entrenching new forms of non\u2011consensual abuse via deepfakes, and  \n- expanding censorship regimes that historically silence sexual minorities and women.  \n\nA more nuanced path\u2014strengthening performer agency, tightening safety standards, and regulating AI tools\u2014addresses exploitation without erasing human sexual expression."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search10\ue201","start_idx":382,"end_idx":415,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Lust?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_pornography?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Lust?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_pornography?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Erika Lust","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Lust?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1751244145.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"Feminist views on pornography","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_pornography?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1751924419.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201","start_idx":675,"end_idx":694,"safe_urls":["https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Stoya: 'I thought female sexuality was an OK thing?' - The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1530144000.0,"snippet":"The porn star says her book, Philosophy, Pussycats and Porn, is an attempt to find a 'serious language' for sex.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3news10\ue202turn3search1\ue201","start_idx":1586,"end_idx":1617,"safe_urls":["https://www.economist.com/international/2025/06/26/sex-work-in-the-gig-economy?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sweden-sex-trade-onlyfans-ngc9bndfg?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sweden-sex-trade-onlyfans-ngc9bndfg?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/international/2025/06/26/sex-work-in-the-gig-economy?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Is OnlyFans prostitution?

This move significantly restricts OnlyFans' operations in Sweden by banning users from influencing content creation through chat services, thus undermining the platform\u2019s interactive features. Creators like Mirka Norrstrom and Cara, for whom OnlyFans had been a primary income source, argue that they are selling fantasy and not sex, and fear the law could push some into riskier physical sex work due to lack of alternatives. Despite OnlyFans' legal compliance in various jurisdictions, the Swedish government hasn't engaged directly with sex workers, leading to concerns about enforcement and fairness.
