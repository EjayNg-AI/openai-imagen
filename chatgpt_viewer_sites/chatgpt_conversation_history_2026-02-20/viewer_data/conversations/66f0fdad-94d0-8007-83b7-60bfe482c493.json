They include:\r\n\r\n1. **Academic Performance**: Demonstrates a clear positive correlation with employment status, highlighting its role as a strong predictor of employability.\r\n\r\n2. **School Ranking by MOE**: While the median ranking is consistent across employment statuses, higher-ranked schools are associated with poorer employment outcomes, which is an unexpected result.\r\n\r\n3. **Adverse Legal Records**: Possessing adverse legal records increase the likelihood of employment, which is an unexpected result.\r\n\r\n4. **Nationality**: Foreign nationals exhibit higher employment rates compared to Singaporean nationals, indicating possible advantages in skills, networking, or industry demand.\r\n\r\n5. **Parent Marital Status**: Family background, particularly parental divorce, is linked to higher unemployment rates, suggesting socioeconomic and emotional influences on employment outcomes.\r\n\r\n6. **Extracurricular Activities Type**: The type of extracurricular engagement affects employability, with certain activities like Science & Tech Clubs being negatively associated with employment.\r\n\r\n7. **Presence of Disabilities**: Health-related challenges are associated with slightly higher employment rates, which is an unexpected result.\r\n\r\n8. **Financial Aid Recipient**: No significant association was found, indicating that financial aid does not directly influence employment status.\r\n\r\n9. **Delinquency**: Demonstrates a clear association with employment status, with higher delinquency being associated with higher unemployment. \r\n\r\n10. **Household Income**: No significant correlation with employability was found, indicating that household income does not directly influence employment status.\r\n\r\n11. **Extracurricular activties involvement levels**: No significant correlation with employability was found.\r\n\r\nThe **detailed findings** as well as the **data cleaning and preprocessing** steps are elaborated in subsequent sections of this EDA. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\r\n\r\nData cleaning and preprocessing is necessary in order to verify data integrity, address outliers if any, and correct mistakes in the data wherever possible. These steps need to be done before performing analysis on the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, preprocessing steps are also needed to simplify the data in order to make for a more coherent analysis and build a better machine learning model subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe following cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed:\r\n\r\n1. **Household Income**: Some household income values were found to be negative. There were also extremely large outliers. It was decided that the large outliers are retained for the purpose of the EDA because it is certainly true that some families earn a very high income in Singapore. However in data visualization such as Box Plots, we provide a version without the extreme outliers in order to provide a more grounded visualization of the data. We also comment on how the analysis would differ if the extreme outliers were removed. Subsequently, in developing machine learning models, the extreme outliers will be imputed with the median in order not to adversely affect the model performance using highly skewed data. The negative values were replaced with the median of the household income values (data imputation).\r\n\r\n2. **Academic Performance**: Some GPA grades were non-sensical. Negative values as well as values over 5 were discovered. It is known that the maximum GPA is at most 4 or 5 depending on the educational institution. The National University of Singapore, for instance, allows for a GPA of at most 5. Hence, negative values as well as values above 5 were replaced with the median of the Academic Performance (GPA) values (data imputation).\r\n\r\n3. **Nationality**: Some Nationality values are incorrectly spelled. For instance, ``Foreigner`` was sometimes spelled as ``Foreigne`` and ``Singaporean`` was sometimes spelled as ``Singaporea``. The incorrectly spelled values were replaced with their correctly spelled versions in order to maintain data integrity.\r\n\r\n4. **Extracurricular_Activities_Type**: It was observed that there were many types of extracurricular activities recorded. Some categories could be overlapping, for example, there originally were ``Science Clubs``, ``Technology Clubs``, and simply, ``Clubs``. Originally, there were also ``Sports`` and ``Arts`` categories but these categories only had a very small number of people in them. It was decided for the sake of simplicity that ``Science Clubs`` and ``Technology Clubs`` are merged to form ``Science & Technology Clubs``, whilst ``Clubs``, ``Sports`` and ``Arts`` are merged for form a single ``Miscellaneous`` category. These steps simplify the categories of extracurricular activties without losing too much important data.\r\n\r\n5. **Extracurricular_Activities_Involvement**: There were null values in the Extracurricular_Activities_Involvement column. Since there were only 77 affected rows, it was decided that these rows be removed as their removal would not cause too much data loss.\r\n\r\n6. **Duplicated rows**: After the above steps were performed, any duplicate rows were also discarded, retaining just one copy of each duplicate.\r\n  \r\nThe following table summmarizes the data cleaning and preprocessing steps taken for the purpose of this EDA:\r\n\r\n| **Variable or Feature** | **Processing Method** | **Remarks** |\r\n|--------------|-----------------------|-------------|\r\n| **Household_Income** | Replace negative values with median | Data imputation |\r\n| **Academic_Performance** | Replace negative values and<br>values above 5 with median |  Data imputation |\r\n| **Nationality** | Replace ``Foreigne`` with ``Foreigner``<br>Replace ``Singaporea`` with ``Singaporean`` |  Data correction |\r\n| **Null values** | Entire row discarded | Data cleaning |\r\n| **Duplicated rows** | Duplicates discarded, one copy retained | Data cleaning |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Analysis of Numeric Variables\r\n\r\n### 1. Household Income\r\n\r\n**Summary Statistics by Employment Status**:\r\n\r\n| Employment Status | Mean Income (SGD) | Median Income (SGD) | Std Dev (SGD)    | Min Income (SGD) | Max Income (SGD) |\r\n|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\r\n| **Employed**      | 6,409,349         | 243,063             | 296,192,900      | 922.0             | 1.912919e+10      |\r\n| **Unemployed**    | 1,029,891         | 242,564.5           | 37,927,830       | 0.0               | 2,303,188,000     |\r\n\r\n**Boxplot Analysis**:\r\n\r\nAn additional boxplot was generated for `Household_Income` after removing high outliers, defined as incomes exceeding \\( Q3 + 3 x IQR = 581,172 \\) SGD. **See the visualization plots** that are displayed below this writeup.\r\n\r\n**Observations and Analysis**:\r\n\r\n- **Skewness and Outliers**: The mean household income for employed individuals (6,409,349 SGD) is substantially higher than the median (243,063 SGD), indicating a highly right-skewed distribution with significant high-income outliers. The maximum income value (1.912919e+10 SGD) for employed individuals appears anomalously high, suggesting potential data recording errors or extreme wealth among a minority of employed individuals.\r\n\r\n- **Employment vs. Income**: Employed individuals have a much higher mean household income compared to unemployed individuals. However, the median incomes are almost identical (243,063 SGD vs. 242,564.5 SGD), implying that the bulk of the income distribution is similar across both groups, but the employed group has a few extremely high-income earners skewing the mean.\r\n\r\n- **Outliers Removal**: After removing high outliers (household incomes above 581,172 SGD), the distribution of household income becomes more symmetric, providing a clearer comparison between employed and unemployed groups.\r\n\r\n**Point-Biserial Correlation**:\r\n\r\n- **Household_Income**: Correlation = 0.0128, **p-value** = 0.2029\r\n  \r\n- The correlation between household income and employment status is negligible and not statistically significant.\r\n\r\n**Data binning and Spearman Correlation**\r\n\r\nWe also performed **binning** of the Household Income variable and calculated the **Spearman's Rank Correlation**. This method allows us to capture potential **non-linear** or **monotonic** relationships between Household Income and the Employment outcome. We also perform **chi-square test of association** on the binned Household Income data versus the dependent variable to see whether there is any association between the two variables.\r\n\r\nHousehold_Income was binned into **Quartiles** to create four categories: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, and **Very High**.\r\n\r\n| **Household_Income_Binned** | **Employed_Count** | **Unemployed_Count** | **Total** |\r\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|\r\n| **Low**                     | 1,234              | 1,244                | 2,478     |\r\n| **Medium**                  | 1,218              | 1,260                | 2,478     |\r\n| **High**                    | 1,244              | 1,234                | 2,478     |\r\n| **Very High**               | 1,224              | 1,254                | 2,478     |\r\n\r\n- The counts of employed and unemployed individuals are nearly identical across all income bins, indicating a lack of significant disparity in employment status distribution based on income levels.\r\n- **Spearman Correlation = -0.000361**, **P-Value = 0.9713**\r\n- There is **no significant correlation** between the binned household income and employment status. The correlation coefficient is effectively zero, indicating no association.\r\n- **Chi-Square Test of Association**: **Chi-Square Statistic: 0.6328**, **P-Value: 0.8889**, Degrees of Freedom: 3\r\n- There is **no significant association** between binned household income and employment status post-graduation. The distribution of employed and unemployed individuals is consistent across all income categories.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nWhile employed individuals have a higher mean household income, the lack of significant correlation indicates that income alone may not be a strong predictor of employment status. The presence of extreme outliers also highlights potential data quality issues that need to be addressed to ensure accurate analysis. Both the **Chi-Square Test of Association** and **Spearman's Rank Correlation** suggest that, within this dataset, household income does not serve as a strong predictor of post-graduation employment and does not play a substantial role in determining employability.\r\n\r\n### 2. Academic Performance\r\n\r\n**Summary Statistics by Employment Status**:\r\n\r\n| Employment Status | Mean Academic Performance | Median | Std Dev | Min | Max |\r\n|-------------------|---------------------------|--------|---------|-----|-----|\r\n| **Employed**      | 2.7231                    | 2.73   | 0.6836  | 0.05| 5.00|\r\n| **Unemployed**    | 2.3815                    | 2.38   | 0.6508  | 0.00| 4.82|\r\n\r\n**Observations and Analysis**:\r\n\r\n- **Academic Performance**: Employed individuals exhibit a higher mean (2.7231) and median (2.73) academic performance score compared to unemployed individuals (mean = 2.3815, median = 2.38). This indicates that better academic performance is associated with a higher likelihood of being employed post-graduation.\r\n\r\n- **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviations are relatively similar across both groups, suggesting comparable variability in academic performance.\r\n\r\n**Point-Biserial Correlation**:\r\n\r\n- **Academic_Performance**: Correlation = 0.2480, **p-value** = 0.0000\r\n  \r\n- There is a moderate and statistically significant positive correlation between academic performance and employment status, indicating that higher academic performance is associated with a greater likelihood of being employed after graduation.\r\n  \r\n**Data binning and Spearman Correlation**\r\n\r\nWe also performed **binning** of the Academic Performance variable and computed the **Spearman's Rank Correlation** in order to capture potential **non-linear** or **monotonic** relationships between Academic Performance and employability. We also perform **chi-square test of association** on the binned Academic Performance data versus the dependent variable to see whether there is any association between the two variables.\r\n\r\nAcademic Performance was binned into **Three Equal-Width Bins**: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**.\r\n\r\n| **Academic_Performance_Binned** | **Employed_Count** | **Unemployed_Count** | **Total** |\r\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|\r\n| **Low**                         | 324                | 679                  | 1,003     |\r\n| **Medium**                      | 3,658              | 3,969                | 7,627     |\r\n| **High**                        | 945                | 350                  | 1,295     |\r\n\r\n- **Employed vs. Unemployed**:\r\n  - **Low Performance**: Higher number of unemployed (679) compared to employed (324).\r\n  - **Medium Performance**: Almost equal distribution between employed (3,658) and unemployed (3,969).\r\n  - **High Performance**: Significantly more employed (945) than unemployed (350).\r\n- **Spearman Correlation = 0.200286**, **P-Value = 2.414717e-90**\r\n- There is a **weak positive** and **highly significant** correlation between binned academic performance and employment status. This suggests that individuals in higher academic performance categories are more likely to be employed post-graduation.\r\n- **Chi-Square Statistic: 411.22096406187535**, **P-Value: 5.064099527236722e-90**, Degrees of Freedom: 2\r\n- There is a **significant association** between binned academic performance and employment status post-graduation. The distribution of employed and unemployed individuals varies notably across different academic performance categories.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nAcademic performance emerges as a significant predictor of employment status, with higher-performing individuals more likely to secure employment. Both correlation measures confirm a **significant positive relationship** between academic performance and employment status. While the strength of the association is **weak to moderate**, it consistently highlights academic performance as a key factor influencing employability. The Chi-Square Test highlights a **strong association** across categorical bins. This underscores the importance of academic excellence in enhancing employability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Analysis of Ordinal Variables\r\n\r\n### 1. School Ranking by Ministry of Education (MOE)\r\n\r\n**Summary Statistics by Employment Status**:\r\n\r\n| **School_Ranking_by_MOE** | **Employed_Count** | **Unemployed_Count** | **Total** |\r\n|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|\r\n| **Low Tier**              | 1,290              | 440                  | 1,730     |\r\n| **Mid Tier**              | 3,313              | 4,125                | 7,438     |\r\n| **Top Tier**              | 324                | 433                  | 757       |\r\n\r\nWe also determine the median school ranking category within the class of employed graduates, and the median school ranking category within the class of unemployed graduates:\r\n\r\n| Employment Status | Count | Median School Rank Category |\r\n|-------------------|-------|-----------------------------|\r\n| **Employed**      | 4,927 | Mid Tier                    |\r\n| **Unemployed**    | 4,998 | Mid Tier                    |\r\n\r\n- **Employed vs. Unemployed**:\r\n  - **Low Tier**: Higher number of employed (1,290) compared to unemployed (440).\r\n  - **Mid Tier**: Higher number of unemployed (4,125) compared to employed (3,313).\r\n  - **Top Tier**: Slightly higher number of unemployed (433) compared to employed (324).\r\n- **Median School Rank Category**: There is no difference in median school rank category between the employed and unemployed groups.\r\n- **Spearman's Rank Correlation**: **Spearman Correlation = -0.203310**, **P-Value = 4.310588e-93**\r\n- There is a **weak to moderate negative correlation** between school ranking and employment status. Higher-ranked schools (e.g., Mid and Top Tier) are associated with a higher likelihood of being **unemployed** post-graduation. The negative correlation indicates that as school ranking improves (moving from Low to Top Tier), the probability of employment **decreases**.\r\n- **Chi-Square Statistic: 521.4890**, **P-Value: 5.7557e-114**, Degrees of Freedom: 2\r\n- There is a **significant association** between school ranking by MOE and employment status post-graduation. The distribution of employed and unemployed individuals varies notably across different school ranking categories.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe data indicates that individuals from higher-ranked schools (Mid and Top Tier) are more likely to be **unemployed** post-graduation compared to those from lower-ranked schools (Low Tier). The **significant Chi-Square Test** and **negative Spearman's correlation** both support the conclusion that school ranking is a meaningful predictor of employment status. However, it is noteworthy that while the association is significant, the effect size (correlation coefficient) is weak to moderate. Additionally, the overall distribution indicates that \"Mid Tier\" remains the most common ranking across both employment statuses. These findings suggest that while school ranking plays a role, it is not the sole determinant of employment outcomes.\r\n\r\nWe offer some explanations why employment appears to decrease as school ranking increases (an unexpected finding). This could be due to students taken vacations or seeking further education in the tight labour market for white collar workers, thus postponing employment. The economy in Singapore may also be well equipped with low-skilled and mid-skilled jobs, enabling graduates from low-tier schools to find employment quickly.\r\n\r\n### 2. Extracurricular Activities Involvement\r\n\r\n**Summary Statistics by Employment Status**:\r\n\r\n| **Extracurricular_Activities_Involvement** | **Employed_Count** | **Unemployed_Count** | **Total** |\r\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|\r\n| **Low**                                    | 1,338              | 1,322                | 2,660     |\r\n| **Medium**                                 | 3,128              | 3,328                | 6,456     |\r\n| **High**                                   | 461                | 348                  | 809       |\r\n\r\nWe also determine the median level of activities involvement within the class of employed graduates, and the median level of activities involvement within the class of unemployed graduates:\r\n\r\n| Employment Status | Count | Median Category |\r\n|-------------------|-------|------------------|\r\n| **Employed**      | 4,927 | Medium           |\r\n| **Unemployed**    | 4,998 | Medium           |\r\n\r\n- **Employed vs. Unemployed**:\r\n  - **Low Involvement**: Slightly higher number of employed (1,338) compared to unemployed (1,322).\r\n  - **Medium Involvement**: Slightly higher number of employed (3,128) compared to unemployed (3,328).\r\n  - **High Involvement**: Higher number of employed (461) compared to unemployed (348).\r\n- **Frequency Distribution**: There is no difference in median level of activities involvement between the employed and unemployed groups.\r\n- **Spearman's Rank Correlation**: **Spearman Correlation = 0.011386**, **P-Value = 2.567189e-01**\r\n- The correlation between extracurricular activities involvement and employment status is negligible and not statistically significant. This suggests that the level of extracurricular engagement does not have a meaningful impact on post-graduation employment in this dataset.\r\n- **Chi-Square Statistic: 21.5689**, **P-Value: 2.0719e-05**, Degrees of Freedom: 2\r\n- There is a **significant association** between extracurricular activities involvement and employment status post-graduation. The distribution of employed and unemployed individuals varies notably across different levels of extracurricular involvement.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe **Chi-Square Test of Association** indicates a significant relationship between extracurricular activities involvement and employment status, suggesting that the level of involvement influences employability. However, the **Spearman's Rank Correlation** does not support a monotonic relationship, as evidenced by the negligible correlation coefficient and non-significant p-value. This could imply that the quality or relevance of extracurricular activities, rather than the level of involvement, plays a more critical role. Alternatively, other factors may overshadow the impact of extracurricular engagement on employment outcomes. Other factors, such as academic performance or socioeconomic status, might confound the relationship between extracurricular involvement and employment, affecting the Spearman's correlation results. Participation in activities that develop specific skills or networks relevant to employment could have a more substantial impact than mere extra-curricular activities participation levels.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Analysis of Nominal Variables\r\n\r\n### 1. Delinquency\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Delinquency | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|-------------|----------|------------|\r\n| No          | 2,757    | 1,636      |\r\n| Yes         | 2,170    | 3,362      |\r\n\r\n**Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Fisher's Exact Test**: Odds Ratio = 2.6109, **p-value** = 0.0000\r\n- The odds of individuals with delinquency records being found **unemployed** are approximately 2.61 times the odds for those without such records. The association is statistically significant, indicating that delinquency is a strong predictor of unemployment post-graduation.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe substantial odds ratio underscores the adverse impact of delinquency on employment prospects. This relationship may be attributed to factors such as employer biases, the legal implications of delinquency records, and potential disruptions in academic or professional trajectories caused by delinquent behavior. Addressing delinquency through support programs and rehabilitation could be pivotal in improving employment outcomes for affected individuals.\r\n\r\n### 2. Nationality\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Nationality | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|-------------|----------|------------|\r\n| Foreigner   | 3,697    | 2,512      |\r\n| Singaporean | 1,230    | 2,486      |\r\n\r\n**Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Fisher's Exact Test**: Odds Ratio = 2.9746, **p-value** = 0.0000\r\n- The odds of Singaporeans being found **unemployed** are approximately 2.97 times the odds for foreigners. This association is statistically significant, suggesting that nationality plays a significant role in post-graduation employment outcomes.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe higher employment rate among foreign nationals could be influenced by various factors such as specific skill sets in demand, higher mobility and willingness to relocate, or possibly employer preferences for diverse backgrounds. Additionally, foreign nationals might be concentrated in industries with higher employment rates, because in the Singapore context, employers are indirectly incentivised, via quotas and stringent government regulations, to employ foreigners only when there is demonstrably insufficient applications from local job seekers. Understanding the underlying reasons for this disparity is essential for formulating inclusive employment policies and support mechanisms for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n### 3. Parent Marital Status\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Parent Marital Status | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|\r\n| Divorced              | 392      | 898        |\r\n| Married               | 4        | 62         |\r\n| Separated             | 2,899    | 2,862      |\r\n| Single                | 72       | 30         |\r\n| Widowed               | 1,560    | 1,146      |\r\n\r\n**Chi-Square Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Chi-Square statistic**: 329.8272, **p-value** = 0.0000, Degrees of Freedom = 4\r\n- There is a significant association between parent marital status and employment status.\r\n- Individuals with **Divorced** parents are more likely to be unemployed.\r\n- A small number of individuals with **Married** parents are unemployed, but the low count (62) may affect the reliability of this subgroup analysis.\r\n- **Separated** parents show a **similar** number of both employed and unemployed individuals, indicating a balanced impact.\r\n- **Single** parents and **Widowed** parents each show a higher proportion of employed individuals.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe data suggests that family background, particularly parental marital status, influences employment outcomes. Individuals from divorced families may face socioeconomic challenges, reduced access to resources, or emotional stress impacting their employability. Conversely, the overwhelming majority of individuals from separated parents exhibit balanced employment rates, indicating that separation may have a less pronounced effect compared to divorce. Addressing family-related support systems could be beneficial in mitigating these employment disparities.\r\n\r\n### 4. Financial Aid Recipient\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Financial Aid Recipient | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|-------------------------|----------|------------|\r\n| No                      | 2,143    | 2,215      |\r\n| Yes                     | 2,784    | 2,783      |\r\n\r\n**Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Fisher's Exact Test**: Odds Ratio = 0.9671, **p-value** = 0.4185\r\n- Receiving financial aid does not significantly influence employment status, as indicated by an odds ratio close to 1 and a non-significant p-value. This suggests that financial aid is not a strong predictor of post-graduation employment in this dataset.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe lack of significant association indicates that financial aid receipt does not directly impact employment outcomes. This could imply that financial aid is allocated irrespective of employability factors or that the support provided does not translate into enhanced job prospects. Further investigation into how financial aid is utilized and its indirect effects on employment, such as reducing financial stress or enabling further education, may provide additional insights.\r\n\r\n### 5. Adverse Records with Law\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Adverse Records with Law | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|--------------------------|----------|------------|\r\n| No                       | 736      | 823        |\r\n| Yes                      | 4,191    | 4,175      |\r\n\r\n**Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Fisher's Exact Test**: Odds Ratio = 0.8909, **p-value** = 0.0385\r\n- The odds for individuals with adverse legal records being found **unemployed** are slightly **less** than the odds for those without such records, as indicated by an odds ratio below 1. This association is statistically significant, suggesting that legal issues modestly impact employability.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThis unexpected association, together with a small effect size, suggests that there could be confounding variables impacting the relationshop between having adverse legal records and being employed. Those with adverse legals records could also be given more technical skills training and vocational training to prepare them to start life anew and embark on a productive career. The support that society gives them may well contributue to their higher likelihood of finding employment within the survey timeframe. Government intervention, especially in the Singapore context, may play a positive role in helping ex-offenders get back on their feet.\r\n\r\n### 6. Extracurricular Activities Type\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Extracurricular Activities Type | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|---------------------------------|----------|------------|\r\n| Dance                           | 1,163    | 1,653      |\r\n| Debate                          | 343      | 835        |\r\n| Miscellaneous                   | 400      | 192        |\r\n| Music                           | 1,827    | 1,469      |\r\n| Science & Tech Clubs            | 78       | 171        |\r\n| Volunteering                    | 1,116    | 678        |\r\n\r\n**Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Chi-Square statistic**: 543.9072, **p-value** = 0.0000, Degrees of Freedom = 5\r\n- There is a significant association between the type of extracurricular activities and employment status. Specific insights include:\r\n    - **Dance** and **Debate** and **Science & Tech Clubs** each show a higher proportions of **unemployed** individuals.\r\n    - **Volunteering** and **Miscellaneous** and **Music** activities each show a higher proportion of **employed** individuals.\r\n  \r\n  This indicates that certain types of extracurricular activities may be more conducive to securing employment, potentially due to the skills or networks they help develop.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe significant association suggests that not all extracurricular activities contribute equally to employability. Participation in **Science & Tech Clubs** and **Debate** activities is more positively correlated to being **unemployed**. This is an unexpected result as these two activities are commonly associated with employable skill sets.\r\n\r\nEncouraging engagement in activities that align with market demands and skill acquisition could enhance employment prospects. However, the above findings are a mixed bag, and further data collection is required for a more accurate analysis. \r\n\r\n### 7. Presence of Disabilities or Chronic Health Issues\r\n\r\n**Frequency Distribution**:\r\n\r\n| Presence of Disabilities or Chronic Health Issues | Employed | Unemployed |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\r\n| No                                                 | 1,939    | 2,123      |\r\n| Yes                                                | 2,988    | 2,875      |\r\n\r\n**Association Test**:\r\n\r\n- **Fisher's Exact Test**: Odds Ratio = 0.8788, **p-value** = 0.0017\r\n- The odds of individuals with disabilities or chronic health issues being found **unemployed** are slightly **lower** than the odds of those without such conditions, as indicated by an odds ratio below 1. This association is statistically significant, suggesting that health-related challenges may impact employability.\r\n\r\n**Analysis and Conclusion**:\r\n\r\nThe association is unexpected, as normally we would expect those with medical conditions or disabilities to have more difficulty finding work. Their higher levels of employability could well indicate that soceity has cared for these groups well and afforded them ample chances to be productively employed. Government intervention, especially in the Singapore context, could be a factor resulting in higher levels of employment for disabled people or those with medical conditions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Limitations of the EDA\r\n\r\n- **Data Quality Concerns**: Extreme outliers in `Household_Income` suggest potential data recording issues that may impact analysis reliability.\r\n\r\n- **Causality**: The EDA establishes associations but does not imply causation. Further inferential statistical modeling is required to draw causal inferences.\r\n\r\n- **Generalizability**: Findings are based on the specific dataset and may not be generalizable to other populations or contexts without further validation.\r\n\r\n- **Explore Interaction Effects**: Investigate how interactions between variables (e.g., `Nationality` and `Academic_Performance`) influence employment outcomes. Currently, interactions effects remain unexplored."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8c78291bcb254011-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"41460875-abe1-4ac9-b48a-4f6bb9504307","children":["bb15145f-4960-46f8-b312-ef0f409f7942"]},"bb15145f-4960-46f8-b312-ef0f409f7942":{"id":"bb15145f-4960-46f8-b312-ef0f409f7942","message":{"id":"bb15145f-4960-46f8-b312-ef0f409f7942","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1727069696.353294,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Taking a closer look**\n\nI\u2019m examining an EDA report to ensure its data accuracy and consistency. Interestingly, the report discusses statistical summaries, visualizations, and association tests.\n\n**Assessing key elements**\n\nI\u2019m gathering info on different data variables, including household income, academic performance, and various ordinal and nominal factors. The report outlines key findings, emphasizing academic performance's significant role in predicting employment status.\n\n**Examining school rankings**\n\nI\u2019m curious about how school rankings relate to employment outcomes. Despite consistent median rankings, higher-ranked schools surprisingly link to poorer employment outcomes.\n\n**Analyzing unemployment ties**\n\nInterestingly, there\u2019s a hint that higher delinquency links to greater unemployment, while household income and extracurricular activities show no direct influence on employability.\n\n**Examining surprising trends**\n\nI'm thinking about the report, which shows that having a criminal record or a disability actually slightly lowers unemployment rates. It implies external support might be at play.\n\n**Examining correlations**\n\nI'm curious about the correlation between science and tech clubs, debate activities, and unemployment. The unexpected positive correlation suggests a need for reanalysis or re-coding.\n\n**Making a decision on outliers**\n\nI chose to retain large outliers for EDA in Singapore. Extreme outliers in Box Plots are omitted to avoid skewed data visualization. Machine learning models were imputed with the median income, compensating for negative income values.\n\n**Analyzing unemployment factors**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together the variables\u2014adverse legal records and delinquency\u2014to ensure clear interpretation and avoid overlap. Considering nationality highlights Singaporeans' higher unemployment odds compared to foreigners.\n\n**Evaluating income variations**\n\nI'm thinking through the wide gap between mean and median incomes, especially when looking at employed and unemployed individuals. The huge standard deviations hint at some extreme outliers.\n\n**Scrutinizing extreme outliers**\n\nOK, let me see. Reviewing extreme outliers in household income, like 19 billion SGD, using the median for imputation. This approach seems logical and effective.\n\n**Richard investigates data trends**\n\nOK, let me see. Richard shares insights on household income distribution, highlighting significant right-skewness and potential data anomalies. Correlation analyses, including Point-Biserial and Spearman, show no substantial links between household income and employment status.\n\nImmediately noticing how Household Income as a post-graduation employment predictor falls short, especially amidst extreme outliers. I\u2019m thinking about the plausibility of extreme values, their potential as data entry errors, and the necessity of data cleaning.\n\n**Evaluating outliers**\n\nI'm noting that the analysis would differ if extreme outliers were removed. Removing them in exploratory data analysis or using median imputation in machine learning models might be necessary.\n\n**Drawing correlations**\n\nI\u2019m working through the Spearman Correlation and Chi-Square tests, revealing a significant link between academic performance and employment status. Now, I\u2019m examining school rankings by MOE to see their impact.\n\n**Examining trends**\n\nSpanning research on Spearman's Rank Correlation, the negative link between school ranking and employment is intriguing. Higher rankings could delay employment due to vacations or further education in Singapore's diverse job market.\n\n**Piecing together employment data**\n\nI noticed that Low Tier schools have a higher percentage of employed individuals, while Mid Tier and Top Tier schools show a lower percentage, highlighting a trend in employment across these education levels.\n\n**Pondering the findings**\n\nI'm noting that higher-ranked schools have lower employment rates, which seems surprising. This might be due to graduates pursuing further studies or data misclassification. More data is needed to confirm.\n\n**Evaluating associations**\n\nI explored the link between extracurricular involvement and employment status. While the Spearman's correlation showed minimal significance, the Chi-Square statistic revealed a significant association, suggesting a non-monotonic relationship.\n\n**Analyzing delinquency and nationality**\n\nI\u2019m noting the frequency distribution of delinquency by employment status, finding more employed among those with no delinquency, and more unemployed with delinquency. For nationality, more employed foreigners compared to unemployed, while more employed Singaporeans than foreigners.\n\n**Questioning the result**\n\nOK, let me see. The result showing higher unemployment among Singaporeans seems surprising given the country's employment policies. I wonder if the sample or definitions might be skewing the data.\n\n**Analyzing marital status**\n\nI'm piecing together the relationship between parents' marital status and employment. The chi-square statistic is notably high, suggesting a significant link. Yet, the 'Married' category seems off, possibly due to a data coding error.\n\n**Assessing data integrity**\n\nHmm, I\u2019m thinking about potential data errors in marital status coding, like swapped or mis-coded categories. The unexpectedly high number of widowed statuses for students seems particularly questionable.\n\n**Assessing financial aid's impact**\n\nI tested the link between financial aid and employment, but the results were not significant. This suggests financial aid might not affect employment outcomes.\n\n**Evaluating legal records**\n\nI examined the connection between legal records and unemployment, finding a slightly lower odds ratio for those with such records. This seems odd given most participants had negative legal records, indicating a potential data issue or error.\n\n**Assessing data reliability**\n\nI'm thinking through the accuracy of the 'Delinquency' variable in the data. It seems unusual that half of the sample has 'Yes' for it.\n\n**Investigating potential biases**\n\nI\u2019m working through the data for ex-offenders and recent graduates, flagging the possibility of mislabeling or incorrect coding. The high 'Yes' rates for adverse records and disabilities in such a sample seem improbable.\n\nIdentifying data uncertainties\n\n**Evaluating data accuracy**\n\nAssuming data accuracy, I identify potential misinterpretations in conclusions about school rankings, laws, and disabilities affecting employment rates.\n\n**Assessing data implications**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the 'Parent Marital Status' data and suspecting misclassification. The misleading conclusions from higher-ranked schools to parents' marital status might need more accurate analysis."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Thought for 64 seconds","initial_text":"Thinking","parent_id":"aaa22472-a65d-4c8a-a52b-36f090f336fb","request_id":"8c78291bcb254011-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa22472-a65d-4c8a-a52b-36f090f336fb","children":["007f9f3e-8a1c-4909-a860-5d1a094c8d51"]},"007f9f3e-8a1c-4909-a860-5d1a094c8d51":{"id":"007f9f3e-8a1c-4909-a860-5d1a094c8d51","message":{"id":"007f9f3e-8a1c-4909-a860-5d1a094c8d51","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727069696.353397,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Upon reviewing your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report, I have identified several areas where statements may be inaccurate or misleading, despite the data and numerical values being correct. Below are the key points that require attention:\n\n1. **Association Between Higher-Ranked Schools and Unemployment**:\n\n   - **Statement in Report**: *\"Higher-ranked schools are associated with poorer employment outcomes, which is an unexpected result.\"*\n   - **Issue**: This conclusion contradicts common expectations and may mislead readers. Typically, graduates from higher-ranked schools have better employment prospects due to reputation, networking opportunities, and employer preferences.\n   - **Recommendation**: Re-express this finding by acknowledging the counterintuitive nature and suggest potential reasons such as graduates from top-tier schools pursuing further education, taking gap years, or being more selective in job searches, which could temporarily reflect as higher unemployment rates.\n\n2. **Adverse Legal Records Increasing Employment Likelihood**:\n\n   - **Statement in Report**: *\"Possessing adverse legal records increases the likelihood of employment, which is an unexpected result.\"*\n   - **Issue**: This is counterintuitive, as adverse legal records are generally associated with reduced employability. The analysis may have misinterpreted the odds ratio or failed to account for confounding variables.\n   - **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate the analysis to ensure correct interpretation of statistical tests. If the finding holds, provide plausible explanations, such as targeted rehabilitation programs improving employability for individuals with legal issues, and emphasize the need for cautious interpretation.\n\n3. **Individuals with Disabilities Having Higher Employment Rates**:\n\n   - **Statement in Report**: *\"Health-related challenges are associated with slightly higher employment rates, which is an unexpected result.\"*\n   - **Issue**: This finding is unexpected, as disabilities often pose barriers to employment. The conclusion may be misleading without sufficient context.\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider whether there are supportive policies or programs in place that enhance employment for individuals with disabilities. Clarify that while the data shows this association, it is unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n4. **Implausible Distribution of Parent Marital Status**:\n\n   - **Observation**: The data shows only 66 individuals with \"Married\" parents out of 9,925, which is highly unlikely in most populations, especially in Singapore.\n   - **Issue**: This suggests potential data coding errors or misclassification, making any conclusions drawn from this variable unreliable.\n   - **Recommendation**: Re-examine the data coding for `Parent_Marital_Status`. If corrections cannot be made, acknowledge the limitation and avoid drawing conclusions based on this variable.\n\n5. **High Prevalence of Adverse Legal Records and Disabilities**:\n\n   - **Observation**: The majority of individuals are marked as having adverse legal records (`Yes`: 8,366 out of 9,925) and disabilities or chronic health issues (`Yes`: 5,863 out of 9,925), which is unusually high.\n   - **Issue**: This raises concerns about data accuracy or misinterpretation of the variables.\n   - **Recommendation**: Verify the definitions and coding of these variables. Ensure that \"Yes\" and \"No\" are correctly assigned and that the variables accurately reflect what they are intended to measure.\n\n6. **Counterintuitive Findings on Nationality and Employment**:\n\n   - **Statement in Report**: *\"Foreign nationals exhibit higher employment rates compared to Singaporean nationals.\"*\n   - **Issue**: Given Singapore's employment policies favoring locals, this result is unexpected and may mislead readers.\n   - **Recommendation**: Discuss potential reasons such as sample bias or specific industries where foreigners might have higher employment. Suggest that this finding should be interpreted with caution and may require further data validation.\n\n7. **Handling of Extreme Outliers in Household Income**:\n\n   - **Observation**: The dataset includes extremely high household incomes (e.g., 19 billion SGD), which significantly skew the mean.\n   - **Issue**: Retaining these outliers without proper treatment can distort analysis and conclusions.\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider capping extreme values or using robust statistical measures like the median. Clearly explain how outliers are handled and their impact on the analysis.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Results Between Statistical Tests**:\n\n   - **Observation**: For variables like `Extracurricular_Activities_Involvement`, the Chi-Square test indicates a significant association, while Spearman's correlation does not.\n   - **Issue**: This inconsistency may confuse readers regarding the true nature of the relationship.\n   - **Recommendation**: Provide a detailed explanation for the discrepancy, such as the Chi-Square test detecting any association while Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships. Clarify that while there is an association, it may not be linear or monotonic.\n\n9. **Potential Misinterpretation of Statistical Significance and Practical Importance**:\n\n   - **Issue**: Some findings are statistically significant but have weak correlations or small effect sizes, which may not be practically meaningful.\n   - **Recommendation**: Emphasize the difference between statistical significance and practical significance. Highlight effect sizes and discuss whether the associations have meaningful implications in real-world contexts.\n\n10. **Lack of Consideration for Confounding Variables**:\n\n    - **Issue**: Conclusions are drawn without accounting for potential confounders that may influence the relationships observed.\n    - **Recommendation**: Acknowledge the limitations of not controlling for confounding variables in the EDA. Suggest that further multivariate analyses are needed to isolate the effects of individual predictors on employment status.\n\n11. **Assumptions About Causality**:\n\n    - **Issue**: Some statements imply causation from correlations (e.g., family background influencing employment outcomes).\n    - **Recommendation**: Rephrase conclusions to avoid causal language unless causality has been established through appropriate methods. Use terms like \"is associated with\" rather than \"influences\" or \"impacts.\"\n\n12. **Overlooking Data Quality Issues Beyond Outliers**:\n\n    - **Issue**: The report mentions outliers but does not adequately address potential data entry errors or misclassifications in categorical variables.\n    - **Recommendation**: Expand the data cleaning section to include verification of categorical data accuracy. Discuss any steps taken to ensure correct classification and coding of categorical variables.\n\n**Overall Recommendations**:\n\n- **Review Data Coding and Classification**: Re-examine the dataset for potential coding errors, especially in variables with implausible distributions (e.g., `Parent_Marital_Status`, `Adverse_Records_with_Law`, `Presence_of_Disabilities_or_Chronic_Health_Issues`).\n\n- **Interpret Findings with Caution**: Acknowledge when results are counterintuitive and discuss possible reasons or the need for further investigation.\n\n- **Enhance Transparency**: Clearly document all data cleaning steps, including decisions about handling outliers and missing data, to enhance the credibility of the analysis.\n\n- **Clarify Statistical Interpretations**: Ensure that statistical results are accurately interpreted and that limitations are clearly stated.\n\nBy addressing these points, your EDA report will present a more accurate and reliable analysis, providing valuable insights while maintaining integrity and transparency."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[199999]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-preview","default_model_slug":"o1-preview","parent_id":"bb15145f-4960-46f8-b312-ef0f409f7942","request_id":"8c78291bcb254011-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bb15145f-4960-46f8-b312-ef0f409f7942","children":[]}}}
