Researchers, including those from SETI, have noted the signal could be from extraterrestrial life but caution against overhyping this possibility. The signal, detected in 2015 but only recently reported, may be due to terrestrial interference or background noise.

Modern digital TV is lower on average power and *much* less narrowband (the big analog video carrier is gone; ATSC has only a small pilot near the lower channel edge). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn12search1\ue202turn12search6\ue201  \n- Big **FM** stations are typically **100 kW ERP** in Class C in the US. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search4\ue201  \nCrucially, broadcast antennas **suppress radiation upward**; they concentrate power toward the horizon.

That pushes ranges down by the square-root of that factor. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue201\n\n### Plug-in numbers (1 Hz spectral bin, i.e., narrowband carrier)\nBelow are **CMB-limited** distances (no coherent integration) for representative EIRPs and receivers:\n\n| Transmitter (EIRP toward space) | Receiver \\(A_e\\) | Distance where \\(P_\\text{sig}\\approx kT_\\text{CMB}B\\) |\n|---|---:|---:|\n| **100 kW** (optimistic leak from a strong FM/TV site) | **1 m\u00b2** (small dish) | **0.0015 ly** (~97 AU) |\n|  | **10 m dish** (~50 m\u00b2) | **0.011 ly** (~690 AU) |\n|  | **Arecibo-class** (~3\u00d710\u2074 m\u00b2) | **0.27 ly** |\n| **1 MW** | **Arecibo-class** | **0.84 ly** |\n| **3 MW** | **Arecibo-class** | **1.46 ly** |\n\n(Computed directly from the boxed formula with \\(T_\\mathrm{CMB}=2.725\\) K; Arecibo\u2019s \\(A_e\\approx3\\times10^4\\) m\u00b2 is consistent with measured gain \\(G\\simeq10.4\\ \\mathrm{K\\,Jy^{-1}}\\) and \\(T_\\mathrm{sys}\\sim30\\) K at L-band. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search13\ue201)\n\n**Reality bites:** broadcast arrays are down-tilted; if you assume even **\u201320 dB** upward (a common order-of-magnitude), all the ranges above **shrink by 10\u00d7**. Then a 1 MW TV stick looks CMB-level to an Arecibo at **~0.08 ly**\u2014still **well inside** the nearest star\u2019s distance (Proxima: 4.24 ly).\n\n### Two more effects that make leakage even harder to see\n1) **Digital TV/Radio \u226b noise-like:** Analog TV had a strong continuous video carrier (a near-CW \u201cspike\u201d that SETI could dig out with sub-Hz bins). Modern ATSC/DVB use wideband modulations with only a **small pilot** (ATSC pilot \u22480.3 dB/\u22487 % of power at a fixed offset), so narrowband detectability dropped markedly. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search1\ue202turn12search6\ue201  \n2) **Sky noise dominates below ~300 MHz:** At FM/VHF, the **Galactic synchrotron** background is hundreds of kelvin with spectral index \u2248\u20132.6, swamping the 2.7 K CMB. E.g., at 100 MHz, typical sky \\(T\\) is \\(\\mathcal{O}(10^2\u201310^3)\\) K, shrinking ranges by another \\(\\sqrt{T_\\text{CMB}/T_\\text{sky}}\\sim 10\u201320\\times\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn11academia12\ue202turn11search4\ue201\n\n### Why radars are the exception (and why people get confused)\nNarrow-beam **early-warning/planetary radars** have *enormous* EIRP. Arecibo\u2019s planetary radar achieved **\\(\\sim 2\\times10^{13}\\) W EIRP**; some ground EW radars have **GW-class** *peak* EIRP. Those can be CMB-level at **tens to thousands of light-years** in a 1 Hz bin (directionally, while on). That\u2019s *not* typical broadcast leakage\u2014and it\u2019s intermittent and pointed. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search3\ue202turn7search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n- For **ordinary radio/TV broadcasts**, the **CMB-limited range is \\(\\ll 1\\) ly** for realistic upward leakage and even **\\<0.3 ly** under very generous assumptions with an Arecibo-scale receiver.  \n- At **FM/VHF** the Galactic background, not the CMB, sets the floor and shrinks ranges further.  \n- So an alien at **4\u2013100 ly** wouldn\u2019t see our broadcast leakage unless they have **multi-km-class arrays**, **long coherent integrations**, and target **narrowband features**\u2014and the transition to digital has removed the best narrowband beacons.\n\nYour hypothesis is essentially right: **our civilization\u2019s \u201cradio bubble\u201d is not bright**. Absent intentional beacons or very high-EIRP radars aimed their way, even technologically capable neighbors will find us **radio-quiet** at interstellar distances. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search13\ue201\n\n*Key sources:* radiometer noise \\(kTB\\) and CMB temperature; broadcast ERP/EIRP norms & antenna vertical patterns; Arecibo sensitivity; low-frequency sky temperature scaling; digital TV pilot. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn2search13\ue202turn11academia12\ue202turn11search4\ue202turn12search1\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":925,"end_idx":958,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_temperature?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CMB.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_temperature?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Noise temperature","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_temperature?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1014652275.0,"snippet":"In electronics, noise temperature is one way of expressing the level of available noise power introduced by a component or source.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Cosmic Microwave Background","url":"https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CMB.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"24 Oct 2009 \u2014 The CMB is very close to a blackbody with temperature 2.725 K.

The project, imagined to be based in the Atacama Desert to minimize atmospheric distortion, faces numerous challenges such as protecting the satellite from debris and atmospheric interference.

Along with Jacob Haqq Misra, he explored whether modern telescopes could detect NO\u2082 on Earth-like exoplanets, indicative of advanced technological societies. They published findings suggesting future telescopes like LUVOIR and HabEx might confirm such signals of civilization from 30 light-years away after extensive observation. Challenges include accurately simulating exoplanet atmospheric dynamics and addressing similarities between natural and artificial NO\u2082 sources. This research aligns with a broader scientific effort to identify technological markers beyond traditional radio signals, supported by renewed attention and funding for space exploration and the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life.","ref_id":{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1614862800.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_690d9f80113c8329b275b6dbf20324a1","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for NO2 and technosignature detection papers","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"990b11e3-987d-46dd-b789-3b03c33087a2","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"876c7026-6344-4207-9714-2a94ecb793a7","turn_exchange_id":"c6a27c80-97a1-4555-bed8-26d8222d6d76","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"876c7026-6344-4207-9714-2a94ecb793a7","children":["c0b903ff-0a1c-4586-bc18-75f1bad34ba4"]},"c0b903ff-0a1c-4586-bc18-75f1bad34ba4":{"id":"c0b903ff-0a1c-4586-bc18-75f1bad34ba4","message":{"id":"c0b903ff-0a1c-4586-bc18-75f1bad34ba4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762500595.325013,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring distributed beamforming for detection","content":"Next, I\u2019m considering the idea of using distributed beamforming arrays across the Solar System, both for detecting transmissions and potentially sending signals.

LIFE-class concepts can characterize dozens of nearby temperate terrestrials; mid-IR is optimal for CO\u2082, O\u2083\u2014and *anthropogenic* species (below). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search11\ue201\n\n7) **Atmospheric *technosignature* spectroscopy.**  \n   - Targets: CFCs (CF\u2084, CCl\u2083F), **NO\u2082**, SF\u2086, NF\u2083\u2014molecules hard to sustain abiotically at high abundance.  \n   - Feasibility: Studies show CFCs and NO\u2082 would be detectable at boosted levels with LUVOIR/HWO-class or LIFE-class facilities, offering direct evidence of industry. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn14search2\ue201\n\n8) **Dysonian searches for waste heat (mid/far-IR all-sky).**  \n   - Hardware: A next-gen cryogenic IR all-sky surveyor (beyond WISE), tuned for **Kardashev Type II** waste-heat excess around stars/galaxies, coupled with optical/GAIA vetting.  \n   - Why: If large-scale energy harvesting is common, it glows in the mid-IR; WISE-based **\u011c** surveys already set upper limits\u2014deeper surveys expand the search volume by orders of magnitude. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue202turn7search15\ue201\n\n9) **Surface-tech signatures: night-side city lights & photovoltaic \u201cedges.\u201d**  \n   - Hardware: HWO (with starshade) and ELTs to look for phase-curve anomalies (night-side illumination) and unusual **spectral edges** from large-area solar arrays.  \n   - Why: Both are plausible large-area installations for a Type-I civilization and are geometrically favored on tidally locked worlds. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search8\ue201\n\n10) **Beamed-power sentinels (microwave/laser).**  \n   - Hardware: Wide-field, fast spectro-imagers watching for short, ultra-bright sweeps characteristic of **laser/microwave sail** beams (think Starshot).  \n   - Why: Directed-energy systems radiate transient, high-EIRP sidelobes\u2014detectable across great distances when you catch the beam. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search2\ue201\n\n11) **Neutrino \u201cjust in case\u201d (low ROI unless they *want* to be seen).**  \n   - Hardware: IceCube-class arrays (scaling to IceCube-Gen2) for ultra-high-energy neutrino beacons.  \n   - Why: Backgrounds are tiny and propagation is unimpeded\u2014but required transmitter powers are enormous, so this is only sensible for *intentional* neutrino beacons. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue202turn12search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n### What to actually prioritize (pragmatic roadmap)\n- **Now\u20132030:** Run **commensal technosignature pipelines** on SKA/MeerKAT/DSA-2000; expand drift-rate searches (\u00b1few Hz/s), pursue deep, narrow-band integrations, and use multi-beam ON\u2013OFF discrimination\u2014exactly what Breakthrough Listen pipelines do today. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search7\ue201  \n- **2030s:** Fly **HWO**; stand up **PANOSETI-class** all-sky laser watchers; push **space-VLBI** for localization. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- **Late 2030s\u20132040s:** Launch a **LIFE-class** mid-IR interferometer and a **deeper mid/far-IR all-sky survey** to hunt waste heat at scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n- **Whenever lunar logistics allow:** build a **farside low-frequency array**, the ultimate RFI-free technosignature monitor. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** The shortest path to galaxy-scale reach is **radio first** (SKA/DSA-2000-class arrays with modern drift-search software), followed by **direct imaging** (HWO/LIFE) for atmospheric technosignatures. A lunar-farside array and deeper IR sky surveys close critical blind spots.
