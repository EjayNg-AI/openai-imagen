An **evaluation harness**: win-rate or **Elo rating** (a head-to-head skill rating) vs random, vs a simple heuristic bot, and AZ vs MZ.\n\n### The minimal algorithmic core (what you should implement)\n#### 1) Shared: MCTS with PUCT\nUse **PUCT (Predictor + Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees)** selection:\n- Store per edge: visit count \\(N\\), mean value \\(Q\\), prior \\(P\\).\n- Selection balances exploitation \\(Q\\) and exploration via \\(P\\sqrt{N}/(1+N)\\).\n- Root: add Dirichlet noise (optional) to encourage exploration in self-play.\n\n#### 2) AlphaZero network\nSingle network \\(f_\\theta(s)\\to(\\pi, v)\\)\n- Input: board planes (current player stones, opponent stones, side-to-move).\n- Output:\n  - \\(\\pi\\): policy logits over all moves (including \u201cpass\u201d if needed)\n  - \\(v\\): scalar value prediction (expected outcome from current player\u2019s perspective)\n\nTraining targets come from self-play:\n- \\(\\pi\\) target = normalized MCTS visit counts\n- \\(v\\) target = final game outcome (+1/0/\u22121)\n\n#### 3) MuZero networks\nSplit into 3 parts:\n- **Representation** \\(h_\\theta(o)\\to z_0\\) (latent state from observation)\n- **Dynamics** \\(g_\\theta(z_t, a_t)\\to (z_{t+1}, r_{t+1})\\)\n- **Prediction** \\(f_\\theta(z_t)\\to (\\pi_t, v_t)\\)\n\nMCTS runs entirely in latent space:\n- Expand using \\(g_\\theta\\), evaluate using \\(f_\\theta\\)\n\nTraining uses short unrolls (e.g. \\(K=5\\)):\n- Policy loss at each unroll step (match MCTS improved policy)\n- Value loss (match n-step return bootstrapped with predicted value)\n- Reward loss (match observed reward)\n\n### Experiments that make the \u201cillustration\u201d obvious\n- **Same search budget** (e.g., 50 or 100 sims/move): compare learning curves (win-rate vs a fixed opponent).\n- **Ablation**: run both with **0 MCTS** (policy-only) vs with MCTS \u2192 shows how search + learning interact.\n- **Model accuracy probe (MuZero-only)**: check whether predicted rewards/terminal outcomes match reality when unrolling from real positions.\n\n### Practical knobs to keep it consumer-grade\n- Small board (6\u00d76) + small net (e.g., 4\u20136 residual blocks, 32\u201364 channels).\n- Batched inference: during MCTS across multiple games, batch all leaf evaluations into one GPU/CPU call.\n- Moderate sims/move (start at 25; scale to 100 once it runs cleanly).\n\n### Use existing codebases as references (or as a \u201csanity check\u201d baseline)\n- **OpenSpiel** documents and provides AlphaZero implementations (useful reference, even if you don\u2019t adopt their full training stack). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- **muzero-general** is a heavily commented MuZero implementation intended for educational adaptation (\u201cadd a game file\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue201  \n- If you want a ready-made framework that already supports both families:\n  -
