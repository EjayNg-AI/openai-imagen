During the COVID-19 pandemic, rampant health falsehoods led many people to **decline lifesaving vaccines, reject public health measures, or embrace unproven \u201ctreatments,\u201d** with harmful consequences for individuals and communities\u301029\u2020L125-L133\u3011. Such misinformation spreads rapidly via social media and messaging apps, creating what the World Health Organization calls an *\u201cinfodemic\u201d* \u2013 an overabundance of false or misleading information that can erode trust in vaccines and health authorities\u301036\u2020L313-L321\u3011\u301036\u2020L323-L330\u3011. Singapore is not immune to this global challenge. **In recent incidents, online videos and posts have promoted unfounded claims about vaccines \u2013 for example, a video circulated locally in 2021 falsely claimed COVID-19 vaccines were \u201cexperimental and unsafe\u201d for children and insinuated the Government would not help in case of adverse effects\u30103\u2020L589-L597\u3011.** These falsehoods, if left unchecked, could undermine Singapore\u2019s hard-won public health achievements.\n\nYouths are especially exposed to digital misinformation. Growing up with smartphones and social media as primary information sources, young people may encounter anti-vaccine narratives on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, or Telegram. **A WHO review found that up to *51%* of social media posts about vaccines contain misinformation\u301036\u2020L333-L341\u3011, and such online falsehoods *\u201camplify vaccine hesitancy and promote unproven treatments\u201d*\u301036\u2020L323-L330\u3011.** The **speed and reach** of modern media allow conspiracy theories and rumors to gain foothold quickly, before accurate information can catch up\u301029\u2020L133-L141\u3011. Moreover, psychological factors like cognitive biases play a role \u2013 repetition of a claim (even to debunk it) can make it feel familiar and believable\u30104\u2020L125-L134\u3011. In the youth demographic, the influence of popular content creators (including those peddling pseudoscience) can be significant, potentially *\u201cpersuasive\u201d* if teens are not equipped to discern credibility\u30104\u2020L99-L107\u3011\u30104\u2020L110-L118\u3011. This infodemic threatens to \u201cinfect\u201d Singapore\u2019s society with dangerous myths about vaccines unless robust measures are taken.\n\n## Consequences of Vaccine Misinformation for Society\n\nAllowing vaccine misinformation to take root in Singapore would have **severe consequences**, particularly for vulnerable groups like infants, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people. The most direct risk is a decline in vaccination coverage \u2013 which can lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases. A stark **real-world example** comes from Samoa in 2019: after anti-vaccine propaganda spread fear about the measles vaccine, the nation\u2019s childhood measles immunization rate plummeted from over 80% to just 31%, setting the stage for a deadly measles outbreak\u301038\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u301038\u2020L202-L210\u3011. **This outbreak infected over 5,700 people and claimed 83 lives \u2013 mostly babies and young children \u2013 who were unprotected due to misinformation-fueled vaccine refusals\u301038\u2020L170-L178\u3011\u301038\u2020L209-L217\u3011.** \u301037\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Figure: The 2019 measles outbreak in Samoa was fueled by a drastic drop in vaccination rates, illustrating the deadly consequences of vaccine misinformation\u301038\u2020L170-L178\u3011\u301038\u2020L197-L205\u3011.* Singapore, with its dense population, could face similar outbreaks of measles, pertussis or other diseases if even a small anti-vaccine movement grows. Infants too young to be vaccinated and immunocompromised persons (who cannot safely receive certain vaccines or may respond poorly) rely on community herd immunity for protection \u2013 they would be put at grave risk by any erosion of that herd immunity\u301038\u2020L213-L221\u3011.\n\nBeyond infectious disease outbreaks, pervasive vaccine falsehoods can undermine trust in **health authorities and medical advice**, leading to poorer health outcomes. During COVID-19, for instance, misinformation led some to refuse vaccines or proven treatments, resulting in avoidable hospitalizations and deaths\u301029\u2020L125-L133\u3011. It also fostered hostility and division \u2013 front-line health workers, public officials, and even airline staff enforcing mask or vaccination rules faced harassment and violence driven by conspiracy beliefs\u301029\u2020L125-L133\u3011. In a misinformation-plagued environment, **fear and confusion grow** while social cohesion frays. Vulnerable seniors might become afraid to get needed vaccines (like influenza or pneumococcal shots), or parents might delay childhood immunizations, leading to setbacks in our nation\u2019s disease prevention efforts. Wrong and misleading information *\u201csows suspicion and confusion, and prevents people from protecting themselves and their loved ones\u201d*, as Minister of State Ms. Low Yen Ling warned\u30105\u2020L123-L131\u3011. In short, vaccine misinformation can cost lives, damage public trust, and hinder the collective action needed in health crises.\n\nSingapore has thus far maintained high vaccine uptake and public confidence \u2013 for example, over 95% of children here (as in similarly high-performing countries like Portugal) receive recommended vaccines\u301020\u2020L135-L143\u3011. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign was met with broad cooperation, achieving over 90% first-dose coverage in adults\u301020\u2020L151-L159\u3011. **These successes are built on trust, effective communication, and a strong \u201cvaccination culture.\u201d** However, they cannot be taken for granted. If anti-vaccine narratives infiltrate our social media feeds, schools, or community conversations, that **public trust could be eroded**. Even small pockets of hesitancy can have outsized effects \u2013 a localized cluster of unvaccinated individuals can spark an outbreak that spreads widely. Therefore, **preemptive action is critical** to inoculate our population against misinformation, just as vaccines inoculate individuals against disease.\n\n## Current Landscape in Singapore: Efforts and Gaps\n\nThe Singapore Government has recognized the threat of misinformation and taken initial steps to address it. Under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), authorities have issued corrections and takedowns for pandemic-related falsehoods. The Ministry of Health (MOH) actively debunks circulating myths \u2013 for example, when false claims about COVID-19 vaccination for children emerged, MOH promptly refuted them with evidence. **Officials emphasized that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 5\u201311 year-olds was *not* experimental but had been rigorously tested on thousands of children with no serious adverse events, and that millions of children worldwide had been safely vaccinated** (with myocarditis cases on the order of only 1 in a million)\u30103\u2020L604-L612\u3011\u30103\u2020L612-L620\u3011. Such clear, fact-based public statements help reassure anxious parents and set the record straight. MOH also reminded the public not to spread unverified information and to rely on credible sources\u30103\u2020L699-L707\u3011.\n\nIn Singapore\u2019s education system, **information literacy is already taught across various subjects** as a foundation. From primary through pre-university, students learn to discern the credibility of online information, understand how falsehoods spread, and practice critical reading and thinking skills\u301030\u2020L113-L122\u3011\u301030\u2020L123-L131\u3011. For instance, primary pupils are taught to verify online sources as part of Cyber Wellness in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, while secondary students discuss real-life fake news scenarios and learn how cognitive biases and social media virality can propagate misinformation\u301030\u2020L113-L122\u3011\u301030\u2020L123-L131\u3011. Subjects like English, History and Social Studies incorporate exercises in separating fact from opinion, checking multiple sources, and spotting signs of false or incomplete information\u301030\u2020L123-L131\u3011. These efforts indicate a strong starting point \u2013 our youths are being equipped with baseline media literacy skills.\n\nCommunity and youth engagement initiatives have also begun. In 2021, the Rotary Club of Singapore and NUS\u2019s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health launched a **Public Health Ambassador Programme** to train volunteers as vaccine ambassadors\u301033\u2020L68-L77\u3011\u301033\u2020L78-L87\u3011. Through this program, **young people (Interactors and Rotaractors) were empowered to share accurate, science-based information about COVID-19 vaccines with the public and help address concerns**\u301033\u2020L74-L82\u3011\u301033\u2020L92-L100\u3011. As Ms. Low Yen Ling noted at the launch, such ambassadors \u201cspur our battle against misinformation\u2026 by spreading accurate and timely information about vaccinations\u201d and giving those with doubts personal reassurance\u301033\u2020L74-L82\u3011. Youth volunteers, with their passion and tech-savvy, became natural influencers to convince seniors and peers by explaining vaccine safety and efficacy in relatable terms\u301033\u2020L92-L100\u3011. This community-driven approach complements official messaging by adding trust at the grassroots level.\n\nThese measures \u2013 **strong government communication, curriculum-based literacy education, and community volunteer programs** \u2013 have helped Singapore manage misinformation so far. **However, the evolving nature of the threat** means we must continuously strengthen our defenses. The existing curriculum could be updated to put even more emphasis on scientific literacy and common vaccine misconceptions. Volunteer efforts need scaling and broader reach. And critically, **long-term strategies** must be put in place to ensure Singapore\u2019s public remains scientifically informed and resilient against falsehoods, not just during COVID-19 but for future health emergencies and everyday information consumption. In the sections below, we present a comprehensive set of policy recommendations \u2013 spanning the mid-term and long-term \u2013 to build a **\u201cwhole-of-nation\u201d resilience** to vaccine misinformation. These recommendations draw on global best practices and successes, aligning with Singapore\u2019s context as a highly educated, digitally connected society.\n\n## Policy Recommendations (Mid-Term and Long-Term)\n\nTo address this multifaceted challenge, the approach must be **holistic**, involving education, public communications, community engagement, and support from legislation and technology. We propose the following recommendations:\n\n### 1. Inoculate Against Misinformation through Education and Literacy \n\n**Mid-Term (Next 1\u20133 years):** Immediately bolster educational efforts that equip students and the general public with the tools to recognize and reject misinformation about vaccines.\n\n- **Integrate Vaccine Science into Curriculum:** Develop new modules or lesson plans that teach the *science behind vaccines (especially mRNA vaccines)* in an accessible way. For example, science classes can include a unit demystifying how mRNA vaccines work \u2013 explaining that mRNA vaccines deliver genetic instructions to our cells to produce a harmless viral protein that trains the immune system, **never interacting with or altering human DNA**\u301026\u2020L408-L416\u3011. By learning *why* the vaccines are safe and how rigorously they are tested, students will be less susceptible to bogus claims. This can be reinforced through Biology and General Paper projects where students investigate and present on vaccine development timelines, safety monitoring, and debunk common myths (e.g. \u201cvaccines contain microchips\u201d or \u201cvaccines cause infertility\u201d)\u301026\u2020L402-L410\u3011.\n\n- **Use Misconception-Based Learning:** Adopt pedagogical methods that confront misconceptions directly. Research suggests that having students actively debunk false ideas can strengthen their understanding and retention of correct science\u30104\u2020L179-L187\u3011. For instance, an assignment might require teams to take a popular anti-vaccine claim and *research thoroughly why it is scientifically baseless*, then present their findings. Such exercises not only impart vaccine knowledge but also hone critical thinking. Singapore\u2019s curriculum planners could incorporate these as part of science or health education. *Inoculation theory* in education posits that exposing learners to a \u201cweakened dose\u201d of misinformation and refuting it builds immunity to real fake news\u30104\u2020L181-L189\u3011. This approach should be systematically applied to vaccine topics.\n\n- **Leverage Educational Games and Media:** Engage youth through interactive tools. There are already **free online games like \u201cBad News,\u201d \u201cHarmony Square,\u201d and \u201cCranky Uncle\u201d that simulate how disinformation is produced and spread**\u30104\u2020L173-L181\u3011. Empirical studies show these games are effective in improving students\u2019 ability to spot fake news tactics\u30104\u2020L173-L181\u3011. The Ministry of Education (MOE) can introduce such games in classrooms or as recommended activities. Additionally, short cartoon explainer videos and infographics about vaccines (for example, illustrating how herd immunity works or how our immune system fights viruses) should be produced and disseminated via social media channels popular with youth. By making learning about vaccines *fun and relatable*, we can captivate young audiences before anti-vax propaganda does.\n\n- **Teacher Training and Resources:** Provide teachers with up-to-date training and resources to confidently address vaccine questions and misinformation in class. Educators should be briefed on common myths circulating locally (\u201cmRNA vaccines are not tested,\u201d \u201cnatural immunity is better,\u201d etc.) and effective ways to counter them with evidence. Just as MOE provides cyber wellness resources on emerging online issues\u301030\u2020L133-L141\u3011, it can work with healthcare experts to create a \u201cVaccine Fact Kit\u201d for schools \u2013 including Q&A sets, myth-busters, and guidelines on facilitating discussions about controversial claims. This will ensure consistency and accuracy in the messages students receive.\n\n**Long-Term (3\u201310 years):** Fundamentally enhance Singapore\u2019s education system and public education initiatives to cultivate *enduring scientific literacy and critical thinking* as a societal norm.\n\n- **Embed Scientific Literacy as a Core Competency:** We recommend a formal review of curriculum standards to place greater emphasis on understanding the scientific method, evidence-based reasoning, and evaluation of scientific claims. A global expert group convened by Stanford University recently concluded that science education must go beyond facts, to *\u201censure that students are equipped with skills that guard them against pseudoscientific online claims.\u201d*\u301015\u2020L215-L223\u3011\u301015\u2020L225-L234\u3011 In practice, this means teaching students *how scientific knowledge is established \u2013 the processes of hypothesis, experimentation, peer review \u2013 and why this makes science trustworthy*, as well as how to spot flawed logic or unsupported assertions\u301015\u2020L225-L234\u3011. **Exams and assessments** should be updated to test these skills (e.g. asking students to analyze a given argument about vaccines and identify if it\u2019s backed by evidence or fallacious). By making scientific literacy as fundamental as numeracy or literacy, future generations of Singaporeans will be better \u201cvaccinated\u201d against all sorts of misinformation, not only about vaccines.\n\n- **Expand Media Literacy Programs to All Ages:** Building on current Cyber Wellness education, media and information literacy training should be a *lifelong* effort. Finland offers a powerful model: starting as early as kindergarten, Finnish schools teach children to be their own fact-checkers, asking *\u201cWho is behind this information? What is the evidence? What do other sources say?\u201d* as routine questions\u301015\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u301015\u2020L163-L170\u3011. This approach contributed to Finland ranking *first in Europe for resilience to fake news* in recent years\u301012\u2020L103-L112\u3011. Singapore should adapt and adopt similar strategies. In schools, this means spiraling these critical questions through all levels and subjects \u2013 from simple exercises distinguishing fact vs. fiction in primary folklore tales, up to analyzing media propaganda in secondary history lessons (interestingly, Finnish students even study historical propaganda and learn how statistics can mislead in math class)\u301012\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301012\u2020L142-L150\u3011. At the tertiary and adult education level, courses or public workshops on media literacy, digital skepticism, and science communication could be offered (for example, polytechnics and universities might introduce general education modules on navigating misinformation). The National Library Board\u2019s existing **S.U.R.E. program** (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) for information literacy can be amplified and tailored with more content on health/science misinformation, ensuring that even older adults and seniors learn how to verify health news they see on WhatsApp or Facebook.\n\n- **Teacher Professional Development and Hiring:** Ensure our educators are well-prepared to teach inquiry and skepticism. Finland requires all teachers to have a Master\u2019s degree and training in research methods, fostering a *\u201cculture of research\u201d* in the classroom\u301015\u2020L152-L160\u3011. While Singapore\u2019s teachers are highly trained, we could encourage more in-service training on facilitating student inquiry and debate on scientific controversies. Over time, position scientific and media literacy as core competencies in teacher training colleges. When teachers are empowered, they in turn empower students to question and investigate claims rather than passively accept information.\n\n- **Public Science Outreach Infrastructure:** We propose establishing a dedicated **Science Communications and Information Integrity unit** (perhaps under MOH or MCI) that works continuously to educate the public about vaccines and other scientific issues. This unit would collaborate with schools, community centers, and media outlets to run campaigns during peacetime (not just during outbreaks). For example, it could run an annual **\u201cVaccine Awareness Week\u201d** with exhibitions (at Science Centre or public libraries) illustrating how vaccines are developed, talks by local scientists or doctors in community clubs, and articles placed in mainstream media highlighting vaccine success stories. Over the long term, this normalizes knowledge about vaccines. Singapore could also create online portals or apps that engage citizens in learning \u2013 e.g. a \u201cVaxFacts SG\u201d website where people can easily find verified answers to vaccine questions, read myth-busting explainers in English and vernacular languages, and even pose questions to experts. These initiatives should be ongoing, so that in the next pandemic or outbreak, our citizens already have a solid grounding in scientific facts and are less easily swayed by fearmongering.\n\n### 2. Strengthen Public Communication and Rapid Response to Misinformation\n\n**Mid-Term:**\n\n- **Proactive Public Education Campaigns:** Launch nationwide campaigns to **publicly explain and promote the benefits and safety of vaccines**. This could involve multi-platform messaging: TV documentaries or short clips showing Singapore\u2019s own scientists and doctors explaining how vaccines work, radio segments debunking common myths (perhaps in a call-in Q&A format to address public queries), and social media infographics with punchy \u201cDid You Know?\u201d facts (e.g. \u201cDid you know *mRNA vaccines cannot change your DNA* \u2013 they never enter the cell nucleus\u301026\u2020L414-L420\u3011!\u201d). The tone should be **informative and reassuring**, not scolding. Campaigns can highlight real local stories \u2013 for instance, a profile of an immunocompromised child who relies on herd immunity, or interviews with elderly Singaporeans who lived through past epidemics and can attest to the importance of vaccines. By humanizing the issue, we can build emotional resonance and counter the narratives of fear with narratives of collective responsibility and success.\n\n- **Real-Time Myth-Busting Taskforce:** The government should set up a **rapid-response unit** to monitor emerging misinformation trends (especially on social media and messaging forums popular in Singapore) and respond within *hours*, not days. Taiwan\u2019s experience is instructive here. Taiwan\u2019s Digital Minister Audrey Tang implemented a rapid 2-2-2 response strategy: issue a **response within 20 minutes, in 200 words or less, accompanied by 2 engaging images or memes**\u301028\u2020L191-L199\u3011. The response is crafted to be factual **but also witty or humorous (\u201chumour over rumour\u201d) to grab public attention**\u301028\u2020L191-L199\u3011\u301028\u2020L195-L203\u3011. Singapore could establish a similar inter-agency team combining communications officers, healthcare experts, and even local comedians or creatives to devise quick, shareable rebuttals to viral falsehoods. For example, if a false WhatsApp message claims \u201cthe COVID vaccine contains microchips,\u201d the team might rapidly circulate a light-hearted cartoon on official channels joking \u201cNo, our national e-payment systems already know how we shop \u2013 no chips needed in vaccines!\u201d followed by a brief fact-check explaining what the vaccine actually contains. This kind of agile counter-messaging can *outshine the falsehoods* and prevent panic. As Tang noted, **a witty meme can often spread farther and faster than a dry correction, making it an effective tool to *\u201cquash fake news\u201d***\u301028\u2020L191-L199\u3011\u301028\u2020L195-L203\u3011.\n\n- **Leverage Influencers and Youth Voices:** To reach younger demographics (teens, young adults) in particular, work with social media influencers, content creators, and youth ambassadors to spread accurate information. Many youths are more likely to trust and pay attention to a message if it comes from a relatable peer or an idol they follow. We can create a network of **\u201cvaccine advocate\u201d influencers** \u2013 for instance, popular YouTubers, TikTokers, or Instagram personalities in Singapore \u2013 who are given access to expert information and perhaps even training sessions to understand vaccine science, and then encouraged to incorporate pro-vaccine messages into their content. Some might do myth-busting skits, others could simply share their own family\u2019s vaccination stories. These collaborations should be creative and organic rather than feeling like government propaganda. The **key is to occupy the social media space with positive, accurate content** so that youth feeds are balanced or flooded with good information, not dominated by conspiracies. Nearly four in five Singapore students under 18 have said they *want* media literacy and guidance in school for navigating fake news\u30107\u2020L19-L27\u3011; this indicates many youth are receptive and would welcome truthful information if presented in an engaging way.\n\n- **Transparent Communication by Authorities:** Continue and enhance the practice of **transparent, frequent public communication** during health emergencies. One reason misinformation thrives is when people feel uncertain or think information is being hidden. Singapore\u2019s approach during COVID-19 \u2013 regular press briefings, detailed explainers on policies, Ministers addressing public concerns directly \u2013 should be maintained and even expanded in future crises. Health authorities should not shy away from acknowledging uncertainties or rare side effects; instead, *address them head-on with context*. For example, if a new vaccine has a 1 in 100,000 risk of a certain adverse event, explain how that risk compares to the much higher risk of disease complications, and outline clearly the support available (as MOH did by highlighting the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme when introducing pediatric COVID vaccines\u30103\u2020L651-L659\u3011). This openness preempts misinformation narratives that often accuse governments of covering up dangers. **When people trust that the government will tell them the whole truth, they are less likely to be swayed by rogue \u201calternative facts.\u201d** Maintaining that trust through candid communication is paramount.\n\n**Long-Term:**\n\n- **Institutionalize a National Center for Combating Health Misinformation:** We propose creating a **permanent center or office** dedicated to monitoring and countering health-related misinformation. This could be part of the upcoming *Disease Preparedness* or *Digital Readiness* strategies of the government. Its roles would include: ongoing social listening (using AI tools to detect viral rumors or keywords), coordinating with tech platforms to flag false content, issuing timely public advisories or POFMA correction orders when needed, and continually refining best practices for counter-messaging. Essentially, treat dangerous misinformation as a public health threat in its own right \u2013 much like how we have surveillance for disease outbreaks, we have surveillance for misinformation outbreaks. This center can also partner with academic researchers (e.g. NTU\u2019s communications school or NUS\u2019s public health researchers) to study the impact of misinformation and effectiveness of interventions, feeding that back into policy adjustments.\n\n- **Strengthen Legislation and Platform Accountability:** While education and persuasion are the preferred tools, there is a place for **targeted regulation** to stem the tide of falsehoods. In the long run, Singapore might review and update laws like POFMA to ensure they can effectively address health misinformation. For example, setting *fast-track procedures* to act on viral health hoaxes during emergencies, or working with social media companies to **amplify corrections and demote proven false content** in algorithms. Singapore can also liaise with international efforts \u2013 e.g. the EU\u2019s Code of Practice on Disinformation \u2013 to share data on misinformation sources and push platforms for greater transparency. The WHO recommends \u201cdeveloping legal policies\u201d as one tool against infodemics\u301036\u2020L275-L283\u3011\u301036\u2020L295-L303\u3011, but these must be balanced with public trust. Any enforcement should be even-handed and clearly justified to avoid feeding conspiracy claims of censorship. Over time, as our populace becomes more literate, the **hope is to rely less on censoring false content and more on an immune citizenry that simply does not buy into it** \u2013 but until then, a firm legal backbone remains an important support.\n\n- **Early Engagement of Communities and Opinion Leaders:** Another pillar for the long haul is building alliances with community organizations, religious and grassroots leaders, and healthcare professionals to be **proactive messengers** before and during crises. We should identify respected figures in various communities (e.g. a well-known imam, a popular mandarin-speaking community leader, clan association heads, etc.) and equip them with training and information *now*, so that when vaccine drives or public health emergencies occur, these leaders can vouch for the vaccines\u2019 safety and necessity within their circles. This approach was used in some countries to overcome cultural or religious vaccine hesitancy \u2013 for instance, engaging local imams in Indonesia and Malaysia to endorse polio and COVID vaccines helped counteract rumors. Singapore\u2019s multi-cultural society would benefit from a **network of trusted local champions** who amplify the pro-vaccination message in every language and enclave. Government agencies can facilitate periodic briefings for these community leaders (keeping them updated on scientific facts, listening to the ground sentiments they report) to create a two-way trust channel. Over the long term, this will **anchor public willingness to cooperate** with health measures, because the messages won\u2019t just come top-down from officials, but also horizontally from within communities.\n\n- **Cultivate a Pro-Vaccination Culture and Trust in Institutions:** Perhaps the most intangible yet crucial long-term goal is fostering a societal culture that values science, seeks truth, and rallies together in crises. In Portugal, for example, **a strong culture of vaccination and public trust in health authorities led to some of the highest vaccination rates in the world** \u2013 over 99% measles immunization and 95% COVID vaccination in adults\u301020\u2020L135-L143\u3011\u301020\u2020L151-L159\u3011. The Portuguese public\u2019s instinct was to view vaccination as a collective good, and this was reinforced by transparent communication and the visible success of the vaccine program (dramatic drops in COVID deaths and hospitalizations, widely publicized)\u301020\u2020L163-L170\u3011. Singapore can strive for the same kind of **social norm**: where getting vaccinated and rejecting misinformation is seen as part of being a responsible citizen. Achieving this means continuing to earn the public\u2019s trust through competent health governance and showing results (e.g. highlighting how high vaccine coverage has prevented outbreaks here). It also means **celebrating science** \u2013 elevating scientists and doctors in the public eye (through media profiles, awards, etc.) so that children grow up admiring them as much as other role models. When people trust the experts and the system, misinformation has fewer cracks to slip through. Thus, all policy efforts \u2013 from education to communication \u2013 should ultimately reinforce *trust*: trust that our vaccines are safe and beneficial, trust that our government and health professionals act in the public\u2019s best interest, and trust that our fellow citizens will do their part. With that trust, Singaporeans will be far more willing to cooperate swiftly and calmly during emergencies, whether it\u2019s coming forward for a new vaccine booster or adhering to public health measures, because they understand *why* it matters and reject baseless rumors to the contrary.\n\n### 3. Enhance Digital and Media Infrastructure to Combat Falsehoods\n\nGiven that the modern misinformation ecosystem is intertwined with digital platforms, a critical component of our strategy must target the **information environment itself**:\n\n**Mid-Term:**\n\n- **Collaboration with Social Media Platforms:** In the immediate term, Singapore\u2019s regulators and ministries should deepen collaborations with major social media companies (Facebook/Meta, Google/YouTube, TikTok, Telegram, etc.) to flag and remove or contextualize vaccine misinformation targeting Singapore users. Many of these companies have community guidelines against COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation \u2013 the government can ensure local false content is promptly reported through official channels for action. We can also encourage platforms to **push authoritative content** to users in Singapore \u2013 for instance, placing MOH or WHO vaccine info at the top of search results and news feeds when users query vaccine-related terms. Another approach is to implement \u201cinterstitial warnings\u201d \u2013 if someone tries to share a piece of content that independent fact-checkers have debunked, a pop-up could warn, \u201cThis has been identified as false \u2013 are you sure you want to share?\u201d Such nudges can reduce casual misinformation sharing. Singapore might not unilaterally change how global platforms operate, but as part of a global push (aligned with WHO and other countries\u2019 efforts), we can advocate for **design changes that reduce misinformation spread by default**. The U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s advisory calls on tech platforms to \u201cprioritize early detection of misinformation super-spreaders\u201d and be transparent about their algorithms\u301029\u2020L189-L197\u3011 \u2013 Singapore should echo these calls and participate in international forums to hold platforms accountable.\n\n- **Supporting Fact-Checking and Journalism:** Mid-term, it\u2019s important to support independent fact-checkers and quality journalism in Singapore. While government statements are key, an ecosystem of third-party fact-checkers (e.g. media outlets, academic institutions, or civic tech groups) adds credibility and bandwidth to debunk misinformation. Providing grants or creating a dedicated fund for projects that develop fact-checking tools, investigative reports on misinformation networks, or public data visualizations of \u201cfake news\u201d trends could be beneficial. For example, Singapore-based media could run weekly \u201cFact vs Fake\u201d columns that address circulating vaccine myths. Journalists should also be trained to **avoid inadvertently spreading falsehoods** (for instance, by clearly labeling false claims as false and not giving undue \u201cbalanced\u201d coverage to fringe anti-vax opinions). The media has a duty to provide context \u2013 e.g. if reporting on a vaccine adverse event, also report the rarity and the overall benefit \u2013 so as not to skew public perception\u301029\u2020L179-L187\u3011. Strengthening our journalism standards in this regard will ensure that mainstream channels remain a bulwark of accurate information.\n\n**Long-Term:**\n\n- **Continuous Digital Literacy in the Workplace and Community:** Extend digital literacy initiatives into workplaces, National Service, and community groups over the long run. For example, incorporate modules on misinformation awareness into NS training or in civil service staff development, so that large segments of adult population routinely refresh their skills in spotting online falsehoods. Community Centers could offer regular workshops on topics like \u201cNavigating Health Information Online\u201d for various age groups. By institutionalizing such programs, we acknowledge that learning to deal with misinformation is not one-and-done in school \u2013 it must be reinforced as technology evolves.\n\n- **Adaptive Technology Solutions:** Invest in homegrown technology solutions that help Singaporeans identify misinformation in real time. This could mean encouraging local developers to build browser plugins or chatbots that, for instance, allow a user to forward a WhatsApp message to an official bot and get a quick fact-check result. Some initiatives along these lines have appeared globally (e.g. COVID-19 info chatbots by health ministries). Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation expertise can be harnessed to create user-friendly verification tools that integrate with the apps people use daily. In the long term, perhaps Singapore could even develop an AI-driven \u201cinformation hygiene\u201d assistant that personal devices come equipped with \u2013 something that alerts users if a webpage they\u2019re reading is known for false content or if an extraordinary claim lacks credible sources.\n\n- **Evaluation and Iteration:** Finally, a long-term commitment means continuously **evaluating what works and what doesn\u2019t** in our fight against misinformation. The government should fund research to measure Singaporeans\u2019 scientific literacy and susceptibility to misinformation at regular intervals (for example, a biennial national survey or index of \u201cmisinformation resilience\u201d). This would help track progress \u2013 are our interventions leading to better informed citizens? Which demographics still struggle (maybe seniors with lower digital skills, or particular language groups)? Such data-driven insights will allow policies to be refined. It also aligns with the WHO\u2019s advice that we improve metrics and evidence on combating infodemics\u301036\u2020L339-L347\u3011\u301036\u2020L347-L355\u3011. Singapore could aspire to be the first in Asia in media literacy rankings (similar to Finland in Europe), and setting that as a national objective would focus efforts across education, media, and tech domains.\n\n## Comparative Insights from Abroad\n\nIt is useful to underscore some **international case studies** that inform these recommendations, to assure that Singapore\u2019s strategy benefits from others\u2019 lessons:\n\n- **Finland \u2013 Education as the First Line of Defense:** As discussed, Finland\u2019s success in creating a population highly resilient to misinformation stems from its education reforms. By infusing **digital literacy and critical thinking from an early age**, and treating education as a form of *\u201ccollective civil defense\u201d*\u301015\u2020L152-L160\u3011\u301015\u2020L178-L187\u3011, Finland dramatically improved its citizens\u2019 ability to discern truth. Finnish students learn to interrogate information across subjects and grade levels in a cohesive, continuous manner\u301012\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301012\u2020L142-L150\u3011. The result is a generation that scores top in Europe on media literacy and also performs well in science\u301012\u2020L103-L112\u3011. Singapore shares a high-quality education system ethos; we can similarly embed multiliteracy so that *every* student graduates as a little \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d of information\u301015\u2020L178-L187\u3011. **Key takeaway:** Long-term curriculum commitment pays off in a populace that can think for itself and not be easily misled.\n\n- **Portugal \u2013 Trust and Health Culture:** Portugal\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination drive was one of the world\u2019s most successful \u2013 with around 85% of its entire population fully vaccinated and even higher rates in vulnerable groups\u301019\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u301019\u2020L27-L35\u3011. This was achieved *without* significant coercive mandates, but rather through **public trust and a strong pro-vaccine culture** built over years. Portugal\u2019s populace generally believes in vaccines\u2019 benefits and was proud of the nation\u2019s vaccination achievements\u301020\u2020L151-L159\u3011. Experts note that close **cooperation between health institutions, clear and consistent public messaging, and visible proof of vaccine success (sharp declines in COVID deaths) reinforced the public\u2019s positive view of vaccination**\u301020\u2020L165-L173\u3011\u301020\u2020L173-L180\u3011. The government appointed respected leaders (like a former naval admiral) to coordinate vaccinations, who communicated transparently and apolitically, further boosting trust. Portugal shows that when the public sees vaccination as apolitical and purely for public good, misinformation has a harder time gaining a foothold. **Key takeaway:** Maintaining **high public confidence** in authorities and highlighting real outcomes (e.g. \u201cvaccines saved X lives here\u201d) is crucial \u2013 it creates a virtuous cycle where people\u2019s initial trust leads to high uptake, which leads to good outcomes, which then increases trust further. Singapore, with its historically high trust in government and strong health outcomes, is well-positioned to emulate this; we must be careful to nurture that trust (through openness and responsiveness) and never take it for granted.\n\n- **Taiwan \u2013 Agile and Innovative Counter-Messaging:** Taiwan faced waves of COVID-19 related misinformation, sometimes allegedly from foreign actors, but managed to keep its case counts and panic low in the early pandemic. A signature policy was the **\u201chumour over rumour\u201d rapid response** described earlier. By flooding social media with quick, often funny corrections (like the Premier joking about toilet paper shortage myths with a cartoon of his bottom\u301028\u2020L191-L199\u3011), the government undercut misinformation virality. Audrey Tang dubbed this building *\u201cnerd immunity\u201d* \u2013 a tech-savvy society immune to lies by virtue of digital democracy and transparency\u301028\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u301028\u2020L191-L199\u3011. Additionally, Taiwan engaged civil society in fact-checking and relied on an open data approach to build public trust. **Key takeaway:** Be *fast*, be present on the same channels as the rumors, and use creativity to make truth spread as enticingly as falsehoods. Singapore can adapt this by leveraging our own cultural humor and by ensuring our responses are swift and shareable, not just accurate.\n\n- **Samoa \u2013 The Cost of Complacency:** The tragedy of Samoa\u2019s 2019 measles outbreak serves as a cautionary tale. It highlights how quickly hard-won public health gains can reverse if misinformation spreads. Samoa had high vaccination coverage historically\u301038\u2020L213-L221\u3011, but a single incident (a tragic error in vaccine administration) and the subsequent exploitation of that incident by anti-vaccine activists led to an unprecedented drop in coverage\u301038\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u301038\u2020L202-L210\u3011. This opened the door for a disaster that took the lives of dozens of babies. The Prime Minister of Samoa explicitly blamed \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d and outside misinformation for fueling the crisis\u301038\u2020L170-L178\u3011\u301038\u2020L179-L187\u3011. **Key takeaway:** Even communities that have accepted vaccines for generations can be shaken by a wave of misinformation if they are not prepared. Vigilance is needed \u2013 authorities should swiftly counter false narratives *the moment* they arise, especially following any adverse event or public scare, to prevent loss of confidence. Singapore\u2019s policy of immediate clarification and assurance when health scares occur (for example, transparently investigating and publicizing findings on any serious adverse vaccine event) must continue, so that we never see a Samoa-like collapse of trust.\n\nIn summary, **successful countries fight misinformation with a combination of education, trust-building, and agile communication**, while countries that fell victim illustrate the dire stakes of inaction. Singapore\u2019s strategy should therefore be comprehensive and proactive, drawing the best elements from each example: the educational rigor of Finland, the trust-centric approach of Portugal, the communicative agility of Taiwan, and the awareness of risk from Samoa\u2019s experience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVaccine misinformation is a complex, persistent threat that **demands a concerted, long-term response**. Singapore has the advantage of a well-educated populace, strong social cohesion, and credible institutions \u2013 the foundations upon which we can build an even more resilient society. By investing in our people\u2019s scientific literacy and critical thinking from young, we effectively \u201cinoculate\u201d minds against falsehoods before they spread\u30104\u2020L181-L189\u3011. By improving transparency, engaging communities, and communicating creatively, we cut misinformation off at its source and fill the space with truth and trust. And by coordinating across government, technology platforms, and international partners, we address the structural vectors through which misinformation proliferates.\n\nOur recommendations have addressed the **mid-term needs** \u2013 stepping up education and outreach immediately, deploying rapid-response tactics, and empowering youth and community ambassadors in the coming months and years. They have also outlined **long-term strategies** \u2013 embedding these solutions into the fabric of our education system and public health approach, so that in a decade, Singaporeans collectively boast one of the highest \u201cimmunity\u201d levels to misinformation in the world. Mid-term measures will show results in improved vaccine confidence and uptake in the next health campaign; long-term measures will ensure those results are sustained for future generations and future challenges.\n\nImplementing these policies will require ongoing commitment and resources, but the payoff is immense: a Singaporean society that is **well-informed, scientifically grounded, and united in the face of public health emergencies**. In such a society, even when a novel virus emerges or a new vaccine is introduced, people will approach it with rational optimism \u2013 asking questions and seeking evidence (as is their training), but not succumbing to baseless fears. They will cooperate with public health guidance not just out of deference, but out of understanding *why* it\u2019s necessary and right.\n\nIn essence, we aim to cultivate a national psyche that values facts over rumors and community welfare over individual fear \u2013 a psyche encapsulated by the willingness to verify sensational claims, the confidence to choose vaccination for oneself and one\u2019s children, and the **solidarity to fight pandemics together with the government rather than in spite of it**. This is in line with Singapore\u2019s longstanding social compact: the government will be transparent, evidence-driven, and caring, and in return citizens will remain informed, discerning, and responsible.\n\nBy adopting the recommendations in this paper, the Singapore Government can strengthen that compact against the corrosive effects of misinformation. In doing so, we will not only mitigate the current infiltration of vaccine myths, but also set a global example of a nation that achieved \u201cherd immunity\u201d to misinformation. Such **information resilience** is as vital to our national security and well-being as biological immunity. Armed with knowledge, anchored by trust, and guided by science, Singapore will remain ready to face whatever public health challenges the future holds \u2013 **together, and with confidence**.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Low Yen Ling, *Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth \u2013 Remarks at Public Health Ambassador Programme Workshop*, 5 June 2021\u301033\u2020L74-L82\u3011\u301033\u2020L92-L100\u3011\n\n- Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS \u2013 *\u201cAddressing vaccine hesitancy by tackling misinformation\u201d* (news article), 7 June 2021\u30105\u2020L123-L131\u3011\u30105\u2020L131-L139\u3011\n\n- Channel NewsAsia \u2013 *\u201cVideo containing \u2018misinformation\u2019 about COVID-19 vaccination\u2026 a great disservice to our children\u201d: MOH*, 31 Dec 2021\u30103\u2020L589-L597\u3011\u30103\u2020L612-L619\u3011\n\n- Mayo Clinic Staff \u2013 *\u201cDebunking COVID-19 Myths\u201d* (updated 2023)\u301026\u2020L402-L410\u3011\u301026\u2020L408-L416\u3011\n\n- TODAY Online (Commentary by Adrian Kwek & Josef Tan) \u2013 *\u201cHow to \u2018vaccinate\u2019 youth against believing fake news\u201d*, 13 Mar 2023\u30104\u2020L173-L181\u3011\u30104\u2020L179-L187\u3011\n\n- **WHO News Release:** *\u201cInfodemics and misinformation negatively affect people\u2019s health behaviours\u201d*, 1 Sep 2022\u301036\u2020L323-L330\u3011\u301036\u2020L333-L341\u3011\n\n- **U.S. Surgeon General Advisory:** *\u201cConfronting Health Misinformation \u2013 Building a Healthy Information Environment\u201d*, July 2021\u301029\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u301029\u2020L162-L170\u3011\n\n- The Guardian \u2013 *\u201cSamoa\u2019s PM criticises RFK Jr\u2019s vaccine views after deadly measles outbreak\u201d*, 30 Jan 2025\u301038\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u301038\u2020L209-L217\u3011\n\n- Issues in Science & Technology (Kari Kivinen) \u2013 *\u201cIn Finland, We Make Each Schoolchild a Scientist\u201d*, Spring 2023\u301012\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301015\u2020L223-L232\u3011\n\n- VaccinesToday.eu \u2013 *\u201cPortugal in focus: public trust drives vaccine uptake at all ages\u201d*, 23 Sep 2024\u301020\u2020L151-L159\u3011\u301020\u2020L165-L173\u3011\n\n- The Guardian \u2013 *\u201cHumour over rumour?
