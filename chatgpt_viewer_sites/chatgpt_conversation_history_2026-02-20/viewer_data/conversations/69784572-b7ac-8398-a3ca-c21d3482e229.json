That\u2019s typically **Primary 6 / Sec 1**, i.e. **~1\u20132 years above Grade 5**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Difficulty profile is more \u201ctraining-book olympiad\u201d than \u201cSOF Grade 5 paper\u201d:** Many problems are multi-step, with heavier number theory / combinatorics / algebraic structure than what Grade 5 SOF IMO usually expects. Examples you can see inside include things like:\n  - **digit/prime-product structure**, **divisibility constraints**, **alphametic/cryptarithm** style puzzles (e.g., letter-digit substitutions),  \n  - deeper **counting arguments** and **pattern/sequence** reasoning,  \n  - **non-trivial geometry/area** configurations. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n- **Format mismatch:** SOF IMO is strongly **MCQ + OMR** oriented, while this book is largely **open-response training** (you write the answer), which changes time management and guessing strategy even if the math overlaps. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### Where it *is* similar / still useful\n- It *does* contain many topics that overlap with SOF\u2019s general scope (ratio\u2013speed\u2013time, number patterns, area/perimeter, counting, logic).  \n- If your Grade 5 student is already scoring very high on SOF-style papers, this book can function as a **stretch / enrichment source** (selective use).\n\n### Practical verdict\n- **As a primary prep resource for SOF IMO Grade 5:** **too hard / too broad**, and not exam-format aligned.  \n- **As an extension resource after mastering SOF Grade 5 papers:** **good**, but use it **selectively** (choose the more \u201cupper-primary\u201d style questions first; skip the ones that hinge on heavier number theory or advanced algebraic tricks).\n\nIf you want, I can quickly **label pages/questions in this PDF into 3 bins** (\u201cSOF Grade 5-aligned\u201d, \u201cStretch\u201d, \u201cToo advanced for now\u201d) based on what\u2019s visible in the

SOF IMO is strongly **MCQ + OMR + exam pacing**. So even when topic difficulty is similar, *test-taking skills don\u2019t transfer 1:1*. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201  \n- **Difficulty distribution is broader:** There are quite a few problems that lean toward **competition-style reasoning** (logic/constraints, more involved counting, etc.). Those can be **harder than typical SOF Level 1 Grade 5**, though still generally appropriate as \u201cstretch\u201d for strong students.  \n- It also includes an **\u201cIn-depth Analysis\u201d** solutions/explanations section (PDF ~38 onwards), which is great for learning, but again signals it\u2019s a *training book* more than a *mock SOF paper*. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201  \n\n### Practical verdict\n- **As SOF IMO Grade 5 prep:** **Good supplementary resource** (especially for building reasoning strength).  \n- **If you need something that mirrors the exam most closely:** you still want **SOF-style timed sample/past papers** as the core, and use this book to **raise ceiling**.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether your student is aiming for **Level 1 only** or also **Level 2**, and I\u2019ll suggest **which types of questions in this book** are most worth prioritising (and which to skip until later)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201","start_idx":329,"end_idx":350,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Mathematical Olympiad_L4.pdf","id":"file_0000000084a47206b50bb27817ce3079","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"7312c0bd-541d-4bd1-9c07-315d34699afe","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201","start_idx":1069,"end_idx":1090,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Mathematical Olympiad_L4.pdf","id":"file_0000000084a47206b50bb27817ce3079","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"7312c0bd-541d-4bd1-9c07-315d34699afe","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201","start_idx":1591,"end_idx":1612,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Mathematical Olympiad_L4.pdf","id":"file_0000000084a47206b50bb27817ce3079","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":1,"message_id":"7312c0bd-541d-4bd1-9c07-315d34699afe","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2134,"end_idx":2134,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[{"start_ix":329,"end_ix":350,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Mathematical Olympiad_L4.pdf","id":"file_0000000084a47206b50bb27817ce3079","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":206,"cited_message_id":"7312c0bd-541d-4bd1-9c07-315d34699afe","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1069,"end_ix":1090,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Mathematical Olympiad_L4.pdf","id":"file_0000000084a47206b50bb27817ce3079","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":206,"cited_message_id":"7312c0bd-541d-4bd1-9c07-315d34699afe","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1591,"end_ix":1612,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Mathematical Olympiad_L4.pdf","id":"file_0000000084a47206b50bb27817ce3079","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":1,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":206,"cited_message_id":"7312c0bd-541d-4bd1-9c07-315d34699afe","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}}],"request_id":"7d629532-9202-4b65-a557-d3a9e38f6859","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e817091a-2954-4113-a9ce-9b17d47b0051","turn_exchange_id":"76a562ce-6587-4886-a56c-bdf9b42df8bb","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"e817091a-2954-4113-a9ce-9b17d47b0051","children":[]}}}
