This guide breaks down the key government-paid leave entitlements, other support measures, and private sector initiatives in a simple, friendly way. We also include action steps so you can make the most of these benefits. \n\n## Government-Paid Leave Schemes\n\nSingapore\u2019s Government-Paid Leave schemes ensure that new parents can take time off work to care for their children **without loss of income**. Below are the main leave types, with details on who qualifies, how long the leave lasts, what benefits you receive, and how to apply.\n\n### Maternity Leave (Government-Paid Maternity Leave \u2013 GPML)  \n- **Eligibility:** Available to working mothers (including self-employed) if the child is a Singapore citizen and the mother has served at least 3 months with her employer before birth\u30103\u2020L75-L83\u3011. (Under the Employment Act, maternity leave is also provided for mothers of non-citizens, but the government-paid 16 weeks is only for Singapore citizen births.)  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** **16 weeks** of paid maternity leave for each birth if eligible\u30103\u2020L75-L83\u3011. You can start up to 4 weeks before delivery and the rest after birth. For the **1st and 2nd child**, your employer pays the first 8 weeks and the government reimburses the last 8 weeks (capped at $10,000 per 4 weeks)\u30103\u2020L92-L100\u3011. For the **3rd child and beyond**, all 16 weeks are government-paid (capped at $40,000 total)\u30103\u2020L92-L100\u3011. During this period, you receive your usual salary (subject to the cap for the government-paid portion). Your job is protected by law during maternity leave.  \n- **How to Apply:** Inform your employer at least 1 week before you plan to start maternity leave (so they can make cover arrangements)\u30103\u2020L81-L84\u3011. Your employer will handle the government reimbursement paperwork via the Government-Paid Leave portal\u30103\u2020L106-L113\u3011 \u2013 you typically just need to provide your child\u2019s birth certificate and fill out any internal forms. If you are self-employed, you can apply for reimbursement of income loss through the GPL portal as well\u30103\u2020L106-L113\u3011.\n\n### Paternity Leave (Government-Paid Paternity Leave \u2013 GPPL)  \n- **Eligibility:** Available to working fathers (including self-employed) if the child is a Singapore citizen, the father has been married to the child\u2019s mother between conception and birth, and has worked at least 3 months with his employer before the birth\u30105\u2020L57-L65\u3011\u30105\u2020L60-L68\u3011. (Adoptive fathers of infants may also qualify under similar conditions from the formal intent to adopt date\u30105\u2020L69-L77\u3011.)  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** **2 weeks** of paid paternity leave are *mandatory* for eligible fathers, to be taken within 12 months of the child\u2019s birth. Each week is paid at your normal salary (capped at $2,500 per week) and reimbursed by the government\u30105\u2020L81-L89\u3011. In **2024**, the government introduced an **additional 2 weeks** of paternity leave (making it **4 weeks total**) \u2013 employers were encouraged to grant this extra leave with reimbursement by the government\u30105\u2020L89-L97\u3011. **From 1 April 2025 onwards**, it will be *mandatory* for employers to provide the full 4 weeks of paternity leave for eligible fathers of babies born from that date\u30105\u2020L89-L97\u3011. This means dads can look forward to a month off with their newborn, on top of any annual leave. You can take paternity leave in one stretch or split into separate days by agreement with your employer (as long as it\u2019s all taken within baby\u2019s first year)\u30105\u2020L99-L107\u3011.  \n- **How to Apply:** Discuss your leave dates with your employer and give advance notice (many dads take it soon after birth). Your employer will claim reimbursement from the Government-Paid Leave portal\u30105\u2020L118-L125\u3011. If your employer is unsure, you can refer them to the MOM guidelines. The key is to communicate your plans early so work arrangements can be made.\n\n### Shared Parental Leave (SPL)  \n- **Eligibility:** This scheme allows the father to share some of the mother\u2019s maternity leave. It is open to working fathers (including self-employed) if the child is a Singapore citizen, the child\u2019s mother qualifies for maternity leave, and both parents agree to allocate leave to the father\u30108\u2020L55-L63\u3011. (The parents must be legally married to use this scheme.)  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** Under the current scheme (for children born before 1 Apr 2025), an eligible father can take up to **4 weeks** of *Shared Parental Leave*, which are essentially weeks transferred from the mother\u2019s 16-week maternity leave entitlement\u30108\u2020L51-L60\u3011\u30108\u2020L69-L77\u3011. These 4 weeks are government-paid (capped at $2,500 per week) and give dads additional bonding time on top of paternity leave\u30108\u2020L69-L77\u3011. The leave can be taken flexibly (e.g. a week at a time) within the first year of the child\u2019s life\u30108\u2020L75-L83\u3011. **Note:** A major enhancement is coming \u2013 for children born on or after 1 Apr 2025, the Shared Parental Leave scheme will be replaced by a **New Parental Leave** system that grants **6 weeks (from Apr 2025)** and later **10 weeks (from Apr 2026)** of parental leave to be shared between both parents\u30109\u2020L87-L95\u3011. This new leave is in addition to maternity and paternity leave, giving families even more flexibility. Under the new scheme, each parent will be allocated half the weeks by default, but parents can mutually agree to reallocate as needed\u30106\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u30106\u2020L33-L41\u3011.  \n- **How to Apply:** For the current SPL, the mother must **formally give up** X weeks of her maternity leave to the father. She can do this easily via the Shared Parental Leave Allocation System (online) and by informing her employer\u30108\u2020L51-L59\u3011. The father then applies for SPL through his employer (similarly to paternity leave) who will claim reimbursement. If you plan to use the new shared leave system in 2025, you will need to notify your employers (via the LifeSG app/website) within 4 weeks of the child\u2019s birth on how you and your spouse wish to share the leave\u30106\u2020L33-L41\u3011. Always communicate early and put in the request as per your company\u2019s HR process.\n\n### Childcare Leave (for children under 7)  \n- **Eligibility:** All working parents are entitled to **Childcare Leave** each year if they have a child below 7 years old. If your child is a **Singapore citizen** and you have worked with your employer for at least 3 months, you qualify for the **Government-Paid Childcare Leave** scheme\u301011\u2020L46-L54\u3011\u301011\u2020L79-L88\u3011. (If your child is not a citizen, the Employment Act still provides childcare leave \u2013 see below.) This leave is **per parent**, so both mother and father can take it.  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** **6 days** of paid childcare leave per year per parent for citizen children under 7\u301011\u2020L46-L54\u3011. These days can be used to care for your child (for example, when your child is sick or if you need to attend school events). The 6 days are **fully paid**: your employer pays for the first 3 days, and the government reimburses the last 3 days (up to $500 per day)\u301012\u2020L97-L105\u3011. The 6-day allowance is *fixed regardless of number of young children* (you don\u2019t get extra days for additional kids, but the entitlement continues until your youngest child turns 7). If your child is not a Singapore citizen, you are eligible for **2 days** of childcare leave per year under the Employment Act\u301011\u2020L46-L54\u3011. (These 2 days are employer-paid and apply if you have worked at least 3 months.) Unused childcare leave does not carry over year to year\u301012\u2020L91-L99\u3011.  \n- **How to Apply:** This is similar to applying for annual leave \u2013 follow your company\u2019s leave application procedure (some may require a few days\u2019 notice or allow last-minute requests in cases of child illness). The government reimbursement for the 4th\u20136th day is handled by your employer via the GPL portal\u301012\u2020L97-L105\u3011, so you may need to sign a declaration form for those days. It\u2019s a good idea to inform your employer of your childcare leave needs as early as possible (especially for planned events), but employers are generally understanding if you need to take childcare leave at short notice for urgent family needs.\n\n### Extended Childcare Leave (for ages 7\u201312)  \n- **Eligibility:** If your youngest child is a Singapore citizen who is **7 to 12 years old**, each parent gets **Extended Childcare Leave**. You must have served at least 3 months with your employer to qualify\u301016\u2020L153-L161\u3011. (If you also have a younger child under 7, you will use the regular 6 days of childcare leave instead; you **cannot double-claim** both sets in the same year \u2013 6 days per year is the maximum per parent for childcare leave\u301016\u2020L169-L171\u3011.)  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** **2 days** of Extended Childcare Leave per year, per parent, when your youngest child is 7\u201312\u301016\u2020L153-L161\u3011. These 2 days are fully paid and **funded by the Government** (reimbursed up to $500 per day)\u301016\u2020L165-L172\u3011. Essentially, once your child turns 7 and you no longer get the 6 days, you\u2019ll get 2 days each year until the year the child turns 12. This helps parents attend to older kids\u2019 needs (e.g. primary school matters) without using annual leave.  \n- **How to Apply:** The application is the same process as normal childcare leave \u2013 simply submit a leave request through your employer\u2019s system, specifying it\u2019s childcare leave. Your employer will classify the leave correctly (they may ask for your child\u2019s birthdate to verify eligibility) and claim reimbursement from the government for those 2 days\u301016\u2020L165-L172\u3011.\n\n### Unpaid Infant Care Leave (UICL)  \n- **Eligibility:** This is additional leave for parents of infants. If you have a child under 2 years old who is a Singapore citizen and you\u2019ve worked at least 3 months with your employer, you are entitled to Unpaid Infant Care Leave\u301019\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Each parent is eligible separately \u2013 so both mum and dad can take this leave (it is **over and above** your paid childcare leave).  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** **12 days per year** of Unpaid Infant Care Leave for each parent\u301019\u2020L125-L134\u3011. This was enhanced in 2024 (previously 6 days) to give parents more time in the crucial first two years\u301032\u2020L665-L673\u3011. \u201cUnpaid\u201d means your employer is not required to pay your salary for these days; however, your job is protected \u2013 you can take the leave in full or in part to care for your infant without fear of losing your position. Many parents use this to extend time at home during the infant\u2019s illness, vaccinations, or other needs once paid leave is exhausted.  \n- **How to Apply:** As with other leave, submit a request to your employer. Because it\u2019s unpaid, coordinate with your employer on the best timing (some may allow you to take it all at once, or spaced out as needed). Employers cannot unreasonably deny a valid request for infant care leave, but do give as much notice as possible. Since it\u2019s statutory, you don\u2019t \u201capply\u201d to the government \u2013 you simply inform your employer and they mark the days as unpaid leave (there\u2019s no reimbursement process since no salary is paid).\n\n### Adoption Leave (Government-Paid Adoption Leave \u2013 GPAL)  \n- **Eligibility:** Available to **adoptive mothers** who adopt an infant (under 12 months old). If the adopted child is a Singapore citizen, the adoptive mother qualifies for 12 weeks of adoption leave, provided she has worked at least 3 months before the formal intent to adopt\u301022\u2020L140-L148\u3011\u301022\u2020L155-L163\u3011. (If the adopted child is not a citizen, the adoptive mother may qualify if certain conditions are met, such as the child being issued a Dependant\u2019s Pass and at least one adoptive parent being a Singapore citizen\u301022\u2020L145-L154\u3011.) Fathers adopting a child can use paternity leave in respect of the adopted infant (there isn\u2019t a separate \u201cadoption leave\u201d for fathers, but adoptive fathers enjoy the same paternity leave entitlement as biological fathers)\u30105\u2020L69-L77\u3011.  \n- **Duration & Benefits:** **12 weeks** of paid adoption leave for adoptive mothers of infants (to mirror maternity leave)\u301022\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u301022\u2020L140-L148\u3011. This leave should be taken within 12 months from the child\u2019s birth. By default it\u2019s taken in one continuous block starting from the date of **Formal Intent to Adopt** (which is when you file the court application or when the Dependant\u2019s Pass is issued)\u301022\u2020L131-L139\u3011. However, with agreement from your employer, you can arrange flexibility \u2013 for instance, you might start later or even take the last 4 weeks flexibly over the year\u301022\u2020L131-L139\u3011. The government reimburses adoption leave similar to maternity leave: for the 1st and 2nd child adopted, the employer pays the first 4 weeks and the government pays the next 8 weeks (capped at $10,000 per 4 weeks)\u301022\u2020L171-L179\u3011. For the 3rd child adoption onward, all 12 weeks are government-paid (cap $30,000 per adoption)\u301022\u2020L175-L184\u3011. In practice, most employers will pay your full salary during adoption leave and claim the reimbursement.  \n- **How to Apply:** Notify your employer once you have the \u201cformal intent to adopt\u201d date (since that triggers when leave can start). Provide documents like the adoption application or Dependant\u2019s Pass to your employer as proof. Then agree on the leave schedule \u2013 by default it\u2019s a continuous 12-week block, but you can discuss spreading it out. Your employer will apply for reimbursement from the government for the applicable portion\u301022\u2020L171-L179\u3011. Ensure you also inform your HR if your adoption process finalizes or if any conditions (like the child becoming a citizen) affect the leave, as there are rules about repaying the leave if the adoption doesn\u2019t go through within a year\u301022\u2020L191-L199\u3011. \n\n## Other Government Support Schemes for Parents\n\nBeyond leave, the government provides **financial support and incentives** to help defray the costs of raising children and to encourage parents to continue working. These schemes range from cash gifts for your newborn to tax reliefs and childcare subsidies. Below, we outline the key initiatives, what you get, and how to access them.\n\n### Baby Bonus Scheme  \n- **Eligibility:** Your child must be a **Singapore Citizen** to qualify for Baby Bonus benefits. The scheme is open to all Singaporean children regardless of the parents\u2019 income. (If the child isn\u2019t a citizen at birth, you can still get benefits *pro-rated* if the child obtains citizenship by age 12 \u2013 but the full benefits require citizenship by 24 months for the cash gift, and by 12 years for the savings account\u301024\u2020L373-L381\u3011\u301024\u2020L377-L384\u3011.) Note that the **Baby Bonus Cash Gift** is given only if the parents are lawfully married; unwed parents may not receive the cash, though the savings account benefits might still apply in some cases\u301026\u2020L205-L213\u3011.  \n- **Key Benefits:** The Baby Bonus has **two components**: a **Cash Gift** and the **Child Development Account (CDA)**. For children born from 14 Feb 2023 onwards, the Cash Gift amounts have been **enhanced**\u301028\u2020L569-L577\u3011: you receive **$11,000** in total for your **1st and 2nd child**, and **$13,000** for your **3rd and each subsequent child**\u301028\u2020L569-L577\u3011. This cash is paid out in stages every 6 months over 6\u00bd years to support you as the child grows\u301025\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301026\u2020L191-L199\u3011. For example, for a first child, you get $3,000 at birth, then installments and then $400 every six months from age 2 until 6\u00bd, totaling $11k\u301025\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301027\u2020L243-L251\u3011. The **CDA** is a special savings account: the government gives a **First Step Grant** of $5,000 (for 1st and 2nd child) or $3,000 (for older births prior to 2023; note: from early 2025, third and fourth children get $10,000 first step under a new Large Family scheme\u301024\u2020L326-L334\u3011\u301026\u2020L185-L189\u3011). On top of that, the government **matches every dollar** you save in the CDA, up to a cap. For instance, for the first child, the government will co-match up to $4,000 of your savings\u301026\u2020L147-L155\u3011\u301027\u2020L263-L271\u3011. In total (grant + matching), this means up to $9,000 of government contributions for the first child\u2019s CDA, $19,000 for the second, and even higher for third and beyond\u301024\u2020L324-L332\u3011. You can use CDA funds for your child\u2019s childcare fees, preschool, medical expenses, etc., at approved institutions (such as child care centres, clinics, and pharmacies)\u301027\u2020L273-L282\u3011\u301027\u2020L285-L293\u3011. **Example:** If you have a second child, you\u2019ll get $11,000 cash over time, plus $3,000 CDA grant and up to $7,000 matched if you save that amount, giving potentially $10,000 in CDA from government for that child.  \n- **How to Apply:** The process is made easy via the **LifeSG app/website**. You can join the Baby Bonus Scheme as part of your child\u2019s birth registration on the LifeSG app (just have your Singpass handy)\u301024\u2020L354-L363\u3011. If you missed that, you can still apply on LifeSG after the birth\u301024\u2020L362-L369\u3011. No physical forms are needed. Once approved, the cash gift will be deposited into a designated bank account (now, by default, into the Child\u2019s *Child Development Account* itself from July 2024)\u301026\u2020L193-L202\u3011. The CDA will be opened with an approved bank (DBS/POSB, OCBC, or UOB) \u2013 you will receive notification to set it up and the First Step Grant will be deposited automatically\u301027\u2020L263-L271\u3011. *Tip:* The entire application \u2013 from birth registration to Baby Bonus \u2013 can be done in one go on LifeSG, so take advantage of that convenience\u301024\u2020L358-L364\u3011.\n\n### MediSave Maternity Package (MMP) and MediSave Grants  \n- **Eligibility:** All parents can use their **CPF MediSave** for maternity expenses \u2013 there is no special application or criteria aside from having sufficient MediSave funds. Every Singaporean newborn is also given a MediSave grant.  \n- **Key Benefits:** The **MediSave Maternity Package** allows you to tap on your MediSave savings to pay for pre-natal checkups and delivery bills. The withdrawal limits are generous: you can use up to **$900** for pre-delivery medical expenses (ultrasounds, tests, doctor consultations), and for the delivery itself you can use between **$750 and $2,600** depending on the delivery procedure (e.g. higher limit for C-section)\u301030\u2020L118-L126\u3011. Additionally, you can use MediSave for the hospital stay during delivery: up to **$550 per day** for the first two days, and $400 per day thereafter\u301030\u2020L120-L127\u3011. These limits significantly reduce out-of-pocket costs. In fact, with government hospital subsidies plus MediSave, many couples have little or no cash to pay for childbirth\u301030\u2020L137-L145\u3011. Beyond the MMP, the government also provides a **MediSave Grant for Newborns**: every Singaporean baby gets **$4,000 credited** into their MediSave account shortly after birth\u301032\u2020L626-L634\u3011. This can help pay for the child\u2019s MediShield Life insurance premiums, recommended vaccinations, or future healthcare expenses\u301032\u2020L628-L636\u3011. (The $4,000 is automatic for citizen babies once the birth is registered, so it\u2019s a nice \u201cstarter\u201d medical fund for your child.) If you have a third or higher-order child from 2025 onward, there is also a **Large Family MediSave Grant** (additional MediSave funds) as part of the new Large Families Scheme\u301032\u2020L678-L687\u3011\u301032\u2020L689-L697\u3011.  \n- **How to Use/Apply:** To use MediSave for maternity bills, inform the hospital during admission or billing that you wish to use your MediSave. You\u2019ll fill out a form, and the hospital will directly deduct the allowable amounts from your MediSave account under the Maternity Package\u301030\u2020L149-L157\u3011. Don\u2019t forget to bring along your NRIC and CPF details at admission. For pre-delivery expenses (e.g. visits to clinics), keep the receipts \u2013 you can submit them to the hospital where you deliver, and they can process those together (up to $900) to refund to you or offset the bill\u301030\u2020L118-L126\u3011\u301030\u2020L149-L157\u3011. The MediSave Grant for Newborns is automatic; after you register your child\u2019s birth, **CPF Board will create a MediSave account for your baby and credit the $4,000 grant** without any action needed on your part\u301032\u2020L626-L634\u3011. You will get a notification when it\u2019s done. Essentially, ensure your child\u2019s birth registration is done (also via LifeSG or at the hospital) \u2013 that triggers all these automatic benefits.\n\n### Working Mother\u2019s Child Relief (WMCR)  \n- **Eligibility:** This is a **tax relief** for working women who have Singapore citizen children. To qualify, you must be a **working mother** (i.e. have earned income from employment or business) and **legally married**, with a child who is a Singapore Citizen. The relief is typically claimed in the Year of Assessment after the year the child is born (and every year until the child is 16 or up to 18 for tax purposes). Note: Single mothers and fathers cannot claim WMCR \u2013 it\u2019s specifically to encourage married mothers to remain in the workforce\u301050\u2020L1077-L1085\u3011. (However, single parents can still claim other tax reliefs like Qualifying Child Relief.)  \n- **Key Benefits:** WMCR *reduces the amount of your income that is taxed*. Starting from Year of Assessment 2025, WMCR has been simplified to a **fixed dollar relief per child** (instead of a percentage of income)\u301038\u2020L602-L610\u3011. For children born from 2024 onwards, the relief amounts are: **$8,000 for the 1st child, $10,000 for the 2nd child, and $12,000 for each subsequent child**. For example, if 2024 was the birth year of your first baby, in your tax filing for YA2025 you can deduct $8,000 from your taxable income\u301047\u2020L1156-L1164\u3011\u301047\u2020L1167-L1170\u3011. These amounts effectively reduce your tax bill (especially beneficial for lower- and middle-income working mums)\u301038\u2020L604-L612\u3011. If you have older children (born before 2024), those remain on the previous scheme which was a percentage of income (15%\u201325% of income depending on child order)\u301038\u2020L623-L631\u3011\u301047\u2020L1201-L1205\u3011. WMCR for all children is subject to a cap \u2013 the total child-related relief (WMCR + Qualifying Child Relief) is capped at $50,000 per child, and total personal tax reliefs are capped at $80,000. In practice, most mothers will benefit from the full fixed relief unless they have very high incomes.  \n- **How to Claim:** You claim WMCR when filing your annual income tax return. IRAS (the tax authority) usually includes a section for \u201cWorking Mother\u2019s Child Relief\u201d. If your child\u2019s birth has been registered and the child is a Singapore citizen, the IRAS e-Filing system often auto-includes the relief \u2013 you just need to verify the details. Otherwise, you can enter the child\u2019s particulars (name, birth certificate number) and claim the relief amount for that child. There\u2019s no need to submit documents as IRAS will cross-check with government records of births. Just ensure you *tick the box* to claim it. The relief will then be reflected in your Notice of Assessment, reducing your taxable income accordingly. (For older kids on the percentage scheme, IRAS will compute the % based on your income and child order \u2013 but for new claims it\u2019s just the fixed amount.) If you have any issues or if the relief isn\u2019t reflected, you can file an objection or contact IRAS, but usually it\u2019s straightforward. \n\n### Childcare and Infant Care Subsidies  \n- **Eligibility:** All Singapore Citizen children enrolled in licensed infant care or childcare centres are eligible for **basic subsidies**, regardless of family income\u301036\u2020L66-L74\u3011\u301036\u2020L92-L100\u3011. The basic subsidy is given as long as the main caregiver (usually the mother, or single father) is working, or even for non-working parents at a lower rate. In addition, families with household income $12,000 or below (per month) can qualify for an **additional subsidy** on top of the basic one, with lower-income families getting more support\u301033\u2020L1-L4\u3011. To get the additional subsidy, the mother (or single father) must be working at least 56 hours a month (about 2 weeks of part-time) and meet the income criteria\u301036\u2020L73-L81\u3011. These subsidies apply for full-day and half-day programmes at childcare centres licensed by ECDA (which includes most public and private childcare centres in Singapore).  \n- **Key Benefits:** The **Basic Childcare Subsidy** for working parents is **$600 per month** for infant care (under 18 months), and **$300 per month** for childcare (18 months to 6 years)\u301036\u2020L93-L101\u3011. This amount is deducted from the fees, effectively lowering what you pay to the centre. If the mother is not working, a smaller basic subsidy of $150/month is still provided (infant or childcare)\u301036\u2020L92-L100\u3011. On top of basic subsidy, the **Additional Subsidy** provides further fee discounts on a sliding scale: for example, a lower-income family (earning <$3,000) could get up to **$710 extra** off infant care or **$467 extra** off childcare fees per month\u301036\u2020L93-L101\u3011. Even families at the upper end (earning $10k\u2013$12k) get some additional subsidy, though smaller. In short, a dual-income family with moderate income might see hundreds of dollars in fee savings each month \u2013 a huge help given private childcare fees can be high. For example, if your infant care fee is $1,500 a month and you qualify as a working mother, you\u2019d get $600 off (basic), and if your household income is say $5,000, you might get perhaps ~$400 more off, meaning you pay only ~$500 instead of $1,500. The government\u2019s aim is that 80% of preschoolers will have a place in government-supported (affordable) preschools by 2025\u301032\u2020L701-L710\u3011, so these subsidies make childcare much more affordable for most families. (There are also **Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS)** subsidies for MOE kindergartens and low-income families, and **Special grants** for parents of twins/triplets, etc., but those are more specific.) Additionally, if you ever employ a foreign domestic worker (maid) to help with child-raising, note that families with young children get a concessionary maid levy of $60 (vs $300 normal) \u2013 another cost saver (no need to apply; it\u2019s automatic if you have a child under 16 living with you).  \n- **How to Apply:** For childcare subsidies, the **childcare centre will handle the application** once you enroll your child. You\u2019ll fill out a subsidy form and provide details like your employment status and household income documents for means-testing. The centre submits this to ECDA. The subsidies (basic and additional) are then given **directly as fee reduction** \u2013 you pay the net amount each month. Ensure you update the centre if your employment status or income changes, as it can affect the subsidy level. You can also use the *Preschool Subsidy Calculator* on ECDA\u2019s website to estimate your subsidy\u301036\u2020L125-L133\u3011. For the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy concession, if you have a young child, it\u2019s auto-applied \u2013 you just inform MOM when getting a maid that you have an infant/child. Remember to also utilize your **child\u2019s CDA** to pay any remaining childcare fees after subsidy, as that effectively makes your out-of-pocket $0 until the CDA funds are used up.\n\n### Other Financial and Tax Support  \n- **Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR):** This is a one-time income tax rebate for each child, which you can use to offset your tax payable over the years. It\u2019s **$5,000 for your 1st child, $10,000 for your 2nd, and $20,000 for each subsequent child**\u301050\u2020L1047-L1055\u3011. You claim it in the year after your child is born. It\u2019s a rebate (not a deduction), meaning it directly cuts your tax bill. If you and your spouse pay taxes, you can share the rebate. Unused amounts carry forward \u2013 e.g. if you have $5k rebate and your tax is only $2k this year, the remaining $3k carries to next year\u301050\u2020L1041-L1049\u3011\u301050\u2020L1042-L1050\u3011. So many parents effectively pay no tax for several years after having a child. You must be married to claim PTR and the child must be a citizen. Claiming is done during tax filing (similar to WMCR \u2013 just indicate your child\u2019s details and the split between spouses)\u301050\u2020L1041-L1049\u3011\u301050\u2020L1045-L1053\u3011.  \n- **Qualifying Child Relief (QCR):** If you are a tax resident and have a child (regardless of citizenship), either parent can claim QCR which is a $4,000 deduction per child (or $7,500 if the child is handicapped). Typically, if the mother is claiming WMCR, the father claims QCR to maximize relief (parents can decide how to split QCR)\u301050\u2020L1069-L1077\u3011. IRAS automatically links QCR and WMCR such that total per child doesn\u2019t exceed $50k relief. Claim QCR in the tax form by adding your child and selecting the relief.  \n- **Grandparent Caregiver Relief (GCR):** Working mums (citizen or PR) can get an extra $3,000 tax relief if you have a Singaporean child under 12 **and** one of the child\u2019s grandparents is helping to care for the child *without salary*\u301050\u2020L1053-L1061\u3011. E.g. if your mother or mother-in-law babysits your kid so you can work, you can claim this $3k relief. You must be married and the grandmother/grandfather must not be working (income < $4,000) and not already claimed by someone else\u301050\u2020L1055-L1063\u3011. You claim it in your tax return by providing the grandparent\u2019s particulars.  \n- **Housing and Other Support:** While not the focus of this guide, note that first-time married couples with children get priority in HDB flat allocation (e.g. the Parenthood Priority Scheme). There are also government initiatives like **Preschool Subsidy Enhancements** (as discussed) and community support (parenting workshops, etc.). The Marriage & Parenthood Package is comprehensive \u2013 you can find more on the official \u201cMade for Families\u201d website\u30103\u2020L113-L119\u3011 for things like assistance with fertility treatments, education bursaries down the line, etc. The key ones for an employee to know, however, are the leave, cash, and tax benefits described above.\n\n## Private Sector Initiatives and Family-Friendly Workplace Policies\n\nMany employers in Singapore go **above and beyond** the statutory requirements to support their employees with families. Progressive companies recognise that helping staff balance work and family leads to happier, more productive employees and better staff retention. Here are some common private-sector initiatives and best practices that you might find in various companies:\n\n- **Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs):** Flexibility is one of the most valued benefits for parents. Employers may offer flexible work hours (e.g. start early and leave early to pick up kids, or vice versa), telecommuting/remote work, or a hybrid model. For example, some companies allow employees to work from home a few days a week or have \u201ccore hours\u201d during which one must be online but let you schedule the rest of your work time around family commitments\u301054\u2020L218-L227\u3011\u301054\u2020L233-L241\u3011. From 2024, Tripartite Guidelines will require employers to fairly consider any formal requests for FWAs\u301052\u2020L127-L135\u3011 \u2013 so you have the right to request flexibility. *Best practice:* Companies like those in consulting and tech often implement hybrid work models, providing toolkits and training to help employees and managers make flexibility work\u301054\u2020L218-L227\u3011\u301054\u2020L229-L238\u3011. If your company has adopted the **Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony**, they have committed to provide FWAs and even appoint a Work-Life ambassador in management\u301052\u2020L173-L181\u3011. **How to access:** Check your employee handbook or HR portal for an FWA policy. Many firms have a formal process (a form or an email request to HR) to request flexible working. Don\u2019t hesitate to discuss informally with your manager as well \u2013 often you can negotiate an arrangement that suits both parties. With the new guidelines, feel confident to propose an arrangement; your employer should respond based on business needs and try to accommodate where possible.\n\n- **Additional Parental Leave and Benefits:** Some companies provide more leave than the legal minimum. For instance, certain multinational companies offer **extended maternity leave** (e.g. 6 months paid) or **parental leave** that applies equally to mothers and fathers beyond government-paid leave\u301057\u2020L288-L297\u3011. A notable example is a global firm like Rio Tinto, which in Singapore gives *all new parents* (regardless of gender) **18 weeks of fully paid parental leave** as a corporate benefit\u301058\u2020L584-L592\u3011 \u2013 enabling fathers to take much more time off than the statutory 2-4 weeks. Other firms may offer a longer period of unpaid leave for new mothers to extend their time at home without quitting their job. Locally, some companies (especially larger banks, professional services firms, etc.) voluntarily increased paternity leave to 4 weeks even before it was mandated. Additionally, a number of family-friendly SMEs provide **extra childcare leave** or family care days on top of the statutory leave. For example, one Singapore SME, Absolute Kinetics, gives their staff **additional company-paid childcare leave** beyond the 6-day entitlement, as well as *parent-care leave* to look after elderly parents, and even a benefit where staff can leave work early once a month for family time\u301056\u2020L320-L328\u3011. These show a culture that truly values employees\u2019 families. Some companies also celebrate milestones with gifts (e.g. baby gift hampers) or offer benefits like lactation consultants for new mums returning to work. **How to access:** Familiarize yourself with your company\u2019s HR policies or staff benefits handbook \u2013 the info on extra leave or benefits is usually documented there. You may need to inform HR to activate certain benefits (e.g. apply for extended maternity). If unsure, ask your HR rep, \u201cAre there any additional parental benefits or leave that our company provides?\u201d They can guide you. It\u2019s also a good idea to speak to colleagues who are parents to learn from their experiences using these benefits.\n\n- **Family-Friendly Workplace Policies:** Companies increasingly strive to create a culture that supports families. This can include having **on-site or near-site childcare facilities** or partnerships with childcare centers to give employees priority placement or discounts. Some large workplaces (business parks, hospitals, universities) have a childcare centre right on campus for staff convenience. Many employers also set up **dedicated nursing rooms** for breastfeeding mothers to express milk in privacy and comfort. Flexible **break times** for mothers to nurse or pump are commonly allowed. **Family days** and events are another popular initiative \u2013 firms organize annual Family Day outings where employees can bring spouses and kids for a day of fun, or they hold kids-to-work days during school holidays. For example, a fintech company, Coinhako, shares that they frequently organize activities where employees\u2019 families are invited \u2013 like hiking trips \u2013 to foster a family-like environment\u301056\u2020L327-L335\u3011\u301056\u2020L337-L344\u3011. Some companies also offer **family healthcare benefits** (like extending corporate health insurance to cover employees\u2019 children or spouses) and **employee assistance programmes** (counselling services that can help with family or marital issues). The Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony encourages employers to implement at least two kinds of support schemes for families \u2013 such as health and wellness programmes or childcare support \u2013 and two enhanced leave benefits (like those extra family leave days or compassionate leave)\u301052\u2020L173-L181\u3011. **How to access:** If your workplace has on-site facilities or family events, you would be informed via internal communications \u2013 so keep an eye on emails or notice boards for announcements. For using nursing rooms or claiming dependent insurance, check with HR on the procedures (often it\u2019s as simple as registering your child as a dependent for insurance coverage). Don\u2019t hesitate to utilize these facilities \u2013 they are there to help you. If you require something that\u2019s not formally provided (say, you need a private space to express milk), talk to HR/management; progressive employers are often willing to make ad-hoc accommodations.\n\nIn summary, while government policies set the baseline, many employers provide **even more generous perks** to support working parents \u2013 from flexible scheduling and extra leave to a supportive office culture. If you\u2019re job hunting and family support is important to you, look out for employers known for such practices (sometimes they have accolades like \u201cFamily Friendly Employer\u201d or openly advertise their benefits in recruitment materials\u301053\u2020L27-L35\u3011). Internally, make sure you communicate with your supervisor about your family needs; good companies will try to adjust work arrangements to help you thrive both as an employee and a parent.\n\n## Employee Action Steps: Making the Most of Your Entitlements\n\nNavigating all these schemes can feel overwhelming, but don\u2019t worry. Here\u2019s a simple checklist to ensure you receive everything you\u2019re entitled to \u2013 and advice on where to get help if you have questions or run into issues:\n\n- **1. Educate Yourself on Your Benefits:** As a start, use resources like this guide and official websites to know what leave and support you can get. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) website and the \u201cMade for Families\u201d portal have up-to-date details on schemes\u30103\u2020L113-L119\u3011. Knowledge is power \u2013 when you know your entitlements (e.g. that you have 6 days childcare leave or that you can use MediSave for delivery), you can plan ahead and confidently discuss them with your employer. If you\u2019re unsure about any benefit, don\u2019t hesitate to ask your HR department for information.\n\n- **2. Communicate and Plan Early with Your Employer:** To smooth the process, inform your employer early about major leave events. For example, once you\u2019re comfortable sharing your pregnancy news, let your supervisor and HR know the expected due date and discuss preliminary plans for your maternity leave duration and handover of duties. Similarly, fathers should notify employers about upcoming paternity leave, and parents should give as much notice as possible for childcare leave (except emergencies). Early communication helps your team plan for your absence and shows goodwill. Remember, by law you generally need to give at least one week\u2019s notice before starting maternity or paternity leave\u30103\u2020L81-L84\u3011, but in practice giving a few months\u2019 heads-up is appreciated. Have a meeting with your manager to agree on how your work will be covered \u2013 this reduces any possible work stress while you\u2019re on leave.\n\n- **3. Follow Application Procedures and Keep Records:** Each entitlement may have a form or process \u2013 be diligent in following through. Apply for your Baby Bonus on LifeSG, fill up your company\u2019s leave application forms, and submit any required documents (e.g. child\u2019s birth certificate for paternity leave, or medical certificate if childcare leave was taken for a sick child as some companies require proof for childcare leave). Mark key deadlines: for instance, when tax filing comes around (by April each year), remember to claim the WMCR, QCR, or PTR you\u2019re eligible for. Keep personal copies of important documents: birth certificates, adoption papers, medical certificates, and any correspondence with HR about your leave arrangements. Usually everything goes smoothly, but if there\u2019s any discrepancy (say, your payroll didn\u2019t reflect your maternity leave pay correctly), it helps to have records to clarify.\n\n- **4. Know Your Rights: If in Doubt, Seek Advice:** Singapore\u2019s employment laws protect parents. It is **illegal for employers to dismiss or penalize an employee for taking entitled maternity or paternity leave**. Pregnant employees are also protected from unfair dismissal \u2013 if that ever happens, you can file a claim with MOM. If you feel your company is not honoring your leave entitlements or you face workplace discrimination related to pregnancy/parenthood, you can get help. First, talk to your HR or union (if your company is unionized) \u2013 sometimes misunderstandings can be resolved internally. If not, you can contact the **Ministry of Manpower** for assistance or lodge a complaint. You can also approach the **Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP)** if you encounter discrimination (e.g. being passed over for promotion due to being a new parent). These bodies can advise you on your rights and, if needed, step in to ensure compliance. Remember, these government-paid benefits are your **legal right**, not a favor from the employer.\n\n- **5. Reach Out for Help and Support:** For any questions on leave schemes or baby benefits, there are resources available. The **Government-Paid Leave (GPL) Portal** has FAQs and guides on how claims work\u30103\u2020L106-L113\u3011. The **LifeSG app** is a handy one-stop app for family-related services. If you prefer to speak to someone, you can call MOM\u2019s helpline or the CPF Board (for MediSave/Baby Bonus queries). Additionally, don\u2019t underestimate the value of peer support \u2013 talk to coworkers who are parents, join local parenting forums or Facebook groups, and share experiences. Sometimes another parent at your workplace can mentor you on how they negotiated flexible work or utilized certain benefits. And finally, involve your spouse: coordinate who takes which leave, share the Baby Bonus application task, and double-check each other\u2019s understanding of the reliefs to claim \u2013 teamwork makes the dream work!\n\n**In conclusion**, Singapore provides a strong support system for working parents through government programs and many employers build on that with family-friendly practices. By knowing the schemes, planning ahead, and communicating with your employer, you can confidently take advantage of these benefits to care for your family. Embrace your entitlements \u2013 they exist to help you **balance your career and parenthood successfully**. Enjoy the precious time with your little ones, and remember that taking leave or asking for flexibility when you need it is absolutely okay. You deserve to benefit from these pro-family measures, and your employer and the government are partners in helping you raise a healthy, happy family!\u301052\u2020L173-L181\u3011\u301056\u2020L320-L328\u3011\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":80,"end_ix":96,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"image_inline","asset_pointer_links":["browse://fetch_multimodal_raw?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cpf.gov.sg%2Fmember%2Finfohub%2Feducational-resources%2Fbaby-bonus-benefits-and-support-for-new-parents%2F_jcr_content%2Froot%2Fcontainer_58825609%2Fcontainer_copy_copy__488319030%2Fimage.coreimg.jpeg%2F1683081434030%2Fbaby-bonus-benefits-and-support-for-new-parents-cover.jpeg&zdr_type=3&check_internal_classifiers=False&original_conversation_id=67da739f-1f68-8007-a3ed-c85d48a6d1b9"],"clicked_from_url":"https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/baby-bonus-benefits-and-support-for-new-parents","clicked_from_title":"CPFB
