We have pushed next token prediction, reasoning models, agentic workflows, and the associated scaffolding far, and while there is still room to go, all these will eventually hit a wall. JEPA and its successors might be the new paradigm; or we may need a completely new paradigm. Either way, the AI industry is in for a rude awakening some time in the not-too-distant future.\n- Enterprise adoption will continue apace but will continually encounter real frictions that will prove very challenging. Converting vast amounts of data to a format suitable for interfacing with AI models is one friction, Regulatory compliance, the traditional audit and check and balance systems, will form another source of friction. It will not be smooth sailing. \n- The boom (economic, capital investment, venture funding, etc) still has a couple of years of life left before the bubble encounters real consequences and real fallout. This will occur toward the end of the Trump Presidency, casting a grave shadow over the 2028 elections. The stock market bull run will have stallled by then, perhaps even gone into bear mode.\n- Job losses in the next recession will be substantial and the jobs lost will not be coming back at all. Firms will take the opportunity to aggressively slash head count and replace workers with AI systems and agentic workflows. Refer to the previous point on enterprise adoption \"frictions\". These frictions will pose real challenges and difficulties, but firms will take the pain of these frictions rather than avoid the great worker head count slash. They will suffer -- yes -- but they will see the suffering and the potential long term rewards as worth it. Jobs losses will escalate and the next economic recovery will be shocking in that the usual job recovery will not occur alongside it.\n- This will set the stage for a very tumultuous 2028-2032 Presidential term. There will be real economic suffering, and rapidly widening inequality as the fruits of AI are unevenly shared between owners of capital versus owners of labor. Social unrest will deepen the culture wars. Things will likely get violent and bloody. This will set the stage for a pivotal 2032 Presidential election, as per the renowned analysis by George Friedman which maps out the great economic and political cycles of the United States. Friedman may have missed the AI boom in his seminal thesis on the next 100 years, but his cycle theory will prove intact.\n\nLet us start the ball rolling with the above hypotheses. Challenge my assumptions, explore their ramifications if they pan out.

The operation, conducted in cooperation with the Nigerian government, struck ISIS camps in Sokoto State, resulting in multiple enemy fatalities. Trump described the actions as a response to escalating violence against Christians and previously vowed retaliation if it continued.\n\nThe U.S. Department of War released unclassified footage of missile launches and coordinated with Nigeria for strategic and intelligence support. War Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized the administration\u2019s resolve to combat radical Islamic terrorism. The strikes followed intensifying surveillance efforts and came a day after a deadly suspected suicide bombing at a mosque in Maiduguri.\n\nThe violence in Nigeria is linked to militant groups such as Boko Haram and ISIS affiliates. President Trump had previously warned of potential U.S. intervention and aid suspension. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu responded with a call for religious peace and reaffirmed his commitment to protecting all citizens.

Nevertheless, Nigeria's foreign ministry confirmed the strikes occurred within a framework of security coordination and intelligence-sharing with the U.S.\n\nThe targeted region of Sokoto is known for harboring Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) cells and bandit groups.

House to present plans for Trump's East Wing ballroom in January","snippet":"The White House is set to present plans for President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed East Wing ballroom during a hearing with the National Capital Planning Commission on January 8. The $400 million ballroom, which would be 90,000 square feet\u2014far larger than the White House itself\u2014is facing significant opposition from preservationists and Democratic lawmakers, who are concerned about its size, cost, and donor transparency. The commission, chaired by Trump ally Will Scharf, has opted not to review certain aspects of the project, including its potential impact on historic landmarks, even as the former East Wing was quietly demolished in October. The National Trust for Historic Preservation is suing to stop construction, though a judge recently denied a temporary restraining order due to a lack of finalized plans. Trump, known for his real estate background, is personally involved in the initiative, framing it as part of efforts to revitalize the White House and the capital ahead of the upcoming 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. A more formal review by the commission is expected in spring, during which public input will be considered.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1766743759.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-inauguration-donald-trump-2025-01-20/","title":"Scenes from the inauguration of Donald Trump","snippet":"20 Jan 2025 \u2014 Tammy Holt and Vicky Askew, from Alabama, react after Donald Trump was sworn in at his inauguration ceremony for his second presidential term, in Washington.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-inauguration-donald-trump-2025-01-20/XZXIJ4CFNNN3FELSUOA3GVLJ6U/","title":"Scenes from the inauguration of Donald Trump","snippet":"20 Jan 2025 \u2014 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during the inauguration ceremony.

See the impact of his tariffs, in four charts","snippet":"In 2025, President Donald Trump dramatically reshaped U.S. trade policy by implementing widespread tariffs on imports from nearly every country. This aggressive strategy, aimed at reducing the trade deficit and reviving domestic manufacturing, caused major disruptions in global commerce and heightened costs for both consumers and businesses. While the tariffs generated over $236 billion for the U.S. Treasury by November, they represent only a small share of federal revenue and fall short of covering lost income tax revenue or funding proposed dividends for Americans.\n\nEconomic effects were significant: the effective U.S. tariff rate surged to nearly 17%\u2014the highest since 1935\u2014and the trade deficit, though decreasing in recent months, remained higher year-over-year. U.S. imports from China dropped by nearly 25% as tariffs on Chinese goods reached 47.5%. Meanwhile, imports from Mexico, Vietnam, and Taiwan increased. The rollout of these trade measures, often sudden and inconsistent, added to economic volatility, contributing to major stock market swings throughout the year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1766748687.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-inauguration-swearing-capitol-b3549ebe5dae74a872502aa79def7a11","title":"Trump sets out to erase Biden's legacy after taking office as ...","snippet":"21 Jan 2025 \u2014 President Donald Trump pardons more than 1,500 of his supporters charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1737349590.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-inaugural-address-takeaways-212571b9f231469010c31e06ec530199","title":"Key moments from Trump's second inaugural address","snippet":"20 Jan 2025 \u2014 Trump added a long list of policies that sounded more at home in a State of the Union speech than an Inauguration Day address.

Republican lawmakers have demonstrated unprecedented loyalty to Trump, aligning with his public positions 95% of the time in the House and 96% in the Senate\u2014the highest rates since the 1950s. This rising partisanship, underscored by sharp divisions with Democrats, has hindered legislative collaboration on key issues such as healthcare and immigration, exemplified by a 43-day government shutdown over health insurance subsidies.\n\nTrump has further strained the balance of power by issuing over 400 executive orders this year, sidestepping legislative authority and challenging norms with actions like withholding $4 billion in Congressional-approved foreign aid. Scholars warn that such executive overreach threatens Congress' constitutional role, though some reforms may only come after Trump leaves office.\n\nDespite the gridlock, bipartisan cooperation remains possible, notably through the use of omnibus bills that bundle diverse legislation.

are hiring AI specialists instead of data engineers - and its a big problem","snippet":"A recent TechRadar article highlights a critical issue in the AI industry: the over-hiring of AI specialists compared to data engineers is jeopardizing the success of AI projects. Despite the growing demand for AI technology, more than 80% of AI initiatives are failing\u2014double the failure rate of traditional tech projects. The primary reason isn't flawed AI models but inadequate data quality, accessibility, and governance. \n\nAccording to DoubleTrack, U.S. job postings show a 46% higher demand for AI/ML roles over data infrastructure roles, with industries like sales and marketing showing the most significant imbalances. For instance, there are 232% more AI roles than data roles in sales, a sector heavily dependent on clean, organized data. Despite AI specialists earning an average of $15,000 more annually than data engineers, their performance is hindered without robust data foundations.\n\nStates with less-established tech sectors, such as Mississippi and Missouri, show the largest surpluses of AI hiring, potentially driven more by trend-following than strategic need. The report warns that companies investing heavily in AI without building the necessary data infrastructure are the most vulnerable to project failure. The article concludes that AI success should not be measured by speed but by solid data groundwork.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1766175300.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai","title":"AI Act | Shaping Europe's digital future -

Effective from February 2, 2025, the Act prohibits emotion-tracking of employees via webcams or voice systems, and bans deceptive AI practices like manipulating users into unwanted purchases on websites. It also restricts exploitation based on age, disability, or economic status and prohibits social scoring based on irrelevant personal data. Law enforcement is barred from predicting criminal behavior solely from biometric data and from using mobile facial recognition surveillance, except under strict conditions.\n\nAlthough the guidelines are not legally binding, they aim to support businesses and regulators in interpreting and complying with the AI Act ahead of its full implementation on August 2, 2026. Violations could lead to fines ranging from 1.5% to 7% of a company's global revenue. The EU's AI regulatory framework is noted for being stricter and more comprehensive than the lighter-touch or state-control approaches of the U.S. and China, respectively.

AI Could Cause Social Security to Run Out of Money Sooner Than Expected","snippet":"The article discusses how the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) could accelerate the depletion of Social Security funds by disrupting the job market and reducing payroll tax revenues. AI has the potential to both increase productivity and cause significant job displacement. If more jobs are lost than created, it could weaken Social Security\u2019s funding, which already pays out more in benefits than it collects. The Social Security trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2033, potentially triggering a 23% benefit cut without legislative intervention.\n\nEstimates from Goldman Sachs suggest that if AI reduces workforce participation in line with productivity gains, 2.5% of U.S. jobs could be lost. However, if AI significantly boosts wages and workforce participation, the depletion timeline might be extended. Still, research from the Penn Wharton Budget Model indicates that AI's positive impact on Social Security will likely be modest, closing just 4% of the projected 75-year funding gap. Job losses are expected mainly in white-collar sectors, while manual labor roles remain less vulnerable. Experts argue the effects of AI will become more evident in the next few years, potentially leading to considerable job displacement and further straining Social Security revenues.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1766730600.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/ai-jobs-yale-economist-martha-gimbel-11862050","title":"Tech Makes Society Better Off-But Not the Displaced Workers, Yale Economist Warns","snippet":"In a recent conversation with Investopedia, Martha Gimbel, co-founder and executive director of the Yale Budget Lab, discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the labor market. While major companies warn of AI's potential to eliminate jobs in sectors like software engineering and customer service, Gimbel emphasizes that the actual effect and timeline are hard to predict. She compares this uncertainty to past technological revolutions like electricity, where new, unforeseen jobs emerged, only to be later automated.\n\nHistorically, displaced workers, such as phone operators, often ended up underemployed or leaving the labor force, despite society benefiting overall from the technological advancement. Gimbel notes that while future generations may prosper, the immediate impact on displaced workers can be devastating, as seen during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nRegarding job vulnerability, Gimbel suggests that roles involving substantial human interaction, such as theater acting, are less likely to be replaced by AI. She warns against both overreacting and underestimating AI's disruptive potential, as technology adoption typically unfolds over many years due to logistical and regulatory challenges.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1766750400.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-layoffs-in-2025-crossed-50000-4-biggest-technology-companies-that-called-out-ai-in-their-job-cuts-announcement-and-how/articleshow/126106779.cms","title":"AI layoffs in 2025 crossed 50,000: 4 biggest technology companies that called out AI in their job cuts announcement and how","snippet":"In 2025, over 50,000 jobs were cut in the U.S. tech industry with companies directly citing artificial intelligence (AI) as a primary reason, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Its new reasoning model, R1, utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to automate the typically labor-intensive process of refining large language model responses, thus significantly reducing human involvement and development costs. The breakthrough, described as an \u201caha moment,\u201d occurred when the model began independently reevaluating and improving its answers.\n\nDeepSeek first created a strong pre-trained model, V3, and then rewarded it through RL instead of traditional human feedback mechanisms. This method allowed the model to learn and reason with minimal human input. Additionally, the company developed smaller, efficient models by distilling knowledge from larger ones, including tweaking existing models from Alibaba and Meta. Despite controversy over potential use of OpenAI outputs for training, DeepSeek\u2019s transparent and efficient methods have been praised by AI experts.\n\nThe R1 model reportedly rivals or surpasses flagship models from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic on reasoning tasks, offering a new paradigm for developing powerful AI at a fraction of the usual cost. Experts believe these techniques could democratize AI innovation by enabling less well-funded teams to compete.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1738126848.085,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-openais-ai-models-win-milestone-gold-global-math-competition-2025-07-21/","title":"Google and OpenAI's AI models win milestone gold at global math competition","snippet":"Google and OpenAI announced that their AI models have achieved gold medals at the 66th International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)\u2014a historic first for artificial intelligence. This milestone indicates a major advancement in AI's reasoning abilities, particularly in processing and solving complex math problems using natural language rather than traditional formal methods. Both companies' models successfully solved five out of six problems in the competition.\n\nGoogle utilized its general-purpose Gemini Deep Think model, while OpenAI relied on an experimental model that heavily scaled \"test-time compute,\" enabling extended and parallel reasoning. Though OpenAI didn't disclose the cost of computation, the effort was described as \"very expensive.\"\n\nThis success has sparked optimism among researchers, including Brown University professor and DeepMind visiting researcher Junehyuk Jung, suggesting AI might soon assist mathematicians in resolving unsolved research problems. Both companies coordinated with the IMO board to validate and time the release of their results. This year also marked the first official collaboration between the competition and AI developers, highlighting a growing fusion of human and artificial intelligence in academic domains.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1753137861.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-industrys-scaling-obsession-is-headed-for-a-cliff","title":"The AI Industry's Scaling Obsession Is Headed for a Cliff","snippet":"A new MIT study warns that the AI industry's current obsession with ever-larger models and infrastructure investment may soon hit diminishing returns. Researchers Neil Thompson, Hans Gundlach, and Jayson Lynch demonstrate that beyond a certain point, increasing model size and computational power does not produce proportional gains in performance. Instead, optimizing model efficiency may drive future breakthroughs, especially in reasoning-focused AI systems. The recent success of efficient models like DeepSeek\u2019s underscores this shift. Despite this, major labs like OpenAI are heavily investing in data center infrastructure, driven by growing demand and strategic independence. Critics, including financial leaders like JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, caution against the economic risks of this infrastructure bubble. The MIT team urges the industry to consider alternative paths, such as developing more efficient algorithms and exploring academic innovations, rather than just scaling compute. Their analysis suggests that the dominance of large AI companies could wane as efficiency gains level the playing field.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1760551200.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694e87ebd2b88330aa34d8f0fe0922ed","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching the web for transformer scaling research","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"19230ca7-47d4-47fb-8f33-c3ed0f87dc87","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"73650e69-ad6e-4b7e-8937-980d4a8e9d4f","turn_exchange_id":"3104d224-edb7-4daf-b419-504c0792953e","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"73650e69-ad6e-4b7e-8937-980d4a8e9d4f","children":["f788a199-8bf1-42e6-954f-280328665388"]},"f788a199-8bf1-42e6-954f-280328665388":{"id":"f788a199-8bf1-42e6-954f-280328665388","message":{"id":"f788a199-8bf1-42e6-954f-280328665388","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766754437.730718,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying approach for discussing hypotheses and defining terms","content":"I have sources on diminishing returns, test-time compute, and the scaling cliff, so I'll cite them.

The research, based on U.S. Census Bureau data and surveys from 2017 to 2021, found that early AI adopters experienced a short-term drop in productivity as automation displaced human workers and interrupted established workflows, such as inventory management. However, companies that weathered this disruption later reported enhanced productivity, sales growth, and employment. The study involved 30,000 firms, showing a rise in AI adoption from 7.5% to 9.1%. Researcher Kristina McElheran noted that older, larger firms struggled more with the transition.

I\u2019ll treat your five points as *working hypotheses*\u2014but I\u2019m going to pressure-test the load-bearing assumptions and show where your story is internally consistent vs where it\u2019s doing hidden work.\n\nOne factual anchor first: as of **December 26, 2025**, **Donald Trump is the sitting U.S. president**, inaugurated **January 20, 2025**. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search10\ue202turn5search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis 1: \u201cAutoregressive transformers will hit a wall; JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) or a new paradigm replaces them\u201d\n\n### Where you\u2019re probably right\nThere are *multiple* \u201cwalls,\u201d and they\u2019re easy to conflate:\n\n1) **Scaling returns**: \u201cbigger model + more data + more compute\u201d yields diminishing marginal gains on many benchmarks (not zero gains\u2014just worse economics). Recent discussions and papers explicitly frame progress as shifting from pure pretraining scale toward *efficiency* and *inference-time/test-time compute* (using more computation during answering). \ue200cite\ue202turn9news37\ue202turn9search1\ue202turn9search4\ue201\n\n2) **Reliability wall**: long-horizon, high-stakes tasks require *consistent correctness*, not \u201cusually right.\u201d Enterprises care about tail risk, auditability, and repeatability more than flashy demos.\n\n3) **Data wall**: high-quality new text data is finite; growth increasingly depends on synthetic data, curation, multimodal data, and better training pipelines.\n\n### Where your argument overreaches\nYou\u2019re implicitly claiming a *paradigm discontinuity* (\u201crude awakening\u201d), but the evidence also supports a *phase transition* instead:\n\n- Recent \u201creasoning\u201d leaps can come from **scaling test-time compute** and better search/verifier loops\u2014i.e., *more computation at inference*, not necessarily a new backbone architecture. A concrete example: Reuters reports that OpenAI and Google achieved **gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad** with approaches that leaned heavily on scaled reasoning at test time. \ue200cite\ue202turn9news35\ue201  \n  That cuts against \u201cwe\u2019re about to slam into a wall,\u201d and more toward: \u201cwe\u2019re moving from training scaling \u2192 inference scaling + systems engineering.\u201d\n\n- **JEPA** is real and important, but right now it\u2019s not a drop-in replacement for language-first systems. Meta\u2019s I-JEPA is explicitly presented as a *representation prediction* approach for self-supervised learning (initially in vision), not as a proven general substitute for large language models (LLMs). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n  It\u2019s best seen as a **complement**: world-model style representation learning + planning, potentially feeding into (or sitting alongside) language models.\n\n**Key critique:** you\u2019re making a *false dichotomy*: \u201ctransformers hit wall \u2192 JEPA replaces them.\u201d The more likely outcome is *hybridization*: transformers remain a core interface/decoder, while JEPA-like world models, tool-augmented execution, and explicit verification become the \u201cengine room.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis 2: \u201cEnterprise adoption continues, but frictions (data, compliance, audits) make it hard\u201d\n\nThis one is strongly grounded.\n\n- OpenAI\u2019s **2025 enterprise report** claims enterprise usage is scaling fast (e.g., **8\u00d7** growth in weekly enterprise messages since Nov 2024; large increases in \u201creasoning token\u201d consumption; increasing use of custom assistants/projects integrated into workflows). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- McKinsey\u2019s 2025 survey reports **88%** of respondents say their organizations use AI in at least one business function\u2014yet \u201cscaling\u201d remains the hard part. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search3\ue201  \n- Gartner explicitly flags **data availability and quality** as top challenges even among high-maturity orgs. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search11\ue201  \n\n### The friction you\u2019re missing: \u201cdata conversion\u201d isn\u2019t the real bottleneck\nThe bottleneck is **data governance**: permissions, lineage, semantic consistency, and accountability. Turning PDFs into embeddings is the easy part. Ensuring the model\u2019s answers are *traceable, policy-compliant, and reproducible* is the hard part.\n\n### Regulation: yes\u2014*but it\u2019s uneven*\nIn the EU, the **AI Act** timeline is now concrete (e.g., prohibited practices and AI literacy obligations applied from **Feb 2, 2025**; general-purpose AI obligations applied from **Aug 2, 2025**; full applicability **Aug 2, 2026**, with some later deadlines). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7news42\ue201  \nIn the U.S., many orgs use voluntary frameworks like the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)**. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search2\ue201  \nAnd globally, compliance programs are coalescing around auditable management standards like **ISO/IEC 42001** for AI management systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search1\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** you\u2019re right adoption won\u2019t be smooth. But the \u201cfrictions\u201d don\u2019t necessarily prevent adoption\u2014they **shape what gets adopted** (copilots + constrained automation first; high-autonomy, high-stakes agents later).\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis 3: \u201cThe boom has ~2 years left; bubble fallout late in Trump\u2019s term; shadow over 2028 election; bull market stalls or turns bear\u201d\n\nThis is the most speculative part, and your causal chain needs tightening. You\u2019re assuming a synchronized timing across:\n\n- model progress slowdown,\n- enterprise monetization shortfall,\n- capital markets repricing,\n- a recession,\n- and election-cycle political narratives.\n\nThat *can* happen, but it\u2019s not a single-parameter system.\n\n### A stronger version of your argument (that survives critique)\nA plausible \u201cbubble\u201d trigger is not \u201cAI disappoints\u201d in the abstract, but:\n\n- **Capex (capital expenditure) outpaces monetizable demand**, especially in data centers/compute; plus  \n- **marginal capability gains get more expensive** (inference costs dominate), which compresses margins; plus  \n- **regulatory/liability constraints** delay high-value deployments in health/finance/legal.\n\nWired recently highlighted the concern that scaling obsession could face sharply diminishing returns and push the industry toward efficiency and algorithmic improvements rather than brute-force growth\u2014i.e., a narrative that can spook capital markets if earnings don\u2019t match infrastructure spend. \ue200cite\ue202turn9news37\ue201\n\n### A serious counter-scenario you need to account for\nEven if frontier progress slows, **diffusion** can keep the boom going: enterprises integrating existing capability into workflows can generate multi-year productivity gains without \u201cnew paradigm\u201d breakthroughs. The enterprise usage metrics above are consistent with that diffusion story. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7search3\ue201\n\nSo: the \u201cboom ends soon\u201d thesis is plausible, but your **timing certainty** (late-term \u2192 2028 shadow) is doing too much work.\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis 4: \u201cNext recession job losses will be huge, and those jobs won\u2019t come back; firms will accept AI friction to cut headcount; next recovery is \u2018jobless\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is *not* crazy\u2014and it has historical support\u2014but you\u2019re overstating determinism.\n\n### Historical evidence that recessions can lock in automation\n- Research on jobless recoveries shows that in the 1991, 2001, and 2009 recessions, **routine jobs accounted for ~89%, 91%, and 94% of job loss**, respectively\u2014suggesting recoveries can be \u201cjobless\u201d in the middle of the skill distribution. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search4\ue201  \n- Work on the Great Recession argues recessions can accelerate **routine-biased technological change** (automation substituting routine work). \ue200cite\ue202turn10search0\ue202turn10search6\ue201  \n\nNow overlay AI:\n- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates ~**60% of jobs in advanced economies** are exposed to AI impacts (some augmented, some substituted). \ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue201  \n\n### The key weakness in your story\nYou treat \u201cjobs won\u2019t come back\u201d as an *aggregate* claim. More defensible is a **composition** claim:\n\n- Many *specific roles* won\u2019t come back (especially routine cognitive workflows),  \n- but the economy may still create new roles\u2014just not for the same people, in the same places, at the same wages, on the same timeline.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 report, for example, forecasts large churn by 2030 (big displacement *and* big creation, net positive overall in their aggregate numbers). \ue200cite\ue202turn8search5\ue201  \n\nSo the hard political problem is less \u201ctotal employment collapses\u201d and more **transition failure**: wage scarring, regional decline, skills mismatch, and a widened capital\u2013labor split.\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis 5: \u201c2028\u20132032 will be tumultuous; inequality widens; unrest deepens; could turn violent; Friedman\u2019s cycle theory holds\u201d\n\n### What you\u2019re getting right\nIf we combine:\n- job polarization dynamics,\n- AI-enabled productivity capture by capital,\n- and high social distrust,\n\nthen \u201cdistributional crisis\u201d is a coherent risk. Your narrative is internally consistent *if* the labor displacement outpaces social adaptation.\n\n### Where you\u2019re leaning too hard on Friedman\nFriedman\u2019s cycle framing (roughly **80-year institutional** and **50-year socioeconomic** cycles) is indeed part of his thesis. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search4\ue202turn6search0\ue201  \nBut cycle theories often have two problems:\n\n1) **Low falsifiability**: almost any turbulence can be fit post hoc.\n2) **Neglect of policy reaction**: democracies don\u2019t passively ride cycles; they change rules when pain becomes acute.\n\nIn other words, the \u201ccycle theory remains intact\u201d claim risks becoming a narrative that filters evidence rather than predicts it.\n\n### A better way to frame 2028\u20132032 risk\nInstead of \u201ccycle says turmoil,\u201d treat it as a **governance stress test**:\n\n- If unemployment/underemployment rises in specific cohorts (white-collar clerical, junior professional services, routine analysts)  \n- while asset owners capture AI rents,  \n- and the state lacks credible redistribution/upskilling mechanisms,  \n\nthen you get instability. Violence is possible, but not inevitable; it depends on institutional response capacity, local political entrepreneurs, and the information environment.\n\n---\n\n## The biggest internal tension across your hypotheses\nYou\u2019re simultaneously asserting:\n\n- **Enterprise adoption will be friction-heavy** (slower, messier), *and*  \n- **firms will still slash headcount aggressively anyway** (fast, decisive).\n\nThese can both be true, but only under one of these conditions:\n\n1) firms find **low-friction substitution zones** (customer support, sales ops, basic coding, internal reporting), and cut there first, or  \n2) recession pressure makes them accept **higher operational risk** temporarily, betting they can \u201cpatch the holes\u201d later.\n\nThe second path is exactly how crises harden structural changes\u2014consistent with the recession/automation literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search0\ue202turn10search4\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## If your story pans out, the key ramifications are *not* the ones people fixate on\nNot \u201crobots take all jobs,\u201d but:\n\n1) **A widening performance gap between firms**: leaders embed AI deeply; laggards don\u2019t. (OpenAI\u2019s report explicitly notes a growing gap between \u201cfrontier firms/workers\u201d and the median.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n2) **A new bargaining regime**: labor\u2019s leverage weakens in routine cognitive work; strengthens in scarce complementary work (domain experts who can supervise/verify; people who own scarce data/process access).\n3) **Compliance becomes a competitive moat**: firms that can prove provenance, auditing, and risk controls will deploy faster in regulated sectors. EU timelines make this concrete. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7news41\ue201  \n4) **Politics shifts from \u201cgrowth vs austerity\u201d to \u201cdistribution and legitimacy\u201d**: who gets the productivity dividend, and who trusts the institutions managing it.\n\n---\n\n## A compact \u201cdashboard\u201d that would falsify or validate your hypotheses (2026\u20132028)\nIf you want to turn this into something testable, watch:\n\n- **Capability economics**: cost per reliable task completion (not benchmark scores). If this plateaus or rises, your \u201cwall\u201d thesis strengthens.  \n- **Agent reliability metrics**: long-horizon execution success rates (not single-turn QA). \ue200cite\ue202turn9search0\ue201  \n- **Enterprise scaling**: share of workflows run through integrated AI systems (not pilots). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7search3\ue201  \n- **Labor composition**: routine cognitive job postings + wage compression patterns. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search4\ue202turn8search14\ue201  \n- **Regulatory enforcement**: EU AI Act enforcement actions and compliance spend. \ue200cite\ue202turn7news42\ue202turn7search0\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you want to keep rolling, the most productive next step is to pick **one** hinge question and force precision. My suggestion: **define what you mean by \u201chit a wall.\u201d** Is it (a) capability plateau, (b) economics plateau, or (c) trust/compliance plateau? The downstream macro and political story changes materially depending on which \u201cwall\u201d you mean.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Related reading (recent)\ue202turn9news35,turn9news37,turn7news42,turn10news34,turn5news31\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search10\ue202turn5search0\ue201","start_idx":342,"end_idx":375,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-inauguration-donald-trump-2025-01-20/","https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-inauguration-donald-trump-2025-01-20/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/","https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Inaugural Address","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1737411234.0,"snippet":"For American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day.

Researchers Neil Thompson, Hans Gundlach, and Jayson Lynch demonstrate that beyond a certain point, increasing model size and computational power does not produce proportional gains in performance. Instead, optimizing model efficiency may drive future breakthroughs, especially in reasoning-focused AI systems. The recent success of efficient models like DeepSeek\u2019s underscores this shift. Despite this, major labs like OpenAI are heavily investing in data center infrastructure, driven by growing demand and strategic independence. Critics, including financial leaders like JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, caution against the economic risks of this infrastructure bubble. The MIT team urges the industry to consider alternative paths, such as developing more efficient algorithms and exploring academic innovations, rather than just scaling compute.

Researchers Neil Thompson, Hans Gundlach, and Jayson Lynch demonstrate that beyond a certain point, increasing model size and computational power does not produce proportional gains in performance. Instead, optimizing model efficiency may drive future breakthroughs, especially in reasoning-focused AI systems. The recent success of efficient models like DeepSeek\u2019s underscores this shift. Despite this, major labs like OpenAI are heavily investing in data center infrastructure, driven by growing demand and strategic independence. Critics, including financial leaders like JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, caution against the economic risks of this infrastructure bubble. The MIT team urges the industry to consider alternative paths, such as developing more efficient algorithms and exploring academic innovations, rather than just scaling compute. Their analysis suggests that the dominance of large AI companies could wane as efficiency gains level the playing field.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WIRED"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7search3\ue201","start_idx":6495,"end_idx":6525,"safe_urls":["https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI CDN](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"","url":"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"The State of AI: Global Survey 2025","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"5 Nov 2025 \u2014 Our latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies.Read more","attribution":"McKinsey & Company"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI CDN"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn10search4\ue201","start_idx":7216,"end_idx":7236,"safe_urls":["https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18334/w18334.pdf","https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18334/w18334.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18334/w18334.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Job Polarization and Jobless Recoveries","url":"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18334/w18334.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1543606926.0,"snippet":"by N Jaimovich \u00b7 2012 \u00b7 Cited by 553 \u2014 In the 1991, 2001, and 2009 recessions, routine jobs account for 89%,. 91%, and 94% of all job loss, respectively.
