This will cause issues when performing data analysis, as the entries will be treated as different categories. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Convert all entries to lowercase.\r\n\r\n- `Temperature Sensor (\u00b0C)` column:\r\n  - **Problem**: Has entries outside the expected range of 10\u201350\u00b0C as well as null entries. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Remove entries outside the expected range as well as the null entries.\r\n\r\n- `Humidity Sensor (%)` column: \r\n  - **Problem**: Has null entries, but removing all of them would eliminate too much data. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Perform linear regression to predict the missing values based on the other features.\r\n  - **Data leakage**: In machine learning, this method will introduce data leakage if the linear regression is performed on the entire dataset. For the purpose of the EDA, this is immaterial as we are examining the dataset as a whole without performing prediction tasks. However, when performing machine learning tasks, the linear regression will be performed on the training set only, and the model will then be used to predict the missing values in the test set. This prevents data leakage when training the model.\r\n\r\n- `Light Intensity Sensor (lux)` column:\r\n  - **Problem**: Has entries outside the expected range of 0\u2013100,000 lux as well as null entries. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Remove entries outside the expected range as well as the null entries.\r\n\r\n- `EC Sensor (dS/m)` column:\r\n  - **Problem**: Has entries outside the expected range of 0.1\u20135.0 dS/m. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Remove entries outside the expected range.\r\n\r\n- `Nutrient N Sensor (ppm)`, `Nutrient P Sensor (ppm)`, `Nutrient K Sensor (ppm)` columns:\r\n  - **Problem**: Have null entries. Some entries are hard-coded with the string `None`. Some entries are recorded as integer values, but others are recorded as strings with the letters `ppm` appended at the end. These inconsistencies will cause issues when performing data analysis. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Remove null entries, remove entries hard-coded as `None`, remove the string `ppm` from the entries, and convert all entries to integers.\r\n\r\n- `Water Level Sensor (mm)` column:\r\n  - **Problem**: Has null entries. \r\n  - **Remedy**: Remove null entries.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each attribute, discard the description and the expected range, and insert a column summarizing the remedial steps taken."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8ec955e99b994709-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0c16751b-065b-4298-82fc-ac30cc3de104","children":["17d26b6c-a367-4cd0-b247-59e7f363bf73"]},"17d26b6c-a367-4cd0-b247-59e7f363bf73":{"id":"17d26b6c-a367-4cd0-b247-59e7f363bf73","message":{"id":"17d26b6c-a367-4cd0-b247-59e7f363bf73","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1733289511.618056,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa2d387-d351-431f-9f69-9596642c35fe","request_id":"8ec955e99b994709-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2d387-d351-431f-9f69-9596642c35fe","children":["917821f3-7082-441f-bc39-dfb5667cff08"]},"917821f3-7082-441f-bc39-dfb5667cff08":{"id":"917821f3-7082-441f-bc39-dfb5667cff08","message":{"id":"917821f3-7082-441f-bc39-dfb5667cff08","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1733289511.618226,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["```markdown\n\n| Attribute                | Remedial Steps Taken                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| System Location Code     | No anomalies detected.                                                                                    |\n| Previous Cycle Plant Type| No anomalies detected.                                                                                    |\n| Plant Type               | Convert all entries to lowercase to ensure consistency.                                                   |\n| Plant Stage              | Convert all entries to lowercase to ensure consistency.                                                   |\n| Temperature Sensor (\u00b0C)  | Remove entries outside the range of 10\u201350\u00b0C and null entries.                                             |\n| Humidity Sensor (%)      | Use linear regression to predict missing values based on other features.                                  |\n| Light Intensity Sensor (lux)| Remove entries outside the range of 0\u2013100,000 lux and null entries.                                   |\n| CO2 Sensor (ppm)         | No anomalies detected.                                                                                    |\n| EC Sensor (dS/m)         | Remove entries outside the range of 0.1\u20135.0 dS/m.                                                         |\n| O2 Sensor (ppm)          | No anomalies detected.                                                                                    |\n| Nutrient N Sensor (ppm)  | Remove null entries, remove entries hard-coded as `None`, strip `ppm` from entries, and convert to integers. |\n| Nutrient P Sensor (ppm)  | Remove null entries, remove entries hard-coded as `None`, strip `ppm` from entries, and convert to integers. |\n| Nutrient K Sensor (ppm)  | Remove null entries, remove entries hard-coded as `None`, strip `ppm` from entries, and convert to integers. |\n| pH Sensor                | No anomalies detected.                                                                                    |\n| Water Level Sensor (mm)  | Remove null entries.                                                                                      |\n\n```"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"17d26b6c-a367-4cd0-b247-59e7f363bf73","request_id":"8ec955e99b994709-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"17d26b6c-a367-4cd0-b247-59e7f363bf73","children":[]}}}
