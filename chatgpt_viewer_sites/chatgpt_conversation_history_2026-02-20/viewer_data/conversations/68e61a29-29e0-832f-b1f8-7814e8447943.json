security policies. The users reportedly sought proposals for social media surveillance tools, which OpenAI considered a misuse of its generative AI. The company\u2019s public threat report also states that Chinese-language accounts used ChatGPT to support phishing and malware operations and explored further automation through China\u2019s DeepSeek platform.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI took action against accounts tied to Russian-speaking criminal groups who used the AI model to develop malware. Since beginning public threat reporting in February of the previous year, the company has disrupted over 40 malicious networks. OpenAI emphasized that its models did not provide new offensive capabilities to threat actors.\n\nThe report highlights growing safety concerns amid increasing U.S.-China technological rivalry. Despite the controversy, OpenAI now boasts over 800 million weekly ChatGPT users and recently reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale. The Chinese embassy in the U.S. has not commented on the situation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1759837823.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/u-s-commerce-sec-lutnick-says-american-ai-dominates-deepseek-thanks-trump-for-ai-action-plan-openai-and-anthropic-beat-chinese-models-across-19-different-benchmarks","title":"U.S. Commerce Sec.

These tests evaluated various domains such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning, general knowledge, and security resilience. Notably, DeepSeek models underperformed in cyber and software engineering tasks and were more vulnerable to hijacking and jailbreaking, raising national security concerns.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited President Donald Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan, which supports domestic AI infrastructure, for securing American leadership in AI. The study also criticized Chinese AI models for exhibiting biased behavior and alignment with Chinese government messaging. Though DeepSeek's new V3.2 model was not included in the tests, its ongoing adoption prompts caution, with CAISI warning of risks to consumers, developers, and U.S. national interests. Additionally, U.S. models were found to be 35% more cost-efficient than Chinese ones.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the strategic importance of maintaining leadership in AI technology and the potential security implications of relying on foreign AI systems.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1759405628.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/03/ai-deepseek-alarm","title":"AI standards institute sounds alarm over DeepSeek","snippet":"A recent report from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) issued a warning about China's DeepSeek AI models, citing national security risks.

NIST\u2019s summary page says DeepSeek \u201clags\u201d U.S. models in *performance, cost, security, and adoption* and raises national-security concerns. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Technical details (from the PDF).** CAISI compared **DeepSeek R1, R1-0528, and V3.1** against **OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, gpt-oss**, and **Anthropic Opus 4** on **19 benchmarks** drawn from public and CAISI-built private tests. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201\n- **Press framing.** U.S. coverage amplified the message: Axios called it the first comprehensive federal comparison and quoted \u201cHuawei on steroids.\u201d Some outlets (e.g., Tom\u2019s Hardware) asserted U.S. models beat DeepSeek on *19 benchmarks* and were more cost-efficient. (Note: those specific cost and \u201c19/19\u201d claims are in media summaries, not clearly verifiable on NIST\u2019s landing page.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news33\ue201\n\n# Strengths of the report\n- **Government-backed, reproducible venue.** NIST/CAISI doing the work is significant; they are setting evaluation norms and feeding policy. Even if you distrust the politics, it\u2019s a serious signal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n- **Security emphasis.** The report foregrounds jailbreak/agent-hijack susceptibility and censorship/propaganda risks\u2014areas the field often hand-waves. That\u2019s valuable, especially for procurement and gov use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n# Where to be skeptical (method and incentives)\n1. **Version selection bias.** CAISI tested **R1, R1-0528, V3.1**; newer DeepSeek iterations (e.g., **V3.2**) are referenced in media as *not* included. If U.S. baselines (GPT-5/Opus 4) are fully current but PRC baselines lag a rev, the comparison skews. Ask for a strict **model-snapshot date** policy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue201  \n2. **Opaque \u201cprivate\u201d benchmarks.** The PDF states a mix of public and **private CAISI benchmarks** built with partners. Without released items, task distributions, and **per-domain weighting**, it\u2019s hard to audit construct validity (what exactly is being measured) and reproducibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n3. **Language/domain coverage.** Most U.S. evals are English-centric. For a Chinese model with strong non-English usage, an English-heavy suite underestimates real-world capability. Require **multilingual** (incl. Chinese) reasoning, safety, and tool-use tests. (Contrast with broader analyses noting DeepSeek\u2019s disruptive potential.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n4. **Cost claims need apples-to-apples accounting.** Media summaries claim U.S. models are more cost-efficient. Unless CAISI normalizes **context length, decoding params, tool-use, and cloud pricing regions**, cost comparisons are fragile. I don\u2019t see those controls documented on the summary page; if they\u2019re only in the private appendix, that\u2019s a problem. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n5. **Security comparisons can penalize openness.** Open-weight / permissive models are inherently easier to red-team at scale (and to fine-tune around safety). If DeepSeek variants are more open than U.S. commercial models, higher jailbreak rates may reflect **deployment posture** rather than core model risk. CAISI should stratify by **open- vs closed-weight** status. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n6. **Adoption as a metric is parochial.** U.S./EU enterprise adoption is influenced by compliance, sanctions, and vendor access, not just capability. Treat adoption as *policy/market* signal, not technical performance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n7. **Geopolitical incentives.** This report lands amid U.S. narratives that both warn about PRC tech and simultaneously reassure domestic leadership. That dual aim can color framing (\u201cnational security threat\u201d + \u201cstill behind\u201d). Balance with neutral/independent takes (Nature, Stanford HAI, CSET, EU briefs) showing DeepSeek\u2019s disruptive cost/performance profile and talent dynamics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n# What independent evidence says about DeepSeek\n- **Impact & cost disruption.** Multiple non-government sources note **R1** catalyzed a re-think of compute needs and costs (e.g., \u201cshoestring\u201d development; lower hardware reliance). Even if headline benchmarks trail, the *price-performance frontier* matters strategically. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- **Strategic concern is real.** U.S. policy shops (CSET/CSIS) flagged R1\u2019s implications for export controls and talent well before CAISI\u2019s report\u2014evidence that the worry isn\u2019t invented post-hoc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n# My verdict\n- **Technically**: CAISI likely finds real gaps\u2014especially **safety hardening** and some **reasoning/coding** tasks\u2014vs top U.S. models. Take those signals seriously for high-assurance use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- **Methodologically**: The evaluation has **replicability and comparability holes** (version skew, private tests, unclear cost normalization, English bias). Treat \u201cacross 19 benchmarks\u201d headlines with caution until item pools and weights are public. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0news33\ue201  \n- **Strategically**: Even if DeepSeek is *currently behind* on CAISI\u2019s chosen metrics, its **cost structure, talent base, and open-weight posture** remain strategically disruptive. Underestimating it because a U.S. report says \u201cbehind\u201d would be a mistake. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n# If you want a fairer re-test, here\u2019s the minimum bar\n1. **Freeze dates and versions** for *both* U.S. and PRC models; publish model cards + decoding params. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n2. **Publish all benchmark items** (or at least full schemas, sampling rules, and weights); separate **public** from **proprietary** scores. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n3. **Multilingual battery** (zh-CN/EN parity) for reasoning, coding, safety, tool-use/agents, retrieval-augmented tasks, and function calling.

These tests evaluated various domains such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning, general knowledge, and security resilience. Notably, DeepSeek models underperformed in cyber and software engineering tasks and were more vulnerable to hijacking and jailbreaking, raising national security concerns.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited President Donald Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan, which supports domestic AI infrastructure, for securing American leadership in AI.
