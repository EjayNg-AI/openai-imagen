Model structure on\u202f`Top`** | Re\u2011defines Quillen\u2019s classes for the category of all spaces:  *F*\u00a0=\u00a0Hurewicz fibrations,  *C*\u00a0=\u00a0closed cofibrations,  *W*\u00a0=\u00a0ordinary homotopy equivalences.  Shows these satisfy Quillen\u2019s axioms **M0\u2013M6**, so \u3008Top;\u202fF,C,W\u3009 is a **closed model category** \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 | *Proposition\u202f1* gives the necessary lifting relations (LLP/RLP).  *Proposition\u202f2* constructs **functorial factorizations** \\(f = pi = p'i'\\) where one factor is a (acyclic) cofibration and the other a (acyclic) fibration.  *Theorem\u202f3* records the final verification of the axioms. |\n| **2.  Auxiliary lemmas** | Develops point\u2011set tools (product theorem for cofibrations, behaviour under pullback, etc.) needed later \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 | Lemma\u202f4 (product with a compact space preserves cofibrations), Lemma\u202f6 (fibres of fibrations over well\u2011pointed bases are well\u2011pointed). |\n| **3.  Pointed variant (`Top\u1d42`)** | Restricts to well\u2011pointed spaces (base point inclusion is a closed cofibration).  Shows that **pointed fibrations/cofibrations/homotopy equivalences coincide with their \u201cfree\u201d analogues** and that `Top\u1d42` again satisfies axioms **M1\u2013M6** \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 | *Propositions\u202f9\u202f&\u202f10* identify cofibration\u00a0\u21c6\u00a0free\u2011cofibration and fibration\u00a0\u21c6\u00a0free\u2011fibration.  *Theorem\u202f11* gives the model structure on `Top\u1d42`.  A \u201csmash\u2011product theorem\u201d (Prop.\u202f12) illustrates stability under \u2227. |\n\n**Significance.**  Str\u00f8m proves that by working with *classical* notions (Hurewicz fibrations and ordinary homotopy equivalence) one still obtains a Quillen model structure whose homotopy category is exactly the **classical homotopy category** \\(h\\text{Top}\\).  This bridges abstract model\u2011category theory with the hands\u2011on tools used by algebraic topologists and provides a basis for doing homotopy theory without invoking weak (Serre) notions.  The pointed version extends these advantages to constructions such as smash products and loop\u2013suspension adjunctions.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u202f\u202fAfework Solomon\u2019s critique in **\u201cA Note on\u202f\u2018The\u00a0Homotopy Category is a Homotopy Category\u2019\u201d** (J.\u202fMath.\u202f&\u202fStat.\u00a015\u202f(2019)\u202f201\u2011207)\n\nSolomon praises Str\u00f8m\u2019s elegance but argues that **Quillen\u2019s framework, even in Str\u00f8m\u2019s refined form, omits essential parts of classical homotopy theory.**  His criticism has two pillars:\n\n| Theme | Core argument | Representative evidence |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| **(A)  Weak fibrations & weak cofibrations are invisible to the model structure** | The classes *G* (weak fibrations) and *D* (weak cofibrations) are central to gluing, \u201cWCHP\u201d, and other classical results, yet they **cannot be incorporated** into any Quillen model structure on `Top`. | *Example\u00a03.1* adapts the map \\(p:I\\times(0,1]\\to I\\) (a *weak* fibration) and shows it **fails Quillen\u2019s lifting axiom MC4**, so no model structure can treat weak fibrations as fibrations \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201.  Consequently Brown\u2013Heath cogluing and the gluing theorem for weak homotopy equivalences escape the axiomatic net. |\n| **(B)  Self\u2011duality of model\u2011category axioms mis\u2011represents classical duality** | Quillen\u2019s axioms are *automatically self\u2011dual* (swap \u201ccofibration\u201d\u21c4\u201cfibration\u201d, \u201cpushout\u201d\u21c4\u201cpullback\u201d).  Classical homotopy theory is *not*\u2014many theorems have no dual, or the dual is false or needs a different proof.  Therefore the model structure cannot \u201csee\u201d these asymmetric phenomena. | Solomon lists six families of examples (Section\u202f4):<br>\u2022\u202fStr\u00f8m\u2019s **pull\u2011back theorem** for cofibrations has a false dual for fibrations (Example\u00a04.4).<br>\u2022\u202fStr\u00f8m\u2019s **cancellation theorem** (cofibration version) fails dually (Example\u00a04.6).<br>\u2022\u202fMather\u2019s *cube theorem* dual fails (Example\u00a04.7).<br>\u2022\u202fEven elementary facts (a cofibration is injective, but a fibration need not be surjective) break symmetry (Example\u00a04.3). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201 |\n\n**Implications of Solomon\u2019s analysis**\n\n1. **Incompleteness** \u2013 Important constructions (weak fibrations, weak cofibrations) and results (gluing/cogluing, Dold\u2011Lashof theory, Eckmann\u2013Hilton duality failures) cannot be recovered from the model\u2011category axioms alone.\n\n2. **Loss of nuance** \u2013 The forced self\u2011duality in the axioms obscures the *genuine* asymmetry present in topological phenomena; proofs that rely on point\u2011set subtleties or ad\u2011hoc decompositions have no formal counterpart in the abstract setting.\n\n3. **Properness issues** \u2013 Solomon points to Rezk\u2019s examples of model categories that are right\u2011 but not left\u2011proper (and vice\u2011versa) to illustrate that symmetry is not generic; `Top` happens to be proper both ways under Str\u00f8m\u2019s classes, but this is exceptional rather than inevitable.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fBalanced assessment\n\n| Aspect | Strength captured by Str\u00f8m/Quillen | Elements highlighted by Solomon as missing |\n|--------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Formal calculus** | Factorization, lifting, and homotopy localisation are elegantly packaged; many classical results (e.g., Whitehead theorem) become abstract corollaries. | The theory ignores *weak* notions that are indispensable for, e.g., gluing arguments, approximation theorems, and certain bundle constructions. |\n| **Computational tools** | Small\u2011object argument, cylinder & path\u2011object methods are standardised. | Several key lemmata (product theorem for cofibrations, cancellation, pull\u2011back in the weak sense) lie outside the axioms or break self\u2011duality. |\n| **Conceptual clarity** | Identifies minimal axioms needed to invert weak equivalences and do derived functors. | Risks *over\u2011idealising*: automatic duals in the abstract theory contradict genuinely one\u2011sided truths in `Top`. |\n\n---\n\n### 4\u202f\u202fTake\u2011away for practitioners\n\n* Str\u00f8m\u2019s paper remains **foundational**: it secures a robust, classical model structure for spaces and justifies the routine use of Quillen homotopy machinery in everyday topology.\n* Solomon\u2019s critique is a **cautionary reminder**: when one works exclusively inside the model\u2011categorical language, be aware that certain pathologies, one\u2011sided theorems, and \u201cweak\u201d constructions may be invisible, and separate arguments (often point\u2011set\u2011topological) are still required.\n* For research that **needs weak fibrations/cofibrations or relies on non\u2011dual statements**, one must step outside the Quillen axioms\u2014perhaps to more flexible frameworks (e.g., Waldhausen categories, \u221e\u2011categories with explicit parametrised homotopy) or to bespoke point\u2011set proofs.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u202f\u202fFurther directions\n\n1. **Enhanced model structures** \u2013 Investigate mixed or *partial* model structures where weak fibrations are allowed but MC4 is replaced by a weaker \u201clifting up to fibre\u2011wise homotopy\u201d.\n2. **\u221e\u2011categorical replacements** \u2013 In an \u221e\u2011topos, duality is not forced; one can encode asymmetric conditions more faithfully.\n3. **Properness\u2011sensitive frameworks** \u2013 Develop techniques that keep track of failures of left/right properness, accommodating Solomon\u2019s examples within controlled settings.\n\nStr\u00f8m gives us the *skeleton*; Solomon reminds us not to forget the *flesh*."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":516,"end_ix":537,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Strom_HomotopyCategory.pdf","id":"file-1Wi6RG4yPsfBzyoqUVc4wv","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":8,"cited_message_id":"b603b71b-b283-44b4-a451-8de4eed6700f","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":957,"end_ix":978,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Strom_HomotopyCategory.pdf","id":"file-1Wi6RG4yPsfBzyoqUVc4wv","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":8,"cited_message_id":"b603b71b-b283-44b4-a451-8de4eed6700f","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1393,"end_ix":1414,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Strom_HomotopyCategory.pdf","id":"file-1Wi6RG4yPsfBzyoqUVc4wv","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":8,"cited_message_id":"b603b71b-b283-44b4-a451-8de4eed6700f","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":3113,"end_ix":3134,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"jmssp.2019.201.207.pdf","id":"file-Pmj9qwDesf8w8oTDDaxfut","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":1,"cited_message_idx":9,"cited_message_id":"eb3e6f07-3919-4961-a90d-8bbe2396fc2b","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":4047,"end_ix":4068,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"jmssp.2019.201.207.pdf","id":"file-Pmj9qwDesf8w8oTDDaxfut","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":1,"cited_message_idx":9,"cited_message_id":"eb3e6f07-3919-4961-a90d-8bbe2396fc2b","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":516,"end_idx":537,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Strom_HomotopyCategory.pdf","id":"file-1Wi6RG4yPsfBzyoqUVc4wv","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"b603b71b-b283-44b4-a451-8de4eed6700f","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":957,"end_idx":978,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Strom_HomotopyCategory.pdf","id":"file-1Wi6RG4yPsfBzyoqUVc4wv","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"b603b71b-b283-44b4-a451-8de4eed6700f","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":1393,"end_idx":1414,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Strom_HomotopyCategory.pdf","id":"file-1Wi6RG4yPsfBzyoqUVc4wv","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"b603b71b-b283-44b4-a451-8de4eed6700f","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201","start_idx":3113,"end_idx":3134,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"jmssp.2019.201.207.pdf","id":"file-Pmj9qwDesf8w8oTDDaxfut","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"eb3e6f07-3919-4961-a90d-8bbe2396fc2b","file_index":1,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201","start_idx":4047,"end_idx":4068,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"jmssp.2019.201.207.pdf","id":"file-Pmj9qwDesf8w8oTDDaxfut","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"eb3e6f07-3919-4961-a90d-8bbe2396fc2b","file_index":1,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-pro","default_model_slug":"o3-pro","parent_id":"97ffd42d-3ebd-4f6a-a96a-893b3d6d06ca","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"97ffd42d-3ebd-4f6a-a96a-893b3d6d06ca","children":["87727b4d-0882-4325-9dc9-250e424ee80c"]},"87727b4d-0882-4325-9dc9-250e424ee80c":{"id":"87727b4d-0882-4325-9dc9-250e424ee80c","message":{"id":"87727b4d-0882-4325-9dc9-250e424ee80c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752369284.211,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Investigate into what research has been done into creating abstract model categories that enhances Quillen's original version so that the weaknesses mentioned by Solomon are addressed.

The constructions listed above let you **re\u2011inject those missing features** without throwing away the homotopical toolkit:\n\n* **Keep Quillen when you only need homotopy localisation.**  \n* **Switch to Brown/Waldhausen/etc. when theorems involve weak fibrations/cofibrations or rely on asymmetric point\u2011set arguments.**  \n* **Escalate to \u221e\u2011categorical language when you want *all* of homotopy theory, with no artificial symmetry, once and for all.**\n\nIn practice most algebraic topologists move **fluidly between these levels**\u2014proving a delicate gluing lemma inside a Brown category, then pushing the result through a Quillen equivalence to a stable \u221e\u2011categorical computation\u2014so having the whole toolkit ready is the best way to \u201ccapture the intricacies\u201d that Quillen\u2019s original axioms leave out."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201","start_idx":574,"end_idx":595,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":1180,"end_idx":1212,"safe_urls":["https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category%2Bof%2Bfibrant%2Bobjects?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/scan/1973.0186.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Pi Math Cornell](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/scan/1973.0186.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [NCAT Lab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category%2Bof%2Bfibrant%2Bobjects?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Volume 186, December 1973","url":"https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/scan/1973.0186.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"We will call C a category of fibrant objects for a homotopy theory (or simply a category of fibrant objects) if the following axioms are satisfied.

A model category is a category K together with three \r\ndistingxtished classes of morphisms in K: F (\"fibrations\"), C (\"cofibrations\"), and \r\nW (\"weak equivalences\"). These classes are required to satisfy axioms M0--M5 of [4]. \r\nA closed model category is a model category satisfying the extra axiom M6 (see [4] \r\nfor the statement of the axioms M0--M6). \r\nTo each model category K one can associate a category Ho K called the homotopy \r\ncategory of K. Essentially, HoK is obtained by turning the morphisms in W into \r\nisomorphisms. \r\nIt is shown in [4] that the category of topological spaces is a closed model category \r\nff one puts F---- (Serre fibrations) and IV = (weak homotopy equivalences}, and \r\ntakes C to be the class of all maps having a certain lifting property. \r\nFrom an aesthetical point of view, however, it would be nicer to work with ordinary \r\n(Hurewicz) fibrations, cofibrations and homotopy equivalences. The corresponding \r\nhomotopy category would then be the ordinary homotopy category of topological \r\nspaces, i.e. the objects would be all topological spaces and the morphisms would be \r\nall homotopy classes of continuous maps. \r\nIn the first section of this paper we prove that this is indeed feasible, and in the \r\nlast section we consider the case of spaces with base points. \r\n1. The model category structure of Top. Let Top be the category of topolo~cal spaces \r\nand continuous maps. By fibrations (eofibrations) we shall mean maps having the \r\nhomotopy lifting (extension) property with respect to all spaces. \r\nLet F = (fibrations), C = (closed cofibrations), and IV----(homotopy equiva\u0002lences). \r\nIf i: A --> X and p: E --> B are morphisms in Top, we shall say that i has the \r\nle/t lilting property (LLP) with respect to p, and that p has the right lilting property \r\n(RLP) with respect to i, if every commutative square of the form \r\nA ~E \r\nX )B \r\nin Top admits a diagonal X--> E. \r\n28* ","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 1 / 7>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-MdbrfZD9r9DFbLFU51auDT","size_bytes":146941,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 7>","436 A.

In this study, we show by examples that Quillen\u2019s \r\nmodel structure on Top fails to capture some of the subtleties of classical \r\nhomotopy theory and also, we show that the whole of classical homo\u0002topy theory cannot be retrieved from the axiomatic approach of Quillen. \r\nThus, we show that model category is an incomplete model of classical \r\nhomotopy theory.\r\nKeywords: Fibration, Cofibratios, Homotopy Category, Weak Cofibrations \r\nand Fibrations, Quillen\u2019s Model Structure on Top\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn his paper \u201cThe Homotopy Category is a Homotopy \r\nCategory\u201d (Str\u00f8m, 1972), Arne Str\u00f8m\u2019s in-tent is to \r\nshow that the Homotopy Category hTop of topological \r\nspaces is a homotopy category in the sense of Quillen.\r\nWhat he shows (and what he tells us he means) is that if \r\nQuillen\u2019s fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences \r\nare taken to be ordinary fibrations, closed cofibrations \r\nand homotopy equivalences in hTop, then the objects of \r\nQuillen\u2019s homotopy category H0(Top) has as its objects \r\nall topological spaces and as its morphisms all homotopy \r\nclasses of continuous maps.\r\nPeter May commenting on the importance of the \r\nnotion of weak fibration in the sense of Dold, says that \r\nhe does not know if it has a model theoretic role to play \r\n(May and Sigurdsson, 2006, Page 62). In view of the \r\nstated importance of this notion and the corresponding \r\nnotion of weak cofibration we subsume his question \r\ninto the larger one which asks \u201cDoes the model \r\nstructure H0(Top) on Top faithfully reflect the richness \r\nof the structure of hTop?\u201d Or putting this in a slightly \r\ndifferent way, is the homotopy category H0(Top) the \r\nsame as the classical homotopy category hTop?\r\nWe answer May\u2019s question in the negative, \r\nshowing the notion of weak fibration does not satisfy \r\none of the fundamental axioms of model category \r\ntheory. We also answer the larger question in the \r\nnegative by showing that many of the classical results \r\nin hTop cannot be proved within the framework of the \r\nmodel structure on Top. So apart from the fact that the \r\nmodel structure excludes the whole of weak fibration \r\nand weak cofibration theory, the other main hurdle, \r\nwhich is present even when we consider the stronger \r\nnotions of Hurewicz fibrations and closed Hurewicz \r\ncofibrations, has to do with duality. In particular in \r\nany model category and in particular in H0(Top), any \r\nstatement involving fibrations and cofibrations that is \r\nprovable from the axioms of a model category has a \r\nvalid automatic dual which, moreover is automatically \r\nprovable by the dual proof. We show this is not the \r\ncase with respect to some of the classical results on \r\nfibrations and cofibrations in hTop when we consider \r\nthe corresponding duality principle known as the \r\nEckmann-Hilton duality in classical homotopy theory.\r\nIn this study we point out two things that are \r\nmissing from hTop if we only look at its model \r\nstructure. The first has to do with duality. It is only \r\npossible, using the model structure to replicate results \r\nfor which both the result itself and the proof are self \r\ndual and that is only possible as long as the result is \r\nprovable from the axioms of a model category. We \r\nexhibit results from classical homotopy theory whose \r\nduals are not true and hence cannot be proved within \r\nthe framework of a model category. We show in \r\nparticular that two of Str\u00f8m\u2019s theorems, the pullback \r\ntheorem and the cancellation theorem (see examples 4.4 \r\nand 4.6) are not dualizable and so cannot be proved \r\nwithin the model category structure on hTop. We also \r\nprovide examples of results from classical homotopy \r\ntheory where the duals are true but require separate \r\nproofs that are not self dual. We provide examples of \r\nboth cases in section four.

We show that \r\nthe category Top fails to admit a Quillen model structure \r\nwith respect to weak cofibrations and weak fibrations \r\nand so consequently we would loose the full generality \r\nof the gluing and cogluing theorems which have been \r\nproved for weak fibrations and cofibrations. Because of \r\nthis and some other things that we discuss in this study, \r\nthere is a real sense in which the homotopy category is \r\nnot a homotopy category. What we are saying is that we \r\ncannot retrieve the whole of classical homotopy theory \r\nfrom Quillen\u2019s model category theory and that there are \r\nlimitations to the theory.\r\nThis paper is divided into four main parts. The first \r\npart, section 2, sets forth the model category \r\ndefinitions and other topological definitions that are \r\npertinent to the latter sections. Section 3 constitutes \r\nthe second part and here we give an example of a \r\nweak fibration that does not have the homotopy \r\ncovering property. That is, axiom MC4 of Quillen is \r\nnot applicable to weak fibrations. Here is where we \r\nanswer May\u2019s question in the negative. Section 4 \r\nconstitutes the third part and here we give examples \r\nfrom classical homotopy theory whose duals are not \r\ntrue in general and hence cannot be proved in a model \r\ncategorical framework as well as examples of results \r\nwhose duals are true but the proofs are not self dual.\r\nThe author would like to express his sincere thanks \r\nto Phil Heath for his helpful suggestions and \r\ncomments pertaining to this paper.\r\nPreliminaries\r\nThe definition below is originally due to Quillen \r\n(1967).

Other useful sources of \r\nmodel categories are (Hirschhorn, 2003; Hovey 1999;\r\nMay and Ponto, 2012).\r\nDefinition 2.1\r\nA Model Category is a category with three \r\ndistinguished classes of maps called weak equivalences, \r\ndenoted by, fibrations and cofibrations each of which is \r\nclosed under composition and contains all identity maps.\r\nA map which is a fibration and and a weak \r\nequivalence is called an acyclic fibration. A map which \r\nis a cofibration and a weak equivalence is called an \r\nacyclic cofibration. We require the following axioms:\r\nMC1 (Limit Axiom): Finite limits and colimits exist.\r\nMC2 (Two out of three axiom): If f and g are maps in M\r\nsuch that gf is defined and two of f, g and gf are \r\nweak equivalences, so is the third.\r\nMC3 (Retract Axiom): If f and g are maps in M such \r\nthat f is a retract of g and g is a weak equivalence, \r\na fibration, or a cofibration, then so is f.\r\nMC4 (Lifting Axiom): Given the commutative solid \r\narrow diagram in M as shown below:\r\nthe dotted arrow exists if either i is a cofibration \r\nand p is an acyclic fibration or, i is an acyclic \r\ncofibration and p is a fibration.\r\nMC5 (Factorization Axiom): Any map f can be factored \r\nin two ways: f = pi, i is a cofibration and p is an \r\nacyclic fibration and f = pi, i is an acyclic \r\ncofibration and p is a fibration.\r\nDefinition 2.2: Let M be a Model category\r\na. The Model category M will be called right proper if \r\nevery pullback of a weak equiv-alence along a \r\nfibration is a weak equivalence. That is, if for each \r\npullback square in M of the form:\r\nin which h is a fibration and f is a weak equivalence, \r\nthen the morphism g is a weak equivalence\r\nb. The Model category M will be called left proper if \r\nevery pushout of a weak equivalence along a \r\ncofibration is a weak equivalence. That is, if for \r\neach pushout square in M of the form:\r\nin which i is a cofibration and f is a weak \r\nequivalence, the morphism g is a weak equivalence.\r\nWe will also be needing the dual notions of pushouts \r\nand pullbacks in the category of topological spaces and \r\ncontinuous maps. We will denote the pullback of \r\n\uf029\r\nf p X B E \uf0be\uf0be\uf0ae \uf0ac\uf0be\uf0be\r\nby X\uf0d5E = {(x,e)|f(x) = p(e)} as the \r\nsubspace of X\u00d7E\r\nDually, the pushout of the diagram\r\nf g X A Y \uf0ac\uf0be\uf0be \uf0be\uf0be\uf0ae\r\nin Top, denoted by\r\nX Y f g\r\nis the quotient set \r\nX Y/\r\nwhere \u223c is the equivalence relation generated \r\nby f(a)\u223cg(a) for all a \u2208 A.

We give the definitions below.\r\nDefinition 2.3\r\nA Hurewicz cofibration(also known as h-cofibration) \r\nis a map j: A\uf0aeX such that for any map f: X\uf0aeZ (Z \r\narbitrary) and any homotopy G: A\uf0b4I\uf0aeZ such that G(a, \r\n0) = fj(a) for all a\uf0ceA, there exists a non-unique map F: \r\nX\uf0b4I\uf0aeZ such that F (j\uf0b41) = G and F(x, 0) = f (x). That is, \r\nthere exists a map f represented by the dotted arrow \r\nmaking the following diagram commutative.\r\nWe say a Hurewicz cofibration j: A\uf0aeX is a closed \r\ncofibration if j(A) is closed in X. However, in the \r\ncategory of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, there \r\nis no need in defining \u201cclosed\u201d cofibration since closure \r\nis automatic.\r\nDefinition 2.4\r\nA map p: E\u2192B is said to be a Hueriwicz fibration(h\u0002fibration in short), if for all topological spaces Z and \r\nevery map f: Z\u2192E and homotopy G: Z\u00d7I\u2192B of pf, there \r\nis a homotopy H: Z\u00d7I \u2192 E with H(\u2212, 0) = f and pH = G. \r\nThat is, for every commutative diagram below, where\r\ni0(z) = (z, 0):\r\nthere exists a map H: Z \u00d7 I \u2192 E such that the resulting \r\ntriangles commute. That is, pH = G and Hi0 = f.\r\nDefinition 2.5\r\nA map f: X\u2192Y is a weak equivalence(or weak \r\nhomotopy equivalence) if f induces a bijection [K,\r\nX]\u2192[K, Y] for all CW complexes K. (Note: [K, X] \r\ndenotes the homotopy class of all continuous \r\nfunctions K\u2192X).\r\nThe notion of a weak(Dold) fibration plays an \r\nimportant role in the theory of fibrations. We first discuss \r\nthe notion of Weak Right Lifting Property (WRLP) which \r\nis a prelude to the definition of a Dold fibration.\r\nDefinition 2.6\r\nA map p: E\u2192B has the Weak Right Lifting Property\r\n(WRLP) with respect to a map i: A\u2192X, if for every \r\ncommutative square\r\nin Top there exists a map h: X\u2192E such that p o h = g and\r\nP\r\nhoi f \uf02d (i.e., there exists a homotopy H from h o i to f\r\nsuch that pH(a, t) = pH(a, 0) for all (a, t) \u2208 A\u00d7I. In short \r\na fiber homotopy from h o i to f.\r\nDefinition 2.7\r\nA continuous function p: E\u2192B is a weak(Dold) \r\nfibration if p has the Weak Covering Homotopy Property \r\n(WCHP) for all topological spaces X. That is, if for every \r\ncommutative diagram, that is, pf = Hi0:\r\nthere exists a homotopy G: X\u00d7I\u2192E such that p o G = H \r\nand \r\nGio f\r\np\r\n(Dieck et al., 1970 for further details).\r\nDefinition 2.8\r\nA continuous function i: A\u2192X is called a weak \r\ncofibration if i has the Homotopy Extension Property \r\n(HEP) up to homotopy for all topological spaces Y .

That is, \r\nconsider the following diagram in a model category M.\r\nwhere, QEY B and PDXA are respectively the pullbacks \r\nof the front and back faces of the diagram. Suppose that p\r\nand q are fibrations and \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are weak equivalences, \r\nwhere A,X,B and Y are fibrant, then \u03b4 is a weak \r\nequivalence. We will show that the more general theorem \r\nwhere fibrations are replaced by weak fibrations cannot be \r\nproved using the model structure. The reason of course is \r\nthat the lifting axiom of Quillen, (MC4) doesn\u2019t work for \r\nweak fibrations. A counterexample is in order.\r\nExample(3.1)\r\nLet W = {\u2605} be a one point space and consider the \r\nfollowing diagram:\r\nwhere, h: {\u2605}\u2192E is defined by h({\u2605}) = (0, 1), H({\u2605}, \r\nt) = (0, t) and i0 is the canonical inclusion.\r\nWe claim that the above diagram doesn\u2019t admit a \r\ncontinuous lifting. Indeed, Suppose there is a continuous \r\nlifting G : {\u2605}\u00d7I\u2192E such that pG = H and Gi0 = h.\r\nConsider G\u22121(0\u00d7(0, 1]) \u2286\u2605\u00d7I where 0\u00d7(0, 1] is \r\nopen in E:\r\n(\u2605, t ) \u2208 G\u22121(0\u00d7(0, 1]) \u21d2 G(\u2605, t ) \u2208 0\u00d7(0, 1]\r\n\u21d2 pG (\u2605, t) \u2208p(0\u00d7 (0, 1])\r\n\u21d2 H(\u2605, t) \u2208pr1(0\u00d7 (0, 1])\r\n\u21d2 t = 0\r\nHence, G\u22121(0\u00d7(0,1] \u2286 (\u2605, 0) and G(\u2605, 0) = Gi0(\u2605)\r\n= h(\u2605) = (0, 1)\u22080(0, 1] \u21d2(\u2605, 0)\u2208G\u22121(0\u00d7(0, 1]).\r\nTherefore, G\u22121(0\u00d7(0, 1]) = (\u2605, 0) is not open in \u2605\u00d7I \r\nand so G is not continuous.\r\nWhat we have actually shown is that p is not a fibration.\r\nHowever, it is well known that p is a weak fibration \r\n(Piccinini, 1992, Exercise 2.2.9), (Dieck et al., 1970\r\nExample 6.2) and so axiom MC4, that is, Quillen\u2019s Lifting \r\naxiom is no longer true when fibration is replaced by weak \r\nfibration. In fact, if there were any model structure on Top\r\nwith weak fibrations as fibrations and weak equivalences as \r\nhomotopy equivalences and cofibrations as closed \r\ncofibrations, then our counterexample shows that the map \r\n\u2605\u2192I would not be a cofibration. Hence, we conclude that \r\nthe cogluing theorem of (Brown and Heath, 1970) which \r\nhas been proved under the weaker conditions that \r\nappropriate maps are weak-fibrations and the gluing \r\ntheorem for homotoy equivalences (Brown, 2006, Theorem \r\n5.5.7 which has been generalized to weak cofibrations\r\n(Kamps, 1972, Satz 8.2) cannot be proved within the model \r\ncategory structure in hTop. Furthermore, our \r\ncounterexample shows that weak fibrations and weak \r\ncofibrations do not satisfy any of the equivalent conditions \r\nof Thereom 2.1 and Theorem 2.2 given by Kieboom and so \r\nthe notions of weak fibrations and weak cofibrations fail to \r\nadmit a model structure on hTop thus answering negatively\r\nthe question raised by Peter May on the relevance of weak \r\nfibrations and cofibrations to model category theory.\r\nConcerns About Duality\r\nWe now present some examples of well known dual \r\ntheorems in classical homotopy the-ory which do no not \r\nadmit dual proofs as well as theorems in classical ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 7>","Afework Solomon / Journal of Mathematics and Statistics 2019, Volume 15: 201.207\r\nDOI: 10.3844/jmssp.2019.201.207\r\n205\r\nhomotopy theory whose duals are not true in general.\r\nExample(4.1)\r\nX is an H-space if and only if the canonical map e: \r\nX\u2192\u2126\u03a3X (the adjoint of id\u03a3X admits a left homotopy \r\ninverse (James, 1955).

Dually, if p: E\u2192B is a fibration, then it is not\r\nnecessarily true that p is a surjection. A trivial example \r\nis the unique map p: \uf066\u2192B for any set B.\r\nExample(4.4)\r\nStrom\u2019s pullback theorem (Str\u00f8m,1968, Theorem 12; \r\nBooth, 1974, Corollary 3) states that if i: A\u2192B is a \r\nclosed cofibration and p: E\u2192B is a Hurewicz fibration,\r\nthen p\r\n\u22121\r\n(A)\u2192E is a cofibration.

Only 1-morphisms need not be invertible.\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2003Main models and their equivalence\n\n| Model | Definition sketch | Strengths |\n|-------|------------------|-----------|\n| **Quasi-categories** (Joyal) | Simplicial sets whose inner horns have fillers. | Combinatorial; nerve of any ordinary category \u21aa quasi-cat. |\n| **Complete Segal spaces** (Rezk) | Simplicial spaces satisfying Segal + completeness. | Makes mapping *spaces* manifest; good for homotopy limits. |\n| **Simplicial categories** | Categories enriched in simplicial sets. | Close to model-category language; strict mapping objects. |\n| **Relative categories with hammock localization** (Dwyer\u2013Kan) | Ordinary category + distinguished weak equivalences. | Minimal input; any model category gives one immediately. |\n\nQuillen equivalences between their ambient model structures imply **all these models present the same homotopy theory**.  Thus \u201c\u221e-category\u201d is a *choice-free* notion.\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2003Spaces as \u221e-groupoids\n\nA **space** (homotopy type) is an \u221e-category in which every 1-morphism is invertible.  \nConcretely:\n\n* For a topological space \\(X\\), its *singular simplicial set* \\(S_\\bullet X\\) is a quasi-category whose higher simplices encode chains of homotopies.  \n* Conversely, any \u221e-groupoid has a geometric realization \\(|\u2013|\\) giving a genuine space.  \n\nHence the \u221e-category **\\(\\mathcal S\\) of spaces** is the precise incarnation of \u201cset with paths, paths between paths, \u2026\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u2003Replacing the homotopy **category** by the homotopy **\u221e-category**\n\nClassical step\u2002\u2003Top \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{localise at }W}\\)\u2003Ho(Top)\n\n* Ho(Top) keeps only the *\u03c0\u2080* of mapping spaces (hom-sets of homotopy classes).  \n* All higher homotopy information is discarded.\n\n\u221e-categorical step\u2002\u2003Top \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{singular nerve}}\\)\u2003\\(\\mathcal S\\)\n\n* Mapping objects in \\(\\mathcal S\\) are **full mapping spaces** \\(\\operatorname{Map}(X,Y)\\).  \n* Homotopy (co)limits, function complexes, loop/path objects, etc. live *inside* the structure rather than being external constructions.\n\nThus \u221e-categories fully answer Solomon\u2019s complaint that the Quillen homotopy category \u201cforgets subtleties\u201d: those subtleties are exactly the higher morphisms retained by \\(\\mathcal S\\).\n\n---\n\n## 5\u2003Homotopy inside an \u221e-category\n\n* **Equivalence** = 1-morphism admitting an inverse *up to higher homotopy*.  \n  It simultaneously captures homotopy equivalences (spaces) and quasi-isomorphisms (chain complexes).\n* **Homotopy limits/colimits** are defined by universal properties using mapping *spaces*; they refine derived functors without auxiliary model-structure choices.\n* **Adjunctions** generalise: two functors \\(F\\dashv G\\) require a map of mapping spaces \\(\\operatorname{Map}(FX,Y)\\simeq\\operatorname{Map}(X,GY)\\) coherent in all variables.\n\n---\n\n## 6\u2003From model categories to \u221e-categories\n\nGiven any combinatorial model category \\(\\mathcal M\\):\n\n1. Take the subcategory of fibrant\u2013cofibrant objects \\(\\mathcal M^{\\circ}\\).  \n2. Regard its simplicial mapping spaces \\(\\operatorname{Map}_{\\mathcal M}(X,Y)\\).  \n3. Apply the **homotopy coherent nerve** \\(N^\\mathrm{hc}\\).\n\nThe result \\(N^\\mathrm{hc}(\\mathcal M^{\\circ})\\) is an \u221e-category; Quillen-equivalent model categories yield **equivalent \u221e-categories**.  Hence \u221e-categories are *model-independent presentations* of homotopy theory, resolving the dependence on arbitrary fibrations/cofibrations that bothered Solomon.\n\n---\n\n## 7\u2003Stabilization and **stable \u221e-categories**\n\n### 7.1\u2003Spectra as the stabilization of spaces  \n*Formally*  \n\\[\n\\mathrm{Sp} \\;=\\; \\operatorname{Stab}(\\mathcal S)\n\\]  \nobtained by formally inverting the suspension functor \\(\\Sigma: \\mathcal S_* \\to \\mathcal S_*\\).\n\n### 7.2\u2003Stable \u221e-category  (definition)  \nAn \u221e-category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is **stable** if  \n1. It has a zero object, finite limits and colimits.  \n2. A square is a pushout \u2003\u21d4\u2003it is a pullback.  \n3. The suspension functor \\(\\Sigma\\) is an equivalence (hence so is \\(\\Omega\\)).\n\n### 7.3\u2003Properties  \n* Mapping spaces become **spectra** (homology theories).  \n* Exact triangles of triangulated categories are replaced by **fiber/cofiber sequences**\u2014but now with coherent higher structure, eliminating ambiguous signs and octahedral-axiom worries.  \n* The classical **stable homotopy category** Ho(Sp) is the homotopy category of the stable \u221e-category Sp, just as Ho(Top) is \\(\\pi_0\\mathcal S\\).\n\n---\n\n## 8\u2003Why \u221e-categories solve classical limitations\n\n| Solomon\u2019s issue | \u221e-categorical resolution |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Weak fibrations/cofibrations sit outside Quillen axioms. | We don\u2019t *choose* F/C classes; all homotopies are encoded in mapping spaces. |\n| Automatic self-duality of model axioms mis-represents topology. | Duality becomes an **additional property** (left-proper/right-proper, Cartesian vs. coCartesian fibrations) rather than baked-in symmetry. |\n| Different models give different homotopy categories. | All reasonable models yield the *same* underlying \u221e-category, so results transport automatically. |\n\n---\n\n## 9\u2003Applications and forward-looking themes\n\n* **Higher topos theory** (Lurie): sheaf theory and Grothendieck topoi upgraded to handle \u221e-groupoid-valued sheaves; crucial for derived algebraic geometry.  \n* **Spectral algebraic geometry**: replacing rings by \\(E_\\infty\\)-ring spectra inside stable \u221e-categories.  \n* **Higher category theory internal to physics**: extended TQFTs are functors \\((\\infty,n)\\)-Cat \u2192 Sp; the Cobordism Hypothesis lives naturally in this realm.  \n* **Homotopy type theory & univalence**: \u221e-groupoids model types; gives computational handle on \u221e-categorical constructions.\n\n---\n\n## 10\u2003Summary\n\n* An **\u221e-category** keeps *all* homotopical data, not just \\(\\pi_0\\).  \n* The \u221e-category \\(\\mathcal S\\) of spaces generalises classical homotopy categories, while its stabilization **Sp** recovers stable homotopy theory.  \n* Model categories, simplicial categories, relative categories, etc., are *presentations*; the \u221e-category extracted from them is presentation-independent.  \n* By moving to \u221e-categories we gain a framework where **asymmetry, weak notions, and higher coherence all coexist naturally**, offering a definitive resolution of the gaps identified in Quillen\u2019s original model.\n\nThis is the modern foundation on which contemporary algebraic topology, derived algebraic geometry and much of higher-dimensional category theory is now built."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":7719,"end_idx":7719,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"c1e8fc1c-28c2-49b4-85a9-8c9bc3d90a28","request_id":"95e5401d7ed4fd93-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c1e8fc1c-28c2-49b4-85a9-8c9bc3d90a28","children":["05fe33e9-c1b7-4aa2-92dc-c2db525b2ad6"]},"05fe33e9-c1b7-4aa2-92dc-c2db525b2ad6":{"id":"05fe33e9-c1b7-4aa2-92dc-c2db525b2ad6","message":{"id":"05fe33e9-c1b7-4aa2-92dc-c2db525b2ad6","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752373005.631,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Do stable \u221e-categories have filtered colimits and do filtered colimits commute with finite products?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95e547b31a02fd93-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9764a6fc-8ca1-4957-94e5-cbdf2dbfe2d7","children":["a9104240-bf6e-40e0-a7f0-7713b8e02626"]},"a9104240-bf6e-40e0-a7f0-7713b8e02626":{"id":"a9104240-bf6e-40e0-a7f0-7713b8e02626","message":{"id":"a9104240-bf6e-40e0-a7f0-7713b8e02626","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752373017.617609,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"05fe33e9-c1b7-4aa2-92dc-c2db525b2ad6","request_id":"95e547b31a02fd93-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"05fe33e9-c1b7-4aa2-92dc-c2db525b2ad6","children":["1e4fe011-ec2c-4c00-9263-ee26f1c20068"]},"1e4fe011-ec2c-4c00-9263-ee26f1c20068":{"id":"1e4fe011-ec2c-4c00-9263-ee26f1c20068","message":{"id":"1e4fe011-ec2c-4c00-9263-ee26f1c20068","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752373017.61773,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring stable \u221e-categories","content":"The user's question concerns stable \u221e-categories and their properties, specifically filtered colimits and their interaction with finite products.\n\nStable \u221e-categories generally require finite limits and colimits, but don't necessarily have arbitrary (filtered) colimits unless they're presentable.

answer**\n\n* No: a *stable* \u221e-category, by definition, is only required to have **finite** limits and colimits.  \n* Yes: whenever a stable \u221e-category is **presentable** (or more generally accessible), it *does* admit all small \u2014 hence filtered \u2014 colimits, and in that situation **\u03ba-filtered colimits commute with finite limits (hence with finite products)** by Lurie\u2019s Proposition 5.3.3.3. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202L28-L30\ue201\n\nBelow is a precise breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003What the axioms of a *stable* \u221e-category guarantee\n\nA pointed \u221e-category \\( \\mathcal C \\) is **stable** iff  \n\n1. it has finite limits and finite colimits, and  \n2. a square is a push-out \u21d4 pull-back. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue202L24-L24\ue201  \n\nNothing in the *definition* mentions *filtered* colimits, coproducts of arbitrary size, or exactness properties relating the two.\n\n*Example without filtered colimits.*  \nThe full sub-category \\( \\mathrm{Sp}^{\\mathrm{fin}}\\subset\\mathrm{Sp} \\) of **finite spectra** is small, stable, and lacks any non-trivial filtered colimits (ind-completion is needed to adjoin them).\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003Adding filtered colimits: presentable & accessible cases  \n\nTo **get** filtered colimits one equips the stable category with size conditions:\n\n| extra hypothesis on \\( \\mathcal C \\) | consequence |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|\n| **accessible** (admits \u03ba-filtered colimits and is generated under them by \u03ba-compact objects) | \u03ba-filtered colimits exist by definition. |\n| **presentable** (accessible + cocomplete) | *all* small colimits, in particular filtered ones, exist. |\n\nMost working examples (spectra Sp, a module category \\(\\mathrm{Mod}_R\\), derived \u221e-category \\(\\mathbf D(A)\\), stable motivic categories, \u2026) are presentable after ind-completion.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Exactness of filtered colimits with finite products  \n\nOnce filtered colimits are available, *presentability* (or merely universality of filtered colimits) forces a strong exactness property:\n\n> **Lurie, HTT 5.3.3.3**    \n> In any presentable \u221e-category, **filtered colimits commute with finite limits**.  \n> (The proof is first given for \\(\\mathcal S\\), the \u221e-category of spaces, and then lifted to arbitrary presentable \u221e-categories.) \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue202L9-L9\ue201\n\nBecause a finite **product** is a particular finite limit, we immediately get:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname*{colim}_{i\\in I}\n\\bigl( X_i\\times Y_i \\bigr)\\;\\simeq\\;\n\\Bigl(\\operatorname*{colim}_{i\\in I} X_i\\Bigr)\\;\n\\times\\;\n\\Bigl(\\operatorname*{colim}_{i\\in I} Y_i\\Bigr)\n\\quad\\text{for any filtered diagram }I.\n\\]\n\nThus in a *presentable* (hence \u201cbig\u201d) **stable** \u221e-category filtered colimits always commute with finite products.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Putting it together  \n\n| Situation for a stable \u221e-category \\( \\mathcal C \\) | filtered colimits exist? | do they commute with finite products? |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Plain definition, no extra size axioms (e.g. \\(\\mathrm{Sp}^{\\mathrm{fin}}\\)) | **Not necessarily** | question is moot |\n| \\( \\mathcal C \\) is **accessible** | **Yes** (by assumption) | generally *no* automatic commuting; need universality (presentability) |\n| \\( \\mathcal C \\) is **presentable** (the usual setting in homotopy theory) | **Yes** | **Yes** \u2014 by Prop 5.3.3.3 |\n\nIf one starts with a small stable \u221e-category \\( \\mathcal C_0 \\) lacking those colimits, its **Ind-completion**  \n\\(\\mathrm{Ind}(\\mathcal C_0)\\) is presentable, stable, and satisfies all the commuting properties above.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Why the commuting result holds (sketch)\n\n1. In a presentable \u221e-category every filtered colimit is **universal** (it is preserved by pull-back along any morphism).  \n2. Universal colimits commute with finite limits (general adjoint-functor argument).  \n3. Finite limits include finite products, hence the claim.\n\nFor products one can also note directly that, in a presentable monoidal \u221e-category, the functor \\( -\\times Z \\) is a **left adjoint** (right adjoint is \\(\\mathrm{Map}(Z,-)\\)), and therefore preserves all colimits, filtered included.\n\n---\n\n### 6\u2003Take-away\n\n* **Bare stability \u2260 big colimits.**  \n  Stable \u221e-categories guarantee only the triangulated-style exactness encoded in finite limits/colimits.\n\n* **Presentability is the right size condition.**  \n  It gives you both filtered colimits *and* their compatibility with finite limits/products, exactly mirroring the classical theorem that filtered colimits commute with finite limits in any locally finitely presentable 1-category.\n\n* **Working practice.**  \n  When finiteness of objects matters one keeps a *small* stable sub-category; when colimit-exactness is required (spectral algebra, t-structures, descent) one moves to its presentable Ind-completion, where filtered colimits and finite products coexist harmoniously."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202L28-L30\ue201","start_idx":397,"end_idx":422,"safe_urls":["https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/brantner/24L2.pdf"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([people.maths.ox.ac.uk](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/brantner/24L2.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"","url":"https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/brantner/24L2.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"people.maths.ox.ac.uk"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue202L24-L24\ue201","start_idx":667,"end_idx":693,"safe_urls":["https://pages.uoregon.edu/njp/garcia.pdf"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([University of Oregon](https://pages.uoregon.edu/njp/garcia.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"","url":"https://pages.uoregon.edu/njp/garcia.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"University of Oregon"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue202L9-L9\ue201","start_idx":2205,"end_idx":2229,"safe_urls":["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/178429/when-do-limits-and-colimits-of-infinity-categories-commute"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/178429/when-do-limits-and-colimits-of-infinity-categories-commute))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"ct.category theory - When do limits and colimits of infinity-categories commute?

The prototypical example is the \u221e-category \\( \\mathcal S_* \\) of pointed spaces, which Lurie singles out as \u201cthe presentable \u221e-category of pointed spaces\u201d\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201.\n\n> Think of them as \u201cbig homotopy-theoretic arenas with a chosen basepoint\u201d in which you can freely form coproducts, filtered colimits, geometric realisations, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 2  Topological examples they subsume\n\n| Classical setting | Presentable pointed \u221e-categorical avatar | Why it fits |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Based topological spaces** (or simplicial sets) | \\( \\mathcal S_* \\) | Zero object = basepoint; all colimits exist; presentability by standard small-object argument.\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201 |\n| **\\(G\\)-spaces with basepoint** for a compact Lie group \\(G\\) | \\( \\mathcal S_*^{\\,BG} \\) (functors \\(BG \\to \\mathcal S_*\\)) | Functor category of a small groupoid into a presentable category is presentable and pointed; recovers equivariant homotopy theory at the \u221e-level. |\n| **Sheaves (or stacks) of pointed spaces on a site \\(\\mathcal C\\)** | \\( \\mathrm{Shv}_{\\infty}(\\mathcal C)_* \\) | Any presentable \\(\\infty\\)-topos becomes pointed by slicing over the terminal object; keeps all colimits needed for \u010cech descent, hypercovers, etc. |\n| **Parametrised (ex-)spaces over a base \\(B\\)** | Slice \\( (\\mathcal S_*/B)_* \\) | Under/over category of a presentable pointed \u221e-cat. is again presentable and pointed; models fibrewise homotopy theory in May\u2013Sigurdsson form. |\n\n---\n\n## 3  Stable topological invariants (still pointed, now stabilised)\n\nEvery presentable pointed \u221e-category \\( \\mathcal C \\) has a **stabilisation**  \n\\( \\mathrm{Sp}(\\mathcal C) \\), again presentable and pointed, obtained by inverting suspension.  Two fundamental cases:\n\n| Stable avatar | What it generalises |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Spectra \\( \\mathrm{Sp} \\)** | Stable homotopy category; the free stable presentable pointed \u221e-category on one object\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201. |\n| **\\(R\\)-module spectra** \\( \\mathrm{Mod}_R \\) | Topological analogues of chain complexes over a ring; appear as categories of parameterised spectra in bundle\u2010theoretic problems and in equivariant stable homotopy. |\n\nBecause presentability is preserved under stabilisation\u2002\ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201, these still sit in the same framework.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Geometric & algebraic geometry incarnations\n\n| Geometric context | Presentable pointed \u221e-category | Explanation |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Derived category of abelian sheaves** on a topological space \\(X\\) | \\( \\mathcal D(\\mathrm{Ab}(X)) \\) | A stable, presentable \u221e-category whose zero object is the complex \\(0\\); models classical \\(D^+(X)\\) but retains all higher homotopies. |\n| **Quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme \\(X\\)** | \\( \\mathrm{QCoh}(X) \\) (as an \u221e-cat) | Presentable (via Ind-completion); pointed by the zero sheaf; fundamental in derived algebraic geometry \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201. |\n| **Motivic \\( \\mathbb A^1 \\)-homotopy theory** | \\( \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathbb A^1}(S)_* \\) and its stable version \\( \\mathrm{SH}(S) \\) | Presheaves of pointed spaces on smooth schemes over \\(S\\), localised at Nisnevich covers and \\( \\mathbb A^1 \\); presentable by left Bousfield localisation. |\n| **Derived (spectral) stacks** | Categories of perfect or QCoh-modules on a spectral stack | Each is a presentable pointed \u221e-category tensored over \\( \\mathrm{Mod}_R \\) (an \\(E_\\infty\\)-ring); key object in Lurie\u2019s DAG programme \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201. |\n\n---\n\n## 5  Unifying power & practical takeaway\n\n1. **Single language for many worlds.**  Whether you study based CW-complexes, G-spaces, sheaves, spectra or quasi-coherent sheaves, they all live as objects of Pr\\(_*^{\\mathrm L}\\)/Pr\\(_*^{\\mathrm R}\\) \u2014 the \u221e-category of presentable pointed \u221e-categories with adjointable functors \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn9view0\ue201.\n\n2. **Colimits + basepoint built-in.**  Colimit\u2013exact constructions (suspensions, Thom spaces, homotopy colimits) are available uniformly, and the zero object gives canonical \u201ccoarse\u201d truncation and fibre\u2013co-fibre sequences.\n\n3. **Automatic stability when needed.**  Stabilising any of the above gives the corresponding \u201cstable homotopy\u201d category (spectra, motivic spectra, derived categories) without leaving the realm of presentable pointed \u221e-categories.\n\n4. **Interoperability via adjunctions.**  Functors preserving colimits (left adjoints) or limits (right adjoints) between such categories encode familiar operations: push-forward/pull-back of sheaves, suspension/loop, smash/tensor, etc., and they are tracked by the general adjoint-functor theorem for presentable \u221e-categories.\n\n> **Hence**: *presentable pointed \u221e-categories* serve as the common umbrella for virtually every \u201clarge, homotopy-theoretic\u201d category used in topology and geometry \u2014 from based spaces and spectra to derived categories of sheaves, motivic spaces, and beyond."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201","start_idx":498,"end_idx":515,"safe_urls":["https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~harpaz/stable_infinity_categories.pdf"],"refs":[],"alt":"([University
