These accords set guidelines to ensure that financial institutions maintain adequate capital to absorb unexpected losses, thereby enhancing financial stability. Basel I, introduced in 1988, focused on the capital adequacy of financial institutions by categorizing assets into risk levels and requiring banks to hold at least 8% of their risk-weighted assets as capital. Basel II updated these regulations, including three pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review, and market discipline. Basel III was developed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, adding stricter capital and liquidity requirements, especially for systemically important banks. The final phase of Basel III, termed \"Basel Endgame,\" is set to be implemented by 2025, requiring banks with $100 billion or more in assets to hold more capital.

This crisis, marked by extensive lending and increasing external indebtedness, posed a bankruptcy threat to major international banks. To mitigate this risk, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision established the Basel I Capital Accord in 1988, setting a minimum risk-based capital adequacy standard for banks globally. Basel I defined bank capital, introduced a two-tiered capital structure, and mandated that banks hold at least 8% of their risk-weighted assets (RWA) as capital.\n\nBasel I faced criticism for its narrow focus on credit risk, ignoring other risks like operational risk. This led to the development of Basel II, implemented in 2007, which expanded risk assessments. Basel III, finalized in 2017, faced delays due to COVID-19 and took effect in January 2023. Despite its flaws, Basel I remains a significant milestone in banking regulation, laying the foundation for subsequent risk and capital frameworks.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1165770000.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/understanding-basel-3-regulations.asp","title":"Understanding the Basel III International Regulations","snippet":"Basel III is a set of international banking regulations developed by the Bank for International Settlements to enhance financial stability by mitigating risk in the banking sector. Prompted by the 2007 subprime crisis, the regulations seek to prevent similar economic meltdowns through stricter capital and liquidity requirements. Banks are now required to maintain a minimum equity level of 4.5% of their risk-weighted assets, with a total buffer of up to 7% to be used during financial distress. While this aims to make banks safer and potentially lower their cost of capital, it might also lead to reduced profitability and slower economic growth due to constrained lending. For investors, Basel III promises more stable bond markets and potentially safer stock investments, although the impact on economic growth and currency markets remains uncertain. Implemented gradually since 2013, the regulations are intended to provide a robust framework to enhance global financial stability.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1284915600.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_689efac3ada8800787db3b76f1ba3b38","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for FRTB and related capital requirements documents","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"96f794cd3ccdfd2d-DFW","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"9175f6b3-3dee-4a4a-8dfa-a1d41058adaa","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9175f6b3-3dee-4a4a-8dfa-a1d41058adaa","children":["9bb58ee3-7c41-4f0f-8905-2114c72fbbeb"]},"9bb58ee3-7c41-4f0f-8905-2114c72fbbeb":{"id":"9bb58ee3-7c41-4f0f-8905-2114c72fbbeb","message":{"id":"9bb58ee3-7c41-4f0f-8905-2114c72fbbeb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755249357.301924,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Focusing on authoritative sources","content":"I shouldn\u2019t rely on Investopedia.
