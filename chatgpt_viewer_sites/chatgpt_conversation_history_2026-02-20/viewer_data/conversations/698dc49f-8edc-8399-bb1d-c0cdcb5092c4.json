For this, I\u2019ll focus on architecture components like web search, storage, summarization, and fact-checking. I'll carefully check official sources like openai.com to get the latest details, especially after the August 2025 cutoff.\n\n**Proposing workflow for Codex CLI and API integration**\n\nI\u2019ll need to clarify that since GitHub is outside the specified domain restrictions, I\u2019ll look for relevant Codex CLI docs on openai.com instead. For the user\u2019s workflow, I suggest using Codex CLI for coding and web browsing, while the API serves as a coordinator for embeddings, retrieval, and summarization. I'll focus on document storage options and organizing the output efficiently.\n\n**Proposing multi-agent architecture and knowledge management workflow**\n\nFor the user\u2019s project, using concept maps with a Neo4j or RDF store could work well. I'll focus on facts, verification, and maintaining provenance with citations for accuracy. The setup needs a human-in-loop, a well-organized agent structure, and session logging with tools to handle timeboxing and approval processes.\n\n**Defining step-by-step plan and workflow considerations**\n\nFor the user\u2019s proposed workflow, I\u2019ll provide code samples, folder structures, and a simple YAML config with a step-by-step plan. I'll explain key steps like document schema, ingestion pipeline, and deep research. It\u2019s important to manage context, avoid paywalls, and ensure citations. I\u2019ll also mention costs for choosing models based on task needs.\n\n**Clarifying user's request and verifying current API info**\n\nThe user is asking for brainstorming, so I\u2019ll focus on general recommendations, like considering cheaper models for summarization. Since they mentioned the OpenAI API, I\u2019ll mention options like the \"Responses API,\" \"Tools,\" and \"File search\" \u2014 keeping things up-to-date by checking OpenAI's current docs. I\u2019ll use the web to verify.\n\n**Looking up details on Codex CLI web search capabilities**\n\nI need more details about Codex CLI's web search feature, specifically regarding agent internet access. I\u2019ll search for \"agent internet access Codex CLI\" to get up-to-date relevant sources and ensure I have the latest information about its capabilities and how it works in this context.\n\n**Designing a modular agentic workflow**\n\nThe user wants an agentic workflow involving Codex CLI and OpenAI's API to build a knowledge base and do deep research. Here's a rough proposal: \n\n- **Orchestrator**: A Python service to manage tasks. \n  - Uses **Responses API** for planning.\n  - Uses **File search** for retrieving document corpus.\n  - Uses **Web search** for relevant current info.\n  - Uses **Codex CLI** or SDK for coding tasks like ingestion and maintenance.\n\nThis approach ensures modularity and flexibility.\n\n**Evaluating Codex CLI and OpenAI API capabilities**\n\nI want to confirm the capabilities of Codex CLI, such as its ability to read, modify, and execute code in a directory, including using cached web search tools that can switch to live search. The OpenAI API also provides web and file search, with an automatic parsing, embedding, and storage feature. New features like the \"Agents SDK\" might help with orchestration. Next, I'll search for more details on the \"Agents SDK\" from OpenAI docs.\n\n**Confirming capabilities and proposing architecture**\n\nCodex CLI supports web search by default for local tasks, and we can switch to live search using the `--search` flag. Cached search results help reduce prompt injection, though web results should always be treated with caution. For cloud tasks, internet access is initially blocked but can be enabled. I'll cite relevant documentation for accuracy. We need to design an architecture that combines Codex CLI\u2019s search, summarization, and data storage processes.\n\n**Proposing a knowledge base solution**\n\nTo address the need for a knowledge base, I\u2019d suggest two tiers. First, a local \"library repository\" to store raw documents with metadata and citations, leveraging git for version control. This could be organized using YAML metadata and even incorporating tools like Zotero/BibTeX for referencing. The file search tool with vector stores helps, but user needs more structured data.\n\n**Proposing a knowledge base architecture**\n\nI suggest a three-layer system: \n\n1) \"Library Repository\" for raw documents with metadata and citations.\n2) \"Index Layer\" with a vector store for semantic retrieval and keyword search, offering tradeoffs between hosted solutions for simplicity or local setups for more control.\n3) \"Synthesis Layer\" for summarization, concept maps, and knowledge updates. For deep research, we'll set up a pipeline and communication protocol, implementing checkpoints and session state tracking for seamless task management and resumption.\n\n**Evaluating LangGraph vs. OpenAI Agents SDK**\n\nWe can consider using either LangGraph or the OpenAI Agents SDK. LangGraph is open-source, ideal for memory checkpointing and flexibility while integrating with various LLMs. On the other hand, the Agents SDK includes built-in tools (like web and file search) and better integration with Codex CLI for programmatic control, making it a strong option for orchestrating search tasks.\n\n**Finalizing automation setup with Codex SDK**\n\nI like the idea of using Codex SDK\u2019s support for threads and resumption with thread IDs. For automation, I'll need to consider utilizing \"Non-interactive Mode\" to run Codex tasks without the terminal interface. That should make the process easier and more streamlined for automated operations.\n\n**Finding relevant content in the documentation**\n\nThe page is long, so I\u2019ll find the section where non-interactive mode is described. I\u2019ll look for keywords or specific lines that mention it, so I can focus on the relevant information and avoid getting distracted by unrelated content. I\u2019ll use a search function to make this quicker.\n\n**Exploring automation and memory management**\n\nThese lines explain automation features like codex exec for running scripts, JSON outputs, and session resumptions \u2014 all important for agentic workflows. I\u2019ll incorporate them. Additionally, \u201ccompaction\u201d could help memory management by summarizing conversation states to address context overflow. I\u2019ll check the \"Compaction\" guide for more details.\n\n**Integrating deep research features into workflow**\n\nThe deep research guide includes several tools and features, like max_tool_calls, web searches, vector stores integration, and a code interpreter. It also tackles safety with prompt injection mitigation, logging, and monitoring. These elements are crucial in the context of the user's deep research question, so I'll integrate them, while also noting the need to cite any claims derived from sources during brainstorming.\n\n**Proposing architecture for research workflow**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about a tri-layer design for the process:\n\n- **Acquisition**: Codex CLI web search and maybe an API search for targeted tasks.\n- **Curation**: Extract metadata, deduplicate, and summarize.\n- **Retrieval**: Use vector store and keyword search, along with an index.\n\nSynthesis involves deep research agents running retrieval and code analysis. I\u2019ll propose Git repo management and streamlining tasks, keeping in mind that Codex CLI search results are cached, but I need to figure out if it allows access to full page content.\n\n**Designing the knowledge base structure**\n\nWe\u2019ll design an acquisition pipeline that captures web search items through Codex exec's JSON output. The user may also want a knowledge base, so I\u2019m proposing a structured metadata directory layout:\n\n- **kb/**: Sources, notes, indexes.\n- **ingest/**: Scripts for content scraping and parsing.\n- **sessions/**: Topic-based folders with detailed logs and decisions.\n- Use **Git** and **Git LFS** for large PDFs.\n\n**Proposing the ingestion process for web content**\n\nHere\u2019s the general flow for ingesting content:\n\n1) **Acquire**: Run Codex search, pulling source details (URL, title, snippet, retrieval date) and storing these as \"SourceRecord\" objects.\n2) **Fetch**: Use a script to fetch content from URLs, store HTML, cleaned text, or PDFs. For non-paywalled content, run Codex search and use `wget`/`curl` to download full pages.\n\n**Considering security for web search and content fetching**\n\nIn Codex cloud, internet access is blocked by default for agents. Web searches rely on cached results unless a live search is configured. For security, we can consider treating web search results as untrusted and use a controlled downloader. Alternatively, the OpenAI API-based search tool might return more content, potentially as a backup.\n\n**Considering deep research and tool integration**\n\nFor large corpora, we can index using OpenAI\u2019s file search tool and vector stores. This allows for deep research into accumulated material, utilizing deep research models like o3-deep-research. These models support various features like web search, file search, and code interpretation, although custom tool calls may need an MCP server. Alternatively, uploading data to a vector store can streamline search retrieval.\n\n**Designing knowledge base and research workflow**\n\nTo enable external access and human oversight, we can store information outside OpenAI and expose it via an MCP search/fetch interface. For paywalled material, deep research models can\u2019t get necessary approval, requiring manual human intervention. As for the knowledge base, we\u2019ll treat it as file-based, supporting operations such as adding sources, ingesting data, and generating syntheses.\n\n**Designing research and maintenance workflows**\n\nFor continuous organization, we can establish nightly restructuring\u2014updating classification, indexing, and deduplication. Using an incremental summarization pipeline allows for clustering and refining ongoing reviews. We can critique assumptions, ensuring a mix of cached and live search for exploration and verification. Specialized sources may require connectors and APIs, and I\u2019ll explain key terms like RAG, CI/CD, and MCP clearly.\n\n**Designing orchestration and knowledge base workflows**\n\nLet's provide a high-level diagram and define the data model, including Document, Chunk, and Claim records. Next, I'll outline agent roles and tasks, offer a minimal pipeline code skeleton, and demonstrate how to combine Codex CLI and OpenAI API calls. We\u2019ll also explore how to manage sessions and vector stores for efficiency.\n\n**Clarifying search tools and functionalities**\n\nThe file search tool offers both semantic and keyword search using vector stores hosted by OpenAI, returning citations and results. I\u2019ll need to check the web search tool guide for API details to ensure I can properly implement it, and I'll be sure to provide citations for both.\n\n**Exploring tools and tradeoffs**\n\nThis document mentions that the web search tool provides citations, actions like search and open page, and domain filtering. As for LangGraph, there's a trade-off with the Agents SDK and a plain orchestrator. While up-to-date info could be useful, it's probably not necessary for brainstorming, so I'll skip checking LangGraph specifics.\n\n**Deciding on the best approach for web search functionality**\n\nWhile up-to-date details on LangGraph are optional, I should still acknowledge alternative frameworks like LlamaIndex, Haystack, and others, which might interest the user. Since the user prefers using Codex CLI to browse the web, I'll propose leveraging Codex for web searches, though capturing citations may require some customization.\n\n**Proposing workflow for handling citations and data safety**\n\nTo manage citations, I\u2019ll suggest using citation objects stored in CSL JSON or tools like Zotero for simplicity, with BibTeX export options. Also, I'll include a note on web search data safety and injection risks. For concept mapping, I propose using the OpenAI API to extract concept graphs, visualized with tools like Graphviz.\n\n**Clarifying agent safety, tool approvals, and MCP integration**\n\nI'll suggest using tool approvals for safety, especially for MCP operations. While deep research models may not need approvals for read-only MCP access, others may. I'll also highlight that Codex can connect to MCP servers using specific commands, enabling programmatic knowledge base queries, and mention that deep research models require a special MCP server for search.\n\n**Proposing a \"lightweight but robust\" research pipeline**\n\nRather than a \"Downloads\" style, I suggest a library-like organization using a domain-level taxonomy, named conventions, and structured pipelines. Codex exec will handle tasks like writing notes, indexing, and configuring a search system with vector stores. We\u2019ll set up a repository, use metadata storage, and build an efficient research pipeline.\n\n**Proposing research and tracking features**\n\nFor streamlined deep research, I'll focus on optimized file searches from the knowledge base and integrate hierarchical notes. I'll emphasize a multi-pass fact-check system and weigh in on human-in-the-loop checks, ensuring robust task management. We\u2019ll use session summaries, background mode, and implement a librarian agent for note organization.\n\n**Considering web search security and system planning**\n\nI'll prioritize security by using cached search results to avoid unwanted network commands and keep approval in place. We'll rely on Codex CLI for web searches while cross-checking with an API for references. I'll mention structured annotations and support for session management with Codex exec.\n\n**Brainstorming architecture and tools for the user**\n\nThe user wants a brainstorm, not a full step-by-step. I\u2019ll mention up-to-date tools like Codex CLI, Codex SDK, file and web search, and deep research. I'll also reference the Agent SDK for workflows and give them the option of either using LangGraph or a local open-source approach. I\u2019ll include a system architecture, recommendations, and sample code snippets while focusing on keeping it helpful but not overwhelming.\n\n**Summarizing tools, safety, and protocols**\n\nI\u2019ll cover the roles of agents and task-specific tools from OpenAI. These include Codex CLI web search, deep research models, and file search tools using vector stores. I\u2019ll highlight safety through web search caution and logging, plus protocols for human review and task resumption. Citations will back up all statements.\n\n**Proposing agent workflows and considerations**\n\nUsing Codex CLI for local search is fine, but keep in mind the potential for outdated cached data, which could lead you to miss the latest updates. For accuracy, a live verification step might be a good idea. Also, relying solely on vector databases can lead to an unstructured mess \u2014 you\u2019ll need human-level curation for stability. Additionally, triggering periodic reorganizations only when necessary will save you time and energy."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 10m 46s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiaeast-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-7773c30c-9bea-41b7-9b0b-04ff0ab989c9:AU","parent_id":"e706cbb8-9d02-4d0d-9af2-dc55bd2fa2fc","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_698dc4a27d0881918cc8899ed1dafb07","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"698dc4a2-7e0c-839e-aa80-96531252b011","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-12T12:16:34.777313Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"e706cbb8-9d02-4d0d-9af2-dc55bd2fa2fc","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"7773c30c-9bea-41b7-9b0b-04ff0ab989c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"dd0dc1f5-717f-400a-a1aa-8fb20c310ae8","finished_duration_sec":646,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e706cbb8-9d02-4d0d-9af2-dc55bd2fa2fc","children":["ec7e57bf-a7f4-419f-84a0-42a38004fc79"]},"ec7e57bf-a7f4-419f-84a0-42a38004fc79":{"id":"ec7e57bf-a7f4-419f-84a0-42a38004fc79","message":{"id":"ec7e57bf-a7f4-419f-84a0-42a38004fc79","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770899241.411662,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s a concrete way to think about this: you\u2019re building **(1) an acquisition pipeline**, **(2) a library system**, and **(3) a research/synthesis agent** that can operate over both *the live web* and *your accumulated corpus*.\n\nBelow is a design that uses **Codex CLI for scouting + local actions** and **OpenAI API calls (Responses API + vector stores + deep research models) for retrieval/synthesis/verification**, with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the glue so agents can use your KB as a \u201ctool\u201d instead of trying to stuff it into context.\n\n---\n\n## 1) First: tighten a few of your assumptions\n\n### Codex CLI web search is good, but by default it\u2019s not \u201cfully live\u201d\nCodex CLI\u2019s web search defaults to **cached mode** (served from an OpenAI-maintained web search cache).

live via `--search` or config. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view3\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n   - Can be run **as an MCP server** (`codex mcp-server`) so another agent can \u201ctool-call\u201d Codex. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\n2) **Disk-based \u201cAcademic Library\u201d KB (canonical store)**\n   - Content-addressed raw artifacts (hash-based IDs)\n   - Normalized text + metadata + bibliographic records\n   - Deterministic regeneration of summaries / indices\n\n3) **OpenAI API for retrieval + synthesis**\n   - **Responses API** supports built-in tools like **file search** and **web search**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n   - **Vector stores + file_search tool** for scalable retrieval over your corpus. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn8search1\ue201  \n   - Vector stores support expiration policy fields (you should treat them as **derived indices**, not your only storage). \ue200cite\ue202turn8search13\ue201\n\n4) **Orchestration layer (Agents SDK or LangGraph)**\n   - OpenAI **Agents SDK** is designed for tool-using multi-agent systems and keeps a full trace. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n   - If you like explicit state machines, LangGraph is fine\u2014but MCP + Agents SDK gives you a clean \u201ctool ecosystem\u201d story that matches Codex.\n\n5) **Optional: Deep Research model for \u201cfinal-form\u201d reports**\n   - Purpose-built for multi-step research with citations and browsing. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue202turn7search14\ue202turn7search0\ue201  \n   - Also note the **Feb 10, 2026 update**: deep research can connect to MCP/apps and restrict web searches to trusted sites, plus real-time progress + interruption. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search11\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3) The workflow as a pipeline (with explicit artifacts)\n\nThink in **phases** where each phase produces artifacts saved to disk, so you can stop anytime and resume.\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Plan (small context)\n**Inputs:** research question + constraints + what you already know  \n**Outputs (saved):**\n- `research_plan.md` (scope, subquestions, definitions, exclusion criteria)\n- `search_queries.json` (query variants, target domains, recency needs)\n- `quality_rubric.md` (what counts as \u201cauthoritative\u201d)\n\n*Agent behavior rule:* no browsing yet; just structure the problem.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Acquire (Codex CLI as Scout)\nUse **Codex CLI web search** to enumerate candidate sources quickly.\n\nKey detail: cached vs live mode.\n- Default cached mode is safer but less up-to-date. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view3\ue201  \n- Use `--search` only when needed. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view3\ue201\n\n**Outputs (saved):**\n- `candidates/sources_seed.json` with fields like:\n  - `url`, `title`, `publisher`, `author`, `published_date` (if available)\n  - `why_relevant`\n  - `source_type` (paper/docs/blog/news)\n  - `credibility_notes`\n  - `needs_paywall_access: true/false`\n\n**How to run it repeatedly (scripted):**\n- `codex exec` is intended for CI-style automation and can output JSON events. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn5view1\ue201  \n- `--full-auto` sets a low-friction automation preset. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n\nExample pattern (conceptual):\n```bash\ncodex exec --full-auto --json --search \"\nFind 20 authoritative sources about <TOPIC>.\nPrefer peer-reviewed, standards bodies, or official docs.\nReturn a JSON array with url/title/author/date/why_relevant/credibility_notes.\nWrite it to candidates/sources_seed.json.\n\"\n```\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Ingest (your \u201clibrarian\u201d job)\n**Goal:** transform unstable web material into stable library objects.\n\n**Outputs (saved):**\n- `raw/<sha256>.<ext>` (original PDF/HTML snapshot if allowed)\n- `norm/<sha256>.md` (clean text form)\n- `meta/<sha256>.json` (provenance + bib metadata + hashes)\n- `bib/library.bib` or `library.csl.json` (your citation database)\n\n**Critical design point:** raw is immutable; normalized is reproducible.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Index (OpenAI vector store as derived index)\nUpload normalized documents to an OpenAI **vector store** and use **file_search** during synthesis.\n\n- Vector stores are collections of processed files for `file_search`. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn8search1\ue201  \n- You can control retrieval count to manage token spend/latency. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- Vector stores include expiration policy fields\u2014don\u2019t treat them as your only storage. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search13\ue201\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Synthesize (two modes)\n**Mode 1: Corpus-first synthesis (preferred for \u201clibrary reuse\u201d)**\n- Use Responses API + `file_search` on your vector store\n- Require citations *from your own corpus* first\n- Allow web search only for gaps / recency\n\n**Mode 2: Deep Research synthesis (for \u201cfinal report\u201d)**\n- Use deep research model for multi-step browsing + citations\n- Give it access to your KB via file_search and/or MCP\n- Keep orchestration outside (since deep research models don\u2019t support function calling). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search4\ue201\n\n### Phase F \u2014 Verify (hallucination resistance via \u201cclaim-evidence\u201d bookkeeping)\nDon\u2019t just \u201cfact check\u201d at the end. Make it structural:\n\n**Store claims as objects:**\n- `claim_id`\n- `claim_text`\n- `status` = {supported | disputed | hypothesis}\n- `evidence` = list of (doc_id, quote_span, location, url, access_date)\n\nThen enforce:\n- If a claim has no evidence object, it cannot be promoted into \u201cKB facts\u201d.\n- Contradictions create a \u201cdisputed\u201d cluster with side-by-side evidence.\n\nThis turns hallucination into a data validation problem.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Where MCP fits (this is the big unlock)\n\nYou mentioned: \u201cAn external agent should utilize accumulated material\u201d \u2014 MCP is the cleanest way to do that.\n\n### Two MCP directions you can use\n1) **Expose your KB as an MCP server**\nSo Codex / deep research / other agents can query:\n- `search(query, filters)`\n- `fetch(doc_id)`\n- `get_citation(doc_id)`\n- `list_concepts(entity)`\n- `open_tasks()`\n\nOpenAI\u2019s MCP guide explicitly frames MCP servers as a way to read from private data sources (like vector stores) and make them available to ChatGPT and deep research. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search2\ue201\n\n2) **Expose Codex as an MCP server**\nCodex can run as an MCP server (`codex mcp-server`) so *another agent consumes Codex* as a tool. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\n### Codex-side MCP configuration is already built-in\nCodex stores MCP config in `config.toml` (global `~/.codex/config.toml` or project `.codex/config.toml`) and you can add servers with `codex mcp add \u2026`. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue202turn5view2\ue201\n\nSo a strong pattern is:\n- Your orchestrator runs a KB MCP server locally\n- Codex connects to it\n- Deep research connects to it\n- Everything reads from the same canonical store\n\n---\n\n## 5) \u201cModern academic library\u201d file layout that actually scales\n\nA practical structure (content-addressed + human-friendly \u201cshelves\u201d):\n\n```\nkb/\n  raw/                # immutable captures (pdf/html/etc) named by hash\n  norm/               # normalized markdown/text, named by same hash\n  meta/               # json metadata (provenance, bib fields, hashes)\n  bib/\n    library.bib       # or CSL-JSON\n  shelves/            # curated, human-meaningful collections\n    topic_x/\n      reading_list.md\n      concept_map.md\n  notes/\n    zettels/          # atomic notes (one concept per file)\n    syntheses/        # topic-level syntheses\n  claims/\n    claims.jsonl      # claim-evidence objects\n  indices/\n    lexical.db        # optional BM25/SQLite FTS for exact lookup\n  runs/\n    2026-02-12T.../   # run manifests, prompts, outputs, session ids\n```\n\nKey point: **\u201cshelves/\u201d are pointers**, not storage. Reorganization becomes editing shelves + regenerating summaries, not moving the source-of-truth.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Human-in-the-loop protocol (so autonomy doesn\u2019t go off the rails)\n\nDefine explicit \u201cinterrupt conditions\u201d that force the agent to ask you:\n\n1) **Paywall / credential boundary**\n- Agent must stop and ask you to provide the document *legitimately* (PDF, institutional access, etc.)\n- It can still store citation metadata and an \u201caccess needed\u201d task.\n\n2) **Execution risk boundary**\nCodex has sandboxing + approvals; `--yolo` bypasses them and is explicitly dangerous. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn1view2\ue201  \nYour automation should:\n- default to `--full-auto` not `--yolo` \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n- require explicit human approval for network access enablement / destructive commands\n\n3) **Quality boundary**\nIf the verifier can\u2019t support a key claim with evidence, it must label it \u201chypothesis\u201d and ask whether to spend more budget/time searching.\n\n**Communication artifacts (simple + effective):**\n- `runs/<run_id>/STATUS.md` (what it\u2019s doing, what\u2019s next)\n- `runs/<run_id>/REQUESTS.md` (questions requiring your input)\n- `runs/<run_id>/STOP_CONDITIONS.md` (what triggered interruption)\n\n---\n\n## 7) Save/resume (time-boxed sessions, e.g., your \u201c3 hours\u201d constraint)\n\nYou want \u201csave + resume\u201d across days; there are two layers:\n\n### Layer 1: Codex session resumption\n- `codex exec resume \u2026` supports resuming scripted sessions, including `--last` and `--all`. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view1\ue201  \n- Interactive resume exists too (`codex resume`). \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\nSo your run manifest should record:\n- codex session IDs\n- prompts used\n- files created/changed\n\n### Layer 2: KB run manifests (always)\nAt the end of every phase, write a `run_manifest.json` with:\n- completed tasks\n- pending tasks\n- source IDs ingested\n- vector store ID/version (if using)\n- last checkpoint timestamps\n\nThis makes stopping trivial: the next day you just load the manifest and continue.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Guardrails for hallucinations + provenance (the \u201clibrary science\u201d part)\n\n### Hard rule: every non-trivial factual assertion needs a pointer\nEither:\n- a citation into your corpus (doc_id + span), or\n- a web citation (url + accessed timestamp + captured raw copy if allowed)\n\nCodex\u2019s cached web search reduces prompt injection risk but still says: treat web results as untrusted. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view3\ue201  \nSo you still want ingestion to be the \u201ctrust boundary.\u201d\n\n### Don\u2019t trust summaries unless you can regenerate them\nSummaries drift. Force them to be:\n- derived from doc hashes + prompt templates + model version info\n- reproducible (or at least auditable)\n\n### Use OpenAI\u2019s data controls consciously\nIf you\u2019re uploading your corpus to OpenAI (vector stores / file search), understand the platform\u2019s data controls: the \u201cYour data\u201d guide says API data isn\u2019t used for training unless you opt in. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue202turn8search9\ue201  \n(Still: your canonical archive should be local so you can re-index anywhere.)\n\n---\n\n## 9) Two implementation strategies (pick based on how \u201cagentic\u201d you want)\n\n### Strategy A \u2014 Minimal, robust (my recommended starting point)\n- Use **Codex CLI** for acquisition + local transformations\n- Use **OpenAI vector store + file_search** for retrieval\n- Use a lightweight orchestrator script that enforces phases and writes manifests\n- Add MCP later\n\nThis gets you 80% of value fast.\n\n### Strategy B \u2014 Full agent ecosystem (what you\u2019re gesturing at)\n- Orchestrator built with **Agents SDK** (planner, scout, librarian, verifier, synthesizer) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n- Run **Codex as MCP server** so agents can delegate coding/search/actions to it \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- Expose **KB as MCP server** so deep research + Codex + agents query it \ue200cite\ue202turn7search2\ue202turn3view1\ue201  \n- Use **Deep Research models** when you need a citation-rich \u201cpaper-like\u201d output \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search14\ue201\n\nThis is the \u201cacademic library with staff\u201d model.\n\n---\n\n## 10) A concrete \u201cagent team\u201d you can instantiate\n\n**Planner**\n- breaks query into subquestions + acceptance criteria + search plan\n\n**Scout (Codex CLI)**\n- runs targeted web searches (cached first, live if required)\n- outputs structured candidate lists + gaps\n\n**Librarian**\n- ingestion + dedup + metadata normalization\n- maintains shelves + concept index\n\n**Skeptic/Verifier**\n- converts narrative into claim objects\n- demands evidence pointers; flags disputes\n\n**Synthesizer**\n- produces topic overviews, concept maps, and answers with citations\n- optionally uses deep research model for full reports \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 11) One more critique: don\u2019t over-commit to constant reorganization\n\u201cConstant reorganization\u201d sounds right but can become a time sink.\n\nA better invariant:\n- **Sources are immutable**\n- **Metadata evolves**\n- **Shelves evolve**\n- **Derived artifacts regenerate**\n\nSo reorg becomes: edit metadata + shelves, then run \u201cregen summaries/concept maps,\u201d not manual reshuffling.\n\n---\n\n## 12) If you want a crisp next step\nIf your goal is to build this without getting lost in framework choices:\n\n1) Implement the **disk library + run manifests** first.\n2) Add **Codex exec** as a \u201cscout\u201d that outputs JSON candidate lists. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn5view1\ue201  \n3) Add **vector store + file_search** so you can query your growing corpus without stuffing it into prompts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n4) Only then decide whether you need MCP + multi-agent orchestration.\n\nIf you tell me the **subject area** and what you mean by \u201cdeep research output\u201d (e.g., *survey paper*, *annotated bibliography*, *argument map*, *technical memo*), I can propose:\n- a concrete metadata schema,\n- claim/evidence object structure,\n- and prompt templates for each agent role (planner/scout/librarian/verifier/synthesizer) that work well with Codex CLI + Responses API + file_search + deep research models."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view3\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":995,"end_idx":1034,"safe_urls":["https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/features/","https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/","https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Developers](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/features/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Codex CLI features","url":"https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/features/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Config basics","url":"https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"OpenAI Developers"},{"title":"Command line options","url":"https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"OpenAI Developers"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI Developers"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search4\ue201","start_idx":1874,"end_idx":1906,"safe_urls":["https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/deep_research_api/introduction_to_deep_research_api/","https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/deep_research_api/introduction_to_deep_research_api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Deep research | OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The Deep Research models are specially optimized for searching and browsing through data, and conducting analysis on it.
