You can design the two states to be iso\u2011energetic and still pay the Landauer cost when you irreversibly erase one of them.\n\n### 2\u202f\u202fWhy people say \u201cflip\u201d when they usually mean \u201cerase\u201d  \n\n* A *controlled toggle* (take whatever is 0 to 1 and whatever is 1 to 0) is **logically reversible**; in principle it can be done with arbitrarily little energy if you engineer away losses.\n* Real digital electronics nearly always **overwrite an unknown state with a known one** during writes or resets. That overwrite is an *erasure*, so the Landauer limit applies. Hence the colloquial \u201cflip a bit = pay \\(kT\\ln2\\).\u201d\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fRelationship (or lack thereof) to other energy notions  \n\n| Notion | Relevance to Landauer limit |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| **Classical internal energy \\(U\\)** | The limit concerns heat \\(Q\\) that must be released, not a minimum change in \\(U\\). You can in principle recover most of the switching energy if you engineer a reversible circuit; only the \\(kT\\ln2\\) part *must* be lost as heat. |\n| **Work supplied by power rails** | Practical switching energies (CV\u00b2/2 in CMOS, losses in interconnects, etc.) are *many orders* of magnitude larger than the Landauer limit; those losses are engineering, not thermodynamic, necessities. |\n| **Mass\u2013energy \\(E=mc^{2}\\)** | All forms of energy are equivalent in general relativity, so the \\(kT\\ln2\\) heat could be written as a mass deficit \\(\\Delta m = E/c^{2}\\). At 300\u202fK this is \\(\\sim3\\times10^{-38}\\ \\text{kg}\\) per bit\u2014utterly negligible. The Landauer bound does **not** invoke relativistic mass\u2011energy conversion in any substantive way.|\n\n### 4\u202f\u202fBig picture  \n\n* The Landauer bound is **thermodynamic**, tied to entropy bookkeeping, not to the microphysics of transistors.\n* It becomes technologically relevant only when devices operate close to that scale; today\u2019s transistors dissipate roughly \\(10^{6}\\!-\\!10^{9}\\)\u202f\u00d7 the limit per operation\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201.\n* To beat the limit you must redesign algorithms and hardware to be **logically reversible** (e.g., adiabatic or quantum\u2010reversible computing). Absent that, every irreversible bit erasure, no matter the substrate, owes Nature at least \\(kT\\ln2\\) of heat.\n\nSo, the \u201cminimum energy to flip a bit\u201d is a shorthand for the *minimum unavoidable heat dissipation for one bit of logically irreversible information loss*. It is rooted in thermodynamics, not in the internal\u2011energy landscape of the circuit and only tangentially\u2014mathematically, not practically\u2014in the relativistic mass\u2011energy relation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":486,"end_idx":505,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Landauer's principle","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1748030200.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":2849,"end_idx":2868,"safe_urls":["https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([cs.princeton.edu](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Notes on Landauer's principle, reversible computation ... - cs.Princeton","url":"https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1056193748.0,"snippet":"Landauer's principle, often regarded as the basic principle of the thermodynamics of information processing, holds that any logically irreversible ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"cs.princeton.edu"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3462,"end_idx":3462,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Landauer's principle","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"[PDF] Notes on Landauer's principle, reversible computation ... - cs.Princeton","url":"https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"cs.princeton.edu"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"medium.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://medium.com/%40bill.giannakopoulos/from-landauer-to-einstein-a-formal-bridge-between-bit-erasure-and-mass-energy-equivalence-16ca7334fe7f?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"From Landauer to Einstein: A Formal Bridge Between Bit Erasure ...","snippet":"Landauer's principle tells us that erasing a single bit of information requires a minimum energy expenditure of E = kT ln 2.

It discusses the integration of concepts from nonequilibrium physics, complex systems science, and information theory into biology, suggesting that living systems act like computation agents by collecting and processing information about their environment to survive and reproduce. The analogy of Maxwell's demon \u2013 a theoretical construct that can seemingly defy the second law of thermodynamics by sorting molecules based on energy \u2013 is used to explain how organisms use information for efficient energy management, thus avoiding equilibrium and sustaining life.\n\nThe piece delves into Jeremy England's theory that adaptation in complex systems, whether living or not, derives from the thermodynamic tendency to absorb and dissipate energy efficiently. It suggests that such adaptation can occur without traditional Darwinian evolution mechanisms. The notion that \"prediction machines\" - systems compelled to store and use meaningful information efficiently - can exist is introduced, challenging the exclusive role of genes and natural selection.\n\nThe text concludes with the implication that life's emergence on Earth might not be a rare event but a likely consequence of thermodynamic principles in nonequilibrium systems, suggesting a broader application of these principles beyond Earth.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1486832424.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle","title":"Landauer's principle","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748030200.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68797a150700800780761d9ffbf458a9","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"960d37647a28ce81-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"f00efbe5-7eca-4617-adef-2f8cefac750c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f00efbe5-7eca-4617-adef-2f8cefac750c","children":["7c26cf73-69bf-409c-a7e6-2e42e4e767b7"]},"7c26cf73-69bf-409c-a7e6-2e42e4e767b7":{"id":"7c26cf73-69bf-409c-a7e6-2e42e4e767b7","message":{"id":"7c26cf73-69bf-409c-a7e6-2e42e4e767b7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752791811.838713,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Compiling answer structure","content":"I\u2019ll structure this response by starting with the significance of the Landauer limit, then break it down into key points: \n\n- Maxwell's Demon and thermodynamics foundation \n- Statistical mechanics and the second law\u2019s role in information \n- Quantum measurement and decoherence \n- Quantum thermodynamics and information theory\n- Black hole thermodynamics: connection to Bekenstein bound and Haw","chunks":[],"finished":true}],"source_analysis_msg_id":"bca3615a-e90c-4939-8bcb-2e2ec1b8e2ac"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"960d37647a28ce81-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"e1f9893b-3442-4e7d-ab74-68194b9cf757","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e1f9893b-3442-4e7d-ab74-68194b9cf757","children":["3acd6956-9f93-411a-ad7d-0640501bc060"]},"3acd6956-9f93-411a-ad7d-0640501bc060":{"id":"3acd6956-9f93-411a-ad7d-0640501bc060","message":{"id":"3acd6956-9f93-411a-ad7d-0640501bc060","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752791811.838792,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 40 seconds"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":40,"request_id":"960d37647a28ce81-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"7c26cf73-69bf-409c-a7e6-2e42e4e767b7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7c26cf73-69bf-409c-a7e6-2e42e4e767b7","children":["16d5870f-6045-4502-b682-65e079737486"]},"16d5870f-6045-4502-b682-65e079737486":{"id":"16d5870f-6045-4502-b682-65e079737486","message":{"id":"16d5870f-6045-4502-b682-65e079737486","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752791802.685185,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is a tour of the Landauer limit\u2019s **\u201csecond life\u2019\u2019 in theoretical physics\u2014places where it illuminates basic questions long after we leave the engineering lab.**  I group the roles from the most established to the more speculative, highlighting why theorists keep invoking the bound and what open problems it touches.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Exorcising Maxwell\u2019s demon & sharpening the Second\u202fLaw  \n* **Entropy bookkeeping.**  Bennett\u2019s 1980s reformulation of Maxwell\u2019s demon showed that the demon\u2019s memory must eventually be erased, costing at least \\(k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln2\\) per bit.  This closed the last loophole in the Second\u202fLaw for feedback\u2011controlled, nanoscopic systems.  Since then, Landauer\u2019s bound has been the benchmark for any experiment or gedankenexperiment that couples information flow to heat flow\u2014optical traps, molecular motors, and feedback\u2011cooled levitated nanoparticles. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn5search10\ue201  \n\n* **From bit erasure to general irreversibility.**  Modern nonequilibrium statistical mechanics now treats Landauer\u2019s limit as a special case of a generalized entropy\u2011production inequality that applies to *any* process whose forward and reverse path probabilities differ.  The most complete quantum\u2011many\u2011body test so far\u2014using an ultracold Bose\u2011gas simulator\u2014tracked how far an interacting quantum field deviates from saturating the bound during a global quench. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  Quantum information & communication  \n* **Dynamic Landauer principle.**  A 2025 PRL result proved that, for a broad class of quantum channels, *communicating one classical bit* is thermodynamically equivalent to delivering a quantized packet of work; the usual \\(kT\\ln2\\) cost emerges as the asymptotic limit of many\u2011shot protocols.  This ties energy\u2013information trade\u2011offs directly to the Holevo\u2013Schumacher\u2013Westmoreland capacity theorem. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\n* **Measurement back\u2011action.**  Quantum\u2010thermodynamic analyses of weak measurements show that the minimal heat one must dump to reset the pointer also matches \\(kT\\ln2\\) per lost Shannon bit, supplying a universal floor to \u201cquantum Maxwell demon\u2019\u2019 engines.  The principle thus undergirds proposals for quantum\u2011reversible or error\u2011corrected computing hardware.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Gravity, horizons & the black\u2011hole information puzzle  \n* **Black\u2011hole evaporation saturates Landauer.**  A 2024 study demonstrated that a black hole emitting one bit of Hawking radiation loses exactly \\(kT_{\\mathrm H}\\ln2\\) of mass\u2011energy, with \\(T_{\\mathrm H}\\) the Hawking temperature; in other words, Nature runs the most *thermodynamically efficient* eraser imaginable. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \n\n* **Cosmological horizons behave differently.**  A 2025 analysis of de\u202fSitter space found that information passing through a cosmological apparent horizon does **not** in general obey the bound, hinting that Landauer\u2019s logic might break down for quasi\u2011local energy descriptions in expanding spacetimes\u2014an emerging \u201ccosmological information paradox.\u2019\u2019 \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n\n* **Towards a unified information bound.**  Recent attempts to merge Landauer\u2019s limit with Bekenstein\u2019s entropy/energy bound (and, by extension, the holographic principle) aim to put all horizon thermodynamics under one information\u2011theoretic roof, with potential clues for quantum\u2011gravity degrees of freedom. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4.  Biophysics & the thermodynamics of life  \nCells, neural networks, and even bacterial chemotaxis are now modelled as information\u2011processing engines.  Analyses of gene\u2011regulatory circuits and sensory adaptation show that their free\u2011energy budgets are ultimately constrained by Landauer\u2019s cost per internal bit they overwrite.  This links evolutionary \u201cfitness for energy efficiency\u2019\u2019 to a hard physical floor. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 5.  Frontier questions  \n\n| Topic | Why Landauer matters |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| **Quantum error correction at finite\u2011T** | How much *cooling power* must an error\u2011corrected quantum computer dump per logical qubit per cycle?  The bound sets the unavoidable part. |\n| **Entropic gravity programmes** | If gravity emerges from coarse\u2011graining microscopic DOF, erasing those DOF must have a Landauer cost.  Can this reproduce Newtonian forces quantitatively? |\n| **Dark\u2011energy thermodynamics** | Some holographic dark\u2011energy models parametrize cosmic acceleration as the heat cost of horizon\u2011scale information loss, again circling back to the \\(kT\\ln2\\) floor. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \nOutside of electronic hardware, **Landauer\u2019s limit is best viewed as the Rosetta\u2011stone linking information, entropy, and energy in any physical theory**.  It:\n\n1.\u00a0Completes the Second\u202fLaw for autonomous or feedback\u2011controlled nanosystems.  \n2.\u00a0Provides a yardstick for quantum irreversibility and communication capacity.  \n3.\u00a0Sets an efficiency ceiling for horizons, sharpening black\u2011hole thermodynamics and perhaps quantum gravity.  \n4.\u00a0Frames biological and evolutionary energetics in information\u2011theoretic terms.\n\nEach domain uses the same simple inequality\u2014but the questions it answers keep getting deeper."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn5search10\ue201","start_idx":886,"end_idx":919,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Maxwell's demon - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1033373186.0,"snippet":"How Maxwell's Demon Continues to Startle Scientists \u00b7 Bennett, C.

To respect the second law, the environment\u2019s entropy must rise by at least the same amount, which\u2014at temperature\u202f\\(T\\)\u2014means dumping a minimum heat \\(Q_{\\min}=T\\Delta S=k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln2\\). This is the *Landauer bound* first stated in 1961\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2002Why \u201cirreversibility\u2019\u2019 is the crux  \n*Logical irreversibility* (many inputs \u2192 one output, e.g. reset\u2011to\u20110) forces physical irreversibility because there is no one\u2011to\u2011one map from final microstates back to initial ones. Reversible operations (bit\u2011swap, Fredkin gate, adiabatic charge transfer) need **no fundamental cost**; any losses are engineering imperfections. Contemporary reviews treat Landauer\u2019s limit as the *\\(\\varepsilon\\to0\\)* case of a universal entropy\u2011production inequality for arbitrary stochastic maps\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2002Maxwell\u2019s demon exorcised  \nIn the 1980s Bennett showed that the demon\u2019s *memory erasure* costs \\(kT\\ln2\\) per bit, restoring the second law and embedding information in classical thermodynamics\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201. This resolution generalised the demon from a thought experiment into a design principle for feedback\u2011controlled nano\u2011engines.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2002Laboratory verifications outside electronics  \n| Physical platform | Result | How close to \\(kT\\ln2\\)? | Ref. |\n|-------------------|--------|-------------------------|------|\n| **Nanomagnetic islands** | Adiabatic single\u2011bit erasure | \\(1.1\\,kT\\) | \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 |\n| **CMOS\u2011like charge\u2011based logic** | Sub\u2011\\(kT\\) systematic study | \\(1.4\u20132.0\\,kT\\) | \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue201 |\n| **Ultracold Bose gas (quantum field)** | First many\u2011body test of Landauer | Within 10\u202f% of bound; mutual\u2011info term resolved | \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search6\ue201 |\n\nThese experiments show that the principle is **substrate\u2011agnostic**: any *physical* memory\u2014spin, charge, phonon mode, collective quantum field\u2014obeys the same thermodynamic bookkeeping.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2002Quantum information & thermodynamic resource theories  \nA 2025 PRL established a *dynamical Landauer principle*: transmitting one classical bit through a noisy quantum channel is thermodynamically equivalent to delivering a work packet of \\(kT\\ln2\\) in the asymptotic limit\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201. The result anchors information capacity, work extraction, and irreversibility in a single framework, extending Landauer\u2019s logic to quantum communication, error\u2011correction overheads, and one\u2011shot resource theories.\n\n---\n\n### 6\u2002Horizons, gravity and the deep ultraviolet  \nRecent analyses reinterpret **Hawking radiation** as the most efficient possible erasure process: each radiated bit reduces the black\u2011hole mass\u2011energy by exactly \\(kT_{\\mathrm H}\\ln2\\)\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201. This dovetails with the Bekenstein bound and holographic principle, suggesting that *horizon thermodynamics is an information\u2011erasure ledger*.

Classical thermodynamics is full of implicit \u201cbits\u2019\u2019:\n\n* **Gas-in-box memories:**  The left/right particle of a Szilard engine, or the *N*-particle generalisation where a piston\u2019s position encodes a string of bits.  \n* **Phase bits:**  Solid \u2194 liquid (e.g. paraffin phase-change memories); liquid \u2194 vapour (bubble nucleation used in classic cloud-chamber detectors).  \n* **Hydraulic logic:**  Fluid in upper vs lower reservoir, exploited in fluidic computers of the 1960s.\n\nWhenever you *irreversibly* collapse such a two-state system into a single preferred state (e.g. letting the gas expand and removing the partition), the environment must absorb at least \\(k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln2\\) of heat **per lost bit of distinguishability**\u2014precisely the Landauer limit.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Mechanical systems\n\n* **Levers, gears, pendula** can store information in position or angular momentum.  Victorian \u201clogic engines\u2019\u2019 and modern micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) latches both realise this.  \n* In principle, a *reversible* mechanical computer (\u00e0 la Fredkin\u2013Toffoli billiard ball model) could approach the Landauer bound: energy is exchanged as ballistic momentum, and dissipation occurs only where a path merges (i.e. at logical irreversibility).\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Nuclear and astrophysical contexts\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t *use* stars or nuclei as computer memories, they *do* possess information-bearing degrees of freedom:\n\n| Context | \u201cBit\u2019\u2019 analogue | How it might be reset/erased | Practical relevance |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Nuclear spin/isomer state** | Ground-state vs long-lived isomer (e.g. \\(^{178\\text m}\\)Hf) | \u03b3-emission stimulated by photon or collision | Nuclear-isomer batteries & speculative gamma lasers\u2014erasure releases MeV photons, dwarfing \\(kT\\ln2\\) at stellar temperatures. |\n| **Proton\u2013proton vs CNO cycle in a star** | Branch choice in reaction network | Convection mixes products; later burning stages overwrite nuclei | Each reaction path \u201cforgets\u2019\u2019 earlier microstate choices; entropy rise already included in stellar thermodynamics. |\n| **Magnetic polarity of a sunspot** | Flux tube pointing N or S | Reconnection events | Solar dynamo continually erases & recreates magnetic bits, dissipating energy as coronal heating. |\n\nIn these high-energy settings the *thermodynamic floor* \\(kT\\ln2\\) is **negligible** compared with the reaction Q-values (keV\u2013MeV) or magnetic energy densities (kJ m\\(^{-3}\\)).  Landauer\u2019s principle still holds formally, but it is swamped by other irreversibilities.\n\n---\n\n### 6\u2003Key lessons for \u201cbits in the wild\u201d\n\n1. **Ubiquity:**  Bits are everywhere once you realise they are simply mutually exclusive macrostates.  \n2. **Landauer\u2019s scope:**  The bound applies **whenever** a process *coarse-grains* many microstates into fewer distinguishable outcomes and the system is in contact with a heat bath at \\(T\\).  \n3. **Scale hierarchy:**  \n   * In low-energy technologies (CMOS, nanomagnets, biochemical pathways) \\(kT\\ln2\\) can be a *measurable fraction* of operating budgets.  \n   * In nuclear or stellar contexts, the same bound is satisfied but utterly eclipsed by larger energy scales; it rarely constrains dynamics.  \n4. **Information vs entropy bookkeeping:**  Even when no one is \u201creading\u2019\u2019 the bits, Nature still \u201cpays\u2019\u2019 the cost when distinguishability is lost; the price is hidden in the global entropy balance.\n\nSo, whether you are actuating a MEMS latch, toggling an MRAM cell, or watching a reactor core churn nuclei toward iron, you are witnessing *physical embodiments of information*.  The Landauer limit is the universal bookkeeping rule that tells you how much entropy must accompany the act of forgetting which state the system was in."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5699,"end_idx":5699,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"960d835a9a7b3dcb-IAD","message_type":"variant","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"f66bd890-3a5f-4f87-a945-5cbabdeeef7b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"f66bd890-3a5f-4f87-a945-5cbabdeeef7b","children":["b7da239e-9804-4d6e-8db4-36a98f458351"]},"8bd68617-84c9-43b4-8840-2cbae11caa39":{"id":"8bd68617-84c9-43b4-8840-2cbae11caa39","message":{"id":"8bd68617-84c9-43b4-8840-2cbae11caa39","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752794800.560599,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"open\": [\n    {\n      \"ref_id\": \"turn0search0\",\n      \"lineno\": 80\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"960d81255a6e3dcb-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"ac6c0d46-bd16-43b0-8a23-1fcacc259acb","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"ac6c0d46-bd16-43b0-8a23-1fcacc259acb","children":["62eb6a2c-3fdf-49cf-bef2-cbb17227d131"]},"b7da239e-9804-4d6e-8db4-36a98f458351":{"id":"b7da239e-9804-4d6e-8db4-36a98f458351","message":{"id":"b7da239e-9804-4d6e-8db4-36a98f458351","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752795900.533,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Suppose I have a sample of an ideal gas in a sealed container.

a sealed container of ideal gas *can* be said to **store information in the Landauer sense**\u2014but with important qualifications about *what kind* of information, how it's accessed, and when erasure occurs.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Basic idea**: Information is physical\n\nFrom Landauer\u2019s principle, **information is not abstract**\u2014it is physically embodied in distinguishable states. If a system has multiple *distinguishable*, *stable*, and *controllable* macrostates, it encodes information.\n\nSo, the key questions for your gas system are:\n- What are the **logical macrostates**?\n- Can we **reset** or **erase** them irreversibly?\n- Is the gas in contact with a thermal bath (so \\(T\\) is well-defined)?\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Gas properties that embody information**\n\n| Degree of freedom | Example of encoding |\n|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Particle number** \\(N\\) | Is it a 1-particle or 2-particle system? (Szilard engine setup) |\n| **Position** | Is the gas localized in left/right half of the box? |\n| **Momentum distribution** | Is it thermalized or not? (e.g. Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann vs nonequilibrium) |\n| **Species type** | Gas A vs Gas B? Can be used as chemical \u201cbits\u201d |\n| **Microstate** | Individual particle positions/momenta encode huge Shannon entropy\u2014but not accessible or useful for *logical* information without coarse-graining |\n\nTo encode *useful* information (like a \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d), we need **macroscopically distinguishable states**, such as:\n- gas in left half = \u201c0\u201d; right half = \u201c1\u201d\n- particle present = \u201c1\u201d; no particle = \u201c0\u201d (single-particle Szilard engine)\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Can Landauer erasure be applied to an ideal gas?**\n\nYes, but only when **you perform a logically irreversible operation** on the gas's macroscopic state. For example:\n\n#### \u2705 Canonical case: *Szilard engine*\n- A single gas particle is in a box.\n- A partition is inserted, and you determine which side the particle is on (i.e. extract 1 bit).\n- Later, to erase that bit, you compress the gas to one side, which requires doing \\(k_{\\mathrm B}T \\ln 2\\) of work (or equivalently, dumps that much heat to a bath).\n- **This is the classic Landauer scenario.**\n\n#### \u2705 Multi-particle version (Generalized Szilard)\n- Multiple distinguishable particles with known configurations (say, three on left, five on right).\n- Erasure = force all to one side \u2192 increase order \u2192 release heat.\n\n#### \u274c No meaningful information\n- If the gas is already in global equilibrium and fully delocalized, then it doesn't *store* a bit of logical information\u2014there's nothing to erase.\n- Entropy is maximal, but **no distinguishable macrostates** are being collapsed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Is this relevant in thermodynamics of real gases or stars?**\n\nOnly in principle.\n\n- In classical thermodynamics (e.g. a gas expanding in a piston), entropy changes and energy flows happen, but we don\u2019t usually track **individual bits of information**.\n- In statistical mechanics, the entropy \\(S = k_{\\mathrm B} \\ln \\Omega\\) *counts* the microstates, but does not always correspond to useful, accessible \u201cinformation\u201d.\n- In stars or bulk matter, Landauer\u2019s limit is trivially satisfied\u2014erasure events (if any) cost **far more** energy than the minimum \\(kT \\ln 2\\).\n\n---\n\n### 5. **So what does a gas teach us about Landauer\u2019s principle?**\n\nThe ideal gas is **a perfect conceptual test bed** for Landauer-style reasoning:\n\n- It exemplifies the connection between *logical irreversibility* and *thermodynamic entropy production*.\n- It shows how **measurement**, **feedback**, and **resetting** cost energy even in minimal systems.\n- It motivates generalized nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the role of *information entropy* in physical systems.\n\nBut unless the gas is used in a structured setting (like a Szilard engine or feedback-control protocol), we **don\u2019t usually treat it as storing or erasing logical information** in practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final summary\n\nYes, a sample of ideal gas **can** store and process information in the Landauer sense\u2014*if and only if*:\n- It\u2019s in a distinguishable macrostate used as a logic state (e.g. particle position),\n- You later **erase** that state (restore to a default),\n- And the process is thermodynamically irreversible (e.g. compressing against pressure).\n\nOtherwise, it is just a thermodynamic system with entropy\u2014but not a memory device in the Landauer sense."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"960d9c4a1eedcdde-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"c9b6d6f2-d691-4837-92e5-24c438514863","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c9b6d6f2-d691-4837-92e5-24c438514863","children":["7d59af18-92b9-4b8d-be70-b51bbcdfc6fc"]},"b0b27021-fe5d-4ce5-a549-1d05bd1d63f4":{"id":"b0b27021-fe5d-4ce5-a549-1d05bd1d63f4","message":{"id":"b0b27021-fe5d-4ce5-a549-1d05bd1d63f4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752794823.180937,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n

An atom **can** encode information in the Landauer sense *by virtue of its discrete quantum energy levels*, **only when** those levels are used as physically *distinguishable*, *controllable*, and *logically meaningful* states. Merely existing with discrete states is **not enough**.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this carefully.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **What does the discreteness of energy levels mean?**\n\nQuantum mechanics guarantees that:\n- Electrons in atoms occupy **quantized energy eigenstates**.\n- These states are **discrete** and **stable** (with long coherence or radiative lifetimes in many cases).\n- They are **distinguishable in principle** (e.g. via spectroscopy), and transitions between them can be induced by absorbing or emitting photons.\n\nSo yes: a hydrogen atom in the ground state \\(1s\\) is physically different from one in the excited state \\(2p\\), and that difference is objectively measurable.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Does this constitute information *in the Landauer sense*?**\n\nOnly **conditionally**. Landauer\u2019s principle applies to *logically encoded* information, i.e., when you have:\n\n| Requirement | Satisfied by atom\u2019s energy levels? |\n|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Physically distinguishable states** | \u2705 Yes\u2014quantized levels \\(E_n\\) |\n| **Stability** (long enough to be used) | \u2705 Often yes, depending on the level |\n| **External controllability** | \u2705 In many systems (e.g., laser excitation, field tuning) |\n| **Logical labelling / encoding** | \u274c Not unless you designate states (e.g., \\(E_1 = 0\\), \\(E_2 = 1\\)) |\n| **Erasure / reset operation** | \u274c Not unless you actively reset the atom to a fixed state |\n\nThus, an atom **has the *potential* to encode information**, but only if *you or a physical process* makes use of that potential in a logically structured way.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Examples where atoms *do* encode information**\n\n| Application | Description | Landauer relevance |\n|-------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| **Qubits (quantum computing)** | Quantum information stored in two-level atomic (or ionic) systems | Yes: erasure or decoherence costs at least \\(kT\\ln 2\\) per bit in irreversible resets |\n| **Atomic clocks** | Transitions between hyperfine levels define precise states | Yes, indirectly\u2014logical state used for time encoding |\n| **Quantum memories** | Atomic ensemble stores photonic qubit as a collective excitation | Yes, state must be reset for reuse (erasure) |\n| **Spectroscopic encoding** | Atom prepared in level \\(E_n\\) for optical readout | Yes, if used as logical carrier |\n\nIn all these, **information is physically written, read, or erased**\u2014so Landauer applies.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **But if you just have a random atom\u2026**\n\nA hydrogen atom floating in space with its electron in some eigenstate (say, \\(n = 2\\)) does **not**, by default, encode information in a Landauer-relevant way. Why?\n\nBecause:\n- The state is not part of any controlled logical scheme.\n- There is no defined \u201cbit\u201d being stored.\n- There is no measurement, encoding, or erasure process involved.\n- No external entropy is reduced by \"knowing\" the atom is in that state.\n\n**Analogy:** Just because the Moon has a position and momentum doesn\u2019t mean it encodes a \u201cbit.\u201d Only if a system *uses* that state to store and manipulate logical information does Landauer\u2019s theory come into play.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **When would erasure of atomic state incur the Landauer cost?**\n\nSuppose you prepare an atom in an unknown state (e.g., some mixed superposition), and then **reset it to the ground state** regardless of its input.\n\nThis is a **logically irreversible operation**, and so it must:\n- Increase the environment\u2019s entropy by at least \\(k_{\\mathrm B} \\ln 2\\) per bit erased,\n- Release heat or dump entropy to a reservoir,\n- Be constrained by the Landauer limit.\n\nThis is relevant for:\n- Resetting qubits during computation,\n- Recycling states in quantum sensors,\n- Quantum thermodynamic engines.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Summary\n\nAn atom **does not inherently encode information in the Landauer sense** just by having discrete energy levels.  \nBut **if those levels are used to encode, manipulate, and erase logical states**, then yes\u2014the atom becomes an information-bearing physical system, and Landauer\u2019s bound **does apply**.\n\nIn short:\n> **Potential for information is not actual information.**  \n> **Actual erasure of logical information = physical entropy cost.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"960db29d4a574059-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"548bb1e7-80c4-433c-bcba-797b1e61242a","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"548bb1e7-80c4-433c-bcba-797b1e61242a","children":["16af58fc-cf47-4424-9563-c174aeb8e6d6"]},"e09ebac7-03bb-4b97-b596-9a8bd8de9ea2":{"id":"e09ebac7-03bb-4b97-b596-9a8bd8de9ea2","message":{"id":"e09ebac7-03bb-4b97-b596-9a8bd8de9ea2","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1752794830.318591,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mdpi.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/10/3/150","title":"Information Equation of State","snippet":"Total lines: 129\n","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.mdpi.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68797a150700800780761d9ffbf458a9","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"960d81255a6e3dcb-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"e3815a08-d4dd-454a-8769-4d773fea760c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e3815a08-d4dd-454a-8769-4d773fea760c","children":["cd6a2c17-38b1-4f2e-8fd8-7a5c7e2a8aac"]},"16af58fc-cf47-4424-9563-c174aeb8e6d6":{"id":"16af58fc-cf47-4424-9563-c174aeb8e6d6","message":{"id":"16af58fc-cf47-4424-9563-c174aeb8e6d6","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752805552.407,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Why does a black hole Hawking Radiation have anything to do with the Landauer limit if a black hole can be completely described using macroscopic parameters like mass and rotational angular momentum?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"960e87eeba97fd2d-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"da953861-7731-459a-95e2-54a0f3882dfd","children":["76fdba49-0a60-4c2a-bcd1-31d93b75d775"]},"cd6a2c17-38b1-4f2e-8fd8-7a5c7e2a8aac":{"id":"cd6a2c17-38b1-4f2e-8fd8-7a5c7e2a8aac","message":{"id":"cd6a2c17-38b1-4f2e-8fd8-7a5c7e2a8aac","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752794833.185041,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Finding more references","content":"I found an article mentioning both star formation and the Landauer principle, which is great.

This touches on a subtle but profound tension in theoretical physics: **how something as seemingly \"simple\" as a black hole with just a few macroscopic parameters can still encode\u2014and erase\u2014vast amounts of information**. Let's address this in layers.\n\n---\n\n## 1.\u2003The paradox: few parameters vs vast entropy\n\nYou're absolutely right:\n\n> **A classical black hole** in general relativity is fully specified by just a few macroscopic parameters:\n> - Mass \\(M\\)\n> - Charge \\(Q\\)\n> - Angular momentum \\(J\\)\n\nThis is the **\u201cno-hair theorem\u2019\u2019**: it implies that the black hole has no internal structure\u2014no internal \"microstate\" labels that an outside observer can access. This makes black holes look like **thermodynamic dead ends**, or information sinks.\n\nYet:\n\n> **The Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy** of a black hole is\n> \\[\n> S_{\\text{BH}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm B} A}{4\\ell_{\\mathrm P}^2}\n> \\]\n> where \\(A\\) is the area of the event horizon and \\(\\ell_{\\mathrm P}\\) is the Planck length.\n\nThis implies that a black hole of mass \\(M\\) has an entropy of order \\(10^{77}\\,k_{\\mathrm B}\\) for a solar-mass black hole\u2014*colossal*.\n\nSo: **how can an object with only a handful of macroscopic observables have such a vast entropy?**\n\nThis is where **Landauer\u2019s principle** enters the scene\u2014not in the classical description of the black hole, but in the *quantum thermodynamic interpretation* of its evaporation.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u2003Hawking radiation *erases* information from the black hole\n\nWhen a black hole emits Hawking radiation:\n- It loses mass and energy.\n- Its horizon area shrinks \u2192 entropy decreases.\n- The surrounding spacetime gains radiation quanta (i.e. photons, gravitons, etc.) that carry energy and entropy away.\n\nNow assume:\n- Each radiated quantum is **not entangled** with the internal microstate (Hawking's original 1975 calculation).\n- Eventually, the black hole evaporates entirely.\n\nThis leads to a **paradox**: what happened to the black hole\u2019s initial entropy \\(S_{\\text{BH}}\\)? Did information get destroyed?\n\nBut from **Landauer's point of view**, here's the reinterpretation:\n> **Each emitted quantum represents an \"erasure\" of a bit of internal black hole state**\u2014a loss of a logical degree of freedom.\n> This erasure must cost at least \\(k_{\\mathrm B}T_{\\text{H}}\\ln 2\\) per bit.\n\nAnd remarkably:\n- The Hawking temperature \\(T_{\\text{H}} = \\frac{\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi G M k_{\\mathrm B}}\\) sets the **minimum energy** of each radiated bit.\n- The black hole loses energy in quanta of exactly the scale required to **saturate** the Landauer bound:\n  \\[\n  E_{\\text{bit}} = k_{\\mathrm B} T_{\\text{H}} \\ln 2\n  \\]\n\nSo black hole evaporation can be viewed as:\n- A series of **information-erasing steps** (each quantum radiated),\n- That collectively **pay the exact thermodynamic price** required to reduce the black hole's entropy from \\(S_{\\text{BH}}\\) to zero.\n\nHence: **black holes are the most efficient erasers in the universe**\u2014they saturate the Landauer limit at every step.\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u2003Reconciling \u201cno hair\u201d with information content\n\nSo how do we square this with the fact that black holes are classically characterized by only \\(M\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(J\\)?\n\nHere\u2019s how theorists currently interpret it:\n\n| Classical GR perspective | Quantum gravity interpretation |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| No internal structure; all states with same \\(M, Q, J\\) are indistinguishable | There exists a *huge number* of quantum microstates corresponding to the same macroscopic \\(M, Q, J\\) |\n| No information inside the hole accessible to the outside | The entropy \\(S_{\\text{BH}}\\) counts the *logarithm of the number of internal quantum states* consistent with the same exterior parameters |\n| No hair | Quantum hair exists\u2014encoded subtly in correlations, soft modes, or stringy degrees of freedom |\n\nThe **statistical mechanical interpretation** of black hole entropy (from string theory, loop quantum gravity, holography, etc.) is that:\n\n> **A black hole encodes a huge number of microstates in its internal structure\u2014even if the classical observer can only see a few parameters.**\n\nTherefore, **evaporation via Hawking radiation is a physical process that erases those microstates** bit by bit. And since the entropy of those states is known (via \\(S_{\\text{BH}}\\)), the **Landauer cost per bit is exactly \\(kT\\ln2\\)**, with the correct \\(T = T_{\\text{H}}\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4.\u2003Why this matters for modern physics\n\nThis idea has had enormous impact:\n\n- **Quantum gravity**: It links thermodynamic reasoning (entropy and Landauer\u2019s principle) to black hole physics.\n- **Holography and AdS/CFT**: The principle that \u201cinformation is preserved\u201d and that Hawking radiation must encode microstates led to holography and firewall debates.\n- **Quantum information theory**: Black holes behave as quantum information processors\u2014scramblers, thermalizers, and encoders.\n- **Foundational physics**: Landauer\u2019s principle becomes part of the \u201cinformation\u2013energy\u2013entropy\u201d triad even in gravitational settings.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer\n\n> A black hole may appear classically simple, but quantum mechanically it contains a huge number of microstates consistent with its mass and spin.  \n> As it emits Hawking radiation, it *erases* this hidden information bit by bit.  \n> Each bit must be erased at a cost of at least \\(k_{\\mathrm B} T_{\\text{H}} \\ln 2\\), in exact agreement with the Landauer limit.  \n> Thus, Hawking radiation is *the most efficient possible thermodynamic erasure of information*, and black hole thermodynamics embodies Landauer\u2019s principle in its most extreme form."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"960e87eeba97fd2d-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"16af58fc-cf47-4424-9563-c174aeb8e6d6","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"16af58fc-cf47-4424-9563-c174aeb8e6d6","children":[]},"bd5d281b-7663-468f-a6a6-bd8b56f86654":{"id":"bd5d281b-7663-468f-a6a6-bd8b56f86654","message":{"id":"bd5d281b-7663-468f-a6a6-bd8b56f86654","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752794830.467245,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"search_query\": [\n    {\n      \"q\": \"black hole landauer principle hawking radiation kT ln 2 per bit\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"black hole landauer principle hawking radiation kT ln 2 per bit"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","request_id":"960d81255a6e3dcb-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"cd6a2c17-38b1-4f2e-8fd8-7a5c7e2a8aac","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"cd6a2c17-38b1-4f2e-8fd8-7a5c7e2a8aac","children":["7bc25d00-0ba1-428e-b13e-25f398452d70"]},"7bc25d00-0ba1-428e-b13e-25f398452d70":{"id":"7bc25d00-0ba1-428e-b13e-25f398452d70","message":{"id":"7bc25d00-0ba1-428e-b13e-25f398452d70","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1752794832.5308754,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"arxiv.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08777v1","title":"Hawking radiation and the Landauer Principle - arXiv","snippet":"We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics.
