Below, I'll explain how it works and provide insights into its functionality in the context of Google Colab and Google Drive.\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Imports Required Libraries:**\n   - `gzip`: For reading `.gz` compressed files.\n   - `os`: For handling file paths and directories.\n\n2. **Defines a Function: `unzip_gz_file`:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `filepath`: The full path to the `.gz` file you want to unzip.\n     - `extract_dir`: The directory where the extracted file will be saved. If not provided, it defaults to the same directory as the `.gz` file.\n   - **Functionality:**\n     - Opens the `.gz` file in binary read mode (`'rb'`).\n     - Creates the output file path by removing the `.gz` extension.\n     - Reads the compressed file content and writes it to the output file.\n\n3. **Logs Completion:**\n   - Prints a confirmation message showing the source and destination paths.\n\n4. **Example Usage:**\n   - Specifies a file in Google Drive (`/content/drive/MyDrive/my_file.gz`) and unzips it in the same directory.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use in Google Colab**\n\n1. **Mount Google Drive:**\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import drive\n   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n   ```\n\n2. **Prepare the File Path:**\n   - Make sure the `.gz` file exists in your Google Drive (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/my_file.gz`).\n\n3. **Run the Code:**\n   - Copy and paste your function and example usage into a Colab cell.\n   - Ensure the `filepath` matches the actual file path in your Google Drive.\n\n---\n\n### **Advantages of This Code**\n- **Customizable Extraction Directory:** You can control where the file is unzipped.\n- **Python-Only Solution:** Avoids shell commands like `gunzip`, making it cross-platform and portable.\n- **Safe File Handling:** Uses `with` statements to ensure proper file closure.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Enhancements**\n- **Error Handling:** Add a `try-except` block to catch issues like a missing file or permission errors.\n  ```python\n  try:\n      unzip_gz_file(filepath)\n  except FileNotFoundError:\n      print(\"The specified file does not exist.\")\n  except Exception as e:\n      print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n  ```\n- **Batch Processing:** Modify the function to process all `.gz` files in a directory.\n\nWould you like to enhance this further or adapt it for a specific use
