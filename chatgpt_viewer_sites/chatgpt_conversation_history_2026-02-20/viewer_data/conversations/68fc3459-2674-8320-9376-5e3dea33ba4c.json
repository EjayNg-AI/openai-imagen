Maximality implies the covering property:\n\\[\n\\forall z\\in S_n\\ \\exists x\\in D_n\\ \\ d(z,x)<2^{-(n+3)}.\n\\]\nSet\n\\[\nD:=\\bigcup_{n\\ge1}D_n\\subseteq U.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: \\(D\\) is discrete\nFix \\(x\\in D_n\\). Because \\(x\\in S_n\\), the numbers\n\\[\n\\delta^{-}(x):=\\rho(x)-2^{-(n+1)}>0,\\qquad \\delta^{+}(x):=2^{-n}-\\rho(x)>0\n\\]\nare positive. Define\n\\[\nr_x:=\\tfrac12\\min\\!\\bigl\\{\\,2^{-(n+3)},\\ \\delta^{-}(x),\\ \\delta^{+}(x)\\,\\bigr\\}>0.\n\\]\nWe claim \\(B(x,r_x)\\cap D=\\{x\\}\\).\n\n- If \\(y\\in D_n\\setminus\\{x\\}\\), then by separation \\(d(x,y)\\ge 2^{-(n+3)}>2r_x\\).\n- If \\(y\\in D_m\\) with \\(m\\ge n+1\\), then \\(\\rho(y)\\le 2^{-(n+1)}\\), hence\n  \\[\n  d(x,y)\\ \\ge\\ |\\rho(x)-\\rho(y)|\\ \\ge\\ \\rho(x)-2^{-(n+1)}=\\delta^{-}(x)\\ \\ge\\ 2r_x.\n  \\]\n- If \\(y\\in D_m\\) with \\(m\\le n-1\\), then \\(\\rho(y)\\ge 2^{-n}\\), hence\n  \\[\n  d(x,y)\\ \\ge\\ |\\rho(y)-\\rho(x)|\\ \\ge\\ 2^{-n}-\\rho(x)=\\delta^{+}(x)\\ \\ge\\ 2r_x.\n  \\]\n\nThus \\(B(x,r_x)\\) meets \\(D\\) only at \\(x\\), proving \\(D\\) is discrete.\n\n### Step 3: \\(\\partial U\\subseteq D'\\) (every boundary point is a limit of \\(D\\))\nFix \\(b\\in\\partial U\\) and \\(\\varepsilon>0\\). Because \\(b\\) is on the boundary, there exists \\(z\\in U\\) with \\(d(b,z)<\\varepsilon/4\\). Let \\(m\\) be the (unique) index with \\(2^{-(m+1)}<\\rho(z)<2^{-m}\\), so \\(z\\in S_m\\). By the covering property of \\(D_m\\), pick \\(x\\in D_m\\) with\n\\(d(z,x)<2^{-(m+3)}\\). For \\(m\\) large enough we have \\(2^{-(m+3)}<\\varepsilon/4\\), and then\n\\[\nd(b,x)\\ \\le\\ d(b,z)+d(z,x)\\ <\\ \\varepsilon/4+\\varepsilon/4\\ =\\ \\varepsilon/2.\n\\]\nHence every neighborhood of \\(b\\) meets \\(D\\). Therefore \\(b\\in D'\\) and \\(\\partial U\\subseteq D'\\).\n\n### Step 4: \\(D'\\subseteq \\partial U\\)\nLet \\(x\\in X\\setminus\\partial U\\).\n\n- If \\(x\\in X\\setminus\\overline U\\), then \\(d(x,U)>0\\) and thus \\(B(x,d(x,U)/2)\\cap D=\\varnothing\\); so \\(x\\notin D'\\).\n- If \\(x\\in U\\), set \\(\\delta:=\\rho(x)>0\\). Choose \\(M\\) with \\(2^{-M}<\\delta/8\\) and put\n\\[\nr:=\\min\\Bigl\\{\\frac{\\delta}{16},\\ \\min_{1\\le n\\le M}2^{-(n+4)}\\Bigr\\}>0.\n\\]\nFor \\(n\\ge M+1\\) and any \\(y\\in D_n\\), we have \\(\\rho(y)\\le 2^{-n}<\\delta/8\\), hence\n\\(d(x,y)\\ge \\rho(x)-\\rho(y)>\\tfrac{7}{8}\\delta>2r\\).\nFor each fixed \\(n\\le M\\), the set \\(D_n\\) is \\(2^{-(n+3)}\\)-separated, so \\(B(x,r)\\) contains **at most one** point of \\(D_n\\). There are only finitely many such \\(n\\), hence \\(B(x,r)\\cap D\\) is finite; thus \\(x\\notin D'\\).\n\nTherefore \\(D'\\subseteq \\partial U\\).\n\n---\n\nCombining Steps 3 and 4 gives \\(D'=\\partial U\\). In words:\n\n> **The boundary \\(\\partial U\\) of any open set \\(U\\) in a metric space is exactly the set of accumulation points of some discrete subset \\(D\\subseteq U\\).**\n\n#### Remarks\n- Degenerate cases are consistent: if \\(U=\\varnothing\\) or \\(U=X\\), take \\(D=\\varnothing\\) and \\(D'=\\varnothing=\\partial U\\).\n- The construction uses only metrizability (via the 1-Lipschitz function \\(\\rho\\)) and works verbatim in any metrizable space."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"c9dc545b-eba6-481e-8e5b-471b24ecc691","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d2a1f1eb-128f-479d-9e48-6889f6153613","turn_exchange_id":"cefcc8a4-e9d5-4e6e-9775-c5abdd311d62","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"d2a1f1eb-128f-479d-9e48-6889f6153613","children":[]}}}
