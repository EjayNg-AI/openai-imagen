I'm guessing \"Vitali Formulae\" refers to Vieta\u2019s formulas. To proceed, I'll explore showing the discriminant of g is positive or that the roots are related to f\u2019s roots, possibly via a transformation.\n\n**Computing derivatives and term-by-term expansion**\n\nI\u2019ve computed the derivatives: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b, f''(x) = 6x + 2a, and f'''(x) = 6. Now, for g(x) = f(x) + a f'(x) + b f''(x) + c f'''(x), term-by-term:\n\n- x^3 term: just x^3.\n- x^2 terms combine to 4a x^2.\n- x terms combine to 7b x + 2a^2 x.\n\n**Final expansion of g(x)**\n\nFor the constant terms: c + ab + 2ab + 6c simplifies to 7c + 3ab. After double-checking, everything seems correct. Thus, g(x) simplifies to:\n\ng(x) = x^3 + 4a x^2 + (2a^2 + 7b) x + (3ab + 7c).\n\nSo, g(x) is a cubic with coefficients in terms of a, b, and c.\n\n**Applying Vieta\u2019s formulas to g(x)**\n\nThe task involves using Vieta\u2019s formulas for the real distinct roots of f: \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. These satisfy the relations: \n\n- \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = -a, \n- \u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b3\u03b1 = b, \n- \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = -c.\n\nNow, I need to show that g(x) has 3 distinct real roots, possibly involving symmetric functions of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Maybe something like 1/\u03b1, 1/\u03b2, 1/\u03b3. I will compute g(x) in terms of f's derivatives.\n\n**Evaluating g(x) at the roots of f(x)**\n\nI need to show that g(x) has 3 distinct real roots, possibly involving symmetric functions like 1/\u03b1, 1/\u03b2, 1/\u03b3, or \u03b1 + 1/\u03b1. By evaluating g at the roots of f, I can see that f\u2019s roots aren't necessarily the roots of g because g(r) doesn't always equal zero. I\u2019ll express f\u2019s coefficients using Vieta\u2019s relations: f(x) = x\u00b3 - S\u2081x\u00b2 + S\u2082x - S\u2083.\n\n**Relating g(x) coefficients to Vieta\u2019s formulas**\n\nUsing Vieta\u2019s formulas, I can express the coefficients of g(x) in terms of the sums and products of the roots \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3. The coefficient of x\u00b2 becomes -4S1, while the coefficient of x comes out to be 2S1\u00b2 + 7S2. Considering a = -S1, b = S2, and c = -S3, I have a consistent set of expressions for the coefficients.\n\n**Exploring the roots of g(x) through factorization**\n\ng(x) can be expressed as x\u00b3 - 4S1x\u00b2 + (2S1\u00b2 + 7S2)x - (3S1S2 + 7S3) in terms of Vieta\u2019s relations. Now, we need to demonstrate that g(x) has three distinct real roots. The discriminant could help with that, but it\u2019s a bit tricky to calculate. An alternative approach might involve transforming g(x) and analyzing the factorization.\n\n**Exploring patterns in g(x) through root assumptions**\n\nI'm experimenting with different ways to express the roots of g. If \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are roots of f, could g(t) be expressed as a product involving these? For a symmetrized approach, I\u2019m considering affine transformations of the \u03b1_i using parameters p and q. I\u2019ll adjust these to match the Vieta relations.\n\n**Adjusting coefficients to match Vieta\u2019s relations for g**\n\nI\u2019m adjusting parameters p and q to match the Vieta\u2019s relations for the polynomial g(x). The idea is that if the roots u_i are linear transformations of \u03b1_i, they\u2019ll preserve the distinctness. Now, I need to find constants A and B that make the sum of the roots match the desired sum from the polynomial form.\n\n**Matching coefficients to determine A and B**\n\nI\u2019m trying to compute the sum of the roots (S1') for g(x). Based on the criteria, I know that S1' must equal 4S1. That gives the condition A + 3B = 4, assuming S1 isn\u2019t zero. Then, I\u2019ll proceed to check the next elementary symmetric sum, S2'.\n\n**Computing sums for coefficients**\n\nI\u2019m working on computing the sum \u03a3_{i<j} u_i u_j by breaking it down into smaller parts. I know that S2' should match 2 S1^2 + 7 S2, from the coefficients. Using known expressions for \u03a3 u_i and \u03a3 u_i^2, I need to equate coefficients for S1^2 and S2, then solve for A and B step-by-step. I'll proceed with this systematic approach.\n\n**Solving for A and B values**\n\nOkay, the expression from Sympy gives us a system of equations. We know that A^2 = 7, so A = \u00b1\u221a7. Then we also have the equation 2AB + 3B^2 = 2, and from earlier, A + 3B = 4. I\u2019ll solve these equations simultaneously, keeping track of the signs and checking for real solutions.\n\n**Revisiting the polynomial for clarity**\n\nI realized there might not be a real solution when solving the system simultaneously. I had assumed S1' = 4S1 earlier, but I should double-check the polynomial form. In a typical monic cubic, the sum of the roots is -p. For g(x) = x\u00b3 + 4a x\u00b2, I concluded S1' = 4S1, so the setup seems correct, but I need to clarify further.\n\n**Clarifying root sums and relations**\n\nI\u2019m working through the monic cubic equation and the relationships between coefficients and roots. For g(x), the coefficient A1 is 4a, leading to S1' = -A1 = -4a. Since S1 = -a, this gives S1' = 4S1, which is correct. The equation \u03a3 u_i = S1(A+3B) holds with A + 3B = 4, so everything checks out.\n\n**Verifying the \u03a3 pairs equation**\n\nI need to verify my equations based on \u03a3 pairs = A^2 S2 + (2AB + 3B^2) S1^2 = 2 S1^2 + 7 S2. The equations I got were A^2 = 7 for S2, and 2AB + 3B^2 = 2 for S1^2. I ran into an issue with no solution, so I might need to check the \u03a3 pairs calculation more carefully. I'll also recheck the polynomial expression.\n\n**Completing the expression and mapping to S1, S2**\n\nIt seems like I truncated the expression earlier. I should capture the full expression and make sure to map it correctly to S1 and S2 to ensure everything aligns properly in the calculations. Let\u2019s work through the exact terms and coefficients one more time.\n\n**Manually simplifying Spairs expression**\n\nSympy didn't handle the rewriting well, so I'll manually substitute S1, S2, and S3 using their relationships. To simplify, I\u2019ll expand Spairs_direct, collect terms like \\(a_1^2\\), and then apply the identities\u2014such as \\(S_1^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + 2S_2\\). If everything's correct, I expect it to simplify to 0.\n\n**Re-evaluating system of equations and factorization**\n\nThe formula looks correct, but the system might still be inconsistent. I might have mis-signed or incorrectly expressed \\(g(x)\\) in terms of \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\), and \\(S_3\\). Let\u2019s re-derive the expression for \\(g(x)\\) carefully, checking coefficients, and re-compute the expansions to confirm.\n\n**Expressing g(x) in terms of S's**\n\nSymPy gave me \\( g(x) = x^3 + 4a x^2 + (2a^2 + 7b) x + (3ab + 7c) \\), which looks good. Now, I need to rewrite this expression using \\( S_1 \\), \\( S_2 \\), and \\( S_3 \\) to see if everything matches up as expected. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n**Re-running after fixing import issue**\n\nThe error I encountered was due to a wrong import, which doesn't really affect the main calculations. Now that I know the cause, I'll fix it and re-run everything from the beginning with the correct imports. This should ensure no further issues come up. Let's go ahead with that.\n\n**Substituting values into the equation**\n\nNow, I'll go ahead and substitute the known values into the equation. This should allow me to simplify everything and move forward with solving the problem. I'll carefully make sure everything aligns correctly, step by step, so I don't miss anything.\n\n**Verifying g(x) and sum-product relationships**\n\nThe expression for \\(g(x)\\) looks correct now: \\( x^3 - 4 S_1 x^2 + (2 S_1^2 + 7 S_2) x - (3 S_1 S_2 + 7 S_3) \\). The constant term check matches expected values. Now we have relationships for \\( S_1', S_2', S_3' \\) tied to the sums and products of the roots. Time to compute the next expression to link everything.\n\n**Solving for A and B using elimination**\n\nI need to express the product in terms of \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\). Manual methods would be complicated, so I plan to use SymPy's elimination approach, expressing \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\) in terms of \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\). To avoid handling formal polynomials, I\u2019ll solve for constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) using linear equations from several generic triples.\n\n**Checking consistency of ansatz for A and B**\n\nWe compute \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\) and the transformed values \\( S_1', S_2', S_3' \\) from both the formula and ansatz. By solving for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), checking consistency across triples helps test the validity of the ansatz. However, since the equations don't yield a solution, the ansatz is invalid. A new approach is needed.\n\n**Exploring differential operator interactions**\n\nI\u2019m considering a potential relationship where \\( g(x) = (x^2 + k...) f'(x) + ... \\), but I\u2019m not entirely sure yet. I want to dig deeper into the structure of \\( g \\) and explore it algebraically. It seems like \\( g(x) \\) could be derived from a linear differential operator applied to \\( f \\), with coefficients \\( a, b, c \\) depending on \\( f \\). Now, I need to check if this operator preserves the reality of roots in monic cubics.\n\n**Considering g(x) discriminant and factorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about expressing \\( g(x) \\) in terms of \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\), potentially factoring it as a product of three linear terms. To prove that \\( g(x) \\) has three distinct real roots, it might be enough to show that its discriminant is positive, just as the discriminant of \\( f(x) \\) with distinct roots is greater than 0.\n\n**Exploring discriminant relationship and Vitali formulas**\n\nI\u2019m considering using Sturm sequences or Lagrange interpolation, and exploring how to express the coefficients of \\( g \\) using symmetric sums in the roots of \\( f \\). Since the problem suggests using Vieta\u2019s formulas, I\u2019ll examine the discriminants of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) and test if they are related, with the hope that \\( \\Delta(g) \\) is proportional to \\( \\Delta(f) \\).\n\n**Exploring the relation between discriminants of f and g**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the discriminant of \\( f \\) and comparing it to \\( g \\). Since \\( \\Delta_f \\) matches the general form, I\u2019ll try expressing \\( \\Delta_g \\) in terms of \\( \\Delta_f \\) or as a factorized form where \\( \\Delta_f \\) plays a role. Maybe it factors as a polynomial times \\( \\Delta_f \\).\n\n**Revisiting the relationship between the discriminants**\n\nIt seems I made a mistake earlier; sympy gave me a rational function. Maybe \\( \\Delta_f \\) doesn\u2019t divide \\( \\Delta_g \\) after all. Another approach: I\u2019ll try calculating the GCD of \\( \\Delta_f \\) and \\( \\Delta_g \\) with sympy to get a better sense of their relationship.\n\n**Exploring the relationship between \\( \\Delta_g \\) and \\( \\Delta_f \\)**\n\nIt turns out that \\( \\Delta_g \\) isn\u2019t just a constant times \\( \\Delta_f \\), and their signs aren\u2019t directly related. The discriminant method is challenging, but I might be able to show that \\( \\Delta_g > 0 \\) when \\( \\Delta_f > 0 \\). Alternatively, I can explore root representations\u2014writing \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) in product form might help, especially if \\( g(x) \\) factors nicely.\n\n**Factorizing g(x) and evaluating derivatives**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of factoring \\( g(x) \\) as a product of three linear factors, with coefficients depending on \\( a, b, c \\) or symmetric sums. To proceed, I'll use Vieta\u2019s relations to express these in terms of the roots, and evaluate at \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\). I'll also use derivatives of \\( f(x) \\) for useful simplifications.\n\n**Computing g(\u03b1) and factorization approach**\n\nI\u2019m computing \\( g(\\alpha) \\) by incorporating \\( f(\\alpha) \\), \\( f'(\\alpha) \\), and higher derivatives, using known relations for the coefficients \\( a, b, c \\). I\u2019ll express this in terms of symmetric polynomials and might factor \\( g(\\alpha) \\) to check signs, which could help in proving the existence of a root between \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\n**Alternating signs of g and using IVT**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that showing \\( g(\\alpha) \\), \\( g(\\beta) \\), and \\( g(\\gamma) \\) alternate signs could let me apply the Intermediate Value Theorem and prove that there are 3 distinct real roots for the cubic. I need to find the signs of \\( g(\\alpha) \\), \\( g(\\beta) \\), and \\( g(\\gamma) \\), possibly via derivatives.\n\n**Exploring g's root behavior and derivatives**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how we can evaluate \\( g \\) at its roots using derivatives, but it might be tricky to mark the signs. An alternative idea is to explore whether there\u2019s a transformation from \\( f \\) to \\( g \\) that keeps real-rootedness intact, using concepts like multiplier sequences or differential operators.\n\n**Exploring the operator relationship between f and g**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to express \\( g \\) as a linear combination of the derivatives of \\( f \\), with coefficients matching the constant term, linear term, etc. This leads to the realization that \\( g \\) could be represented by a polynomial differential operator. This relationship preserves the real-rootedness of polynomials, as shown by P\u00f3lya-Schur.\n\n**Evaluating root properties through operator applications**\n\nIf \\( f \\) has distinct real roots \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), and \\( \\gamma \\), the roots of the related polynomial \\( P \\) are \\( 1/\\alpha \\), \\( 1/\\beta \\), and \\( 1/\\gamma \\). However, for real-rootedness preservation, the condition on the signs of these roots isn't always guaranteed. The P\u00f3lya-Schur operator theory suggests that this holds for certain conditions, like when zeros of polynomials maintain real-rootedness under transformation.\n\n**Exploring relationship between g(x) and f(x)**\n\nI'm reviewing how \\( g(x) \\) can be represented in terms of \\( f(x) \\)\u2019s derivatives. It seems like the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) for a cubic function relate to its derivatives at 0. Specifically, \\( a = f''(0)/2 \\), \\( b = f'(0) \\), and \\( c = f(0) \\). I can express \\( g(x) \\) with a combination of these derivatives.\n\n**Exploring factorization of g(x)**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about expressing \\( g(x) \\) by substituting the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in terms of the roots \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), \\( \\gamma \\) of \\( f(x) \\). I can try factoring \\( g(x) \\) using these roots and see if it produces a factored form. Let\u2019s try that with symbolic manipulation.\n\n**Exploring factorization approaches for g(x)**\n\nSympy didn\u2019t factor as expected, possibly because \\( g(x) \\) is a cubic in \\( x \\), but also a polynomial in \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), and \\( \\gamma \\). Factoring it over the rational function field might be tricky, but I could try using \\( g(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) specifically to simplify.\n\n**Considering alternate factorization methods for g(x)**\n\nFactoring a polynomial with rational function coefficients over \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), and \\( \\gamma \\) typically requires solving a cubic equation, and the roots might involve radicals. Sympy sees \\( g(x) \\) as irreducible because it only factors over fields where \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), and \\( \\gamma \\) are treated as indeterminates. This hints at the need for a different approach.\n\n**Exploring alternatives to express g(x)**\n\nI'm considering using a root-locating argument. Since the derivative \\( f' \\) has two real roots between the roots of \\( f \\), maybe I can evaluate \\( g(x) \\) at those points to understand its sign pattern. I might also need to explore other expressions and combinations of \\( f(x) \\) and its derivatives to check how \\( g(x) \\) relates.\n\n**Exploring a simpler approach with linear algebra**\n\nI think it might be simpler than I imagined. Since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are cubic, monic polynomials, I might express \\( g(x) \\) as a linear combination of \\( f(x) \\) and its derivatives. Using linear algebra, I'll treat \\( f(x) \\) and its derivatives as vectors to achieve this. I'll explore this further with root space considerations.\n\n**Exploring operator and Lagrange methods for expressing g(x)**\n\nI\u2019m considering viewing the coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) as a vector in the monomial basis. Derivative operations seem like they correspond to a matrix, which might work symmetrically at the roots \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\), but that may not lead anywhere useful.\n\nInstead, using Lagrange interpolation might help represent the evaluation of g as a cubic linked to \\( f(x) \\), especially since \\( f(x) \\) is cubic. I also look into differential operators and their connection to polynomials.\n\n**Exploring polynomial stability and discriminant relationships**\n\nIt seems there\u2019s a deeper idea of \"stability preservers,\" but using that here might be overcomplicating it. Rather than that, I\u2019m considering simpler approaches tying \\( g(x) \\) to \\( f(x) \\). I might focus on how the discriminants of \\( g \\) and \\( f \\) relate and try to link inequalities based on their roots to show \\( g \\)\u2019s discriminant is positive. It\u2019s tricky, but manageable. I\u2019ll also look into factorization and signs of differences at roots.\n\n**Focusing on differences for factorization**\n\nI should factor the expression in terms of the differences between the roots, like \\( (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) \\), \\( (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3) \\), and \\( (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1) \\). That could simplify things. I'll go ahead and try applying a factorization approach to see how it works in this context.\n\n**Factoring and expressing g(\u03b1)**\n\nSymPy didn't factor things as neatly as I hoped. So, let's focus on factoring in terms of differences, like (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2). I suspect g(\u03b1) involves terms like (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)(\u03b1\u2212\u03b3), but the rest isn\u2019t straightforward. I'll express f\u2019s derivatives and see if we can write g(\u03b1) in a more symmetric way using known forms. Let's work with the coefficients and try re-expressing g(\u03b1).\n\n**Simplifying expression**\n\nThe output is a complicated expression, but we're focusing on checking if the difference equals zero. I'll work on simplifying it step-by-step, so we can clearly evaluate it. Hopefully, once it's more manageable, the difference will become obvious. Let's simplify this mess!\n\n**Checking for zero result**\n\nLooks like the output got truncated, but no worries! I\u2019ll go ahead and store the result and then print it out to verify if it\u2019s exactly zero. That way, I can confirm if everything\u2019s working as expected. Let's see if we get the desired outcome!\n\n**Recomputing g\u03b1 and verifying consistency**\n\nLooks like the formula for g\u03b1 was misrepresented\u2014it doesn't equal zero as I thought. The expression for g\u03b1 is more complicated and can\u2019t be simplified using just derivatives. But the approach is clear: calculate g\u03b1 by plugging x = \u03b1 into the formula, then cross-check the result with earlier computations. Let\u2019s recompute and verify!\n\n**Verifying g\u03b1 consistency**\n\nOkay, the results for g_alpha1 and g_alpha2 match! That's a good sign\u2014they're consistent with each other. Now we can be confident that the computation is on track. I'll proceed with the next steps since this part checks out.\n\n**Correcting the g\u03b1 formula**\n\nI made a mistake earlier in expressing g\u03b1. I had incorrectly replaced the constants when specifying the formula. The correct form is: g(\u03b1) = -S1 f'(\u03b1) + S2 f''(\u03b1) - 6S3, where f'''(\u03b1) equals 6. So the term -6S3 is correct, not -S3 as I initially thought.\n\n**Confirming the correct g\u03b1 formula**\n\nThe formula for g_alpha2 now matches what we expected: -S1*(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)(\u03b1\u2212\u03b3) + S2*(6\u03b1\u22122S1) \u2212 6S3. Earlier discrepancies were likely due to a mis-run or reused variables. Now that the formula is clear, we can proceed with factoring g(\u03b1) in terms of differences.\n\n**Reframing approach for g(x) analysis**\n\nThe current approach just gives the original complex fraction, which doesn't simplify much, and sign analysis is tricky. I\u2019m considering a different method now: defining h(t) = f(t)^2 and working through its derivatives. This might reveal a pattern, possibly with a Wronskian-like structure for cubic f. Let's try!\n\n**Considering root behavior with f's derivatives**\n\nWe know that f has three distinct real roots, and the polynomial space spanned by its derivatives has a dimension of at most 4. I\u2019m exploring the possibility of using transformations, like linear fractional maps, to show that g has all real roots by normalizing f. Let's proceed carefully!\n\n**Ensuring transformation maintains root property of g**\n\nI need to check that the transformation keeps g\u2019s three distinct real roots invariant. The coefficients of g change when we transform f, so I need to ensure that this property holds after the transformation. Restricted cases might help, but there's some messiness in the transformation process.\n\n**Exploring cubic transformation**\n\nI\u2019m considering a new approach where we apply a change of variables for a cubic monic function. We\u2019d transform f into g1 using that change, computing its new coefficients. Then, I'd verify how this transformation relates to the original g by working out the scaling relationship. Let\u2019s try doing this with symbolic computation.\n\n**Testing invariance of real roots**\n\nI believe the statement \"g has 3 distinct real roots\" holds for g1, because an affine transformation doesn\u2019t change the number or distinctness of real roots\u2014only their positions. We\u2019ll check this by substituting symbolic transformations (u,v) and comparing the coefficients in a symbolic computation to see if invariance holds.\n\n**Computing and comparing coefficients**\n\nWe can express h(y) as a cubic polynomial with coefficients A, B, and C. Now, using these, we\u2019ll compute g1(y) by summing h, and its derivatives weighted by A, B, and C. Then, we\u2019ll verify the affine transformation by comparing g1(y) to g_affine_normal_reference(y). Let's check if they match.\n\n**Understanding invariance and translation**\n\nThe invariance of the mapping only holds under scaling (v=0), not translation, as the difference is proportional to v. This is expected because the coefficients transform nonlinearly under translation, and the combination used in g is not fully translation-covariant. So, we can scale, but shifting isn't allowed. However, I could attempt a different approach by completing the cube for the monic cubic polynomial.\n\n**Considering translation and root relationships**\n\nThe shift by v = \u2212a/3 violates the earlier assumption, meaning the mapping won't preserve the formula with new coefficients, so we can't use the depressed form to prove the property. Let's not worry about translation invariance and focus on the general case. I'll try plugging in numeric values for the roots \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 of f(x) to investigate root relationships in g(x). Then, we'll see if we can derive a general pattern.\n\n**Examining relationships between roots of f(x) and g(x)**\n\nIn the first example with roots (\u22122, 0, 3), g's roots are approximately [-4.9, 0.43, 8.47], but it\u2019s tricky to spot a direct linear combination. I\u2019ll compute sums and other relations between the roots of f and g. For now, it looks like the roots of g are rescaled versions of those of f.\n\n**Checking symmetric sums of f and g roots**\n\nThe sum of g's roots equals 4 times the sum of f's roots, which is confirmed. Now I\u2019m looking at other symmetric sums: for S2(f), it\u2019s \u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b1\u03b3. For S2(g), it could be something like 2*S1^2 + 7*S2. I\u2019ll check that next.\n\n**Studying relative ordering of roots numerically**\n\nThe predictions match up well, which is good. Now, I want to examine the relative ordering of the roots numerically for each example. I\u2019ll rank g\u2019s roots and try to spot patterns. My guess is that g\u2019s roots will either be all outside the interval [\u03b1, \u03b3] or have two outside and one inside. Let\u2019s compute that.\n\n**Exploring relationships between roots of f and g**\n\nFor the first triple (-2, 0, 3), g has one root less than \u03b1, one root between \u03b1 and \u03b3, and one root greater than \u03b3. For the second triple (0, 1, 2), g\u2019s roots fall as expected: one between \u03b1 and \u03b2, and others greater than \u03b3. The third and fourth triples seem to show a similar pattern where one root falls inside the interval, and others are outside. However, there's a small confusion about precise placements, like the root close to -1.\n\n**Exploring patterns in root relationships for f and g**\n\nFor the given sets of f roots and corresponding g roots, a consistent pattern hasn\u2019t emerged. The interior roots seem to vary, and I can\u2019t find a simple symmetry. Instead, I'll try to express g as a composition of f and a linear transformation to preserve the real roots. I\u2019ll test this out numerically.\n\n**Examining alternative relationships between f and g**\n\nIt looks like an affine transformation doesn\u2019t work for mapping the roots of f to g. Maybe there's a deeper connection, like g being the companion polynomial for the companion matrix of f. I\u2019m considering how the matrix's eigenvalues, interactions, and polynomial properties might yield g\u2019s roots. Let\u2019s explore that.\n\n**Exploring the connection between f and g through companion matrix**\n\nIf f is a monic cubic with companion matrix C and eigenvalues \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, the goal is to find the polynomial P such that applying P to C gives a characteristic polynomial matching g. This would ensure g\u2019s roots are real and distinct. Now, I need to find P such that its characteristic polynomial yields g.\n\n**Exploring how to match symmetric polynomials to P(t)**\n\nWe know the symmetric polynomials S1', S2', and S3' in terms of S1, S2, and S3, so we could try to find a polynomial P(t) = u t + v t^2 + w t^3 that matches these symmetric sums. However, we must ensure that the polynomial P(t) has scalar coefficients depending on S1, S2, and S3 but remains independent of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3.\n\n**Considering polynomial mappings and eigenvalue relations**\n\nFor each polynomial f, I want to map the root set {\u03b1_i} to {u_i}, where u_i is determined by a function F(\u03b1_i, S1, S2, S3). The matrix P(C)\u2019s characteristic polynomial is defined by coefficients depending on scalar values, and we can express P(t) based on a, b, c. This allows polynomial dependencies without requiring a universal P.\n\n**Exploring potential connections between polynomials**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of P(C) doesn\u2019t necessarily match g directly, but by adjusting the coefficients of P, I can attempt to make the match. However, there might be another approach: could g be related to the reciprocal polynomial f* or the conjugate polynomial? I'll explore these ideas, like how the derivative could play a role.\n\n**Exploring derivative relationships between f(x) and its reciprocal version**\n\nLooking at f(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, I can rewrite F(x) = x\u00b3 f(1/x). Now, I want to connect derivatives: f'(x) should relate to F(1/x) and its derivatives. Specifically, f'(x) involves terms like 3x\u00b2F(1/x) and -xF'(1/x). I'll compute this to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Computing f(x) in terms of F_inv**\n\nI want to express f(x) in terms of F_inv, so I write it as f(x) = x\u00b3 F_inv. I'll need to compute the derivatives and other related terms based on this formulation. Let's proceed with those calculations carefully to avoid confusion or mistakes.\n\n**Exploring g(x) in terms of F_inv**\n\nI see that expressing g(x) as a combination of f, f', f'', and f''' works out consistently. We can also rewrite these derivatives in terms of F_inv and its derivatives with respect to x, though it might be more complex. It might be useful to factor the expression in terms of x\u00b3 and a polynomial in 1/x, similar to how we define F_inv. We\u2019ll compute that next.\n\n**Attempting to express g(x) as polynomial H(1/x)**\n\nI\u2019m thinking we might express g(x) as x\u00b3 times a polynomial H(1/x) and analyze H. Its coefficients might be related to the reciprocals of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 in a straightforward way. We previously defined F(u) = u\u00b3 f(1/u), and now I\u2019m considering defining G(u) = u\u00b3 g(1/u) and seeing if we can express it in terms of F and its derivatives.\n\n**Confirming reverse polynomial relationship between F(u) and G(u)**\n\nSo, from my expression, F(u) equals 1 + a u + b u\u00b2 + c u\u00b3, which is as expected (the reverse of the polynomial for f). For G(u), I get 1 + 4a u + (2a\u00b2 + 7b) u\u00b2 + (3ab + 7c) u\u00b3, matching exactly the reverse of g. So, F(u) is the reverse of f, and G(u) is the reverse of g.\n\n**Exploring relationship between G and F**\n\nInterestingly, I\u2019m considering whether G can be expressed as a polynomial of F or its derivatives, but the coefficients of G seem directly derived from F's. The transformation from F to G is linear, with G = M \u2022 [1, a, b, c]^T, which implies a matrix representation. The key question is whether G\u2019s roots are distinct and real, similar to F's. I'll keep mulling it over.\n\n**Exploring the relationship between f, F, and G**\n\nSo, if \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are the roots of f, then 1/\u03b1, 1/\u03b2, 1/\u03b3 become the roots of F. Since \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are distinct, their reciprocals must also be distinct. G seems to match this pattern, aiming for 3 real distinct roots. I'm thinking of expressing g as a combination of f and its derivatives.\n\n**Analyzing g and its relationship to f**\n\nI\u2019m trying to break down g(x) by plugging it into a series expansion. By collecting terms and restructuring it as a convolution, I\u2019ll express g_m using coefficients and some polynomial factors. Given that the transformation is linear, we can explore how it might preserve real-rootedness and possibly diagonalize with respect to orthogonal polynomials.\n\n**Testing the roots of g**\n\nI'm considering the roots of g(x) based on Vieta's formula and trying to express them as linear combinations with integer coefficients. I hypothesize that the roots might correspond to a weighted harmonic mean of the roots of f. I\u2019ll verify my new guess by calculating the sum of these possible roots symbolically.\n\n**Exploring a rational representation for g(x)**\n\nI\u2019m looking into finding a rational expression for the roots of g(x). I want to express them as a linear combination of the roots \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 with integer coefficients, and I\u2019ll work out some hypothetical matrix equations for the coefficients. Then, I'll solve for the unknowns using Vieta's relations.\n\n**Imposing symmetry on the matrix equation**\n\nIt seems like there are too many unknowns for just three equations, so I need to add symmetry constraints. I\u2019ll guess that the coefficients in each row of the matrix follow a pattern, and based on the sum of the u_i\u2019s, I realize that each column should sum to 4. I\u2019ll use this constraint to work through the problem.\n\n**Testing a simple symmetrical candidate matrix**\n\nI\u2019m considering a simple matrix candidate where each diagonal element is 4, and the others are 0. This would give us roots {4\u03b1, 4\u03b2, 4\u03b3}. From here, I\u2019ll check if the resulting sums match what I expect for S1', S2', and S3', but it doesn\u2019t seem to work out. I'll need to adjust the rows of the matrix to match the desired conditions.\n\n**Exploring a symmetric matrix pattern**\n\nI\u2019m trying a symmetric matrix for the pattern where each row has the same coefficients, but they're permuted cyclically. This ensures invariance in the polynomial under the permutation of roots (since both f and g are symmetric). I can express this as U = sJ + (r - s)I and check the relationships between the coefficients. It seems that the earlier form I was exploring with u_i = A \u03b1_i + B S1 is essentially the same as the form I just outlined.\n\n**Considering alternate approaches with real roots**\n\nWe explored symmetric matrices for g's roots before, but these led to unsolvable equations. So, we know a simple symmetric form won't work. Now, I\u2019m thinking maybe we can use a philosophical angle: a cubic polynomial and its derivatives can also have three real roots. I want to test combinations involving f, f', and higher derivatives while ensuring the roots remain real. Let's explore this further and see if the form we choose maintains the root realness.\n\n**Testing polynomial root distributions**\n\nI just remembered a key fact: for a real polynomial with all simple, real roots, its derivative has real roots interlacing with them. I'm thinking of trying a linear combination of the polynomial and its derivative to see if we maintain real roots. To test this, I'll use a cubic polynomial with roots at 0, 1, and 2, and check the roots of both p(x) and p(x) + p'(x). Let's see what happens!\n\n**Testing for real roots in q**\n\nTo test the roots of q, I\u2019ll check if \\( q = p - p' \\) results in three real zeros. I\u2019ll use a specific polynomial to investigate this case and confirm if the hypothesis holds. It\u2019s important to see if the polynomial and its derivative produce a valid root distribution.\n\n**Exploring interlacing roots and combinations**\n\nI\u2019m testing if any \u03bb combination of the polynomials p and q will consistently result in real roots. There\u2019s a known result that if two real polynomials have interlacing zeros and a nonzero Wronskian, any real linear combination will also have only real roots. This is supported by the Obreschkoff theorem.\n\n**Exploring sequential linear combinations and root preservation**\n\nSince f\u2032 and f\u2032\u2032 have interlacing zeros, I can try combining them sequentially, starting with f and f\u2032, then adding f\u2032\u2032, and so on. Each step should preserve real roots as long as the polynomials we combine maintain real interlacing zeros. Still, I have to be careful around constants like f\u2032\u2032\u2032, which complicates things.\n\n**Expressing g as a combination of f and its derivatives**\n\nI could express g as a combination of f, f\u2032, f\u2033, and f\u2032\u2032\u2032, but the theorem needs constant coefficients. For now, I might try reorganizing the expression or integrating by parts. However, I realize that f\u2033 is linear, and so is its combination, which may allow for a different approach using derivatives.\n\n**Expressing g(x) and simplifying \u2113(x)**\n\nI computed h(x) as a linear polynomial and defined \u2113(x) as a linear combination of constants. Then, I expressed g(x) as a combination of f, f', and \u2113(x). I realized that \u2113(x) could potentially be written as a linear combination of f, f', and f'', with constant coefficients.\n\n**Considering real roots of g(x) and discriminant approach**\n\nWe can't represent \u2113(x) as a linear combination of f, f', and f'' with constant coefficients because of the mismatch in dimensions. However, we can attempt to prove that g(x) has three real roots by finding its discriminant. If it\u2019s greater than 0, g(x) will have distinct real roots.\n\n**Exploring discriminant relationships and root parameterization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of grinding down the formula for \u0394_g, aiming to express it in terms of \u0394_f and other squares. If we can structure it like a sum of positive squares, we can prove \u0394_g > 0. For simplicity, I might consider an easier parameterization of roots and check the connections between the coefficients and roots of g(x). Let\u2019s see.\n\n**Exploring rational relationships between g and f**\n\nI'm playing with the idea of expressing g's roots using rational functions of \u03b1 and other sums. Instead of guessing, I\u2019ll try using Vieta's formulas and a flexible parametric approach to see if a pattern emerges. This could help simplify g(\u03b1)/f'(\u03b1) and uncover sign patterns for further analysis.\n\n**Exploring rational expressions for T(t)**\n\nI\u2019m thinking to express T(t) as some linear or quadratic function in terms of the roots, and assess how it behaves at those roots. I'll attempt symbolic manipulation to compute T(t) by defining f(t) and g(t). Substituting at the roots might clarify if this is manageable or still too complex.\n\n**Attempting polynomial division for g(t)**\n\nI plan to perform polynomial division to express g(t) as q(t) times f'(t), plus a remainder r(t). At the roots (t=\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), the remainder r(t) will give us the values of g(t). If r(t) is simple, that will make analyzing the sign of g at the roots easier.\n\n**Deriving g(t) at roots**\n\nI've calculated q(t) and r(t), and now I have an expression for g(t). At each root (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) of f, g(t) simplifies to a linear function, g(r) = A r \u2212 B, where A and B are constants independent of the roots. This means the values of g at the roots are linear. That's a key finding!\n\n**Evaluating g at the roots**\n\nNow that I have the expression for g(r) = A r \u2212 B, I can simply compute g(\u03b1), g(\u03b2), and g(\u03b3) by substituting the roots \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 into the formula. Since the expression is linear, it should be straightforward to find these values at each root. Let me compute those.\n\n**Recomputing q(t) and r(t) with updated formulas**\n\nI think we might have missed something when adjusting S1, S2, and S3 earlier. To be careful, I should recompute both q(t) and r(t) systematically using sympy. I'll go ahead and run the full process again to make sure everything lines up, especially checking the calculation of g(t) and making sure everything keeps matching with the correct terms.\n\n**Clarifying the relationship between g(t) and f'(t)**\n\nOkay, I see now that g(t) equals (t/3 \u2212 10 S1/9) f'(t) + r(t), where r(t) is linear with coefficients A and B. But here\u2019s the catch: the identity involves polynomial coefficients in S1, S2, and S3. When evaluating at the root of f, f' does not vanish, so there's no cancellation like I initially thought.\n\n**Refining the analysis with stationary points**\n\nOkay, here's the correction: I was wrong to assume \"g(r) = r(r)\" at f\u2019s roots. For the polynomial identity, if t is a root of f, no simplification happens. But if t is a root of f', then f'(t) = 0, and we get a simplification for p(t). We should focus on the stationary points of f', where f'(t) = 0, and analyze the sign of g there.\n\n**Analyzing 3 real roots for g based on stationary points**\n\nWe only have two stationary points (since f' is quadratic), but we need to find three real roots for g (which is cubic). The idea is to evaluate g at the stationary points and at \u00b1\u221e, which should reveal sign changes and prove the presence of three real roots. The roots of f' interlace those of f, so we\u2019re good there.\n\n**Using polynomial division to find sign changes for g**\n\nWe already know the form of g(x) via polynomial division: g(x) = h(x) f'(x) + \u2113(x), where h(x) = x/3 - 10S1/9 and \u2113(x) = A x - B. At the roots of f', g(y_i) simplifies to \u2113(y_i). To analyze the signs, I'll compute y1 and y2, then determine their relation to A, B, and \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3.\n\n**Analyzing roots and sign changes for g**\n\nWe can find y1 and y2 as roots of f'(x). By using Vieta\u2019s formulas, we calculate their sums and products. Then, we evaluate \u2113(y1) and \u2113(y2) to check for sign changes, meaning g has a root between them. Considering g\u2019s behavior at \u00b1\u221e, this shows at least three roots. However, we need more systematic analysis to confirm exact values and their positioning.\n\n**Identifying turning points and roots of g**\n\nThe goal is to identify if cubic g has 3 real roots by analyzing its stationary points y1, y2. When the discriminant is positive, three real roots exist, which is equivalent to g(y1) * g(y2) < 0. While we can't directly use g's derivative, we focus on showing two distinct turning points with opposite signs to confirm 3 real roots.\n\n**Using Sturm's theorem or sign changes for roots of g**\n\nTo find the real roots of g, we can apply Sturm's theorem: count the sign changes in the Sturm chain at \u00b1\u221e. We can use the known relationships between f and g without needing to recompute the full Sturm chain. Since f's roots interlace with f', we can use these to approximate.\n\n**Tracking sign changes of g by dividing by f**\n\nWe could track the sign of g at \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 by dividing g by f. This gives us a quadratic remainder r(t). By examining the quadratic's sign at these points, we may infer that g has three real roots. However, we need to consider the discriminant and find more information for a full analysis.\n\n**Analyzing sign changes of g using its quadratic remainder**\n\nWe know that g = f + r, where r is quadratic. At the roots of f (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), g behaves like r. If the signs of r at these points alternate, r must vanish somewhere between them. To fully track g, we might need to compute r explicitly and look at its roots or use Sturm's theorem.\n\n**Exploring the connection between f, g, and Vieta\u2019s formulas**\n\nI\u2019m considering how g(x) is related to f(x) and its derivatives. Parameters like a, b, c describe a family of polynomials, and derivatives with respect to those parameters lead to the terms in g. There is also a mix-up with \"Vitali's formula,\" which I think is meant to refer to \"Vieta's formulas\" for cubic equations.\n\n**Exploring discriminants and root behavior in polynomials**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about using Vieta\u2019s formulas to relate the zeros of g to those of f, considering symmetric combinations of the roots. There\u2019s a lot of detailed work ahead on g\u2019s discriminant and comparing \u0394_f and \u0394_g, with a possible use of sympy to factor and analyze the expressions.\n\n**Determining discriminant of g**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the discriminant of g. I\u2019ll compute it as a polynomial in x, which will give insight into the nature of its roots. This step is part of analyzing the relationship between g and f, and it should help clarify the behavior of the roots.\n\n**Attempting to factor large expression**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a large expression and trying to factor it. Factoring might help simplify everything and give me a clearer understanding of the behavior of the roots. It's tricky, but breaking this down could reveal useful insights. Let's see if any patterns emerge!\n\n**Considering the irreducibility of the expression**\n\nIt looks like Sympy can't factor this expression, which suggests it might be irreducible. That could mean there\u2019s no simpler form to work with. I\u2019ll have to keep that in mind while proceeding \u2014 simplifying further might not be possible at this stage.\n\n**Testing \u0394_g and \u0394_f relationship with real roots**\n\nThe idea of expressing \u0394_g in terms of \u0394_f isn\u2019t panning out through factorization; it\u2019s tough. I could test numerically with random root triples to spot patterns, but it's not a proof. That reminds me of an exercise involving cubic polynomials, where combining P(x) and its derivative ensures three real roots.\n\n**Reorganizing g in terms of f and derivatives**\n\nThe idea is to express g as a combination of derivatives of f, but we also encounter challenges with the b and c terms. Still, we can relate these terms to the roots using Vieta\u2019s formulas. Reorganizing g might highlight a constant shift, which doesn't affect the number of roots but could influence root behavior.\n\n**Exploring the mapping from f to g and roots**\n\nAdding a constant shift doesn't change the number of real roots, just their shape. I\u2019m considering whether the transformation from f to g is invertible. If it is, we might be able to prove that if f has real roots, g does too\u2014and potentially the other way around, but I still need to investigate.\n\n**Investigating the transformation between coefficient and root triples**\n\nThe mapping between the root triples and coefficient triples is a bijection, and there\u2019s a potential rational transformation between the coefficient triples and the root triples of g.\n\n**Adjusting search strategy**\n\nIt looks like I didn't get any useful results with the current search parameters. Maybe I need to broaden the search or try less specific terms to see if I can capture more relevant information. I\u2019ll adjust the approach and give it another shot.\n\n**Refining search with a more targeted approach**\n\nThe search results weren't helpful because they were too general. I think it's time to narrow things down with a more specific search. I'll try combining terms like \"Vitali\" and \"formulae\" to home in on the right information, but I want to make sure the results are still relevant.\n\n**Adjusting search term spelling**\n\nI didn\u2019t find any useful results. Maybe I misspelled something? It should be \"Vieta\" not \"Vieti\". I'll try searching using the correct spelling, \u201cVieta formula,\u201d to ensure I get the right information. This should help refine the search for better results.\n\n**Refining search based on algebraic formulation**\n\nI think focusing more on the polynomial formula rather than derivatives might help.

Near the poles:\n   - As \\(x\\to\\alpha^{-}\\), \\(1/(x-\\alpha)\\to -\\infty\\), so \\(\\phi(x)\\to -\\infty\\).\n   - As \\(x\\to\\alpha^{+}\\), \\(1/(x-\\alpha)\\to +\\infty\\), so \\(\\phi(x)\\to +\\infty\\).\n   Similarly at \\(\\beta,\\gamma\\).\n\nCombine this with monotonicity:\n\n- On \\((-\\infty,\\alpha)\\): \\(\\phi\\) strictly decreases from \\(0^{-}\\) down to \\(-\\infty\\).  \n  Range: \\((-\\infty,0)\\).\n\n- On \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\): \\(\\phi\\) strictly decreases from \\(+\\infty\\) down to \\(-\\infty\\).  \n  Range: \\(\\mathbb R\\).\n\n- On \\((\\beta,\\gamma)\\): \\(\\phi\\) strictly decreases from \\(+\\infty\\) down to \\(-\\infty\\).  \n  Range: \\(\\mathbb R\\).\n\n- On \\((\\gamma,\\infty)\\): \\(\\phi\\) strictly decreases from \\(+\\infty\\) down to \\(0^{+}\\).  \n  Range: \\((0,\\infty)\\).\n\n### Solving \\(\\phi(x)=1/t\\)\n\nWe want solutions of\n\\[\n\\phi(x)=\\frac{1}{t}.\n\\]\n\n- If \\(t>0\\), then \\(1/t>0\\).\n  - No solutions in \\((-\\infty,\\alpha)\\), since \\(\\phi<0\\) there.\n  - Exactly one solution in \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\), since \\(\\phi\\) is continuous, strictly decreasing from \\(+\\infty\\) to \\(-\\infty\\).\n  - Exactly one solution in \\((\\beta,\\gamma)\\), by the same argument.\n  - Exactly one solution in \\((\\gamma,\\infty)\\), since \\(\\phi\\) is continuous, strictly decreasing from \\(+\\infty\\) to \\(0^{+}\\), thus hits any positive value exactly once.\n\n  So for \\(t>0\\), \\(T_{t}h\\) has **three real roots**, one in each of \\((\\alpha,\\beta),(\\beta,\\gamma),(\\gamma,\\infty)\\).\n\n- If \\(t<0\\), then \\(1/t<0\\).\n  - Exactly one solution in \\((-\\infty,\\alpha)\\), since \\(\\phi\\) is continuous, strictly decreasing from \\(0^{-}\\) to \\(-\\infty\\).\n  - Exactly one solution in \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) (range \\(\\mathbb R\\)).\n  - Exactly one solution in \\((\\beta,\\gamma)\\) (range \\(\\mathbb R\\)).\n  - No solution in \\((\\gamma,\\infty)\\), where \\(\\phi>0\\).\n\n  So for \\(t<0\\), \\(T_{t}h\\) also has **three real roots**, one in each of \\((-\\infty,\\alpha),(\\alpha,\\beta),(\\beta,\\gamma)\\).\n\nIn every case \\(t\\neq 0\\), the three solutions lie in **pairwise disjoint intervals**, hence are **distinct**. Also none of them coincides with \\(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\) because \\(\\phi\\) is not finite at those points, so the new roots are not inherited ones.\n\nFinally, the roots are simple: on each interval \\(\\phi\\) is strictly monotone, so it crosses the level \\(1/t\\) transversely; equivalently, \\(T_{t}h\\) and \\((T_{t}h)'\\) cannot vanish at the same point there.\n\nThus for every real \\(t\\), \\(T_{t}h=h-th'\\) has three distinct real roots.\n\nThis proves the lemma.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Finish the argument for \\(g\\)\n\nWe have shown:\n\n- \\(f\\) has three distinct real roots.\n- For any real \\(t\\), if a cubic has three distinct real roots, then so does \\(T_{t}\\) applied to it.\n- And\n  \\[\n  g = (I - r_{1}D)(I - r_{2}D)(I - r_{3}D)f\n    = T_{r_{3}}T_{r_{2}}T_{r_{1}}f.\n  \\]\n\nApply the lemma successively:\n\n1. \\(f\\) has three distinct real roots \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(T_{r_{1}}f\\) has three distinct real roots.\n2. \\(T_{r_{1}}f\\) has three distinct real roots \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(T_{r_{2}}T_{r_{1}}f\\) has three distinct real roots.\n3. \\(T_{r_{2}}T_{r_{1}}f\\) has three distinct real roots \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(T_{r_{3}}T_{r_{2}}T_{r_{1}}f=g\\) has three distinct real roots.\n\nTherefore, **if** \\(f(x)=x^{3}+ax^{2}+bx+c\\) has three distinct real roots, **then**  \n\\[\ng(x)=f(x)+af'(x)+bf''(x)+cf'''(x)\n\\]\nalso has three distinct real roots. \u2714"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201","start_idx":373,"end_idx":392,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Vieta's formulas","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1086853236,"snippet":"In mathematics, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6474,"end_idx":6474,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Vieta's formulas","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"stackexchange.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1674096/approximation-for-fx-using-forward-centered-or-backward-difference?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Approximation for f''(x) using forward, centered, or ...","snippet":"Feb 27, 2016 \u2014 Consider the function g(x)=af(x+h)+bf(x)+cf(x\u22122h). and develop it as a Taylor expansion around h=0.
