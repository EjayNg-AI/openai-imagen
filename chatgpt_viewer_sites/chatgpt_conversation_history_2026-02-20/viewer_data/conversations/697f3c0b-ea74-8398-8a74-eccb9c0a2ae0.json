Code Beyond Coding\\n\\n## Scope, definitions, and research method\\n\\nThis report evaluates whether **OpenAI Codex** and **Anthropic Claude Code** meaningfully support **non-coding work**, with emphasis on (a) academic use\\u2014mathematics problem solving, problem generation, and syllabus-aligned note writing at secondary school, Junior College (JC), and university levels\\u2014and (b) research use\\u2014current affairs analysis and deep topical research (market trends, semiconductor history, Intel\\u2019s evolution). It also contrasts these coding-agent products against the organizations\\u2019 flagship conversational systems: **ChatGPT\\u20115.2** and **Claude Opus 4.5**, focusing on how well coding agents match or fall short on non-coding tasks. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn4view0\\ue202turn28view0\\ue202turn6view0\\ue202turn25view0\\ue201\\n\\nTwo framing points matter for accuracy:\\n\\n- **Codex and Claude Code are \\u201cagent products/surfaces,\\u201d not just raw language models.** Their practical capabilities depend on (i) which underlying model is used, (ii) which tools are enabled (web, filesystem, shell, connectors), and (iii) safety constraints (sandboxing, approvals, network restrictions). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn4view1\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn28view1\\ue202turn3view1\\ue201  \\n- **Depth research quality is often dominated by tool design** (web search behavior, citation support, long-context handling, prompt-injection defenses), not only base model intelligence. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view2\\ue202turn24view3\\ue202turn24view0\\ue202turn24view1\\ue201\\n\\nEvidence gathered and used here falls into four categories:\\n\\n1. **Official product documentation and technical specifications** for Codex, GPT-5.2 / GPT-5.2-Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Opus 4.5 (context windows, tool support, knowledge cutoffs, safety/permissions models). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn5view4\\ue202turn5view0\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn25view0\\ue202turn28view0\\ue201  \\n2. **Official announcements and release notes** describing design intent and recommended usage boundaries (e.g., \\u201cuse codex-variant models for coding tasks; use general models for non-coding\\u201d). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn5view2\\ue202turn5view3\\ue202turn6view0\\ue202turn7view1\\ue201  \\n3. **Peer-reviewed / archival research and benchmark definitions** relevant to coding ability and agentic evaluation (e.g., Codex/HumanEval; SWE-bench) and to math/science reasoning where available from vendors. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn27search0\\ue202turn27search5\\ue202turn6view2\\ue202turn6view1\\ue201  \\n4. **Independent user reports and practitioner commentary** that illuminate real-world failure modes\\u2014especially where official sources are silent (e.g., hallucination risk when repurposing coding agents for documentation). These are treated as *anecdotal but useful* signals rather than ground truth. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn26search4\\ue202turn26search9\\ue201\\n\\nAll conclusions are therefore \\u201ccapability + tooling + defaults\\u201d conclusions, not abstract claims about what a model could do in an unconstrained setting. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn28view1\\ue202turn6view0\\ue201\\n\\n## What these systems are optimized to do\\n\\n### OpenAI Codex as an agent product\\n\\nIn its modern form, Codex is positioned as a **software engineering agent** that can run tasks in isolation, read/edit files, run commands/tests, and produce reviewable changes. In the ChatGPT-integrated cloud experience, each task operates in an isolated environment preloaded with your repository, and Codex provides evidence such as terminal logs and test outputs for traceability. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn4view0\\ue202turn27search1\\ue201\\n\\nA key architectural point: Codex is a **suite** (CLI, cloud, IDE extension) sharing an \\u201cagent loop\\u201d harness that orchestrates model calls and tool calls (shell, web search, MCP tools, etc.). The harness is built on the OpenAI Responses API and can be pointed at different endpoints and even non-OpenAI providers that implement compatible APIs. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn4view1\\ue202turn5view1\\ue201\\n\\n**Default safety posture is intentionally restrictive**, especially on network access. Codex cloud blocks internet access during the agent phase by default (setup scripts can still use network to install dependencies), with optional per-environment enablement (including allowlists and method restrictions). The local CLI/IDE defaults also emphasize sandboxing plus an approval policy controlling when the agent must ask before acting. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view0\\ue202turn24view1\\ue201\\n\\n### Claude Code as an agent product\\n\\nClaude Code is also a **terminal-first agent**, designed to edit files, run commands, and automate engineering workflows. However, its documentation explicitly frames it more broadly as a tool that can maintain project-level awareness and, importantly for non-coding use, *retrieve up-to-date information from the web* and pull from external sources via MCP integrations (e.g., documents or design systems), dependent on configuration. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn28view0\\ue202turn3view1\\ue201\\n\\nUnlike a pure chat UI, Claude Code is intentionally composable (\\u201cUnix philosophy\\u201d) and supports scripting modes and structured output formats, and it exposes flags to replace or append system prompts and to restrict or disable tools. That configurability is central when assessing non-coding tasks, because the default \\u201ccoding agent\\u201d behavior can be tuned closer to a general tutor/research assistant. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn28view1\\ue202turn28view0\\ue201\\n\\n### The \\u201cbaseline\\u201d comparators: ChatGPT\\u20115.2 and Claude Opus 4.5\\n\\nChatGPT\\u20115.2 (as a product experience) is designed explicitly for **general knowledge work and learning** with tool support\\u2014including web search, data analysis, file analysis, image analysis, canvas, image generation, and memory\\u2014depending on tier and mode. OpenAI describes auto-switching among fast vs deeper-reasoning variants in ChatGPT and reports context window sizes per tier/mode. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn6view0\\ue202turn6view1\\ue201\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic\\u2019s premium \\u201cmaximum intelligence\\u201d model and is positioned as broadly capable across analysis and agentic work (not only coding), with published technical specs (context window, output length, knowledge cutoff). Anthropic\\u2019s transparency materials and model documentation describe Opus 4.5 as a hybrid reasoning model with text+image input, and show it is intended for agentic contexts as well as general analysis. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view0\\ue202turn16view0\\ue201\\n\\n## How far Codex and Claude Code extend beyond coding in practice\\n\\n### Tooling determines whether \\u201ccurrent affairs\\u201d and \\u201cdeep research\\u201d are viable\\n\\nFor non-coding tasks involving **fresh information** (current affairs, market trends), the decisive question is whether the system can reliably **browse live sources** and manage prompt-injection risk.\\n\\n- **Codex CLI** includes a first-party web search tool, but\\u2014crucially\\u2014local tasks use a **web search cache by default** (an OpenAI-maintained index of results), returning pre-indexed results rather than fetching live pages.

Coding agents become more compelling here because they can actually run validators (CAS scripts, unit tests, randomized checks). Chat interfaces can do this too (ChatGPT data analysis; Claude code execution tool exists in the Anthropic ecosystem), but coding agents naturally live in that \\u201crun checks until correct\\u201d workflow. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn6view0\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn28view0\\ue202turn7view1\\ue201\\n\\n### Writing syllabus-aligned notes\\n\\nSyllabus-aligned notes have three requirements that coding agents can either help or hinder:\\n\\n1. **Faithful alignment to a declared scope and sequence** (what to include/exclude; depth).  \\n2. **Pedagogical clarity** (explanations, worked examples, misconceptions, exercises).  \\n3. **Consistency and maintainability over time** (updates, version control, linking).  \\n\\nChatGPT\\u20115.2 is explicitly tuned for \\u201ceveryday work and learning\\u201d and supports the full ChatGPT toolset (web search, file analysis, canvas, memory), which is directly aligned with note writing and iterative refinement. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn6view0\\ue202turn6view1\\ue201\\n\\nCodex and Claude Code can be excellent if your notes are treated like a **documentation/codebase project** (Markdown/LaTeX repository, build pipeline, generated diagrams), because their native affordances are \\u201cedit files, run commands, enforce conventions.\\u201d Codex\\u2019s AGENTS.md mechanism and Claude Code\\u2019s system-prompt and tool controls are both designed to create consistent agent behavior across sessions/projects. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn26search3\\ue202turn28view1\\ue202turn24view1\\ue201\\n\\nHowever, there is a real failure mode: when asked to \\u201cwrite notes,\\u201d a coding agent can hallucinate structural facts or over-generalize if it assumes a software-architecture context. An example anecdote from a Hacker News thread described Codex hallucinating architecture details while attempting to write documentation, whereas Claude Code performed better in that particular side-by-side attempt. This is not definitive, but it is consistent with the \\u201cdefault prompt bias\\u201d hypothesis. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn26search9\\ue202turn5view3\\ue201\\n\\n**Bottom line for notes:**  \\n- For \\u201cI want clean, pedagogically strong notes quickly,\\u201d ChatGPT\\u20115.2 is the most direct tool. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn6view0\\ue202turn6view1\\ue201  \\n- For \\u201cI want a maintained notes repository with reproducible builds and automated checking,\\u201d Codex/Claude Code can be better\\u2014*but only if you explicitly configure them for education rather than coding*, and you enforce validation. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn28view1\\ue202turn26search3\\ue201\\n\\n## Suitability for current affairs analysis and deep specialized research\\n\\n### Current affairs analysis\\n\\nCurrent affairs tasks require **live browsing, source comparison, and citation discipline**.\\n\\nChatGPT has a purpose-built \\u201cdeep research\\u201d capability intended to search and synthesize *hundreds of sources*, producing citation-backed reports; OpenAI also provides \\u201cdeep research models\\u201d in the API designed for multi-step research with web search and other retrieval tools. This is a strong indicator that ChatGPT\\u20115.2 (as a product) is *not merely a model* but a research workflow. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view3\\ue202turn24view2\\ue202turn6view0\\ue201\\n\\nCodex can browse the web, but its default posture differs: Codex CLI\\u2019s cached search mode is explicitly about reducing prompt-injection exposure, not about guaranteeing recency, and Codex cloud blocks agent internet access by default.

Big ideas (plain language)\nB. Key definitions (only those used in the notes)\nC. Formulae / standard forms (exact maths, but explanations paraphrased)\nD. Key skills checklist (what students must be able to do)\nE. Common mistakes (as implied by the notes\u2019 pedagogy)\nF. 3\u20136 worked examples you invent (NOT copied), in the same style as the notes\n\nHard constraints:\n- No verbatim copying (no sentence longer than ~8 words copied from the notes).\n- No new technical terms beyond the allowed list.\n- Keep language appropriate for [Sec 3 / JC2 / Uni].\n```\n\n*Practical tip:* if you care a lot about avoiding accidental copying, follow with: \u201cNow scan your draft and list any phrases that look copied; rewrite them.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2014 Generate a question set \u201cin the same pedagogy\u201d\nAsk:\n\n```text\nUsing the question archetypes and tone guide, generate [N] questions.\n\nRequirements:\n- Same pedagogy as the notes (structure, phrasing, scaffolding).\n- Variations, not copies: new numbers, new contexts, same underlying skills.\n- Difficulty: [easy/medium/hard/very challenging] OR distribution like 3/4/3/0.\n- For each question: tag (archetype + skill), and give a one-line difficulty rationale.\n\nDo NOT include solutions unless I ask.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2014 Quality gate (prevents drift and \u201cnew-term leakage\u201d)\nAsk:\n\n```text\nAudit the question set:\n\n1) List any terms used that are NOT in the allowed terminology list.\n2) Check each question matches an archetype.\n3) Check overall coverage: which archetypes are missing?\n4) Revise the set to fix (1)\u2013(3), without changing the total number of questions.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2014 Infinite variations on demand (your \u201canother worksheet\u201d command)\nWhen you want a new worksheet later, you reuse the contract:\n\n```text\nGenerate Worksheet v[##] with [N] questions.\n\nUse the SAME Style & Terminology Contract and SAME archetypes.\nConstraints:\n- Avoid repeating the same numbers/contexts from Worksheet v[##-1].\n- Keep the same difficulty profile: [..].\n- Maintain coverage: include at least one question from each of these archetypes: [list].\n```\n\nThat\u2019s it. This is the \u201clow ceremony\u201d version.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow B \u2014 best for scaling (ChatGPT + Codex or Claude Code as a worksheet factory)\n\nUse this when you want: **consistent outputs across months**, easy regeneration, version history, and optional automated checks (duplicate detection, term leakage detection, formatting).\n\n### What you set up (once)\nCreate a folder (local repo is ideal) like:\n\n```text\nmath-materials/\n  source_notes/         (your PDFs/docs)\n  style_contract/       (the contract you generated once)\n  archetypes/           (question archetypes + difficulty knobs)\n  worksheets/           (generated sets)\n  qa/                   (optional scripts/checklists)\n```\n\nThen add a persistent instruction file for your agent:\n\n- **Codex:** `AGENTS.md` is explicitly supported and is loaded automatically with clear precedence rules. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Claude Code:** use its persistent project guidance pattern (commonly `CLAUDE.md` in practice) and keep it alongside your repo norms; Claude Code also emphasizes permission/sandbox boundaries to reduce risky actions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n\nA minimal `AGENTS.md` you can paste (edit as needed):\n\n```md\n# Education content generation rules\n\nYou are generating student-facing math notes and worksheet questions.\n\nHard rules:\n- No verbatim copying from source notes. Paraphrase all explanations.\n- Only use terminology appearing in the project's allowed_terminology list.\n- Do not introduce new technical terms beyond the target level.\n- Questions must match the project's question_archetypes.\n\nOutputs:\n- Save summaries to /worksheets/summaries/\n- Save question sets to /worksheets/worksheets/\n- Each worksheet includes: title, target audience, topic tags, difficulty profile, and archetype tags.\n\nQuality gate:\n- Run the project's QA checklist before finalizing any worksheet.\n```\n\n### How you run it (each time)\n1) **ChatGPT step (brain + pedagogy):** Upload the notes and generate/refresh the Style & Terminology Contract and archetypes (Workflow A, Step 1). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n2) **Agent step (production + repetition):** Tell Codex/Claude Code:  \n   - \u201cUse the current contract + archetypes; generate Worksheet v17 (hard); write it into the worksheets folder.\u201d  \n   - Optionally run QA checks (duplicates, forbidden terms, formatting).\n\n**Important:** For this education use case you typically do **not** need internet access. Codex cloud blocks agent internet by default (and that\u2019s good\u2014less prompt-injection risk). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n### Why this scales better than ChatGPT alone\n- Persistent instructions reduce drift (Codex loads `AGENTS.md` automatically). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- You can regenerate worksheets \u201cv1..vN\u201d with consistent structure.\n- You can add light automation (even without fancy code): a running \u201cworksheet registry\u201d so the agent avoids repeating contexts/archetypes too often.\n\n---\n\n## Picking A vs B quickly\n- Choose **Workflow A** if you\u2019re producing worksheets interactively and don\u2019t care about repo hygiene.\n- Choose **Workflow B** if you want a long-lived library of materials and you\u2019ll generate

Use **parametric diagrams** instead:\n\n- **LaTeX TikZ (vector, perfect for worksheets / PDFs)**\n- **Python matplotlib (batch generation, easy automation; export SVG/PNG)**\n- Optional: **GeoGebra** for quick interactive drafting (less ideal for automated mass-variants)\n\nBelow are two production-ready routes that match your doc\u2019s diagram types.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1 (recommended for LaTeX worksheets): TikZ templates\n\n### A. Simple axes + line + labelled points (matches Worked Example 8 style)\nThis corresponds to the \u201cline cuts x-axis at A(9,0) and y-axis at B(0,6), and mark a point M on the line\u201d pattern \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue202L2-L39\ue201.\n\n```latex\n% Requires: \\usepackage{tikz}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.55]\n  % Axes\n  \\draw[->] (-1,0) -- (11,0) node[right] {$x$};\n  \\draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,8)  node[above] {$y$};\n\n  % Line (example: through A(9,0) and B(0,6))\n  \\draw[thick] (0,6) -- (9,0);\n\n  % Points\n  \\fill (9,0) circle (2.2pt) node[below right] {$A(9,0)$};\n  \\fill (0,6) circle (2.2pt) node[above left] {$B(0,6)$};\n\n  % Example interior point (M = (3.6, 3.6))\n  \\fill (3.6,3.6) circle (2.2pt) node[above right] {$M(3.6,3.6)$};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n```\n\n### B. Grid + plotted points (matches \u201ccoordinate grid question\u201d style)\nYour doc has grid-based plotting questions (e.g., Self-Practice 6a includes a coordinate grid with points, then asks for equation/length/area etc.) \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue202L11-L18\ue201.\n\n```latex\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]\n  % Grid\n  \\draw[step=1cm, gray!30, very thin] (-3,-3) grid (7,7);\n\n  % Axes\n  \\draw[->] (-3,0) -- (7.5,0) node[right] {$x$};\n  \\draw[->] (0,-3) -- (0,7.5) node[above] {$y$};\n\n  % Example points A(-2,-1), B(1,5), C(5,5)\n  \\fill (-2,-1) circle (2.2pt) node[below left] {$A(-2,-1)$};\n  \\fill (1,5)   circle (2.2pt) node[above left] {$B(1,5)$};\n  \\fill (5,5)   circle (2.2pt) node[above right] {$C(5,5)$};\n\n  % Optional: join segments or draw triangle\n  \\draw[thick] (-2,-1) -- (1,5) -- (5,5) -- cycle;\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n```\n\n### C. \u201cRight triangle legs\u201d helper diagram (distance / gradient intuition)\nYour notes explicitly motivate formulas with right-angled triangles and horizontal/vertical legs \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue202L11-L30\ue201.\n\n```latex\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]\n  \\draw[->] (-1,0) -- (9,0) node[right] {$x$};\n  \\draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,7) node[above] {$y$};\n\n  % Two points P(x1,y1), Q(x2,y2)\n  \\coordinate (P) at (2,1);\n  \\coordinate (Q) at (7,5);\n\n  \\fill (P) circle (2.2pt) node[below left] {$P(x_1,y_1)$};\n  \\fill (Q) circle (2.2pt) node[above right] {$Q(x_2,y_2)$};\n\n  % Horizontal + vertical legs\n  \\draw[dashed] (P) -- (7,1) -- (Q);\n  \\draw[thick] (P) -- (Q);\n\n  % Right angle marker\n  \\draw (7,1) rectangle (6.6,1.4);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n```\n\n**Why TikZ wins for your workflow:** it\u2019s deterministic, crisp in print, and you can generate *parameterized* diagrams by swapping coordinates in a template. It also keeps fonts consistent with your LaTeX worksheet.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2 (best for automation & bulk variants): Python + matplotlib (exports SVG/PNG)\n\nThis is ideal if you want Codex/Claude Code to churn out 30 worksheet variants with diagrams from a spec.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef draw_axes(ax, xlim, ylim, grid=False):\n    ax.set_xlim(*xlim)\n    ax.set_ylim(*ylim)\n    ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')\n\n    # Hide default frame\n    for spine in ax.spines.values():\n        spine.set_visible(False)\n\n    # Axes through origin\n    ax.axhline(0, linewidth=1)\n    ax.axvline(0, linewidth=1)\n\n    # Arrowheads\n    ax.annotate('', xy=(xlim[1], 0), xytext=(xlim[1]-0.001, 0),\n                arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', linewidth=1))\n    ax.annotate('', xy=(0, ylim[1]), xytext=(0, ylim[1]-0.001),\n                arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', linewidth=1))\n\n    ax.set_xlabel('x')\n    ax.set_ylabel('y', rotation=0)\n    ax.yaxis.set_label_coords(-0.06, 1.02)\n\n    if grid:\n        ax.set_xticks(range(int(xlim[0]), int(xlim[1]) + 1))\n        ax.set_yticks(range(int(ylim[0]), int(ylim[1]) + 1))\n        ax.grid(True, linewidth=0.5, linestyle='--', alpha=0.4)\n\ndef plot_point(ax, xy, label=None, label_offset=(0.15, 0.15)):\n    x, y = xy\n    ax.plot([x], [y], marker='o')\n    if label:\n        ax.text(x + label_offset[0], y + label_offset[1], label)\n\ndef plot_segment(ax, p, q):\n    ax.plot([p[0], q[0]], [p[1], q[1]], linewidth=2)\n\ndef example_line_with_intercepts():\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,4))\n    draw_axes(ax, xlim=(-1, 11), ylim=(-1, 8), grid=False)\n\n    A = (9, 0)\n    B = (0, 6)\n    M = (3.6, 3.6)\n\n    plot_segment(ax, A, B)\n    plot_point(ax, A, \"A(9,0)\", label_offset=(0.2, -0.6))\n    plot_point(ax, B, \"B(0,6)\", label_offset=(0.2, 0.2))\n    plot_point(ax, M, \"M(3.6,3.6)\", label_offset=(0.2, 0.2))\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    # fig.savefig(\"diagram.svg\")  # vector\n    # fig.savefig(\"diagram.png\", dpi=300)  # bitmap\n    plt.show()\n\nexample_line_with_intercepts()\n```\n\n### How to make this \u201cworksheet factory\u201d-friendly\nHave the model generate a small **diagram spec** alongside each question, e.g.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"axes_line_points\",\n  \"xlim\": [-2, 12],\n  \"ylim\": [-2, 10],\n  \"grid\": false,\n  \"points\": {\n    \"A\": [9, 0],\n    \"B\": [0, 6],\n    \"M\": [3.6, 3.6]\n  },\n  \"segments\": [[\"A\",\"B\"]]\n}\n```\n\nThen a script renders it. This is the cleanest way to support \u201cgenerate variations at will\u201d without manually redrawing diagrams.\n\n---\n\n## Which option fits your stated workflow best?\n- If you\u2019re already compiling LaTeX worksheets: **TikZ** (fastest path to consistent exam-style diagrams).\n- If you want mass production of variants and reuse across PDF + web + email: **matplotlib with a spec format**.\n\nIf you tell me which output you care about most (**LaTeX-first** vs **multi-channel output**), I\u2019ll give you a single standardized \u201cdiagram spec schema\u201d + 6\u201310 reusable templates that cover the recurring diagram families in your PDF (axes/intercepts, collinearity, trapezium/triangle area, perpendicular distance visuals, reflections, etc.)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue202L11-L30\ue201","start_idx":196,"end_idx":225,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"4)

if you want it perfectly aligned under scaling, I can give a more precise version.)\n\n---\n\n# How to generate diagrams *automatically* from your notes + new questions\n\n### The reliable pattern\nWhen you ask the model to create new questions, also ask it to emit a **diagram spec** (structured, not prose), then convert that spec into TikZ/PGFPlots using the templates above.\n\n**Diagram spec format to request:**\n```text\nFor any question that needs a diagram:\n1) axis bounds: xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,grid(0/1)\n2) points: list of (name, x, y, label_position)\n3) segments: list of point-name pairs\n4) dashed segments: list of point-name pairs\n5) extra: right-angle markers / arrows / labels (if needed)\n\nThen output TikZ/PGFPlots code using my coordplane template.\n```\n\nThis eliminates \u201cdiagram drift\u201d and makes \u201cgenerate another worksheet\u201d trivial.\n\n---\n\n## Practical constraints that keep diagrams clean\n- **Choose bounds first**, then pick points inside them (avoid cramped labels).\n- Prefer **integer coordinates** for Sec/JC worksheets unless decimals are part of the pedagogy.\n- Keep labels short; put full coordinates in the question text if the diagram gets crowded.\n- If a question is algebraic (e.g., \u201cfind equation of line\u201d), the diagram should be **supporting**, not a precision measurement tool.\n\n---\n\n## If you want, I can tailor the templates to your house style\nIf you paste **one diagram page** (or tell me which pages in your PDF contain the key diagram styles you want), I\u2019ll standardize:\n- default axis size\n- tick spacing\n- label font/placement conventions\n- a small library of 8\u201312 \u201cdiagram archetypes\u201d (intercepts line, midpoint/section, perpendicular bisector, distance point-to-line, triangle area, quadrilateral, reflection, etc.)\n\nThen your worksheet-generation prompt can simply say: \u201cUse archetype D3 (Intercept Line)\u201d and it will consistently render."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5110,"end_idx":5110,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"9dba4750-81a7-4ed0-8604-41ba6d7ab14d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"11727e9c-070c-4f06-8624-a1532e44e704","turn_exchange_id":"233e6e66-2c5f-4c55-963c-3220c76cbdbc","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"11727e9c-070c-4f06-8624-a1532e44e704","children":[]}}}
