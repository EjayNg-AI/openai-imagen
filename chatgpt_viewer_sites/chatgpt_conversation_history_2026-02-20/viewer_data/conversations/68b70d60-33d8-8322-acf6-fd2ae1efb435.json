In many **stable** cases, stents don\u2019t improve survival compared with medicines, though they can improve symptoms. The choice is individualized and sometimes CABG surgery is better than a stent.\n\n# When a stent *is clearly indicated*\n\n**1) Heart attack (STEMI) or other high-risk acute coronary syndromes.**  \nPrimary PCI with a stent is standard of care for STEMI if it can be done rapidly; it reduces death and infarct size. Early invasive management is also recommended for NSTEMI/unstable angina with high-risk features, with stenting if a culprit narrowing is found. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n**2) Ongoing ischemia/shock/failed fibrinolysis.**  \nIf there\u2019s persistent/recurrent ischemia, hemodynamic compromise, or lysis failure, urgent PCI with stenting of the culprit lesion is indicated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n# When a stent is *elective* (stable coronary disease)\n\n**3) Angina despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).**  \nIf symptoms remain unacceptable after optimized meds (anti-anginals + risk-reduction therapy), PCI can provide faster/better angina relief than medicines alone. It does **not** lower death/MI risk in most stable patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n**4) Objective, flow-limiting stenosis.**  \nWhen testing shows the lesion truly limits blood flow\u2014e.g., **FFR \u2264 0.80** or **iFR \u2264 0.89**\u2014stenting that lesion is reasonable for symptom relief and to reduce urgent revascularization. (FFR/iFR are invasive pressure-wire measures taken during angiography.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n**5) Anatomic thresholds with demonstrable ischemia.**  \nTypical examples include \u226570% diameter narrowing in a major epicardial vessel (or \u226550% in the left main) with symptoms/ischemia; the specific plan should follow a \u201cHeart Team\u201d discussion of anatomy, comorbidities, and patient goals. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search11\ue201\n\n**6) In-stent restenosis or certain post-bypass scenarios.**  \nWhen a previous stent has re-narrowed, or for suitable lesions in bypass grafts, repeat PCI/stenting may be appropriate. (Guideline-based, case-dependent.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\n# When a stent is *usually not the right choice*\n\n- **Stable disease with good symptom control** on medicines and no large ischemic burden: no survival advantage from routine PCI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **Diffuse multivessel/left-main disease where CABG is superior** (especially in diabetes or with high SYNTAX complexity). CABG improves long-term outcomes vs PCI in diabetics with multivessel disease and in complex left-main/multivessel anatomy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- **Microvascular angina or vasospasm** (no flow-limiting epicardial stenosis): treat the underlying disorder; a stent won\u2019t help. (Addressed in chest-pain guideline algorithms.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n- **Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)** without ongoing ischemia: often conservative first; stents can extend dissections. (Guidelines caution individualized management.) \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue201  \n- **Inability to take dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** even for the shortened modern durations; that\u2019s a relative contra-indication to elective stenting. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201\n\n# What a stent *does* and *does not* do\n\n- **Does:** promptly restore flow in an acutely occluded artery; relieve angina from a proven flow-limiting lesion. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n- **Does not (in most stable patients):** reduce long-term death or MI compared with medicines alone; that was shown across COURAGE and ISCHEMIA (though PCI improves symptoms and reduces urgent revascularization). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n# How doctors decide\n\n1) **Define the problem:** symptoms, ECG/troponins, risk scores. Follow evidence-based chest-pain pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n2) **Prove ischemia/anatomy:** stress imaging or CT-coronary angiography \u2192 invasive angiography if needed. Use **FFR/iFR** to confirm lesion significance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n3) **Choose strategy (meds vs PCI vs CABG):** consider diabetes, lesion complexity (e.g., SYNTAX), left-main involvement, and patient preferences via \u201cHeart Team\u201d discussion. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue201\n\n# After a stent: commitments & trade-offs\n\n- **DAPT:** Typically **6 months** after elective PCI and **12 months** after ACS PCI, but modern guidelines allow **shorter DAPT (1\u20133 months)** in selected patients (especially high bleeding risk) followed by P2Y12-monotherapy; details are individualized. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n- **Risks:** bleeding from DAPT, periprocedural MI, rare stent thrombosis/restenosis (lower with contemporary drug-eluting stents). Post-PCI physiologic and imaging optimization (e.g., achieving high post-stent FFR) correlates with better outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue201\n\n# Quick checklist to discuss with your cardiologist\n- Is my situation **acute** (heart attack/unstable) or **stable**? What\u2019s the immediate risk if we don\u2019t stent now? \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n- Do my tests show **flow-limiting** disease (FFR \u2264 0.80 or iFR \u2264 0.89)? \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- Would **CABG** offer better long-term outcomes for my anatomy (e.g., diabetes with multivessel disease; complex left-main)? \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- What **DAPT duration** would you recommend for me, and how does that interact with bleeding risk or any upcoming procedures? \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- **Acute MI/unstable cases \u2192** stent promptly if feasible.  \n- **Stable cases \u2192** stent for *symptoms with proven flow limitation* after optimized meds; don\u2019t expect a mortality benefit.  \n- **Some anatomies/conditions \u2192** CABG or medical therapy is better.\n\n(Information above reflects major ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines and landmark trials through 2025; individual decisions require clinician judgment.) \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search0\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":875,"end_idx":908,"safe_urls":["https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115313/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001309?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([AHA Journals](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001309?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115313/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI Guideline for the ...","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001309?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by SV Rao \u00b7 2025 \u00b7 Cited by 247 \u2014 Several strategies are available to reduce bleeding risk in patients with ACS who have undergone PCI and require antiplatelet therapy: (a) in ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AHA Journals"},{"title":"2017 ESC guidelines for the management of acute ...","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115313/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by F Arslan \u00b7 2018 \u00b7 Cited by 87 \u2014 For the primary PCI strategy, the 2017 guidelines dictate a < 90 min target from STEMI diagnosis to wire crossing.
