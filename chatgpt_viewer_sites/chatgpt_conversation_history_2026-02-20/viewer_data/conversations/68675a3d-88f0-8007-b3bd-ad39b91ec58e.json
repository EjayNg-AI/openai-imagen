From e-commerce swindles to sophisticated banking phishing schemes, scammers have exploited digital adoption and human vulnerabilities. This report examines recent scam trends, evaluates the state of cybersecurity awareness among Singaporeans, and assesses whether current education and outreach efforts are sufficient. We focus on vulnerable groups \u2013 especially seniors and the less digitally savvy \u2013 and identify gaps in preparedness. Finally, we propose comprehensive, forward-looking solutions for consideration by relevant government ministries and agencies.\n\n## Rising Trends of Cyber Scams (2019\u20132025)  \n**Explosion in Cases and Losses:** Online scams have proliferated dramatically in Singapore over the past five years. The number of reported scam cases nearly **quintupled** from about **9,500 in 2019** to **46,600 in 2023**, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs\u301011\u2020L142-L150\u3011. In 2024, scam reports hit a new high of **51,501 cases**, a **10.6%** rise from 2023\u30108\u2020L339-L347\u3011\u30108\u2020L349-L357\u3011. The financial toll has grown even more stark: victims lost **S$651.8 million in 2023**, and in **2024 losses soared to about S$1.1 billion** \u2013 the first time annual scam proceeds crossed the billion-dollar mark\u30108\u2020L349-L357\u3011. This represents a **70% jump in losses** in one year\u30108\u2020L349-L357\u3011. Cumulatively, scammers have stolen well over **S$3 billion from Singapore victims since 2019**, underscoring an escalating criminal industry\u301010\u2020L5-L12\u3011.\n\n**Common Scam Types:** The nature of scams has evolved in sophistication and scale. In 2024, the **most frequently reported scams** were e-commerce purchase scams (over **11,600 cases**, ~22.7% of all cases), followed by job recruitment scams, phishing scams (often involving bank OTPs), investment scams, and \u201cfake friend\u201d impersonation calls\u30102\u2020L141-L149\u3011. **E-commerce scams** \u2013 e.g. bogus online sales of products like concert tickets \u2013 formed the largest share by volume\u30107\u2020L1579-L1587\u3011\u30107\u2020L1619-L1627\u3011. However, the scams causing the **greatest financial damage** were different: **investment frauds** (including cryptocurrency schemes) caused the highest losses, accounting for roughly **28% of money lost in 2024**, followed by scams involving **government official impersonation**, **job scams**, **malware-enabled scams**, and **business email compromise (BEC)**\u30102\u2020L143-L148\u3011\u30102\u2020L145-L153\u3011. These syndicates often convince victims to transfer large sums \u2013 for instance, one single malware-related crypto scam in 2024 cost a victim **S$125 million**\u30107\u2020L1642-L1650\u3011. Overall, scams now contribute a significant share of Singapore\u2019s crime; as early as 2019 they comprised over a quarter of all crimes, and that share has only grown\u301010\u2020L33-L37\u3011.\n\n**Post-Pandemic Drivers:** Several factors have fueled this \u201cscam pandemic.\u201d COVID-19 accelerated the shift of commerce, banking, and social interaction online, giving scammers a larger attack surface. More people shopping or working from home meant more targets for e-commerce scams and job scams. Criminal groups adapted quickly: for example, **phishing scams tripled and investment scams jumped 77% from 2020 to 2021** in Singapore, with many **socially isolated seniors** falling prey\u301023\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Scammers also capitalized on pandemic anxieties and digital unfamiliarity \u2013 impersonating banks, government agencies, or employers in convincing ruses. The result is a **sustained onslaught of fraud** that continues to evolve in tactics.\n\n**Notable Incidents:** High-profile cases have spotlighted vulnerabilities. A pivotal example was the late-2021 **OCBC Bank SMS phishing scam**, in which **790 customers were duped** by fake bank messages and lost **S$13.7 million** within weeks\u301038\u2020L114-L122\u3011. This incident \u2013 unprecedented in scale for a local bank \u2013 exposed gaps in both customer vigilance and bank response. (OCBC acknowledged its customer service fell short during the incident and provided full goodwill reimbursements to victims\u301038\u2020L126-L133\u3011.) The episode spurred industry-wide security upgrades in early 2022, such as removal of clickable links in bank communications and implementation of \u201ckill-switch\u201d emergency account locks, to prevent similar exploits\u301011\u2020L148-L156\u3011. More recently, 2024 saw scammers leverage **cryptocurrency and malware**; one victim\u2019s extreme **S$125 million loss** in a crypto scam was enabled by malicious code planted during a fake job interview\u30107\u2020L1642-L1650\u3011. These cases illustrate how scammers continuously refine their methods \u2013 from simple e-mail phishing to complex social engineering and tech-enabled heists.\n\n## Impact and Victim Profile  \n**Financial and Social Costs:** The monetary losses from scams are staggering \u2013 over **S$1.1 billion in a single year (2024)** \u2013 but the impact is also deeply personal. Thousands of Singaporeans have seen life savings, retirement funds or hard-earned salaries drained by fraudsters. The police noted that while a majority of scam cases involve relatively small sums (over 70% of cases in 2024 involved losses under $5,000), a few **high-value cases (3.3% of cases) accounted for over 70% of total losses**\u30101\u2020L80-L87\u3011\u30101\u2020L82-L90\u3011. This includes not just wealthy investors but also ordinary individuals coerced into emptying multiple accounts or taking loans. Beyond dollars, victims often suffer emotional trauma, shame, and loss of trust in digital services. The wider society also bears costs \u2013 from law enforcement resources to the erosion of confidence in e-commerce and e-banking.\n\n**Who Are the Victims:** A common perception is that only the elderly or less-educated fall for scams. **In reality, victims span all demographics**\u301030\u2020L59-L67\u3011. **Young adults** are heavily targeted \u2013 for example, *one survey found that nearly 1 in 3 Singaporeans had been scammed, and among those aged 18\u201334 the victimization rate was almost 50%*\u301033\u2020L77-L85\u3011. These \u201cdigital natives\u201d engage frequently in online shopping, social media, and investing apps, making them **prime targets** despite their tech-savvy reputation\u301033\u2020L77-L85\u3011. Many younger victims are lured by get-rich-quick investment schemes or fake job offers on social platforms. **Working professionals** in their 30s\u201340s have also been ensnared by scams like China official impersonations or business email compromises. In short, tech literacy alone has not immunized the population \u2013 in fact, over **84% of Singaporeans *believe*** they can spot a scam, yet tests showed only **40% could identify a phishing email correctly**\u301033\u2020L83-L91\u3011. This overconfidence gap leaves even educated groups vulnerable.\n\nThat said, **seniors and less digitally literate individuals remain at higher risk of severe consequences.** While those **aged 65+ comprised only ~8% of scam victims in 2024, they lost the most per victim on average**\u30105\u2020L173-L178\u3011. Elderly victims tend to be less familiar with digital authentication or scam red flags, and may be more trusting of callers claiming to be officials. Many seniors also have substantial savings or retirement funds that, once lost, are difficult to recover. Community organizations observe that seniors who are **socially isolated and less educated in digital matters are prime targets**, as scammers prey on their loneliness or lack of awareness\u301023\u2020L59-L67\u3011. There have been local cases of elderly individuals nearly transferring **seven-figure sums** to fraudsters, thwarted only by last-minute intervention of bank or police personnel\u301021\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301021\u2020L35-L43\u3011. Clearly, *both* the old and the young require stronger protections \u2013 the former due to limited digital know-how, the latter perhaps due to complacency and high exposure.\n\n## Cybersecurity Preparedness of Singaporeans  \n\n### Public Awareness and Education  \n**General Awareness:** Public awareness of cyber scams has certainly increased in recent years, thanks to frequent media reports and government advisories. Surveys indicate most Singaporeans *know* of common scams; for instance, terms like \u201cphishing\u201d, \u201cOTP scam\u201d or \u201clove scam\u201d are regularly in the news. However, awareness does not always translate into effective caution. A 2025 study revealed that **two-thirds of people would not know how to respond if targeted by a scam**, despite ostensibly high awareness\u301033\u2020L67-L75\u3011. Many Singaporeans still fall back on ad-hoc advice from family or friends when dealing with suspicious situations, rather than official guidance\u301033\u2020L71-L74\u3011. Such peer advice may be well-intentioned but can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to delayed action. This indicates a gap in *practical preparedness* \u2013 people may recognize the idea of scams, but lack concrete steps to verify and respond (e.g. how to check if a call is legitimate, how to report or where to seek help).\n\n**Education System (Youths):** Singapore\u2019s education system has begun incorporating cyber safety and scam awareness topics, but coverage can be expanded. Currently, **schools integrate anti-scam lessons across various subjects**. For example, in **Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)** classes, students learn to evaluate the credibility of online information and are taught how to recognize phishing, e-commerce scams, love scams and the like\u301032\u2020L120-L128\u3011. In **lower secondary Food and Consumer Education**, students are taught consumer rights, financial responsibility and not to be misled by scams when shopping online\u301032\u2020L124-L131\u3011. Even **Social Studies** touches on cybersecurity risks and media literacy, training students to question sources both online and offline\u301032\u2020L127-L133\u3011. Beyond formal curriculum, schools sometimes host talks by the police or cybersecurity agencies, and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS) have partnered with schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to spread anti-scam messages\u301032\u2020L133-L138\u3011. These efforts mean that the current generation of students is more exposed to cyber-safety knowledge than earlier generations. **However**, given the fast-evolving scam landscape (e.g. scams now involving AI deepfakes or cryptocurrency), educational content needs continual refresh. There is room to include more *hands-on simulations* (such as mock scam exercises or interactive games) to let students experience and practice responding to scam scenarios. Notably, a study found **teenagers tend to be overconfident** \u2013 98% of teens surveyed believed they could detect scams, a confidence that is likely misplaced without real-world experience\u301033\u2020L83-L91\u3011. Strengthening school programmes with updated content (like how to spot AI-generated fake videos or voice scams) and reinforcing that *anyone* can be fooled would further improve youth preparedness.\n\n**Adult Digital Literacy:** For the adult population \u2013 especially those who finished schooling before cyber education was common \u2013 public education is critical. Many working adults have learned about scams informally or after a bad experience. The government has mounted public awareness campaigns (discussed in the next section) and banks splash warnings on their apps, yet the continued rise in victims suggests gaps in outreach. A concerning trend is that **victims often ignore warnings** even when they are present. Authorities reported cases where individuals, in the throes of a scammer\u2019s manipulation, *refused to believe they were being scammed* \u2013 even when warned by bank staff or police officers\u30107\u2020L1658-L1666\u3011\u301011\u2020L159-L167\u3011. Scammers adeptly exploit human trust and fear, sometimes convincing victims that legitimate warnings are false. This highlights that education can\u2019t be just a one-way flow of information; it must also address psychological aspects (why people fall prey) and repeatedly reinforce key \u201csafe behaviors\u201d until they become second nature. Overall, while general awareness is high on paper, **true readiness** \u2013 knowing how to *act* when confronted with a scam attempt \u2013 remains insufficient for a large segment of the public.\n\n### Protection for Seniors and Vulnerable Groups  \n**Outreach to Seniors:** Given that elderly citizens are particularly vulnerable, there have been dedicated initiatives to educate and protect them. The Cyber Security Agency (CSA), in partnership with IMDA and SPF, launched the **SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme in 2021** to raise cybersecurity awareness among seniors\u301039\u2020L52-L60\u3011. Under this programme, government-employed **Digital Ambassadors** (through IMDA\u2019s Digital for Life movement) conduct training at community centers and libraries, teaching seniors basic cyber hygiene and how to spot scams\u301039\u2020L56-L64\u3011. Importantly, materials are provided in all four official languages and in easy-to-understand formats\u301023\u2020L59-L67\u3011. CSA and its partners developed a **handbook for seniors**, run regular quizzes and interactive workshops in the heartlands, and even involve student volunteers to provide **one-on-one assistance** during these sessions\u301039\u2020L58-L65\u3011. This peer and inter-generational support approach has helped reach many elderly residents in a personal way. According to public reports, IMDA\u2019s digital literacy programmes (like Seniors Go Digital) have engaged over **130,000 seniors since 2020** through small-group coaching and pop-up booths at community events (teaching skills from using smartphone apps to recognizing scam calls). Such numbers are encouraging, yet there are over 600,000 residents above age 65 in Singapore \u2013 indicating more ground to cover.\n\n**Challenges with Seniors:** Despite these efforts, some seniors still struggle to apply safe practices. Common issues include difficulty handling security features (e.g. using banking tokens or 2-Factor Authentication devices), low trust in digital platforms (leading some to call back scammers out of fear of \u201cofficial\u201d trouble), and simply being less exposed to technology. Scammers have cruelly exploited elderly persons by impersonating police or government officers on the phone, knowing seniors tend to be deferential to authority. The SPF highlights that **impersonation scams by \u201cgovernment officials\u201d often ensnare older victims and lead to very high losses**, as these victims are persuaded to transfer large sums under the guise of assisting an investigation\u301011\u2020L159-L167\u3011. Another challenge is that a segment of seniors, even after attending workshops, might have memory issues or cognitive decline that makes it hard to retain lessons \u2013 they may require repeated reminders or caregiver support to stay vigilant. Community organizations like Lions Befrienders have started **\u201cSay No to Scams\u201d programmes** where volunteers regularly remind isolated seniors about ongoing scam tactics\u301027\u2020L0-L4\u3011. Banks, too, are recognising the need to cater to seniors: for instance, some banks now allow customers to *opt in* for higher protection modes (such as lower default transfer limits or branch-only transaction approvals for those uncomfortable with online banking). The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has even urged banks to **consider the needs of seniors in authentication processes**, so that anti-scam measures remain effective without excluding those with low digital literacy\u301021\u2020L21-L29\u3011. In summary, significant outreach is underway for seniors, but it must continue expanding in depth and breadth. The elderly population is diverse \u2013 from those in their 60s who may still be active online, to those in their 80s or 90s who may barely use smartphones \u2013 so a one-size approach is not enough. Tailored strategies and persistent community support are required to truly safeguard our seniors.\n\n**Less Educated or Non-Tech Users:** Beyond age, individuals with lower education or limited English proficiency also face higher scam risk. Many scam advisories are in English by default; efforts have been made to provide translations (the National Crime Prevention Council produces multilingual scam alert posters, and CSA\u2019s seniors handbook covers Malay, Chinese, Tamil), but ensuring comprehension is an ongoing task. Domestic workers or migrant workers are another vulnerable group \u2013 there have been cases of scammers posing as embassy or immigration officials to scare foreign workers into paying \u201cfines\u201d. Government outreach has begun to include messages in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories and via NGOs to cover these groups. Additionally, people who are new to the internet (for example, some middle-aged individuals who only went online during COVID-19 for essential tasks) might not be fluent in identifying fake websites or scam pop-ups. For them, basic digital literacy programs (like how to install antivirus, how to use messaging apps safely) are as important as advanced cyber warnings. Singapore\u2019s **\u201cDigital for Life\u201d** national movement explicitly aims to include all segments in the digital journey; aligning scam education with this movement will help reach those who might otherwise be left behind. \n\n### Role of Financial Institutions and Industry  \n**Banks and Customer Education:** Banks, being on the front line of many scams (particularly internet banking fraud), have ramped up customer security measures in recent years. After a spate of banking-related scams, MAS and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) introduced a package of safeguards in 2022 to bolster digital banking security. These included **setting default transfer limits ($5,000)**, requiring additional confirmations for high-risk transactions, providing a one-click **\u201ckill switch\u201d** for customers to freeze their account if fraud is suspected, and **co-locating bank staff inside the Police Anti-Scam Centre** to expedite fund recovery\u301040\u2020L123-L132\u3011\u301040\u2020L128-L136\u3011. Banks also agreed to remove SMS/email hyperlinks and implement delays for activating new payees \u2013 all to reduce phishing success. Crucially, an **ABS Standing Committee on Fraud** was established to coordinate industry anti-scam efforts. This committee formalised five key workstreams: **customer education, authentication, fraud surveillance, customer handling & recovery, and equitable loss sharing**\u301040\u2020L159-L167\u3011. The inclusion of *customer education* as a top workstream is notable \u2013 it signals that banks must actively educate their users, not just rely on technology. Indeed, banks have since been sending more frequent scam alert messages via email/app, publishing scam advisories on websites, and training frontline staff to advise customers. For example, OCBC Bank started running workshops for elderly customers, even inviting scam victims to share their experiences as cautionary lessons\u301021\u2020L9-L17\u3011. RHB Bank similarly hosted community fraud awareness talks at a Residents\u2019 Network, teaching dozens of seniors how to spot fake calls and texts\u301023\u2020L73-L81\u3011. Such outreach by financial institutions is a positive development, though it is not yet uniform across the sector. Smaller financial firms (remittance companies, insurers, investment brokers) are also beginning to push out client education on fraud, given scams like fake investment platforms have affected their consumers.\n\n**Responsibility and Reimbursement:** A critical aspect of preparedness is how losses are handled when prevention fails. Historically, scam victims could rarely get compensation from service providers (banks or telcos), because the victim was often deemed to have authorized the transfer (albeit under deception). However, the sheer scale of losses and public outcry (after cases like the OCBC scam) prompted a re-examination of this approach. Regulators recognized that expecting individual consumers to bear all the losses was neither fair nor sustainable for trust in the digital economy. In early 2023, MAS and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) proposed a **Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF)** for phishing scams\u301018\u2020L19-L24\u3011\u301018\u2020L25-L32\u3011. Under this forthcoming framework, liabilities for scam losses may be *shared* between customers and financial institutions if certain duties of care are not met. In essence, banks will be **held to specific duties** (e.g. implementing effective fraud detection, customer warnings, prompt response) and customers likewise have duties (e.g. protecting their credentials, not clicking dubious links). If a bank falls short (say, its systems failed to block a clearly fraudulent transfer or it did not provide appropriate safeguards), it may be required to compensate the victim for part of the loss\u30105\u2020L173-L181\u3011. Conversely, if a customer blatantly ignored all provided warnings, the compensation might be limited. The details are being finalized, but **the direction is clear** \u2013 there is now regulatory expectation on banks to actively prevent scams and to support customers who are defrauded, rather than a \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d stance. This shift is driving banks to invest even more in anti-scam tech and education, as ultimately **prevention is preferable to reimbursement**. \n\n**Technology and Platform Providers:** Preparedness also involves the tech platforms through which scams often occur \u2013 for example, telcos, social media, and e-commerce sites. The government has engaged telecommunications companies to help combat scams: Singapore telcos are now required to **implement SMS sender ID registries and spam filters** to block messages spoofing as banks or government entities. There is also a push to label overseas incoming calls (a \u201c[+]-prefix\u201d is added on phones) to warn users that a call claiming to be local is actually from abroad. These measures have had some effect, though scammers continually seek workarounds (like using messaging apps instead of SMS, or buying local SIM cards illicitly \u2013 an issue the government is addressing via stricter SIM card registration laws\u30109\u2020L409-L417\u3011\u30109\u2020L413-L421\u3011). Social media and online marketplaces are another vector \u2013 scams proliferate on Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Carousell, etc. The authorities (e.g. IMDA under the new Online Criminal Harms Act) now have powers to compel platforms to take down scam content or block fake accounts more swiftly. For instance, under the law passed in 2023, the government can direct internet services to **block phishing websites or domains** and instruct social media platforms to remove posts that promote scams or impersonate government bodies. These tools have been used to tackle malicious sites and fraudulent crypto investment ads targeting Singapore users. While tech companies\u2019 cooperation is improving, it\u2019s an ongoing battle to keep online ecosystems safe. Public education messages increasingly emphasize that **\u201cGovernment officials will NEVER ask for personal details or transfers over a call\u201d**\u301039\u2020L21-L27\u3011 and that **banks will never send clickable login links via SMS** \u2013 simple rules that, if internalized, would stop a large share of scams at the outset.\n\n## Government Education and Outreach Efforts  \n\n### Public Awareness Campaigns  \nThe Singapore government, recognizing the severity of the scam scourge, has mounted extensive public education campaigns in recent years. The **Cyber Security Agency (CSA)** leads annual national cybersecurity awareness campaigns. In **2021**, CSA launched the **\u201cBetter Cyber Safe than Sorry\u201d** campaign to instill four basic cyber hygiene tips in the public\u2019s mindset\u301016\u2020L57-L66\u3011\u301016\u2020L68-L72\u3011. These tips were: *use strong passwords and enable 2FA* on accounts, *spot the signs of phishing*, *install antivirus software*, and *promptly update software*\u301016\u2020L67-L72\u3011. The campaign drew parallels between cybersecurity habits and everyday safety (e.g. comparing software updates to locking doors), and was advertised widely on TV, public transport, and online platforms\u301016\u2020L57-L65\u3011. By **2023**, CSA rolled out its fifth campaign titled **\u201cThe Unseen Enemy\u201d**, highlighting that cyber threats and scams are often invisible yet pervasive in daily life\u301015\u2020L51-L59\u3011. This campaign reinforced *four key cyber tips* in fighting scams: **Enable 2FA & use strong passphrases**, **Beware of phishing scams (think before you click)**, **Keep software updated**, and **Add protective tools like ScamShield and antivirus apps**\u301015\u2020L63-L71\u3011. Eye-catching visuals and slogans were deployed on buses, MRT stations, digital billboards, and social media feeds\u301015\u2020L57-L65\u3011\u301015\u2020L63-L71\u3011. CSA also collaborated with popular banks, e-commerce platforms and local influencers to amplify these messages to their audiences\u301015\u2020L73-L79\u3011. This multi-channel outreach is crucial in repeatedly exposing the public to safe online practices. There is evidence that such campaigns have improved general awareness of things like 2FA and phishing \u2013 for instance, many more people now know not to click strange links, even if not everyone adheres perfectly.\n\nIn addition to CSA\u2019s efforts, the **National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC)** (a government-supported volunteer council) runs complementary anti-scam publicity. In 2023, NCPC launched a national anti-scam slogan **\u201cI can ACT against scams\u201d** to urge the public to take concrete steps, summarized as **A.C.T: Add, Check, Tell**\u301030\u2020L63-L70\u3011. **\u201cAdd\u201d** means install the **ScamShield** app (which blocks known scam calls/SMS) and add antivirus protection\u301030\u2020L67-L75\u3011; **\u201cCheck\u201d** means always verify requests for money or data through official sources (e.g. call the bank\u2019s hotline if someone claims to be from your bank)\u301030\u2020L79-L88\u3011\u301030\u2020L91-L99\u3011; and **\u201cTell\u201d** means inform your family and friends about scams and report incidents promptly\u301030\u2020L99-L107\u3011\u301030\u2020L109-L117\u3011. The ACT campaign has been promoted via short films, radio ads, social media posts, and even community roadshows. Notably, authorities set up a **24/7 Scam helpline (tel: 1799)** that anyone can call if unsure about a call or message \u2013 this is publicized as a resource to \u201cStop and Check\u201d suspicious situations\u301039\u2020L21-L27\u3011. NCPC also produces bite-sized scam alert graphics that are shared on WhatsApp and community notice boards, often in multiple languages, to reach heartlanders who may not follow official websites. \n\nThese campaigns have had encouraging results in specific areas. For example, SPF reported **significant declines in certain scam types in 2024 due to public education and enforcement** \u2013 *fake friend call scams* (where scammers impersonate friends asking for money urgently) saw both case numbers and amounts drop substantially after publicity and cross-border police action\u30107\u2020L1629-L1637\u3011. Similarly, *social media impersonation scams* and *tech support malware scams* declined in frequency, which SPF attributed in part to measures implemented by government, banks, and telcos to warn users and block avenues\u30107\u2020L1637-L1644\u3011. While overall scam figures are still high, these examples show that targeted education combined with action can suppress specific threats. A challenge, however, is that as soon as one modus operandi becomes well-known, scammers pivot to new stories. Thus, public education must be *continuously adaptive* \u2013 recent efforts have started addressing emerging threats like cryptocurrency fraud and AI-driven scams (for instance, CSA\u2019s latest materials include scenarios on deepfake videos and fake investment platforms). \n\n### Law Enforcement and Legislative Measures  \nThe government has progressively strengthened laws and operational capabilities to combat scams, which indirectly boosts public confidence in dealing with online transactions. A notable initiative is the SPF\u2019s **Anti-Scam Command (ASCom)**, established in March 2022, which centralizes police resources to respond to scams in real-time\u30107\u2020L1662-L1670\u3011. ASCom works closely with banks and telecommunication companies to freeze illicit fund flows and takedown phishing infrastructure. In 2024 alone, the police **recovered over S$182 million** of scammed monies through prompt intervention, and even *averted* an estimated **S$483 million in potential losses** by interceding when victims were in the middle of a scam transaction\u30107\u2020L1662-L1670\u3011\u30107\u2020L1664-L1671\u3011. Such interventions often involve analyzing banking transaction patterns to spot likely scam payments and contacting the account holders or temporarily halting transfers. In one dramatic case, an **82-year-old man was stopped from losing $3.7 million** after police and bank staff identified unusual activity and intervened three separate times when scammers tried to persuade him to transfer funds\u301021\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301021\u2020L31-L35\u3011. These efforts demonstrate a whole-of-system vigilance that complements individual vigilance.\n\nOn the legal front, Singapore has introduced new legislation specifically targeting scam tactics and facilitators. In 2023, Parliament passed the **Online Criminal Harms Act**, which, as mentioned, grants authorities quicker powers to block or remove online content facilitating scams (phishing sites, scam web ads, etc.). In 2025, another innovative law \u2013 the **Protection from Scams Act** \u2013 came into effect, empowering police to issue **\u201cRestriction Orders\u201d** to banks to *temporarily freeze* a suspected victim\u2019s bank account if the person is in the midst of being scammed\u301011\u2020L135-L143\u3011\u301011\u2020L168-L176\u3011. This law was designed to protect those stubborn few who, even after being warned, insist on transferring money to scammers. From 2019 to 2023, scam cases involving **voluntary victim transfers (\u201cself-effected\u201d scams) remained exceedingly high \u2013 86% of cases in early 2024**\u301011\u2020L154-L162\u3011. The Police had no legal means to stop a determined victim from sending money away, until now. Under the new Act, if the Police assess that an individual is likely about to be scammed (for example, a retiree under the sway of a fake \u201cChina police\u201d caller trying to clear out her account), they can direct the bank to restrict that person\u2019s outgoing transfers for a short period\u301011\u2020L170-L178\u3011\u301011\u2020L189-L197\u3011. This is a drastic measure to be used as a last resort, but it could save individuals from irreparable financial harm. Appropriate checks are built in \u2013 the order can be lifted if the situation is clarified \u2013 but it signals how far Singapore is willing to go to thwart scams. Additionally, penalties for being a **money mule** (people who allow their bank accounts to be used to launder scam money) have been stiffened. Under amendments to laws like the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes Act and Computer Misuse Act, those who sell their bank account or Singpass login to scammers can face jail and be forced to forfeit gains\u30109\u2020L399-L407\u3011\u30109\u2020L401-L409\u3011. In 2024, police arrested over **8,000 scammers and money mules** in island-wide operations, and more than 660 were prosecuted \u2013 including 110 charged under these strengthened laws that target enablers of scams\u30109\u2020L409-L417\u3011. By choking the local facilitators and swiftly freezing fraudulent proceeds, the government aims to make Singapore a hard target for scam syndicates.\n\nOverall, the government\u2019s multifaceted response \u2013 **education, engineering, enforcement** \u2013 has ramped up significantly. The creation of an Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams means agencies ranging from Home Affairs, Communications and Information, Education, Finance, and Social and Family Development are coordinating on this issue. Public outreach and improved defenses are starting to show results in stabilizing the growth of scam cases (for instance, the number of cases grew ~11% in 2024, slower than previous years, even as total losses jumped due to a few big cases\u30105\u2020L163-L171\u3011). Yet, the consensus is that the fight is far from over, and in some respects will only get tougher as scams mutate.\n\n## Gaps and Challenges in the Current System  \nDespite all the measures in place, several gaps persist in Singapore\u2019s cyber scam defenses. These shortfalls need to be addressed to achieve a truly scam-resilient nation:\n\n- **Residual Lack of Awareness/Alertness:** A portion of the public remains inadequately informed or insufficiently skeptical. This is evident from the steady stream of victims falling for fairly *known* scams (e.g. e-commerce bargains that are too good to be true, or callers asking for OTPs). While outreach has improved awareness *in general*, it may not be penetrating deeply into certain communities or translating into day-to-day caution. For example, **foreign language speakers and less educated individuals** might not fully grasp campaigns delivered mainly in English, creating pockets of lower awareness. Additionally, new entrants to the digital world (such as some seniors or young teens getting their first smartphone) may not receive timely education before encountering scams. Thus, pockets of the population still have low baseline knowledge of cyber risks.\n\n- **Human Factor and Social Engineering:** The **human element** remains the weakest link. As noted, over 80% of scams involve *social engineering* \u2013 scammers manipulating victims to willingly transfer money\u301011\u2020L154-L162\u3011. No amount of firewalls or spam filters can fully prevent a person from being tricked if they trust the wrong person. Singaporeans may have a cultural tendency to be trusting or deferential to authority, which scammers exploit. The current education efforts, while telling people \u201cdon\u2019t trust unsolicited calls\u201d, sometimes collide with deeply ingrained habits of trust. Moreover, scam tactics exploiting *emotions* \u2013 fear (in impersonation scams), greed (in investment scams), or love (in romance scams) \u2013 can override rational judgment. This means our education and intervention methods might not sufficiently account for psychological manipulation. Some victims continue to transfer funds **even after multiple warnings**, essentially under a form of social coercion\u301011\u2020L159-L167\u3011. The system lacks a robust way to \u201cdeprogram\u201d someone in the grips of a scam narrative beyond the new drastic measure of freezing accounts. In summary, the challenge is less about pure *knowledge* and more about *behavioral change* \u2013 getting people to internalize skepticism and break the spell of scam narratives.\n\n- **Elderly and At-Risk Groups Not Fully Reached:** While programs for seniors exist, it\u2019s unclear if we are reaching the *majority* of at-risk elders or just a fraction. Many seniors who live alone or are not socially active may not attend community workshops. Some might also overestimate their ability to handle scams \u2013 for instance, an IMDA survey found only **44% of seniors were at least moderately confident in spotting scams**, meaning over half admitted low confidence, yet others might be falsely confident\u301027\u2020L37-L42\u3011. The current outreach might not adequately cover those with mobility issues or those who do not actively seek help. Similarly, migrant workers and low-income individuals might not be attending existing programmes due to work schedules or lack of awareness. These gaps leave a segment of the population as \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d for scammers.\n\n- **Emerging Threats Outpacing Response:** Scammers continuously innovate, and there can be a lag before countermeasures catch up. For example, the surge of **malware-enabled scams via fake apps** in 2023 took some time to be widely recognized; by the time advisories went out, significant losses had occurred (one case accounted for a huge crypto theft)\u30107\u2020L1642-L1650\u3011. The rise of **AI-generated scams** (such as deepfake voices of loved ones crying for help, or convincingly tailored phishing messages) is a looming threat that the general public is not yet well-prepared for. Only **5% of Singaporeans feel confident in detecting AI-driven fraud**\u301033\u2020L95-L100\u3011, which is worrisome as we expect such scams to increase. The government has begun talking about these issues, but proactive public guidance (e.g. \u201cif you get an urgent call supposedly from your child but asking for money, be aware it could be AI fake\u201d) is still nascent. In short, our scam awareness campaigns may sometimes be reactive (after the scam becomes widespread) rather than proactive. The **speed of threat identification** and public advisory could be improved.\n\n- **Coordination and Information Sharing:** With multiple agencies and private sector stakeholders involved, coordination is crucial. While the Inter-Ministry Committee and ABS Fraud Committee exist, there may be room for more seamless information sharing. For instance, scammer techniques spotted by banks might need to be rapidly communicated to telecommunication firms and social media companies to block vectors, and vice versa. A fully integrated \u201cearly warning system\u201d for scams is still in development. Victims sometimes report feeling passed around between the bank, police, etc. when trying to seek help. Smoother processes (perhaps a one-stop support channel for scam victims beyond just the helpline) could be established. Also, while Singapore collaborates with regional law enforcement (e.g. with Malaysia to bust call centers\u30107\u2020L1631-L1639\u3011), cross-border cooperation can always be expanded given many syndicates operate from overseas.\n\n- **Bank and Corporate Practices:** Some gaps lie in implementation by institutions. Not all banks have the same level of rigor in anti-scam user experience \u2013 for example, some banking apps now force users to read scam advisories when performing certain actions, but others may not. There have been calls for banks to introduce *dynamic warnings* (e.g. if an elderly customer suddenly tries to transfer an unusually large sum, prompt a \u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t a scam?\u201d confirmation or require a bank officer to call). It\u2019s unclear if all banks have deployed such targeted interventions. Additionally, outside of banking, other industries like e-commerce platforms or gig economy apps may not be doing enough to warn or educate users. A person renting a flat online or buying on a marketplace might not see any fraud warning until after they\u2019ve been cheated. Hence, a gap exists in **industry-wide adoption of anti-scam best practices** beyond the financial sector. \n\n- **Public Fatigue and Complacency:** Finally, as scam warnings have become ubiquitous, there is a risk of **alert fatigue** \u2013 people may start tuning out repetitive warnings. Some may feel \u201cscams are so common, if it happens it happens\u201d or develop a false sense that they personally won\u2019t be duped (overconfidence). This complacency is dangerous. The gap here is in finding fresh, engaging ways to convey warnings so that the public doesn\u2019t become desensitized. Empathy-led education (as some experts suggest) that really makes individuals *feel* the impact of scams (perhaps by hearing victims\u2019 stories) might be necessary to break through complacency. \n\nIn summary, Singapore\u2019s anti-scam framework is robust and improving, but needs to address the human and emerging-tech angles more deeply. Education must become more action-oriented and pervasive, and systems must be nimble to adapt to new scam tricks. With these gaps identified, we now move to concrete recommendations to strengthen our national resilience against scams.\n\n## Recommendations for Strengthening Singapore\u2019s Cyber-Scam Defenses  \nAddressing the complex scam problem requires a **comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy**. Below are recommended actions targeted at key stakeholders and ministries, aiming to fill the gaps identified. These solutions build upon existing efforts and introduce new measures to better protect Singaporeans of all ages:\n\n1. **Enhance Public Education through Empathy and Real-Life Simulation**  \n   *Lead agencies: Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) \u2013 including CSA and IMDA; Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA); Ministry of Education (MOE)*  \n   Traditional awareness campaigns should evolve into more engaging, empathy-led education. **We recommend incorporating real scam simulations and personal stories into public outreach.** For example, CSA and SPF could set up interactive exhibits or online modules where people can safely experience a mock phishing attempt or an AI-generated scam call, then learn from it. This hands-on approach can expose overconfident individuals to the fact that scams can fool them, correcting the inflated self-assurance many have\u301033\u2020L83-L91\u3011. It also aligns with expert suggestions to use *real-world learning* and case studies to improve scam readiness\u301033\u2020L135-L144\u3011. In parallel, leverage victim testimonials (with consent) in media \u2013 hearing a fellow citizen describe \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be duped, but I was\u201d can be powerful. The goal is to foster an emotional understanding of scams\u2019 impact, not just intellectual awareness. MCI\u2019s campaigns might partner with local broadcasters to create short drama vignettes or documentaries on scam victims and heroes (similar to the Crimewatch TV episodes, but focused on scams). By evoking empathy, we make the public more receptive to anti-scam advice and less prone to blame victims. \n\n   Furthermore, **public education must be continuous and in multiple languages/formats.** Translate key campaign materials into Mandarin, Malay, Tamil and dialects, using simple analogies relevant to those communities. Grassroots channels like community centres, clan associations, and religious organizations should be enlisted to spread anti-scam messages in culturally appropriate ways. For instance, scam talks could be integrated into activities at seniors\u2019 clubs or during festive community dinners (when attendance is high). We also recommend exploring partnerships with popular media (radio DJs, TV personalities, internet influencers) to periodically remind followers about new scam tactics. Just as health campaigns constantly remind people about dengue or COVID-19, scam awareness needs to be a persistent drumbeat \u2013 without causing fear, but encouraging vigilance.\n\n2. **Strengthen Cybersecurity Curriculum and Training in Schools and Workplaces**  \n   *Lead agency: MOE (with support from MCI/CSA and MOM)*  \n   The foundation for long-term cyber resilience is education from young. MOE should further fortify the curriculum on cybersecurity and digital financial literacy. **We propose making cyber scam awareness a formal component of national education across all levels \u2013 with age-appropriate depth.** For primary schools, this might mean simple \u201cStranger Danger\u201d analogies for the online world (don\u2019t trust unknown messages, always ask an adult). At secondary level and junior college, incorporate modules on common scam case studies, how to verify authenticity online, and the psychology of scams. As noted in MOE\u2019s parliamentary response, elements exist in CCE and other subjects\u301032\u2020L120-L128\u3011; we recommend expanding these with up-to-date examples each year. Students could be tasked to do projects (e.g. designing an anti-scam poster or app) or given scenario-based assessments (e.g. analyzing a mock scam message) to ensure practical understanding. **Cyber safety should also be part of Polytechnic and University orientation programs**, since tertiary students begin to handle finances (loans, investments) independently and are actively targeted by certain scams (job scams, loan scams). An annual workshop or e-learning module could be mandated for first-year tertiary students, possibly in collaboration with CSA\u2019s youth outreach (like the SG Cyber Safe Students Programme).\n\n   Beyond schools, working adults need continuous training as well. The Government could encourage or incentivize **workplace cybersecurity awareness trainings**. Many companies already conduct periodic phishing email tests and IT security briefings for employees \u2013 this practice should be promoted across all sectors, not just in IT firms. For example, the Monetary Authority (MAS) can require financial institutions to include scam awareness refreshers for their staff and front-line customer service, so they in turn can educate customers. The Ministry of Manpower could work with unions and employer associations to roll out a standard \u201cfraud awareness\u201d module in existing training frameworks (perhaps as part of SkillsFuture courses or HR onboarding). A national e-learning portal could be offered where any adult can log in and take an interactive course on identifying scams, with multimedia content drawn from real cases. Such an initiative might be led by CSA/IMDA under the *Digital for Life* umbrella, ensuring it\u2019s accessible to all citizens (including those outside formal education).\n\n3. **Expand and Deepen Outreach to Seniors and Other Vulnerable Groups**  \n   *Lead agencies: MCI/IMDA (Digital Inclusion), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), People\u2019s Association (PA)*  \n   While current programmes for seniors are commendable\u301039\u2020L52-L60\u3011, we need to further expand their reach and tailor them to the varying needs of older adults. **First**, increase the number of *Digital Ambassadors* and community workshops such that they cover more neighbourhoods and senior living facilities. Consider a target to reach *every HDB estate\u2019s senior community* at least once a year with an anti-scam workshop or info-session. Partner with PA and town councils to piggyback on existing senior activities (e.g. monthly mahjong clubs or exercise groups can start with a 10-minute scam tip segment). **Second**, create a *\u201cScam Guardian\u201d volunteer program* where tech-savvy seniors (perhaps retirees who were bankers, teachers, etc.) are trained to be ambassadors to their peers. Peers may trust advice from someone of their own generation more. The police have piloted \u201cP.R.A.I.S.E.\u201d senior volunteer schemes for crime prevention\u301021\u2020L39-L43\u3011; this can be expanded specifically for scam education.\n\n   **Third**, employ more targeted safeguards for seniors in the banking system. We suggest that MAS work with banks on an *opt-in security setting* for vulnerable customers: for example, a senior can register to have any transaction above a certain amount delayed until a bank officer contacts them for verification. Alternatively, a family member could be designated to receive an alert when large transfers occur (with the senior\u2019s consent and in compliance with privacy laws). This acts as a circuit-breaker in case the senior is being coached by a scammer in real time \u2013 a pattern we\u2019ve seen in several cases. We also recommend that banks simplify their user interfaces for seniors: perhaps a dedicated \u201csenior mode\u201d in banking apps with larger text and very clear, repetitive warning prompts (e.g. \u201cHave you confirmed this request is real? If someone on the phone asked you to do this, it is likely a SCAM.\u201d). MAS could issue guidelines on user interface considerations for elderly or less educated users, ensuring inclusivity in fintech.\n\n   **Fourth**, for other vulnerable segments like migrant workers and domestic helpers, deliver scam education in their native languages and through channels they trust. This might involve roadshows in dormitories, pocket-sized brochures in Bengali, Chinese, Tamil, etc., and engaging major employers to brief their workers. As many migrant workers may be targeted by overseas scammers (pretending to be from their home country authorities), MFA and embassies can also help disseminate warnings. In summary, a *community-centric approach* is needed \u2013 meeting vulnerable groups where they are, rather than expecting them to find the information themselves.\n\n4. **Bolster Technological and Legal Defenses Proactively**  \n   *Lead agencies: MHA/SPF, MCI/IMDA, GovTech, MAS*  \n   The government should continue to strengthen the tech and legal infrastructure that shields citizens, anticipating new scam tactics. **On the technology front**, we recommend investing in advanced scam detection and blocking tools. GovTech\u2019s development of tools like **ScamShield and the Scam Analytics Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)** \u2013 which uses data analytics to identify scam websites and communications \u2013 is a great example\u301033\u2020L99-L107\u3011. These efforts should be accelerated and expanded: for instance, deploying AI to monitor and **flag scam trends on social media** (in partnership with platform providers) and to detect mass spam calls or messages in real-time for prompt blocking. The **ScamShield mobile app** (which filters scam SMS and calls) should be aggressively promoted \u2013 every smartphone user in Singapore ought to have it installed as a first line of defense. To achieve this, the government could collaborate with telcos to push automatic prompts or even include ScamShield in phone setup for local users. In addition, explore integrating ScamShield\u2019s filtering intelligence at the network level, so even those without the app get some protection (e.g. a network-wide SMS filter for known scam keywords or blacklisted numbers).\n\n   **Legally**, Singapore must stay nimble. If scammers shift to new platforms or methods, laws/regulations might need updates. For example, if cryptocurrency scams continue rising, MAS may consider tighter regulation of crypto advertisements or requiring local internet service providers to block access to known fraudulent crypto sites (with a nimble whitelist/blacklist process). The new **Restriction Orders** power should be used judiciously but decisively \u2013 SPF should develop clear protocols on when to invoke it, and officers must be trained to identify those extreme cases where victims are in trance-like compliance with scammers\u301011\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301011\u2020L168-L176\u3011. Additionally, enhance cross-border legal cooperation: build on successes with Malaysian police in syndicate busts\u30107\u2020L1631-L1639\u3011 by forging deeper ties with regional countries where scams originate (China, Philippines, Indonesia, etc.). MHA could initiate regional dialogues specifically on scam crime, aiming for faster intelligence sharing and joint operations. The recently established ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation strategy could include scam mitigation as a priority item.\n\n   Another recommendation is to **hold enablers accountable**. This includes not just money mules (which is being done with tougher laws and prosecutions) but also potentially companies that negligently allow scams to propagate. For instance, if a social media platform consistently fails to remove scam ads that victimize users, the government should not shy away from sanctions or public rebuke to spur better self-regulation. The *Shared Responsibility Framework* should extend beyond banks to encompass telcos and online platforms as \u201ckey parties in the ecosystem\u201d responsible for anti-scam duties\u301040\u2020L169-L177\u3011. This multi-party responsibility will incentivize all private stakeholders to actively implement anti-scam measures or face consequences.\n\n5. **Foster a Scam-Resilient Culture and Community Support**  \n   *Lead agencies: All ministries via public communications, National Crime Prevention Council, community organizations*  \n   Ultimately, defeating scams is not only about government action but also about cultivating a vigilant culture in society. We recommend initiatives to make scam awareness as commonplace as, say, road safety or public health consciousness under the **Total Defence** ethos. One idea is to designate an **annual \u201cAnti-Scam Awareness Day\u201d** or week, where nationwide events (talks, exhibitions, media programs) focus on scams \u2013 similar to how Singapore has a National Safety Month or Cybersecurity Awareness Month. This could rally schools, companies, and community groups to run their own anti-scam activities in synchrony, reinforcing messages through multiple channels at once.\n\n   Encourage a norm where people *look out for one another*. For example, neighbourhood committees can set up \u201cdigital watch groups\u201d \u2013 neighbors volunteer to help less savvy residents verify suspicious messages (much like a Neighborhood Watch but for scams). Families should be urged to have conversations about scams: Parent-teacher associations can provide discussion guides for parents to teach children and vice versa (children warning elderly parents). The SGScamWISE program mentioned in a recent report focuses on community empowerment \u2013 training individuals who then educate their circles\u301033\u2020L147-L155\u3011 \u2013 this model should be supported by government grants and recognition. We propose small grants to community clubs or NGOs that come up with creative anti-scam projects (e.g. a youth group developing a mobile game about spotting scams, or an arts group producing comics in vernacular languages on scams). Such ground-up efforts can complement official campaigns and may connect better with certain audiences.\n\n   Additionally, provide **support for scam victims** as part of building resilience. Being scammed can be traumatic; victims might be reluctant to speak up, which then limits others learning from these incidents. The government could partner with counselling services or financial advisory services to help victims recover emotionally and plan their financial next steps, reducing the stigma of being a victim. Visible support will encourage reporting and cooperation with law enforcement. Over time, as more people share their stories and help others avoid the same fate, the community becomes stronger against scammers.\n\n6. **Continuous Review and Foresight**  \n   *Lead agency: Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS)*  \n   Lastly, make sure the fight against scams stays ahead of the curve. The IMCS should set up a dedicated **Scam Foresight and Analytics unit** (possibly within CSA or SPF) that continuously studies emerging scam trends locally and globally. This unit can work with academia and industry to anticipate the next tactics \u2013 be it scams via the metaverse, or using AI to generate fake law enforcement IDs, etc. Proactively run \u201cred team\u201d exercises: think like scammers to identify vulnerabilities in new digital services (for example, as Singapore rolls out digital banking or government e-services, consider how they could be abused in scams and patch those gaps or educate users accordingly). Scenario planning exercises can be conducted (similar to crisis simulations) to test national readiness for, say, a widespread deepfake scam incident. The insights from this foresight group should be fed into policy updates and public advisories promptly. In essence, institutionalize *agility* in our approach \u2013 scammers pivot quickly, so must we.\n\nBy implementing the above recommendations, Singapore can significantly tighten the screws on scam operations and enhance the public\u2019s ability to avoid deception. Each recommendation addresses specific gaps \u2013 from human behavioral weaknesses to systemic coordination \u2013 and together they form a robust strategy to safeguard our increasingly digital way of life.\n\n## Conclusion  \nCyber scams will likely persist as a long-term threat, evolving with technology and social trends. However, Singapore can turn the tide by making scam awareness and preparedness a national priority on par with physical security. The post-2019 spike in scams was a wake-up call; the response so far has been strong but must continue to intensify. By educating our citizens comprehensively, protecting the vulnerable, deploying smart technologies, and enacting agile policies, we can drastically reduce the success rate of scammers. This report has identified the critical areas for improvement and offered actionable solutions for the Government and stakeholders. Implementing these recommendations will require coordination across ministries \u2013 from MHA and MCI to MOE, MAS, MSF and beyond \u2013 reflecting the fact that tackling scams is truly a **whole-of-nation effort**.\n\nSingapore has often been lauded for its safety and trustworthiness in the physical realm; the aim now is to extend that reputation to the digital sphere. With decisive action, Singapore can become a place where cyber criminals find little quarter \u2013 a well-informed public, backed by vigilant institutions, will mean most scams are spotted and foiled before any damage is done. We owe this to our citizens, especially the most vulnerable, to ensure that our smart nation is also a safe nation. The fight against scams is unending, but by staying united, vigilant, and proactive, we will safeguard Singapore\u2019s digital future from those who seek to exploit it\u301033\u2020L156-L159\u3011. \n\n**Sources:** The findings and data in this report draw from official Singapore Police Force scam statistics, government press releases, parliamentary records, and reputable news outlets and research studies, including but not limited to CSA and SPF publications\u30108\u2020L349-L357\u3011\u301011\u2020L142-L150\u3011\u301033\u2020L77-L85\u3011, media reports from *The Straits Times*, *Channel NewsAsia*, *Reuters*\u30105\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u30107\u2020L1611-L1619\u3011, and expert analyses on public scam readiness\u301033\u2020L83-L91\u3011\u301033\u2020L95-L100\u3011.

According to the report, one in three Singaporeans has fallen victim to a scam. Among those aged 18 to 34\u2014digital natives who are deeply integrated into the digital economy\u2014this figure rises to nearly 50%.

Surge in Scam Cases and Losses:**  \nFrom 2019 to 2024, scam reports in Singapore rose sharply from ~9,500 to over 51,500 cases annually, with financial losses jumping from hundreds of millions to **S$1.1 billion** in 2024 alone. Scams now constitute a significant portion of local crime.\n\n**2. Common and Most Damaging Scams:**  \n- *E-commerce purchase scams* are most frequent; *investment scams* and *government/bank impersonation* cause the greatest losses.  \n- Increasingly sophisticated methods (phishing, malware, AI-generated deepfakes, crypto fraud) have outpaced public preparedness.\n\n**3. Victim Profile:**  \n- All demographics are affected; young adults are often targeted, but elderly and less educated suffer higher average losses.  \n- Overconfidence in scam-detection is common; actual scam-recognition ability is weak.\n\n**4. Preparedness and Response:**  \n- Government, banks, and industry have implemented awareness campaigns, legal reforms, and technical safeguards (e.g., ScamShield, transaction limits, emergency \u201ckill switch\u201d, account restriction orders).\n- Education on cyber scams exists in schools and outreach to seniors, but gaps persist: not all at-risk groups are reached, practical preparedness is lacking, and response lags behind emerging threats.\n\n**5. Key Gaps:**  \n- Persistent lack of practical scam resistance, especially in vulnerable groups  \n- Human behavioral factors not fully addressed  \n- Outreach and education coverage incomplete  \n- Industry and platform anti-scam efforts are inconsistent  \n- Response to emerging, high-tech scams is often reactive\n\n---\n\n## **Recommended Measures and Justifications**  \n\n**1.

Here is a **highly condensed research summary** on cyber scams in Singapore (2019\u2013present), with a *full-length, detailed* section on recommended measures and justifications, presented in academic prose and continuous narrative.\n\n---\n\n**The Proliferation of Cyber Scams in Singapore and Policy Recommendations for a Resilient Digital Society**\n\nOver the past half-decade, Singapore has experienced an unprecedented surge in cyber scams, mirroring global trends but exacerbated by the nation\u2019s rapid digitalization and pandemic-induced shifts in consumer behavior. Since 2019, scam cases have quintupled, with financial losses exceeding S$1.1 billion in 2024 alone\u2014an alarming escalation that has rendered online scams the predominant form of crime nationwide. These crimes encompass a wide spectrum, from e-commerce and phishing schemes to sophisticated investment frauds and impersonation attacks, with both the young and elderly falling victim. Despite notable increases in general awareness, surveys and incident data reveal significant deficits in practical cyber-preparedness: while over 80% of Singaporeans believe they can identify scams, fewer than half can correctly discern phishing attempts in controlled tests. The psychological vulnerabilities of trust, overconfidence, and social engineering continue to be systematically exploited, resulting in persistent victimization across all demographic groups.\n\nSingapore\u2019s response has been robust and multi-faceted, leveraging public awareness campaigns, regulatory and technological interventions, and targeted outreach to vulnerable populations. The Ministry of Home Affairs, Cyber Security Agency, and Monetary Authority of Singapore have all played crucial roles in raising awareness, hardening the technological environment, and coordinating law enforcement actions. Nonetheless, major challenges endure, including residual knowledge gaps among seniors and non-English speakers, the adaptability of scam syndicates employing AI and malware, alert fatigue among the general public, and uneven efficacy in institutional education efforts, particularly among financial institutions and non-digital natives. In light of these findings, a comprehensive set of recommendations is warranted, targeting the root causes and evolving nature of the scam epidemic.\n\n**Recommendations for a Scam-Resilient Singapore**\n\nAddressing the complex and adaptive nature of cyber scams demands a suite of evidence-based, coordinated measures spanning public education, institutional design, legal frameworks, and community mobilization. The following recommendations, grounded in the Singaporean context and supported by local and international best practices, seek to address the key identified vulnerabilities.\n\n**1. Enhance Public Education through Empathy and Simulation**\n\nPublic education campaigns must evolve from passive dissemination of warnings to active, empathy-driven learning. The government should develop interactive scam simulation modules and incorporate authentic victim testimonials into mainstream outreach, both online and at community events. Simulated scam exercises can correct misplaced public overconfidence and foster emotional resonance, making cyber risk salient rather than abstract. Importantly, outreach must be multilingual and leverage community groups and local influencers to ensure penetration across all segments, including non-English speakers and digitally marginalized populations. Engaging media campaigns, regular community briefings, and partnerships with local personalities can prevent \u201calert fatigue\u201d by maintaining public engagement and personalizing the scam threat.\n\n**Justification:**  \nEmpirical evidence and behavioral science indicate that hands-on, emotionally salient experiences\u2014rather than passive information\u2014are most effective in shaping protective behavior. Overconfidence and fatigue are common pitfalls; simulations and personal stories act as cognitive and emotional correctives, leading to longer retention and more prudent action.\n\n**2. Institutionalize Cybersecurity and Scam Awareness in Education and Workplaces**\n\nCyber resilience should be embedded formally into the national education curriculum from primary through tertiary levels. The Ministry of Education must continuously update and deepen scam awareness content, employing real-world case studies, scenario-based training, and age-appropriate digital literacy projects. Tertiary institutions and polytechnics should mandate cyber-safety orientations, while SkillsFuture and other adult learning platforms should integrate scam recognition modules. In parallel, all employers\u2014particularly in the financial and technology sectors\u2014should provide regular staff training and conduct simulated phishing and scam drills. National portals could provide universally accessible e-learning modules, under the stewardship of CSA and IMDA.\n\n**Justification:**  \nEarly and repeated exposure to scam scenarios builds lifelong skepticism and analytical habits. Institutionalizing these practices ensures that each new generation is equipped to confront evolving threats, and that working adults are regularly updated as tactics change.\n\n**3. Deepen and Broaden Outreach to Seniors and Vulnerable Groups**\n\nSeniors, the less digitally literate, migrant workers, and those with language barriers require tailored, proactive outreach. Existing community-based initiatives\u2014such as Digital Ambassadors and peer-led workshops\u2014should be substantially expanded, with targets to reach all senior HDB estates annually. Banks should provide opt-in enhanced security modes for seniors, including default lower transfer limits and family alerts for large transactions. Community groups and NGOs should be resourced to deliver scam education in native languages, with face-to-face and hands-on training prioritized for those least likely to seek help online.\n\n**Justification:**  \nVictim data shows that while all demographics are affected, seniors and those less familiar with technology suffer disproportionately large losses. Proactive, community-driven education and system-level protections address both informational and behavioral vulnerabilities.\n\n**4. Bolster Technological and Legal Defenses with Proactivity and Integration**\n\nThe government must accelerate the deployment and adoption of technological tools such as ScamShield and invest in AI-driven, real-time monitoring of scam trends across digital platforms. Telecoms and online platforms should be held to higher standards, with legal obligations to implement network-level filtering and rapid takedown of scam content. Regulatory frameworks like the Shared Responsibility Framework should be swiftly finalized and expanded to cover not just banks, but all key service providers, ensuring equitable loss-sharing and incentivizing collective diligence. Laws enabling timely police interventions (such as temporary account freezes) must be judiciously applied and supported by clear protocols.\n\n**Justification:**  \nScammers exploit systemic lag between innovation and response. Proactive technological and legal integration creates overlapping layers of defense, reducing response time and closing gaps before they can be exploited at scale.\n\n**5. Foster a Scam-Resilient Culture and Mobilize Community Support**\n\nBeyond state-led interventions, fostering a societal culture of mutual vigilance and stigma-free reporting is essential. Annual Anti-Scam Awareness campaigns, community \u201cdigital watch groups,\u201d and the promotion of ground-up initiatives\u2014such as youth-developed anti-scam games or neighborhood discussion forums\u2014will diffuse ownership of the problem. Support services for scam victims, including financial counseling and peer support, should be normalized and visible, reducing shame and facilitating timely reporting.\n\n**Justification:**  \nSustainable resilience requires distributed vigilance and empowerment. Community ownership and destigmatization increase reporting rates, provide support to victims, and promote diffusion of best practices.\n\n**6. Institutionalize Continuous Foresight and Rapid Adaptation**\n\nA dedicated foresight and analytics unit within the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams should conduct horizon scanning, scenario planning, and regular red-teaming exercises, anticipating emerging threats such as deepfake-enabled fraud or next-generation social engineering. Insights must be rapidly translated into both public guidance and technical countermeasures. Cross-sectoral information sharing\u2014among banks, telcos, platforms, and government\u2014should be institutionalized, with clear protocols for early warning and coordinated response.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe adaptive nature of scam syndicates necessitates continuous learning and preemptive action. Foresight and integrated intelligence enable nimble adaptation and maintain systemic resilience as technology and tactics evolve.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the persistent escalation of cyber scams in Singapore demands a forward-looking, holistic, and coordinated response. While progress has been achieved through legislative, educational, and technical initiatives, residual vulnerabilities remain\u2014primarily among at-risk groups, and in the capacity for adaptive, population-wide behavioral change. Implementing the measures above, with a strong emphasis on empathy-driven education, proactive defense, inclusive outreach, and institutional agility, will position Singapore to significantly curtail scam success rates and foster a digitally secure society. Only through sustained, collaborative effort\u2014across government, industry, and community\u2014can Singapore ensure that its digital transformation is matched by equal gains in cyber safety and public trust."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"6e01fdf5-8bdb-4073-bf14-524aaa8c6cf6","request_id":"959d2d8f5954f8c8-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6e01fdf5-8bdb-4073-bf14-524aaa8c6cf6","children":[]},"afe79030-1a9e-4909-ae50-298523585859":{"id":"afe79030-1a9e-4909-ae50-298523585859","message":{"id":"afe79030-1a9e-4909-ae50-298523585859","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751617591.742983,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Certainly.

This format is suitable for journal submission, policy review, or as a forward to ministries. \n\n---\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nCyber scams in Singapore have surged dramatically since 2019, inflicting over S$3 billion in financial losses and affecting citizens across all demographics. While government and industry have implemented a series of robust countermeasures, gaps in public preparedness, institutional response, and adaptation to new threats persist. This report provides an analysis of scam trends, assesses the effectiveness of current education and outreach initiatives, and delivers comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations. These measures are targeted at fortifying the nation\u2019s digital defenses, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable groups. The recommendations, detailed in full, are intended to inform policymakers and stakeholders seeking to build a resilient and scam-aware society.\n\n# Introduction\n\nSingapore\u2019s reputation for security and trust is being challenged by a relentless wave of cyber and online scams. From e-commerce and phishing to highly targeted impersonation and investment fraud, scammers have exploited pandemic-driven digitization and human vulnerabilities with increasing sophistication. The years since 2019 have seen an exponential rise in reported cases and financial damage, culminating in over 51,000 scam reports and losses exceeding S$1.1 billion in 2024 alone. This situation poses not only financial and emotional costs for individuals but also risks eroding public confidence in digital services\u2014undermining Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation ambitions.\n\nThis paper analyzes trends and causes underlying this surge in scams, evaluates the effectiveness of current public and institutional countermeasures, identifies systemic gaps, and proposes a set of comprehensive recommendations with full justification. The analysis draws on official government data, academic studies, and Singapore\u2019s mainstream media, focusing on the period from 2019 to the present.\n\n# Trends and Impact of Cyber Scams in Singapore\n\n**Escalating Scam Incidence and Losses**  \nSingapore experienced a more than fivefold increase in scam reports between 2019 and 2024, accompanied by an even greater surge in total losses. Common scams include e-commerce fraud, phishing (often targeting bank users), investment and cryptocurrency scams, and impersonation of officials. Notably, e-commerce scams are most prevalent by case numbers, but investment scams inflict the greatest financial harm.\n\n**Changing Victim Profiles**  \nContrary to common stereotypes, scam victims span all age groups and educational backgrounds. While seniors tend to lose more per incident, young adults\u2014particularly those active in digital finance and social media\u2014are increasingly targeted. Surveys reveal a worrying gap between self-assessed confidence in spotting scams and actual capability, suggesting widespread overconfidence.\n\n**Systemic Vulnerabilities**  \nThe post-pandemic transition to remote commerce and work, combined with the psychological manipulation techniques of scammers, have exposed systemic weaknesses. Even as awareness of scams has grown, concrete preparedness\u2014knowing how to act in the face of sophisticated fraud\u2014remains lacking for large segments of the population. \n\n# State of Cyber-Preparedness and Institutional Responses\n\n**Public Awareness and Education**  \nWhile public awareness of scams is high in principle, readiness to respond is much weaker in practice. The education system incorporates cyber-safety topics at multiple levels, but lessons are often generic and may not keep pace with fast-evolving tactics such as AI-enabled deepfakes and cryptocurrency fraud. For adults, most knowledge is acquired through informal sources, and even repeated official warnings are often ignored or misunderstood.\n\n**Protection for Vulnerable Groups**  \nPrograms targeting seniors and those less digitally literate (e.g., SG Cyber Safe Seniors, Digital Ambassadors, multilingual outreach) have made inroads, yet many in these groups remain under-reached or unable to translate knowledge into safe behaviors. Migrant workers and other non-native speakers face similar challenges, exacerbated by language and cultural barriers.\n\n**Industry and Government Measures**  \nFinancial institutions have implemented stronger digital security controls, public education, and\u2014following high-profile incidents\u2014are being held to new standards of shared responsibility for losses. Regulatory and legislative innovations, such as the Shared Responsibility Framework and the Protection from Scams Act, aim to rebalance accountability and provide authorities with new tools to preempt or respond to fraud. Nonetheless, the pace of adaptation sometimes lags behind that of criminal innovation, and coordination between stakeholders is not always seamless.\n\n# Gaps and Challenges\n\nDespite considerable progress, significant gaps persist:\n\n- **Behavioral Vulnerabilities:** Social engineering remains highly effective; overconfidence and emotional manipulation often override rational awareness.\n- **Under-reached Populations:** Seniors, the less educated, and non-native speakers may not receive or absorb current outreach.\n- **Emerging Threats:** New scam tactics (malware, AI, crypto, deepfakes) can spread faster than countermeasures.\n- **Coordination Gaps:** Fragmentation exists among banks, telcos, platform providers, and enforcement.\n- **Public Complacency:** Repeated warnings risk \u201calert fatigue,\u201d and those not yet affected may underestimate personal risk.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nAddressing cyber scams in Singapore requires a multi-pronged, forward-looking strategy, outlined here in full detail:\n\n## 1. **Enhance Public Education through Empathy and Real-Life Simulation**\n\nTraditional campaigns must be made more engaging and relatable. We recommend a shift to empathy-led education, leveraging real scam simulations and first-person victim testimonials to correct overconfidence and encourage vigilance. Authorities such as CSA and SPF should develop interactive exhibits and digital modules that allow citizens to safely experience mock phishing or scam attempts, followed by structured debriefs to build practical defensive skills.\n\nMedia partnerships should be used to broadcast personal stories\u2014short documentaries, interviews, or dramatized re-enactments\u2014so that the emotional and financial devastation caused by scams becomes salient to the public. Furthermore, outreach materials must be continuously refreshed and offered in all national languages and relevant dialects, distributed through grassroots channels (community centres, clan associations, faith groups) to maximize penetration.\n\n## 2. **Strengthen Cybersecurity Curriculum and Training in Schools and Workplaces**\n\nCyber scam awareness must be formalized as a core component of national education at all levels, with content regularly updated to address the latest threats. In primary and secondary schools, cyber hygiene and scam recognition should be taught through scenario-based learning and projects. At the tertiary level, digital financial literacy and practical response strategies must be mandatory in orientation and ongoing curricula.\n\nFor adults, the government should incentivize regular workplace training (phishing simulations, scam awareness modules) across all sectors\u2014not just IT. Financial institutions, by MAS mandate, should provide refresher courses for both staff and customers. National e-learning portals could be used to offer interactive anti-scam courses accessible to all, including marginalized populations.\n\n## 3. **Expand and Deepen Outreach to Seniors and Other Vulnerable Groups**\n\nEfforts to protect seniors must go further, with expanded Digital Ambassador programmes, increased frequency of workshops, and tailored materials for varying literacy and cognitive levels. A \u201cScam Guardian\u201d volunteer scheme could empower tech-savvy seniors to serve as peer educators, leveraging trust within age cohorts.\n\nBanks should provide opt-in enhanced security for seniors, such as transaction delays for large transfers, mandatory verification calls, or alerts to family members (with consent). User interfaces in banking apps and critical platforms should offer a \u201csenior mode\u201d with simplified, explicit warnings. For migrant and low-income populations, outreach must use native languages, leverage employer networks, and incorporate trusted intermediaries such as NGOs and embassies.\n\n## 4. **Bolster Technological and Legal Defenses Proactively**\n\nSingapore must invest in advanced, AI-driven scam detection tools, both at the device (ScamShield) and network level, in partnership with telcos and social media platforms. Authorities should push for near-universal installation of filtering apps and extend protection via backend systems for those without smartphones.\n\nLegislative agility is essential: regular review and update of regulations must anticipate new vectors (e.g., crypto, deepfakes), and enforcement of the Shared Responsibility Framework should be broadened to include platform providers and telcos. Cross-border collaboration on enforcement and intelligence must be deepened, especially with regional partners.\n\nAccountability for enablers\u2014such as money mules, negligent platforms, and facilitators\u2014should be clearly delineated, with consequences for inaction or complicity.\n\n## 5. **Foster a Scam-Resilient Culture and Community Support**\n\nA truly resilient society requires more than top-down regulation; community and family engagement are key. An annual national Anti-Scam Awareness Day should be instituted, rallying schools, employers, and civic groups for synchronized education and engagement events.\n\nNeighbourhood digital watch groups and family-oriented discussion guides will empower Singaporeans to look out for one another, especially the vulnerable. Grant support for innovative, ground-up anti-scam projects (youth games, vernacular comics, creative campaigns) will foster local ownership of the problem.\n\nSupport systems for scam victims\u2014counselling, financial advice, peer support\u2014must be scaled up to reduce stigma, promote reporting, and facilitate learning from incidents.\n\n## 6. **Continuous Review and Strategic Foresight**\n\nA dedicated foresight and analytics unit within the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams should be established to anticipate emerging threats, commission red-teaming exercises, and ensure rapid updating of public advisories and institutional protocols. Collaboration with academia and industry on threat intelligence, behavioral research, and scenario planning will ensure Singapore remains ahead of the evolving threat landscape.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe scale, sophistication, and persistence of cyber scams in Singapore require a comprehensive and adaptive national response.
