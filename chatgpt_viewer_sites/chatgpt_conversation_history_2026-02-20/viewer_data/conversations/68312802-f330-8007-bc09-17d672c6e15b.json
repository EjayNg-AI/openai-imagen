Switch to `main` Locally\n```bash\ngit checkout main\n```\n\n### B. Reset `main` to the Branch\n```bash\ngit reset --hard new-feature-branch\n```\n\nThis replaces all content in `main` with the exact state of `new-feature-branch`.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Caution:** This deletes any changes unique to `main`.\n\n### C. Push the Overwritten `main` to GitHub\n```bash\ngit push --force origin main\n```\n\n> This will overwrite the remote `main` branch. Use `--force` only if you're sure you want to lose previous history on `main`.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Alternative (Safer): Use a Pull Request\n\nIf you're collaborating or want a safer audit trail:\n1. Push your `new-feature-branch`.\n2. On GitHub, create a **Pull Request** to merge it into `main`.\n3. Choose \u201cSquash and Merge\u201d or \u201cRebase and Merge\u201d depending on your preference.\n4. Delete the feature branch after merge.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you're using GitHub Desktop, VS Code, or another GUI\u2014steps are similar but slightly different."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"42687b51-9898-431b-9c81-4ae21d31a9f5","request_id":"944931b15b9a5ffc-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"42687b51-9898-431b-9c81-4ae21d31a9f5","children":[]}}}
