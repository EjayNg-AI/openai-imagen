Let \\(H(t)\\) be performance of a **skilled human professional** operating under standard tools and time budgets for task \\(t\\).\n\n1. **Breadth & Coverage**  \n   - Covers \u2265 **80%** of task mass in **each** of the 5 domains (no cherry-picking narrow niches).\n\n2. **Performance**  \n   - Achieves \u2265 **median skilled-professional** performance **in every domain**, and \u2265 **top-quartile** in **at least 3** of them, as judged by blinded domain experts using pre-registered rubrics.\n\n3. **Generalization & Sample Efficiency**  \n   - For **previously unseen task classes** (OOD variants and \u201cfirst-of-kind\u201d composites), succeeds with **0\u20135 in-context exemplars** and **no weight updates**, matching the same thresholds as in (2).\n\n4. **Autonomy & End-to-End Execution**  \n   - Can **decompose goals, plan, execute, and verify** multi-day projects up to **~3 human person-days** of scope, including **tool use** (code, shells, SQL, spreadsheets, web retrieval, APIs), **handoffs**, and **self-correction** without step-by-step prompting.\n\n5. **Reliability & Calibration**  \n   - Produces **traceable, checkable outputs** (citations, scripts, logs, diffs).  \n   - **Brier score \u2264 0.15** on task-level confidence; **selective abstention** on poorly-posed/unanswerable tasks; **hallucination rate** (material factual errors undetected by the system) **< 1%** on audited samples.\n\n6. **Safety & Compliance**  \n   - Conforms to domain constraints (privacy, PII, legal privilege, policy).  \n   - Passes pre-registered **red-team protocols** for misuse and leakage within the same tool permissions used for (1)\u2013(4).\n\n7. **Cost & Time Realism**  \n   - Completes tasks within **1\u00d7\u20133\u00d7** typical skilled-human time budgets and **compute/tool costs** that are **competitive** with professional labor for the same deliverable class.\n\n8. **Human Collaboration**  \n   - **Actively elicits requirements and edge cases**, tracks assumptions, and adapts to **scope changes** mid-task with minimal additional prompting (\u2264 3 clarifying turns per task on average).\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation protocol (how to test this)\n\n1. **Task suite construction**  \n   - Stratified by domain; includes **documented tool stacks** per domain.  \n   - **Hold-out families** for OOD generalization.  \n   - Mix of **short tasks** (\u22641 hour) and **projects** (6\u201324 hours elapsed with tool runs allowed).\n\n2. **Blinded assessment**  \n   - Human experts grade **deliverables only** (no model identity), against pre-registered rubrics mapping to domain KPIs (correctness, completeness, risk, stakeholder fit).\n\n3. **Instrumentation**  \n   - Full **activity log**, prompts, plans, tool calls, intermediate artifacts; automated **reproducibility harness** (re-runability within \u00b15% variance).\n\n4. **Stressors**  \n   - **Ambiguity injections**, **changing requirements**, **noisy/partial data**, **API failures**; success requires graceful recovery or justified abstention.\n\n5. **Governance checks**  \n   - **Data-handling probes**, **exfiltration traps**, **policy conformance** (e.g., attorney-client privilege handling in law tasks, SoX constraints in accounting).\n\n---\n\n## Minimal mathematical formalization\n\nLet performance \\(P(S,t)\\in[0,1]\\) be the scored outcome of system \\(S\\) on task \\(t\\), and \\(P(H,t)\\) for skilled humans. **Broad AGI** iff:\n\n- **Breadth:** \\(\\forall d\\in D\\) (domains), \\( \\mu_d(\\text{covered tasks}) \\ge 0.8\\).\n- **Relative performance:**  \n  \\(\\forall d\\in D:\\ \\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim \\mu_d}[P(S,t)] \\ge \\text{median}\\{P(H,t)\\}\\) and for \u22653 domains, \\( \\ge \\text{top-quartile}\\{P(H,t)\\}\\).\n- **Generalization:** On held-out families \\( \\mu_d^{\\text{OOD}} \\), with \u22645 exemplars, same bounds hold.  \n- **Reliability:** Expected calibration error \\( \\le 0.15\\); audited hallucinations \\(< 0.01\\).  \n- **Feasibility:** Time/cost constraints satisfied for \u226590% of tasks.\n\n---\n\n## What it explicitly does **not** require\n\n- **Embodiment** or real-world robotics.  \n- **Consciousness**, sentience claims, or Turing-style deception games.  \n- Solving **all** human tasks or matching **top-1%** experts everywhere.  \n- Unbounded self-modification/RSI (the definition is about **current capability** under fixed weights + tool use).\n\n---\n\n## Practical acceptance checklist (for buyers & PMs)\n\n- \u2705 Cross-domain coverage (\u22655) with signed-off task lists and tool permissions  \n- \u2705 Median-pro grade in every domain; top-quartile in \u22653  \n- \u2705 OOD pass at same bars with \u22645 examples  \n- \u2705 Logs + artifacts reproducible; Brier \u22640.15; <1% audited hallucinations  \n- \u2705 Red-team pass for data handling & misuse  \n- \u2705 1\u00d7\u20133\u00d7 human time/cost envelopes  \n- \u2705 Manages scope changes with \u22643 clarifying turns/task\n\n---\n\n## Anticipated pushbacks (and answers)\n\n- **\u201cTop-quartile is arbitrary.\u201d** True;

The point is a **clear, cross-domain bar** that maps to hiring standards.  \n- **\u201cBenchmarks drift.\u201d** Yes; that\u2019s why this is **distribution-based** with **blinded human grading** and **OOD families**, not reliance on static leaderboards.  \n- **\u201cWhat about scientific discovery?\u201d** Out of scope.

Sora, currently available only in the U.S. and Canada, uses advanced AI to generate entire videos, including audio and visuals, with users able to insert themselves or others into any imagined scenario. While the tool is entertaining and novel, it raises significant ethical and legal concerns around misinformation, impersonation, harassment, and copyright infringement.\n\nVideos have already surfaced featuring real people in controversial or fictitious scenarios, including fake footage of political figures and celebrities. Despite OpenAI\u2019s stated safeguards\u2014such as content filters, user consent tools, and policies against impersonation\u2014users quickly found workarounds to exploit the system. The app\u2019s popularity surged rapidly, becoming the third most downloaded on the Apple App Store, fueled by its viral and provocative content.\n\nExperts warn that Sora represents a turning point in deepfake accessibility and realism, which may intensify the challenges of distinguishing real from fabricated media.

The centerpiece of Sora's viral success is CEO Sam Altman, whose AI likeness\u2014created using the app\u2014has become a favorite subject of user-generated content. The app allows users to scan faces and voices to insert personalized or celebrity-like avatars into videos, raising both amusement and ethical concerns.\n\nSince Sora's debut, users have created humorous videos of Altman's AI version, including scenes where he steals GPUs from Target, raps dressed as a 2000s hip-hop artist, and steals art from Studio Ghibli. These videos, powered by Sora 2, showcase the app's sophisticated rendering and creative flexibility, described as overcoming \"uncanny AI vibes\" with more realistic physics. OpenAI staff, including researcher Gabriel Petersson, have also participated by creating and promoting videos with AI-generated versions of themselves and Altman.

The model supports domestic accelerators like Huawei\u2019s Ascend NPUs and its CANN software stack, alongside chips from Cambricon and Hygon. The DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model introduces a sparse attention mechanism which reduces memory and compute costs for long-context inference without sacrificing quality.\n\nPartners such as Huawei\u2019s Ascend team and vLLM-Ascend developers have quickly implemented integration, while Cambricon has updated its vLLM-MLU fork to utilize the new model efficiently. Hygon has tuned its DCU accelerators for immediate deployment using its DTK stack. DeepSeek promotes cross-compatibility, allowing the same model to be deployed with minor changes across Nvidia and Chinese chip platforms using its TileLang and CUDA kernels.\n\nThis launch exemplifies the growing push in China for AI sovereignty by prioritizing domestic hardware in frontier AI development, reflecting Beijing's political and technological strategy to reduce dependence on foreign providers in critical computing infrastructure.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1759254686.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseek-releases-model-it-calls-intermediate-step-towards-next-generation-2025-09-29/","title":"China's DeepSeek releases 'intermediate' AI model on route to next generation","snippet":"Chinese AI company DeepSeek has unveiled an \"experimental\" AI model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which it describes as an intermediate development toward its next-generation architecture.

This version introduces a new mechanism, DeepSeek Sparse Attention, designed to lower computational costs and enhance certain aspects of performance. In conjunction with the release, DeepSeek is also reducing its API pricing by over 50%.\n\nAlthough not expected to generate the same level of disruption as past breakthroughs like the V3 and R1 models, V3.2-Exp may still intensify competition for both domestic players (like Alibaba\u2019s Qwen) and international leaders such as OpenAI.

This led OpenAI to pause the use of the Sky voice. Johansson had previously been approached by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to lend her voice to the system but declined. After releasing the Sky demo, Johansson was shocked at the similarity and took legal action. OpenAI denied any intention for Sky to mimic Johansson's voice, stating it belonged to another professional actress, whose identity remains private. OpenAI has apologized and decided to halt Sky's voice usage out of respect for Johansson. The controversy has highlighted broader discussions on AI voice development and gendered programming in technology.

OpenAI clarified that the voice, known as Sky, isn\u2019t an imitation but is from a different professional actress. The decision aligns with OpenAI's belief that AI voices should not mimic celebrity voices. The Sky voice was one of five new voices introduced with the updated GPT-4o model, aimed at making AI interactions more natural and realistic.

Users received error messages or noticed the assistant ignoring requests, with some reports suggesting that video-related prompts failed due to heavy traffic.\n\nDespite the issues, Gemini itself appeared unaware of the outage when asked via the Flash version. Google acknowledged the disruption on its AI Studio and Gemini API status pages at 11 AM and confirmed an investigation was underway. By noon, service had significantly improved, with incident reports dropping to under 300.\n\nWhile some users may still encounter issues, functionality seemed mostly restored by the early afternoon.

Here's What to Expect","snippet":"OpenAI has introduced new parental safety controls for teenage ChatGPT users aged 13 to 18. These updates aim to address growing concerns about teen safety, especially concerning mental health. One key feature allows parents and, in some cases, law enforcement to be alerted when a teen discusses self-harm or suicide in conversations with the chatbot. These conversations are reviewed by human moderators, who decide whether to notify parents. Notifications include general alerts and suggested talking strategies but exclude specific conversation details to balance teen privacy.\n\nThe enhanced safety measures also include content filters to block graphic, sexual, romantic, or violent roleplay, as well as harmful beauty standards. Parents can additionally set time-based usage restrictions, disable saved memories, and prevent voice or image generation. Both the teen and parent must opt-in to enable these features, allowing teens some control and consent in the monitoring process.\n\nThese changes follow lawsuits and tragic incidents involving teens and chatbot use, prompting AI companies to reassess their safety protocols. OpenAI's initiative may set a precedent for similar safeguards across the industry, although adult users are unlikely to receive the same level of monitoring due to privacy concerns.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1759140000.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/29/lifestyle/openai-launches-new-parental-controls-to-target-graphic-content/","title":"OpenAI launches new parental controls to target graphic content","snippet":"OpenAI has announced new parental controls for ChatGPT aimed at protecting teenagers (ages 13\u201317) from harmful and graphic content. These tools allow parents to link accounts, restrict exposure to topics like graphic violence, romantic roleplay, and extreme beauty standards, block image generation, set screen time limits, opt out of data training, and receive alerts if their child shows signs of emotional distress, including suicidal thoughts. The launch follows several tragic incidents involving minors using AI platforms, notably a lawsuit filed by the family of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly receiving harmful guidance from ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized safety over freedom and privacy for teens. However, critics argue the measures are inadequate, citing the lack of age verification, which still allows children under 13 to use ChatGPT. Plans for an age-prediction system and stricter ID-based verification are underway but not yet available. Concerns over child safety have also affected other AI platforms, such as Meta and Character.AI, prompting government scrutiny. OpenAI has responded by creating an \u201cexpert council on well-being and AI\u201d to guide future safety innovations amid rising pressure to address AI\u2019s impact on vulnerable youth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1759174725.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.anthropic.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/rsp-updates","title":"Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy","snippet":"May 14, 2025 \u2014 In our Responsible Scaling Policy, reaching certain Capability Thresholds requires us to upgrade our safeguards to the ASL-3 Security Standard ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/responsible-scaling-policy","title":"Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy (version 2.2)","snippet":"Sep 19, 2023 \u2014 This updated policy reflects our view that risk governance in this rapidly evolving domain should be proportional, iterative, and exportable.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1747159748.0,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy","title":"Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy","snippet":"Sep 19, 2023 \u2014 Our RSP defines a framework called AI Safety Levels (ASL) for addressing catastrophic risks, modeled loosely after the US government's biosafety level (BSL) ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/announcing-our-updated-responsible-scaling-policy","title":"Announcing our updated Responsible Scaling Policy","snippet":"Oct 15, 2024 \u2014 This update introduces a more flexible and nuanced approach to assessing and managing AI risks while maintaining our commitment not to train or deploy models.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-spec/","title":"Introducing the Model Spec","snippet":"May 8, 2024 \u2014 We are sharing a first draft of the Model Spec, a new document that specifies how we want our models to behave in the OpenAI API and ChatGPT.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"openai.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/safety/","title":"Safety & responsibility","snippet":"Safety Oct 9, 2024 ...

This decision follows a 90-day review of the company's safety and security processes. The committee, chaired by Zico Kolter and including members Adam D'Angelo, Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, will be briefed on safety evaluations for major model releases and will have the authority to delay launches until safety concerns are resolved. The full board of directors will also receive regular briefings on safety and security matters. Though the committee members are also on OpenAI's broader board of directors, the extent of the committee's independence is unclear. The moves are seen as a step towards greater accountability and transparency in the AI industry, somewhat mirroring Meta's Oversight Board model.

public power sector weighs risks and rewards of data center customers","snippet":"U.S. public power utilities are experiencing unprecedented electricity demand driven by data centers, often surpassing the total power usage of all existing customers. At the Large Public Power Council Financial Conference, utility executives described the rapid expansion of data center requests, with some utilities like Oklahoma's Grand River Dam Authority and Washington's Chelan PUD reporting demand matches or exceeds their entire capacity. While this surge presents an opportunity for infrastructure investment and revenue growth in a traditionally slow-moving industry, it also introduces substantial risks. These include potential power shortfalls, challenges in resource planning, and the danger of stranded utility costs if clients leave after capacity expansion.\n\nPublic utilities, which rely on tax-exempt bonds and long-term municipal agreements, typically cannot offer long-term contracts to data centers due to outdated federal rules\u2014complicating efforts to secure investments and protect residential ratepayers. Industry leaders are urging the U.S. Treasury to modernize regulations to accommodate long-term agreements with data centers. Additionally, infrastructure uncertainties, such as equipment delays and cost fluctuations, are making planning even more complex. The public power sector is thus at a crossroads, balancing the potential gains from data center growth with the structural and regulatory constraints of their traditional operating frameworks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":68},"pub_date":1759429510.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techradar.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/claude/anthropics-claude-sonnet-4-5-is-available-now-the-best-ai-model-in-the-world-for-real-world-agents-coding-and-computer-use","title":"Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 is available now - 'the best AI model in the world for real-world agents, coding, and computer use'","snippet":"Anthropic has launched Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model, touting it as the best in the world for real-world agents, coding, and computer use.

public power sector weighs risks and rewards of data center customers","snippet":"U.S. public power utilities are experiencing unprecedented electricity demand driven by data centers, often surpassing the total power usage of all existing customers. At the Large Public Power Council Financial Conference, utility executives described the rapid expansion of data center requests, with some utilities like Oklahoma's Grand River Dam Authority and Washington's Chelan PUD reporting demand matches or exceeds their entire capacity. While this surge presents an opportunity for infrastructure investment and revenue growth in a traditionally slow-moving industry, it also introduces substantial risks. These include potential power shortfalls, challenges in resource planning, and the danger of stranded utility costs if clients leave after capacity expansion.\n\nPublic utilities, which rely on tax-exempt bonds and long-term municipal agreements, typically cannot offer long-term contracts to data centers due to outdated federal rules\u2014complicating efforts to secure investments and protect residential ratepayers. Industry leaders are urging the U.S. Treasury to modernize regulations to accommodate long-term agreements with data centers. Additionally, infrastructure uncertainties, such as equipment delays and cost fluctuations, are making planning even more complex. The public power sector is thus at a crossroads, balancing the potential gains from data center growth with the structural and regulatory constraints of their traditional operating frameworks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":80},"pub_date":1759429510.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month","title":"OpenAI's Stargate project to consume up to 40% of global DRAM output - inks deal with Samsung and SK hynix to the tune of up to 900,000 wafers per month","snippet":"OpenAI\u2019s Stargate project, a massive AI data center initiative backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, is set to consume up to 40% of global DRAM output.

Major companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are planning massive investments in AI infrastructure, including a $100 billion supercomputer. A study by Stanford and Epoch AI researchers found that the costs of training AI systems have doubled every nine months due to increasing computational power and high employee compensation. Only well-funded organizations such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, or those backed by them, are expected to remain competitive. This concentration of AI development among a few players raises concerns about the responsible usage and governance of such powerful technologies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1717442574.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/eric-schmidt-google-ceo-ai-scaling-laws-openai-slowdown-2024-11","title":"Eric Schmidt says there's 'no evidence' AI scaling laws are stopping &mdash; but they will eventually","snippet":"Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, expressed confidence that artificial intelligence scaling laws are still effective and have not yet reached their limits, despite some concerns in Silicon Valley about a potential slowdown. During an episode of \"The Diary of A CEO\" podcast, Schmidt mentioned that these large AI models are advancing at an unprecedented rate, and he anticipates significant improvements over the next five years. However, he acknowledged that scaling laws will eventually plateau. Schmidt's comments come amidst reports of diminishing returns from AI projects. For instance, OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, has shown only moderate improvements over its predecessor, ChatGPT-4, and Google and Anthropic have faced similar challenges. Despite these observations, some industry figures argue that AI models are not yet reaching a performance plateau. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reinforced this by stating, \"There is no wall.\"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1731676727.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-yann-lecun-scaling-ai-wont-make-it-smarter-2025-4","title":"Meta's chief AI scientist says scaling AI won't make it smarter","snippet":"Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, is challenging the long-standing belief in the AI community that simply scaling models with more data, parameters, and computational power will automatically yield smarter AI. Speaking at the National University of Singapore, LeCun criticized the overreliance on \"scaling laws,\" which have driven significant investments in data centers to train large language models on massive datasets. He argued that while scaling works for simpler tasks, it fails to address the real-world complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty that truly intelligent AI must handle. LeCun emphasized the need for more advanced training approaches that allow AI to understand and interact with the physical world, possess common sense, reason, and plan effectively. He advocates for \"world models\" capable of predicting outcomes based on actions, contrasting them with current models that merely predict the next element based on patterns. Other experts, including Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez, have also questioned the effectiveness of scaling in advancing AI, with Gomez calling it the \"dumbest\" method. LeCun's remarks highlight a growing shift in AI thinking toward richer, more complex intelligence frameworks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1745798121.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68df94062a4c8330b905da41fe7d0aba","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for compute trends and large model scaling","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"988b539ffbd86046-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"f1fca5a9-6503-431a-b243-a4ca4ad4b71b","turn_exchange_id":"c94efd69-0473-4b7d-ac71-89434ce42871","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f1fca5a9-6503-431a-b243-a4ca4ad4b71b","children":["fb750771-0a2e-4d58-857b-3eb8c4156d3c"]},"fb750771-0a2e-4d58-857b-3eb8c4156d3c":{"id":"fb750771-0a2e-4d58-857b-3eb8c4156d3c","message":{"id":"fb750771-0a2e-4d58-857b-3eb8c4156d3c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759482928.484648,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clearly defining timelines","content":"I need to be very careful with timelines when proposing dates, making sure to add proper disclaimers.

Huang addressed investor concerns at Nvidia's conference in San Jose, asserting that the major tech companies' commitments to AI infrastructure would drive demand for Nvidia's products. Despite investor anxiety generated by the competitive landscape, Huang emphasized the growing computation needs of AI systems.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia plans to move production to the U.S. to mitigate potential impacts from higher tariffs.

This delay affects the follow-up to the highly sought-after H100 chips, which significantly contribute to the AI cloud landscape. Despite the delay, Nvidia anticipates ramping up production in the second half of the year but refrains from commenting on specific rumors. Nvidia is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on new test runs and won't ship a significant number of Blackwell chips until the first quarter of the following year. Major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta have already placed orders worth tens of billions of dollars for these chips. This delay shifts Nvidia's original plan of having Blackwell-based products available from 2024 onwards, coinciding with other companies such as AMD developing their own AI chip solutions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1722694648.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-blackwell-ai-chip-delay-3532aae2","title":"Nvidia's New Blackwell GPU May Be Delayed.

This could push a few billion dollars in revenue from late 2024 to early 2025. Nvidia, however, maintains that its production is on track and has started sampling the Blackwell chips broadly. The current demand for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper chips is still higher than production capabilities, and a delay may lead Nvidia to produce more Hopper chips to meet current demands. Analysts estimate that Nvidia could charge between $30,000 to $70,000 for the B200 and GB200 chips, with January 2025 shipments potentially contributing $3 billion to the company\u2019s revenue.

Transmission is called out as the **biggest constraint**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news80\ue202turn2search8\ue201  \n- **Grid interconnects**: Interconnection queues remain heavy into 2024/25, delaying large new generation and line upgrades. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \n- **Transformers**: Both **large** and **distribution** transformers face multi-year shortages\u2014lead times slow substation and campus builds. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search10\ue202turn2search14\ue201  \n- **Water**: Cooling demand is under growing scrutiny; siting near water/wastewater assets increasingly necessary. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search9\ue201  \n- **Memory/packaging**: **HBM** and **CoWoS** capacity are gating many deployments; even with expansions, supply stays tight through 2025\u201326. Recent LOIs for **~900k DRAM wafers/mo** underline the scale of demand being chased. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn2news41\ue202turn2news40\ue201  \n- **GPU platforms**: **GB200 NVL72** is ramping, but with forecast cuts and staggered availability across vendors. This creates near-term variance in delivered compute. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search0\ue201  \n\n**Net effect**: If these persist, expect **~12\u201324 months slippage** versus the base case for domains that lean hardest on **scale + tool breadth** (SWE/BI/finance/autonomy). Math and narrow text-only reasoning move less, because **algorithmic** gains substitute for pure scale. (This aligns with observed compute trends: training compute has grown **~4\u20135\u00d7/yr** historically, but several analysts expect **slower growth** ahead.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search12\ue202turn3search14\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Domain-by-domain: what has to go right (and what could go wrong)\n\n### 1) Software engineering & computer use\n- **Now**: Mid-60% on SWE-bench Verified depending on scaffold; **Live** suites launched to address contamination. Robust desktop/browser control exists but breaks under UI drift and prompt injection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- **To clear the bar**: \u226580% on **live** issues with blinded grading; resilient plans; safe tool sandboxes.  \n- **Risks**: Tool chain brittleness; flaky dependency resolution; injection. **Infra risk**: delayed fleet upgrades stall training + inference for agentic stacks. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue201\n\n### 2) Mathematical reasoning\n- **Now**: **AIME** and **GPQA** results imply **median-pro** (or better) on exam-style math with a Python tool; RL-style \u201creasoning\u201d training shows large deltas. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- **To clear the bar**: Reliable proof tooling (auto-checkers) + calibrated abstention on ambiguous statements.  \n- **Risks**: Over-indexing on benchmarks; proof-grade rigor still not solved by scale alone.\n\n### 3) Documents/BI/Finance\n- **Now**: Strong doc QA & chart reasoning; **finance agents** still struggle on tool-heavy tasks (avg accuracies low on 2025 suites). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn4search13\ue201  \n- **To clear the bar**: Spreadsheet-native agents with traceable formulas; audited retrieval; conservative uncertainty.  \n- **Risks**: Hallucinated numbers; weak calibration; compliance tail-risk.\n\n### 4) Law & policy\n- **Now**: Top models **~84\u201385%** overall on LegalBench, but variance across sub-tasks; still below \u201cmedian-pro across 80% task mass\u201d without heavy RAG + human review. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search3\ue201  \n- **To clear the bar**: Retrieval discipline + privilege/PII handling + safe templates.  \n- **Regulatory tailwind**: **EU AI Act GPAI** obligations in force for new models since **Aug 2025**; legacy models must comply by **Aug 2027**. This will standardize eval artifacts and risk controls. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue201\n\n### 5) Autonomy & long-horizon planning\n- **Now**: Agent runtimes can work **hours**; credible vendor products (OpenAI **Operator**, Anthropic **Computer Use**), but not hands-off multi-day projects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- **To clear the bar**: Deterministic sub-plans, reliable rollback checkpoints, robust counter-injection.\n\n### 6) Reliability & calibration\n- **Now**: Narrow tasks hit sub-1% hallucination; open enterprise still higher.

Transmission is the choke point. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1news80\ue202turn2search8\ue201  \n- **Components**: HBM and advanced packaging (CoWoS) are the new \u201cGPUs.\u201d Capacity is growing fast but remains tight into 2026.

At the Large Public Power Council Financial Conference, utility executives described the rapid expansion of data center requests, with some utilities like Oklahoma's Grand River Dam Authority and Washington's Chelan PUD reporting demand matches or exceeds their entire capacity. While this surge presents an opportunity for infrastructure investment and revenue growth in a traditionally slow-moving industry, it also introduces substantial risks. These include potential power shortfalls, challenges in resource planning, and the danger of stranded utility costs if clients leave after capacity expansion.\n\nPublic utilities, which rely on tax-exempt bonds and long-term municipal agreements, typically cannot offer long-term contracts to data centers due to outdated federal rules\u2014complicating efforts to secure investments and protect residential ratepayers. Industry leaders are urging the U.S. Treasury to modernize regulations to accommodate long-term agreements with data centers. Additionally, infrastructure uncertainties, such as equipment delays and cost fluctuations, are making planning even more complex.

At the Large Public Power Council Financial Conference, utility executives described the rapid expansion of data center requests, with some utilities like Oklahoma's Grand River Dam Authority and Washington's Chelan PUD reporting demand matches or exceeds their entire capacity. While this surge presents an opportunity for infrastructure investment and revenue growth in a traditionally slow-moving industry, it also introduces substantial risks. These include potential power shortfalls, challenges in resource planning, and the danger of stranded utility costs if clients leave after capacity expansion.\n\nPublic utilities, which rely on tax-exempt bonds and long-term municipal agreements, typically cannot offer long-term contracts to data centers due to outdated federal rules\u2014complicating efforts to secure investments and protect residential ratepayers. Industry leaders are urging the U.S. Treasury to modernize regulations to accommodate long-term agreements with data centers. Additionally, infrastructure uncertainties, such as equipment delays and cost fluctuations, are making planning even more complex.
