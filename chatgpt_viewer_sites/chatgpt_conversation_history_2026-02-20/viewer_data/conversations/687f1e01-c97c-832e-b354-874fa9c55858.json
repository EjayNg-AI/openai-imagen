It supports everything from data preparation and experimentation to model training, deployment, and monitoring.\n\n### 1. **Workspace Management**\n- Centralized control of compute, datasets, models, and experiments\n- Integration with Azure Active Directory for team collaboration\n- Reproducibility via versioned datasets, environments, and pipelines\n\n### 2. **Development Environments**\n- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Hosted notebooks with Python and R support\n- **Visual Designer** (Classic Studio): Drag-and-drop model builder (being deprecated, but still accessible)\n- **VS Code + Git Integration**: Deep integration with Azure Repos and GitHub\n- **CLI, SDK, and REST API**: Full automation support\n\n### 3. **Compute Options**\n- **Compute Instances**: VM-like Jupyter environments (basic dev)\n- **Compute Clusters**: Scalable training clusters (auto-scaling)\n- **Inference Clusters**: For deploying REST APIs (AKS, ACI, Kubernetes)\n- GPU VM types (e.g., NC6, ND40rs_v2) supported for deep learning\n- Autoscaling & spot pricing available for cost savings\n\n### 4. **Model Training and Experimentation**\n- ML pipelines: reusable, parameterized workflows\n- Distributed training (PyTorch, TensorFlow, MPI, Horovod)\n- Hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization\n- Logging and tracking using MLflow-compatible APIs\n\n### 5. **Data and Storage Management**\n- Datasets stored on Azure Blob Storage / Data Lake\n- Supports direct connections to:\n  - Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Snowflake, ADLS\n  - Public datasets and data labeling (via Data Labeling Projects)\n- Dataset versioning, lineage tracking, and snapshotting\n\n### 6. **Model Registry and Deployment**\n- Register models with metadata, tags, and versioning\n- Deploy to:\n  - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: scalable real-time inference\n  - **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: quick test deployments\n  - **IoT Edge**: for on-device inference\n- Auto-scaling and monitoring with Application Insights\n\n### 7. **Responsible AI Toolkit**\n- Fairness, explainability, counterfactual analysis\n- Integrated tools like `interpret`, `fairlearn`, `erroranalysis`\n- Custom dashboards for model auditing\n\n### 8. **MLOps and CI/CD**\n- GitHub Actions & Azure DevOps integrations\n- Trigger pipelines on PRs/commits\n- Automated retraining, validation, rollback\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Pricing Overview\n\nAzure ML pricing is **modular** \u2014 you pay for the underlying resources you consume. The Studio itself has **no fixed cost**, but you are charged for:\n\n### 1. **Compute Charges**\n- Charged per second based on VM family:\n  - **CPU-based VMs**: From ~$0.10/hour (Standard_D2_v2)\n  - **GPU-based VMs**: From ~$0.90/hour (Standard_NC6) to >$6/hour (A100/NVIDIA ND series)\n- **Spot pricing** available at significant discount\n- Cluster auto-scaling helps manage costs\n\n### 2. **Storage Charges**\n- Azure Blob/ADLS storage applies (pay-as-you-go, ~$0.0184/GB/month for hot tier)\n- Bandwidth and read/write operations cost extra\n\n### 3. **Deployment Charges**\n- **ACI**: ~$0.002/vCPU-s\n- **AKS**: Varies with cluster size; auto-scaling helps control this\n\n### 4. **Data Labeling and AutoML**\n- AutoML usage incurs compute costs but no additional service charge\n- Data labeling projects may involve additional costs depending on the volume and labeling schema\n\n### 5. **Responsible AI Features**\n- Tools like interpretability and fairness are free if run on your own compute, but incur cost if running on Azure compute\n\n### Example Cost Breakdown\n| Task                     | VM Type        | Est.

However, it requires:\n- **Comfort with Azure ecosystem**\n- **Budgeting strategy for compute/storage**\n- **More setup effort than Colab or Kaggle**\n\nWould you like a setup guide or a step-by-step tutorial on creating a full ML pipeline in Azure ML Studio?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9630772b9c1e81fc-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"4d28e7e9-eefb-4095-81b1-ded23e75408d","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4d28e7e9-eefb-4095-81b1-ded23e75408d","children":["458555ff-50e1-413b-9c1f-6a23fbce9d0b"]},"458555ff-50e1-413b-9c1f-6a23fbce9d0b":{"id":"458555ff-50e1-413b-9c1f-6a23fbce9d0b","message":{"id":"458555ff-50e1-413b-9c1f-6a23fbce9d0b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753161537.417,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what self-hosted JupyterLab options are there?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"96307af90d7381fc-IAD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4098fab3-1a7b-435e-958e-07582f4c9b97","children":["3641393e-ed13-400f-9b86-f62d337e477d"]},"3641393e-ed13-400f-9b86-f62d337e477d":{"id":"3641393e-ed13-400f-9b86-f62d337e477d","message":{"id":"3641393e-ed13-400f-9b86-f62d337e477d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753161537.756536,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here is a detailed breakdown of **self-hosted JupyterLab options**, covering lightweight setups, scalable multi-user deployments, GPU integration, and advanced enterprise use.
