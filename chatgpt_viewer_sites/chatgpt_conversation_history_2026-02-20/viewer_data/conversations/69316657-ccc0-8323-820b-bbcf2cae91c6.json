By 2025, AI could replace around half of such positions, possibly raising unemployment to 10\u201320%. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude can already perform tasks such as writing, legal memo drafting, and coding, raising concerns about job security. However, the risk of displacement depends more on the tasks employees perform than their job titles. A self-audit of tasks can reveal vulnerability\u2014jobs where over 50% of tasks are AI-compatible face higher risk, while those below 30% might benefit from AI augmentation.\n\nHistorically, technological disruptions have unfolded gradually. Similarly, AI is expected to bring incremental but accelerating changes. Early signs include declining retail jobs, stalled low-wage service growth, rising STEM employment, and a shrinking middle-wage sector.\n\nThe article suggests AI could be a force for good if used for \"task lifting,\" helping mid-skill workers perform more advanced duties with tools like diagnostic bots or AI for repairs. The outcome depends on whether firms use AI to replace or enhance human labor. Policies promoting augmentation could help preserve the middle class.

Now, Andrew Yang says AI may wipe out 40 million jobs over the next decade.","snippet":"Andrew Yang, a long-time advocate warning about automation's impact on the workforce, now asserts that the AI-driven job crisis is no longer theoretical. In a CNN interview, Yang highlights how AI and automation are already reshaping employment, citing MIT's Iceberg Index which found AI can perform tasks equating to about 11.7% of the U.S. labor market\u2014$1.2 trillion in wages. Companies like Amazon, Salesforce, and Walmart are increasingly automating operations, with some linking recent layoffs to AI. Yang estimates that 44% of American jobs are susceptible to automation, aligning with reports from the IMF and McKinsey, and warns that 30 to 40 million jobs could vanish over the next decade if trends continue.\n\nTo counteract this, Yang reiterates his support for universal basic income (UBI)\u2014providing every American adult with $1,000 monthly\u2014as a buffer against economic instability. He suggests that AI firms, responsible for much of the value creation through automation, should fund this initiative via an \u201cAI\u201d or \u201ccompute\u201d tax. Yang emphasizes that while UBI provides economic relief, it must be paired with efforts to maintain social cohesion and purpose for displaced workers.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1764591736.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.hrgrapevine.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.hrgrapevine.com/us/content/article/2024-01-15-imf-ai-will-affect-up-to-40-of-jobs-widen-inequality","title":"IMF: AI will affect up to 40% of jobs and widen inequality","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1743651812.0,"attribution":"www.hrgrapevine.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.goldmansachs.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent","title":"Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%","snippet":"5 Apr 2023 \u2014 Shifts in workflows triggered by these advances could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation, Briggs and Kodnani ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1680652800.0,"attribution":"www.goldmansachs.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-will-ai-affect-the-global-workforce","title":"How Will AI Affect the Global Workforce?","snippet":"13 Aug 2025 \u2014 Goldman Sachs Research estimates that unemployment will increase by half a percentage point during the AI transition period as displaced workers ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1755043200.0,"attribution":"www.goldmansachs.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ecommons.cornell.edu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstreams/f361eac0-29a9-4a42-bc3a-b338e93cbda5/download","title":"The \"Jobless Recovery\" From the 2001 Recession","snippet":"by M Labonte \u00b7 Cited by 1 \u2014 If the potential growth rate of productivity is 2.5% and the labor force grows at 1% a year, then unemployment will rise when economic growth is ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"ecommons.cornell.edu"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation","title":"Innovation - WikipediaAI in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills - OECD Events","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1035196946.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.imf.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity","title":"AI Will Transform the Global Economy.

Channels by which AI could *worsen* the next downturn\n\n### 2.1 Direct displacement and wage pressure\n\nMainstream institutions are now pretty blunt about exposure:\n\n- IMF: around **40% of jobs globally** are exposed to AI; in advanced economies that rises to ~60%. Roughly half of those jobs may see AI as a complement (higher productivity, higher pay), but the other half may face substitution, lower labour demand, and potential job loss. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- Goldman Sachs: generative AI could expose the equivalent of **300 million full-time jobs** worldwide; they estimate unemployment might rise by ~0.5 percentage points during the transition as displaced workers search for new roles. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n\nIf this substitution wave coincides with a cyclical turning point (tight monetary policy, credit stress, geopolitical shock), the labour-market hit amplifies the downturn rather than being absorbed smoothly.\n\n### 2.2 AI-driven bubble risk\n\nThe OECD is already flagging a potential **AI-driven stock market bubble** as a key downside risk for the US and global economy: equity valuations have been pushed up by AI optimism, and a sharp correction could drag on growth. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue201  \n\nMechanism:\n\n- Overinvestment in speculative AI plays and marginal GPU/data-centre projects.\n- Earnings disappoint vs hype \u2192 funding dries up, projects cancelled, hiring freezes, layoffs.\n- Knock-on effects on banks, credit markets, and broader risk appetite.\n\nThis is exactly the \u201coverinvestments are punished\u201d part of your scenario.\n\n### 2.3 Inequality and demand drag\n\nAI has a strong distributional gradient:\n\n- Higher-skill, high-wage workers whose tasks *complement* AI are likely to see income gains. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue201  \n- Lower-skill or routine workers whose tasks are easily automated are more likely to face wage pressure or job loss.\n\nThe IMF and UNDP both warn that AI could **widen inequality within and between countries**, creating a \u201cnew great divergence\u201d unless policy leans hard against it. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news41\ue202turn0news43\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\nSince high-income groups have a lower marginal propensity to consume, you can end up in a world where:\n\n> Productivity and profits are high for winners, but aggregate demand is weaker than it \u201cshould be\u201d, reinforcing stagnation and joblessness for losers.\n\nThat\u2019s a classic mechanism for a downturn that\u2019s *exacerbated* by technology.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why productivity could still rise even as the AI bubble bursts\n\nNow to the second half of your hypothesis. There are several reasons why *measured* productivity could keep rising.\n\n### 3.1 AI genuinely *is* a productivity technology\n\nEarly firm-level and experimental evidence \u2013 including with generative AI \u2013 suggests sizable task-level gains:\n\n- OECD summaries of multiple field experiments show **5\u201325% gains in individual task productivity** for customer support, software development, and consulting when generative AI is used, with the largest gains for less-experienced workers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n\nThese are *real* efficiencies: tasks done faster, with fewer errors. If that capital is already installed by the time the downturn hits, it doesn\u2019t vanish when valuations collapse.\n\n### 3.2 The \u201cinstalled base\u201d effect of bubbles\n\nBubbles tend to overbuild infrastructure that *later* becomes a cheap input to the real economy:\n\n- Railroads in the 19th century,\n- Fibre optics and data networks after the telecom / dot-com bubble,\n- Shale infrastructure in US energy.\n\nAn AI bubble would overbuild:\n\n- Data centres and GPU clusters,\n- Model pipelines, tooling, and MLOps infrastructure,\n- Intangible capital: datasets, code, internal models, fine-tunes, and organisational know-how.\n\nWhen the bubble pops:\n\n- Many firms die or get acquired,\n- Investors eat losses,\n- **But the physical and intangible capital is still there** and can be bought cheaply by stronger survivors.\n\nSo even with heavy financial losses, the *technical frontier* keeps ratcheting forward.\n\n### 3.3 Job shedding + AI = higher *average* output per worker\n\nIn a downturn, management does the standard playbook:\n\n- Cut non-core projects,  \n- Freeze hiring,  \n- Lay off workers whose tasks are easiest to automate or redistribute.\n\nIf AI has already been deployed, it becomes the tool that allows the firm to maintain output with fewer workers. Mechanically:\n\n- Suppose output falls 2%,  \n- Hours worked fall 6% because of layoffs and reduced hours,  \n- Then **labour productivity rises ~4%**.\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the early-2000s jobless recovery: strong productivity growth with weak employment. Bernanke explicitly pointed to higher productivity as \u201cprobably the most important\u201d quantitative factor in that period\u2019s weak job growth. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n\nWith AI, that mechanism could be sharper because more white-collar tasks are \u201csoftware-automatable\u201d once the capex is sunk.\n\n### 3.4 Measurement quirks could *overstate* the productivity jump\n\nAI is heavily intangible:\n\n- Internal models, prompts, data, workflows, staff skills.\n\nNational accounts historically have trouble capitalising these properly. A bubble-era capex boom followed by a capex bust can make the *capital* side look weak even though effective capability keeps improving. That can cause measured total factor productivity (TFP) to look as if it\u2019s accelerating.\n\nSo you can simultaneously have:\n\n- Higher measured TFP and labour productivity, and\n- Grim labour-market outcomes for particular cohorts.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What makes your scenario more or less likely?\n\n### Factors that *increase* the likelihood\n\n1. **Fast AI diffusion with strong substitution effects**\n   - If firms aggressively use AI to replace rather than augment labour \u2013 especially in office support, basic programming, content generation, and customer service \u2013 displacement shocks can be large and bunched in time. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search25\ue202turn0news40\ue202turn0news44\ue201  \n\n2. **An AI-centric financial bubble**\n   - Narrow market leadership (small cluster of AI-theme megacaps + speculative satellites).\n   - Retail and institutional capital crowd into \u201cAI\u201d anything.\n   - A policy or earnings shock unwinds this \u2192 broad risk-off and investment pullback. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue201  \n\n3. **Weak re-skilling and mobility**\n   - Training systems and labour market institutions don\u2019t adapt.  \n   - Housing, licensing, and visa restrictions slow geographic and sectoral reallocation.  \n   - Result: high structural unemployment / under-employment among the displaced.\n\n4. **Inequality and policy paralysis**\n   - AI rents accrue to a thin layer of firms and individuals.\n   - Political response is either delayed, chaotic, or focused on blame rather than adaptation.  \n   - That suppresses aggregate demand even as \u201cheadline productivity\u201d looks good.\n\n### Factors that *reduce* the likelihood\n\n1. **AI mostly complements rather than replaces workers**\n   - In many professional settings, AI looks more like \u201csuper-autocomplete + decision support\u201d than a full worker replacement.  \n   - Mainstream estimates like Goldman\u2019s 0.5 percentage-point bump in unemployment are consistent with a **messy but not catastrophic** labour transition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n\n2. **Demographics: tight labour markets**\n   - Ageing in advanced economies creates chronic labour shortages in health care, eldercare, logistics, and services.\n   - AI then serves more as a *gap-filler* than a pure job-destroyer.\n\n3. **Strong safety nets and active labour market policies**\n   - Generous unemployment insurance, re-training subsidies, public investment in AI-complementary sectors.\n   - This can turn a potentially severe AI shock into something closer to a slow-burn reallocation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. A stylised path where your scenario *does* happen\n\nOne plausible 5\u201310 year storyline (not a prediction, just a coherent path):\n\n1. **Boom phase**\n   - Massive AI capex (data centres, chips), frothy valuations, and aggressive hiring in AI-adjacent firms.\n   - Early adopters show real productivity gains at the task level; macro impact is still modest but rising.\n\n2. **Overreach**\n   - Capital chases too many low-quality \u201cAI for X\u201d ventures.  \n   - Enterprise AI projects with weak use-cases quietly burn cash without delivering returns.\n\n3. **Shock + repricing**\n   - A combination of higher rates, regulatory shocks, or simply disappointing earnings triggers a broad AI-themed selloff.  \n   - Funding dries up for marginal players; many close or downsize.\n\n4. **Recession with AI-amplified layoffs**\n   - Firms seize the downturn as an excuse to rationalise headcount, leaning heavily on AI tools to cover operational gaps.  \n   - White-collar unemployment rises sharply in exposed occupations; lower-skill service jobs are hit via second-order demand effects.\n\n5. **Productivity paradox**\n   - Surviving firms now have:\n     - The AI infrastructure built during the boom,  \n     - A leaner workforce,  \n     - Lessons from earlier failed experiments.  \n   - Output recovers faster than hours worked \u2192 headline labour productivity looks very strong even while some cohorts never fully recover.\n\n6. **Medium-term outcome**\n   - AI genuinely boosts potential output and profit margins.  \n   - But without deliberate redistribution (tax, transfers, public goods, bargaining power), **the gains are highly skewed**, and parts of the labour force see a lost decade.\n\nThis is essentially a \u201cjobless recovery 2.0\u201d with AI as the core general-purpose technology.\n\n---\n\n## 6. So, bottom line on your question\n\n- **Is it possible that AI-related job losses exacerbate the next downturn?**  \n  Yes. The combination of labour market exposure (40\u201360% of jobs in advanced economies), bubbly AI-linked valuations, and inequality-driven demand fragility makes this a realistic risk rather than a sci-fi scenario. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0news42\ue201  \n\n- **Is it possible that productivity keeps rising even as the bubble bursts and overinvestment is punished?**  \n  Also yes \u2013 and we have historical precedent. Once the capital and know-how are in place, firms can and will use AI to maintain or grow output with fewer workers, driving measured productivity up even in a harsh labour market.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about this as an investor or policymaker, the key is to separate:\n\n- **Financial cycles and narratives** (which overshoot and correct), from  \n- **The underlying technological trajectory** (which ratchets forward even through busts).\n\nThe uncomfortable implication is: we could get *both* a nasty AI-amplified downturn and a step-change up in productivity \u2013 with the main uncertainty being *who* captures that productivity and *how* the social and political system reacts.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent reporting on AI, jobs, and bubble risk\ue202turn0news42,turn0news41,turn0news43,turn0news44,turn0news40\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":1032,"end_idx":1092,"safe_urls":["https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstreams/f361eac0-29a9-4a42-bc3a-b338e93cbda5/download","https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstreams/f361eac0-29a9-4a42-bc3a-b338e93cbda5/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/109th-congress-2005-2006/reports/08-05-jobs.pdf","https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/109th-congress-2005-2006/reports/08-05-jobs.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/200311062/","https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/200311062/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2004/winter/~/media/1F710AC8012F4BDAB52E1C0582C076C8.ashx","https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2004/winter/~/media/1F710AC8012F4BDAB52E1C0582C076C8.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2004/winter/~/media/1F710AC8012F4BDAB52E1C0582C076C8.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Jobless Recovery","url":"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2004/winter/~/media/1F710AC8012F4BDAB52E1C0582C076C8.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1264311867.0,"snippet":"by A STEELMAN \u00b7 Cited by 2 \u2014 Fourth, productivity growth continues to be strong at around 4.5 percent per year, compared to a historical average of roughly 2.5 percent.

The report highlights the risk of a \"great divergence\" where disparities in economic performance, skill sets, and governance widen due to unequal access and adaptation to AI technologies.

Countries like China and Japan are well positioned to leverage AI, whereas others, like Afghanistan and the Maldives, face significant barriers.\n\nThe report stresses the importance of prioritizing people over technology, calling for investment in education, digital infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks to address ethical, privacy, and cybersecurity risks. It warns about threats such as deepfakes and data-driven discrimination and calls for greater transparency and social protections to ensure equitable access to AI benefits.

By 2025, AI could replace around half of such positions, possibly raising unemployment to 10\u201320%.

However, the risk of displacement depends more on the tasks employees perform than their job titles. A self-audit of tasks can reveal vulnerability\u2014jobs where over 50% of tasks are AI-compatible face higher risk, while those below 30% might benefit from AI augmentation.\n\nHistorically, technological disruptions have unfolded gradually. Similarly, AI is expected to bring incremental but accelerating changes. Early signs include declining retail jobs, stalled low-wage service growth, rising STEM employment, and a shrinking middle-wage sector.\n\nThe article suggests AI could be a force for good if used for \"task lifting,\" helping mid-skill workers perform more advanced duties with tools like diagnostic bots or AI for repairs. The outcome depends on whether firms use AI to replace or enhance human labor. Policies promoting augmentation could help preserve the middle class.

Companies like Amazon, Salesforce, and Walmart are increasingly automating operations, with some linking recent layoffs to AI. Yang estimates that 44% of American jobs are susceptible to automation, aligning with reports from the IMF and McKinsey, and warns that 30 to 40 million jobs could vanish over the next decade if trends continue.\n\nTo counteract this, Yang reiterates his support for universal basic income (UBI)\u2014providing every American adult with $1,000 monthly\u2014as a buffer against economic instability. He suggests that AI firms, responsible for much of the value creation through automation, should fund this initiative via an \u201cAI\u201d or \u201ccompute\u201d tax.

While the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2% in 2025, the OECD forecasts a slowdown to 1.7% in 2026, with a modest recovery to 1.9% in 2027. The OECD notes that current optimism around artificial intelligence investments has buoyed equity markets, but a correction in these markets could destabilize economic growth. Additionally, the labor market is projected to weaken and inflationary pressures from tariffs are expected to persist.
