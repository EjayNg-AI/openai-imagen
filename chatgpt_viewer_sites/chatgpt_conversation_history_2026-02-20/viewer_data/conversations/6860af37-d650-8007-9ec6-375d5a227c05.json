For lengthy, information-dense documents, a **multi-step workflow** with a language model will yield far better results than a single prompt\u2014especially if you need **full content preservation** and nuanced integration, rather than summarization.\n\nBelow is a **robust workflow** that you (or an automated process) can use with the API (or interactively):\n\n---\n\n## Workflow for Merging Two Research Reports in Markdown Without Loss of Detail\n\n### **Step 1: Document Segmentation**\n\n- **Split both markdown documents into logical sections** (by top-level headings or natural breaks).\n- Number or tag each section (e.g., \u201cReport 1 \u2013 Section 2: Methods\u201d).\n\n### **Step 2: Section Alignment and Mapping**\n\n- **Manually or with a model, map overlapping or related sections** (e.g., both have \u201cIntroduction,\u201d \u201cMethods,\u201d or \u201cResults\u201d).\n- Make a table/list pairing corresponding sections, and listing unique sections.\n\n### **Step 3: Section-wise Merging (Chunked Processing)**\n\nFor each mapped pair or single section:\n- **If overlapping:**  \n  - Prompt the model:  \n    \u201cCombine the following two sections into a single, detailed section. Do not omit any information, examples, or explanations. Integrate content fully, merging redundant sentences and improving clarity as needed. Output the combined markdown section only.\u201d\n- **If unique:**  \n  - Use as-is or lightly edit for consistency.\n\nProcess each mapped/unique section **independently** to avoid context window truncation and to ensure completeness.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembly**\n\n- **Concatenate all merged sections in logical order** to build the unified report.\n- Review for flow; adjust section ordering if needed.\n\n### **Step 5: Title, Headings, and Cohesion Pass**\n\n- Prompt the model:\n  \u201cGiven the following full unified markdown report, rewrite the main title and all section headings to accurately reflect the combined scope, and ensure consistency and smooth transitions between sections. Do not summarize or cut content.\u201d\n- Alternatively, revise headings and transitions manually for the best results.\n\n### **Step 6: Final Quality Pass**\n\n- Optionally, run the full report through the model with a prompt like:  \n  \u201cReview the following unified research report for clarity, coherence, and logical flow. Make only stylistic improvements\u2014do not cut or condense content.\u201d\n- Manually review for any accidental omissions.\n\n---\n\n### **Advantages of This Workflow**\n\n- **Preserves all detail:** By merging at the section level, the chance of omission is minimized.\n- **Scalable:** Works for large documents beyond context window limits.\n- **Customizable:** You can intervene at each step for quality control.\n\n---\n\n**Optional: Scripting Automation**\n\n- Use Python (with OpenAI\u2019s API), Markdown parsers, and simple logic to automate segmentation, pairing, and iterative prompting.\n- Manual review at key points remains highly recommended for academic/research-quality outputs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step              | Purpose                                             | API Prompt Style                                                      |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Segmentation      | Divide docs by section                              | N/A (manual or scripted)                                             |\n| Mapping           | Pair corresponding sections                         | N/A (manual or scripted)                                             |\n| Section Merging   | Integrate pairs, keep all info                      | \u201cMerge both sections in detail, preserve all facts, output in MD.\u201d   |\n| Assembly          | Combine merged sections                             | N/A (manual or scripted)                                             |\n| Headings/Title    | Unify report-wide structure and headings            | \u201cRewrite all headings/titles for unified scope, no info omitted.\u201d    |\n| Final Quality     | Review for style/clarity, **no cutting**            | \u201cEdit for clarity/flow, do not condense or omit.\u201d                    |\n\n---\n\n**This workflow reliably produces a full, information-preserving merged report.**  \nLet me know if you\u2019d like Python code samples, example prompts, or workflow diagrams for any stage."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"f177de30-21d1-4ec3-b9a7-8ef9ed3e6839","request_id":"9572b909cbeb9fbf-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f177de30-21d1-4ec3-b9a7-8ef9ed3e6839","children":["9de36902-9cc5-458a-9333-c5ef0e8bd1d0"]},"9de36902-9cc5-458a-9333-c5ef0e8bd1d0":{"id":"9de36902-9cc5-458a-9333-c5ef0e8bd1d0","message":{"id":"9de36902-9cc5-458a-9333-c5ef0e8bd1d0","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751172147.215,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How can I create an AI agent to *automate* the workflow you have suggested?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9572c1dc3aaf9fbf-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b78e5349-9223-44e0-bb53-f28d2727ac0b","children":["c117c6de-b038-4e84-994e-0fef69d9eab0"]},"c117c6de-b038-4e84-994e-0fef69d9eab0":{"id":"c117c6de-b038-4e84-994e-0fef69d9eab0","message":{"id":"c117c6de-b038-4e84-994e-0fef69d9eab0","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751172158.930968,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9de36902-9cc5-458a-9333-c5ef0e8bd1d0","request_id":"9572c1dc3aaf9fbf-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9de36902-9cc5-458a-9333-c5ef0e8bd1d0","children":["13354e3a-d8be-4107-ad52-68b13d2e9ca7"]},"13354e3a-d8be-4107-ad52-68b13d2e9ca7":{"id":"13354e3a-d8be-4107-ad52-68b13d2e9ca7","message":{"id":"13354e3a-d8be-4107-ad52-68b13d2e9ca7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751172158.931203,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Designing an AI agent for workflow automation","content":"The user is asking how to automate a multi-step workflow, likely related to merging two research reports.

Since the user is a researcher with Python experience, I'll tailor the approach to their skill set.","chunks":[],"finished":true}],"source_analysis_msg_id":"096c5faf-149a-4bd9-a997-42245e91e3a1"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"c117c6de-b038-4e84-994e-0fef69d9eab0","request_id":"9572c1dc3aaf9fbf-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c117c6de-b038-4e84-994e-0fef69d9eab0","children":["b7ad371f-9109-4882-a3f0-51ddbf10bb52"]},"b7ad371f-9109-4882-a3f0-51ddbf10bb52":{"id":"b7ad371f-9109-4882-a3f0-51ddbf10bb52","message":{"id":"b7ad371f-9109-4882-a3f0-51ddbf10bb52","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751172147.226051,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"search_query\": [\n    {\n      \"q\": \"OpenAI Assistant API June 2025 new features document processing agent workflow\",\n      \"recency\": 365,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"CrewAI framework autonomous agents 2025 release\",\n      \"recency\": 365,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"LangChain 2025 document merging agent code example\",\n      \"recency\": 365,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"Autogen library LLM orchestrator 2025\",\n      \"recency\": 365,\n      \"domains\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"OpenAI Assistant API June 2025 new features document processing agent workflow"},{"type":"search","q":"CrewAI framework autonomous agents 2025 release"},{"type":"search","q":"LangChain 2025 document merging agent code example"},{"type":"search","q":"Autogen library LLM orchestrator 2025"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"13354e3a-d8be-4107-ad52-68b13d2e9ca7","request_id":"9572c1dc3aaf9fbf-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"13354e3a-d8be-4107-ad52-68b13d2e9ca7","children":["ef6978dc-0ab0-43c3-b5e8-541cb7230e40"]},"ef6978dc-0ab0-43c3-b5e8-541cb7230e40":{"id":"ef6978dc-0ab0-43c3-b5e8-541cb7230e40","message":{"id":"ef6978dc-0ab0-43c3-b5e8-541cb7230e40","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1751172156.444048,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/","title":"New tools for building agents | OpenAI","snippet":"We're launching a new set of APIs and tools specifically designed to simplify the development of agentic applications.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1741651200.0,"attribution":"openai.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.crewai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.crewai.com/","title":"The Leading Multi-Agent Platform","snippet":"Deploy crew.ai on your own infrastructure with self-hosted options or leverage your preferred cloud service, giving you complete control over your environment.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.crewai.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"python.langchain.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/","title":"Build an Agent - Python LangChain","snippet":"In this tutorial we will build an agent that can interact with a search engine.

Key Components & How to Build Them\n\n| Component | Core task | Implementation notes |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| **Ingestion** | Load two markdown files, split on top-level headings. | Use `markdown-it-py` or LangChain\u2019s `TextSplitter`. |\n| **Section-Map** | Produce an alignment table of \u201cReport 1 \u00a7x \u2194\ufe0e Report 2 \u00a7y\u201d or mark as unique. | Either: (a) cosine similarity on MiniLM embeddings, threshold-match; or (b) deterministic rules on heading text. |\n| **Chunk-Merger** | For every row of the alignment table, run the *merge prompt* (\u201cinclude everything, no omissions\u201d). | Call OpenAI **Responses API** with the large 128k context window, or route through LangChain `LLMChain`. |\n| **Assembler** | Concatenate merged and unique sections in scholarly order. | Pure Python string logic. |\n| **Harmoniser** | Ask an LLM to rewrite the *title* and *all headings* only, preserving body text. | Small prompt + system instruction: \u201cYou may touch headings only.\u201d |\n| **QA Reviewer** | Final pass: \u201cImprove style; do *not* shorten; flag any [(MISSING)] tokens inserted by earlier steps.\u201d | Can be a separate LLM call or human-in-the-loop gate. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Choosing an Agent Framework\n\n| Option | Why use it | Caveats |\n|--------|------------|---------|\n| **OpenAI Responses API + Agents SDK (2025)** | Native first-party tools; integrates \u201cweb search\u201d, \u201cfile dig\u201d, and \u201cOperator\u201d (GUI automation) tools. Good for one-off cloud functions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news40\ue201 | SDK still evolving; lock-in to OpenAI. |\n| **LangChain Agents / LangGraph** | Rich ecosystem, lots of document loaders, easy to define DAG-style flows; tutorial code for building agents is up-to-date. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 | More DIY; must manage retries, caching, eval yourself. |\n| **CrewAI** | Focus on *multi-agent* collaboration (roles, tasks, tools). Self-host or cloud. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 | New; fewer docs; emphasis on role-play may be overkill for linear workflow. |\n| **Microsoft Autogen 0.2** | Strong in multi-agent planning, automatic cost control, cross-provider support. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 | Heavier dependency tree. |\n\n> **Recommendation:** For a single-user research environment, start with **LangChain** for orchestration plus **OpenAI Responses API** for the big context window. Add CrewAI or Autogen only if you later need parallel agents or specialised planning.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Orchestration & Reliability Tips\n\n| Concern | Mitigation |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Context limits** | Chunk \u22645 k tokens; use streaming Responses API (128 k). |\n| **Rate limits / cost** | Enable LangChain callback manager; turn on Autogen cost-aware inference for iteration escalations. |\n| **Determinism** | Fix `temperature=0`; persist intermediate artefacts (JSON alignment table, merged chunks) for re-runs. |\n| **Evaluation** | Compute `diff` vs source; use ROUGE recall \u22650.99; or hash counts of tables/figures. |\n| **Human oversight** | Gate QA step behind a checkbox UI (Streamlit panel or VS Code task). |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Extensions & Future-Proofing\n\n1. **Memory & RAG** \u2013 Store each merged section plus its sources in a vector DB; later updates to either report can trigger incremental re-merge.  \n2. **Multi-doc generalisation** \u2013 Turn the Section-Map into a bipartite matching problem; works for N reports.  \n3. **Interactive agent** \u2013 Wrap the pipeline in a ChatGPT plug-in or Slack bot so you can DM \u201cmerge the two latest lab notes\u201d.  \n4. **Agent-as-Service** \u2013 Package as a FastAPI micro-service with a `/merge` endpoint; crewAI can coordinate with other agents (e.g., citation fixer, PDF exporter).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start Checklist\n\n1. **Pick framework** (LangChain Graph or Responses API agent).  \n2. **Implement** modules as above; test on small docs.  \n3. **Add logging & retries**; cache all LLM calls.  \n4. **Define eval metric** (content-retention diff < 0.5\u200a%).  \n5. **Wrap in CLI or web form** and iterate.\n\nWith these building blocks you should be able to deploy a *fully automated, loss-less report-merging agent* in an afternoon\u2014and extend it to more complex editorial workflows later."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news40\ue201","start_idx":2486,"end_idx":2504,"safe_urls":["https://www.theverge.com/news/627556/openai-ai-agents-responses-api-agents-sdk?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/627556/openai-ai-agents-responses-api-agents-sdk?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI will let other apps deploy its computer-operating AI","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/627556/openai-ai-agents-responses-api-agents-sdk?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1741712400.0,"snippet":"OpenAI is releasing a new Responses API designed to help developers create AI agents that can perform various tasks such as web searches, file digging, and executing computer tasks on behalf of users.
