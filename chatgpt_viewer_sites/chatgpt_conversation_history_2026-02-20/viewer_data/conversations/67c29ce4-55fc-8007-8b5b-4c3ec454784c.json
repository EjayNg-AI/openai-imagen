In other words, \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is *tensor triangulated*.\n- We have a distinguished triangle in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\):\n  \\[\n    X \\;\\longrightarrow\\; Y \\;\\longrightarrow\\; Z \\;\\longrightarrow\\; X[1].\n  \\]\n- We also have an object \\(A \\in \\mathcal{T}\\). One key property in a tensor triangulated category is that \\(\\otimes A\\) is typically an *exact functor* on \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Concretely, this means that tensoring a distinguished triangle with \\(A\\) yields another distinguished triangle:\n  \\[\n    A \\otimes X \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes Y \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes Z \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes X [1].\n  \\]\n\n- A *homological functor* \\(H\\colon \\mathcal{T}\\to \\mathcal{A}\\) (where \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is, say, an abelian category) is a functor that sends distinguished triangles in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) to long exact sequences in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\n\n---\n\n## What happens when we tensor and then apply a homological functor?\n\n1. **Tensor the triangle**: Start with the triangle \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\). Because \\( \\otimes A\\) is an exact functor, we obtain a new distinguished triangle by tensoring with \\(A\\):\n   \\[\n     A \\otimes X \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes Y \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes Z \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes X [1].\n   \\]\n   Exactness here means precisely that this new sequence is again a *distinguished* or *exact* triangle in the triangulated sense.\n\n2. **Apply the homological functor**: Now let \\(H \\colon \\mathcal{T} \\to \\mathcal{A}\\) be a homological functor. By definition, homological (or cohomological) functors send distinguished triangles to long exact sequences (or short exact in a cohomological grading). So applying \\(H\\) to\n   \\[\n     A \\otimes X \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes Y \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes Z \\;\\longrightarrow\\; (A \\otimes X)[1]\n   \\]\n   yields a long exact sequence in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\):\n   \\[\n     \\cdots \\longrightarrow H(A \\otimes X) \\longrightarrow H(A \\otimes Y) \\longrightarrow H(A \\otimes Z) \\longrightarrow H(A \\otimes X[1]) \\longrightarrow \\cdots\n   \\]\n   (and so on in the appropriate shifts).\n\nIn short: *Tensor first, then apply \\(H\\). The new triangle is still exact, so \\(H\\) will produce the usual long exact sequence from it.*\n\n---\n\n## Classic examples\n\nBelow are a few standard places where you actually see this process in action.\n\n### 1. Derived category of \\(R\\)-modules\nLet \\(R\\) be a ring (commutative or not) and let \\(\\mathcal{T} = D(R)\\) be the *derived category of \\(R\\)-modules*. \n\n- **Tensor**: The monoidal structure is the *derived tensor product* \\(\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}}\\).  \n- **Exactness**: In this context, \\(\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} M\\) (for a fixed complex \\(M\\)) is exact on \\(D(R)\\) whenever \\(M\\) has the appropriate properties (e.g. being a perfect complex or having finite projective dimension ensures exactness in many cases). Concretely, if you have a distinguished triangle in \\(D(R)\\), tensoring it with \\(M\\) gives another distinguished triangle.  \n- **Homological functor**: One typical homological functor is *derived Hom* or *ext*, for instance \\(H^*(\\mathrm{RHom}_R(M,-))\\). Another is the homology in each degree of a chain complex. In either case, these functors take triangles to long exact sequences.  \n\nHence, if\n\\[\n  X \\longrightarrow Y \\longrightarrow Z \\longrightarrow X[1]\n\\]\nis a triangle of complexes, tensoring with a complex \\(A\\) (in the derived sense) yields another triangle\n\\[\n  A \\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} X \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} Y \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} Z \\;\\longrightarrow\\; A \\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} X[1],\n\\]\nand applying a homological functor like \\(H_n(\\,-)\\) (the \\(n\\)-th homology groups of the resulting complex) gives a long exact sequence in homology groups.\n\n### 2. Stable homotopy category\nIn the stable homotopy category of spectra (a fundamental object of study in algebraic topology), the monoidal structure is the *smash product* \\(\\wedge\\). \n\n- **Exactness**: Smashing a cofibration sequence (the homotopy-theoretic analogue of a distinguished triangle) with a fixed spectrum \\(E\\) again yields a cofibration sequence, hence a distinguished triangle in the homotopy category of spectra.  \n- **Homological functor**: A (co)homology theory \\(h_*\\) is precisely a homological functor on the stable homotopy category. Applying \\(h_*\\) to the smashed triangle yields a long exact sequence in homology or cohomology groups:\n  \\[\n    \\cdots \\longrightarrow h_*(E \\wedge X) \n      \\longrightarrow h_*(E \\wedge Y) \n      \\longrightarrow h_*(E \\wedge Z) \n      \\longrightarrow h_*(E \\wedge X)[1] \\longrightarrow \\cdots\n  \\]\n  (modulo the indexing shifts).\n\nThis phenomenon underpins many standard long exact sequences encountered in algebraic topology (e.g. the long exact sequence of a cofibration).\n\n### 3. Derived categories of sheaves or motives\nIn more geometric contexts, one has:\n\n- **Derived categories of coherent sheaves** (on a scheme \\(X\\)): the tensor is often the derived pullback or derived tensor of sheaves.  \n- **Motivic derived categories**: the tensor can be given by a \u201cmotivic\u201d product or a twist.  \n\nApplying a motivic cohomology or sheaf cohomology functor\u2014again a homological functor\u2014produces the analogous long exact sequences after tensoring your distinguished triangle with a chosen object.\n\n---\n\n## Key takeaway\n\n1. **Exactness of \\(\\otimes A\\)**: In a tensor triangulated category, the action \\(\\otimes A\\) is required to preserve triangles.  \n2. **Homological functor**: By definition, it sends triangles to long exact sequences.  \n3. **Combining these**: If \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\) is distinguished, then so is \\(A\\otimes X \\to A\\otimes Y \\to A\\otimes Z \\to (A\\otimes X)[1]\\). Hence a homological functor \\(H\\) will produce a long exact sequence from that new triangle.\n\nThis is exactly the process behind many standard exact sequences in both derived categories of modules and in stable homotopy theory, among other settings."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"b93d3394-b358-4c4c-8029-320d2078b8c4","request_id":"91964c3228aefd3c-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b93d3394-b358-4c4c-8029-320d2078b8c4","children":["4ff2269d-85fa-4c72-846a-ada8e25ac405"]},"4ff2269d-85fa-4c72-846a-ada8e25ac405":{"id":"4ff2269d-85fa-4c72-846a-ada8e25ac405","message":{"id":"4ff2269d-85fa-4c72-846a-ada8e25ac405","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740807517.967,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What are some applications of this process?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"91964f3f3848fd3c-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ce997f18-360f-45e5-8633-f081b8dd65b8","children":["12c6d62c-8ad0-475e-b8d6-58848a55f8be"]},"12c6d62c-8ad0-475e-b8d6-58848a55f8be":{"id":"12c6d62c-8ad0-475e-b8d6-58848a55f8be","message":{"id":"12c6d62c-8ad0-475e-b8d6-58848a55f8be","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1740807522.565824,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Understanding applications**\n\nI'm pulling together various applications of tensoring distinguished triangles and homological functors.

Here are some concrete applications and why they matter:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Long Exact Sequences in (Co)Homology Theories\n\n### Stable homotopy theory  \n- **Key idea**: In the stable homotopy category of spectra, smashing (the \\(\\wedge\\) product) with a fixed spectrum \\(E\\) preserves cofibration sequences (triangles). A homology theory \\(h_*\\) is a homological functor on this category.  \n- **Outcome**: From a cofibration (triangle) \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to \\Sigma X\\), you get another cofibration \\(E \\wedge X \\to E \\wedge Y \\to E \\wedge Z \\to \\Sigma (E \\wedge X)\\). Applying \\(h_*\\) or \\(h^*\\) to that sequence yields the usual long exact sequence in \\(E\\)-homology or \\(E\\)-cohomology of these spectra.  \n- **Significance**: This construction is exactly what you see in any classical (co)homology theory on spectra or spaces (via suspension, smash products, and so on). It is the cornerstone of how one computes or relates homological invariants of spectra.\n\n### Derived categories of modules  \n- **Context**: In \\(D(R)\\), the derived category of \\(R\\)-modules, the tensor is the derived tensor product \\(\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}}\\).  \n- **Outcome**: If \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\) is a triangle, then so is \\(A\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} X \\to A\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} Y \\to A\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} Z \\to A\\otimes_R^{\\mathbf{L}} X [1]\\). Applying a homological functor like \\(\\mathrm{RHom}_R(A',-)\\) or \\(\\mathrm{Tor}^R_*(A',-)\\) (in derived form) yields long exact sequences in \\(\\operatorname{Ext}\\) or \\(\\operatorname{Tor}\\) groups.  \n- **Significance**: This is the engine behind many standard exact sequences in homological algebra\u2014like those computing derived functors, local cohomology, or checking which triangles induce *universal coefficient* or *K\u00fcnneth*-type spectral sequences.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Localization and Support Theories\n\nIn tensor-triangulated categories arising from geometry or algebraic geometry, *localization* sequences are often encoded by distinguished triangles. For example:\n\n- In **derived categories of sheaves** on a scheme \\(X\\), one frequently gets triangles representing excision or localization (restricting to an open set or a closed set). Tensoring those triangles with another sheaf (or complex) and then applying a homological functor\u2014like taking derived global sections \\(\\mathrm{R}\\Gamma(X,-)\\)\u2014gives a long exact sequence that relates local cohomology to global cohomology.  \n\n- In **support theory** (e.g.\\ for modular representations of finite groups), one uses the tensor structure with \u201clocalizing\u201d objects (like certain injective or projective modules) to *cut out* supports. Applying homological functors to the resulting triangles provides the exact sequences that identify or measure the size of these supports.\n\nThis is also behind **local-to-global** principles in geometry: if you know something about an object restricted to an open cover (and possibly its overlaps), you glue those facts into a global statement by applying a global cohomological functor (\u010cech cohomology, derived global sections, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Computing (or Comparing) Invariants\n\nAnother broad application is when you use the tensor with a specific object to *probe* certain invariants:\n\n1. **K\u00fcnneth Formula / Universal Coefficient Phenomena**  \n   - In many categories, if you tensor an object \\(X\\) with a \u201ctest\u201d object \\(A\\), then apply a homological functor, the resulting spectral sequence or exact sequence can reveal \u201cK\u00fcnneth formulas\u201d or \u201cuniversal coefficient\u201d theorems. Essentially, the user picks \\(A\\) to be something that extracts \\(\\mathrm{Tor}\\) or \\(\\mathrm{Ext}\\)-type information.  \n\n2. **Change-of-Rings / Base-Change**  \n   - In derived algebraic geometry or in derived categories of modules, \u201cbase-changing\u201d from \\(R\\) to \\(R/I\\) (by tensoring with an \\(R/I\\)-module) can measure how invariants behave when you pass to a quotient. A homological functor like \\(\\mathrm{Tor}_*^R(R/I, -)\\) or the associated local cohomology functor \\(\\mathrm{H}_I^*( - )\\) yields a long exact sequence relating the original object\u2019s homology to that of its quotient.  \n\n3. **Spectral Sequences**  \n   - Oftentimes in triangulated categories, short exact sequences in the underlying abelian categories (if you look at co/homology in degrees) appear as \u201c\\(\\mathrm{E}_2\\) pages\u201d of spectral sequences. The exact triangles in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) become exact sequences once you have picked a homological functor. Tensoring (or smashing) by a particular object can then modify the spectral sequence in a controlled way.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Geometry: Derived Categories of Schemes / Motives\n\nIn more sophisticated geometric contexts:\n\n- **Derived categories of coherent sheaves**:  \n  The tensor with a line bundle (or more generally, a perfect complex) is typically exact. Applying a homological functor (like a derived pushforward \\( \\mathrm{R}f_*\\)) to that triangle will yield exact or spectral-sequence-type information that connects cohomology of twisted sheaves to that of the original sheaf.\n\n- **Motivic categories**:  \n  In the derived category of motives, tensoring with certain \u201cmotive-like\u201d objects (\\(\\mathbb{Q}(1)\\), for instance) is exact. A (co)homology theory on motives (like motivic cohomology, \\(\\ell\\)-adic cohomology, or Betti cohomology) then translates those triangles into long exact sequences in (co)homology. This underlies comparisons between different cohomology theories in the \u201cyoga\u201d of motives.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Constructing and Proving Theorems via Reduction to Exact Sequences\n\nFinally, a very conceptual application is:\n\n- **Using exactness to \u201cbootstrap\u201d arguments**:  \n  If you want to prove that a certain functor (like \\(\\mathrm{RHom}\\) with a fixed object, or \u201csmash with a ring spectrum\u201d) is *exact* or *cohomological*, you reduce it to the statement that tensoring (or smashing) is exact on the level of triangles. Then you show that homology respects those triangles. This is used frequently in proving foundational theorems in derived categories, stable categories, and geometric contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n**Tensoring a distinguished triangle and then applying a homological functor** is not just a formal trick\u2014it's an essential method for extracting long exact sequences of invariants from triangulated objects. You see it in:\n\n1. **Homological algebra** (exact sequences in Ext, Tor).  \n2. **Algebraic topology** (long exact sequences in (co)homology or stable homotopy).  \n3. **Algebraic geometry** (localization and \u010cech-type arguments in derived categories).  \n4. **Representation theory** (support varieties, projective/injective resolutions).  \n\nAnytime you see a \u201clong exact sequence\u201d in homological computations stemming from a short exact sequence or cofiber sequence, you can typically trace it back to the fact that \u201ctensoring (or smashing) with an object is exact\u201d and \u201cthe chosen (co)homology functor is homological,\u201d enabling you to map the triangle to a long exact sequence of abelian groups."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"12c6d62c-8ad0-475e-b8d6-58848a55f8be","request_id":"91964f3f3848fd3c-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"12c6d62c-8ad0-475e-b8d6-58848a55f8be","children":[]}}}
