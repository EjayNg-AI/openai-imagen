Add new CLI subcommand in pdf_to_latex/convert.py:\r\n     export-web <session> [--out index.html] [--title \"...\"] [--math-mode svg|mathml] [--strict]\r\n  2. Add module pdf_to_latex/web_exporter.py with:\r\n     export_session_to_web(session_dir: Path, out_html: Path, *, title: str, math_mode: str=\"svg\", strict: bool=False)\r\n     -> Path\r\n  3. No changes to existing init, segment-review, transcribe-*, or build behavior.\r\n\r\n  ## Implementation Design (Decision Complete)\r\n  1. Source selection:\r\n  - Read assembled document from <session>/<PDFStem>.tex.\r\n  - Fail clearly if missing; suggest running build first.\r\n\r\n  2. Lightweight LaTeX-to-HTML transform (targeted, not full TeX engine):\r\n\r\n  - Strip preamble and parse body between \\begin{document} and \\end{document}.\r\n  - Map structure:\r\n      - \\section{} -> <h2>\r\n      - \\subsection{} -> <h3>\r\n      - \\section*{}/\\subsection*{} -> <h2>/<h3> with data-unnumbered.\r\n      - \\newpage -> <hr class=\"page-break\"> (CSS displays subtle separator, not forced print break).\r\n  - Convert paragraph text and common inline markup:\r\n      - \\textbf{} -> <strong>\r\n      - escaped symbols (\\%, \\#, etc.) -> plain text.\r\n      - <div class=\"workingspace\" data-height=\"...\"></div>.\r\n  - Convert tabular blocks into HTML <table>:\r\n      - parse row \\\\ and cell &,\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Detect math spans:\r\n      - inline $...$,\r\n      - display \\[...\\],\r\n      - environments used in session (aligned inside display math).\r\n  - Replace each math span with token placeholder @@MATH_n@@.\r\n  - For each token, compile standalone TeX snippet and render SVG via local tools:\r\n      - latex/pdflatex -> DVI-compatible pipeline,\r\n      - post-process SVG ids to avoid collisions.\r\n  - Cache by normalized math source hash to avoid recompiling duplicate formulas.\r\n  - --strict mode: fail export on any math render error.\r\n  - default mode: insert visible fallback <code> block for failed snippets and continue.\r\n\r\n  4. Diagram embedding:\r\n\r\n  - Replace with <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,...\">.\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Write one index.html containing:\r\n      - inlined content HTML,\r\n  - Include metadata header:\r\n      - export timestamp (2026-02-11 style),\r\n\r\n\r\n      - parse,\r\n      - SVG render success/fail counts,\r\n      - final file size.\r\n\r\n  ## Test Cases and Scenarios\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Expect: single HTML file generated; opens offline in browser; no external requests required.\r\n  2. Math coverage:\r\n\r\n  - Verify all detected math tokens are replaced; no raw $...$ or \\[...\\] remains unless fallback inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Confirm representative tabular sections render as HTML tables with correct row/column counts.\r\n  4. Diagram embedding:\r\n\r\n  5. Error handling:\r\n  - Corrupt one math snippet and run without --strict; ensure fallback block appears and export completes.\r\n\r\n  6. Regression guard:\r\n\r\n  - Existing conversion commands still execute unchanged.\r\n\r\n  ## Assumptions and Defaults\r\n\r\n  1. Selected source session: pdf_to_latex/output/2) Real Numbers-edited_20260209_225953 (latest by mtime).\r\n  2. Packaging default: single-file HTML only.\r\n  3. Layout default: readable reflow web layout (not page-faithful PDF clone).\r\n  4. Math policy: render all detected math LaTeX as SVG; keep prose/layout/table semantics in HTML.\r\n  5. Network policy approved for this session (domain api.openai.com, methods POST create, GET poll, POST cancel), but\r\n     this export path itself is local/offline and does not require API calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u203a Are you planning to use MathJax?

It can look excellent, but it\u2019s still an approximation of TeX layout with different font strategies.\n\n**Pros**\n- **Selectable/searchable** math (big win for studying/teaching).\n- Better **accessibility** (screen reader support, can generate MathML).\n- Smaller HTML if you keep TeX source and render at runtime (though MathJax itself is heavy unless you bundle it).\n\n**Cons**\n- Visual output can differ from TeX PDF: font feel, spacing, and some edge cases (especially dense scripts, uncommon macros, or certain font expectations).\n- Requires JS; if you want truly offline single-file, you must **inline MathJax + fonts/assets** (often very large), or accept additional local files.\n- First render cost can be noticeable on large documents.\n\n## \u201cMore visually appealing\u201d in practice\n- If your LaTeX uses **Computer Modern / Latin Modern**-ish expectations and you want \u201cpaper-like,\u201d **TeX\u2192SVG** tends to look more like a real paper.\n- If you want \u201cweb-native crisp + copyable,\u201d MathJax (often **CommonHTML output**) is pleasant and practical, though slightly less \u201cjournal PDF\u201d in vibe.\n\n## Determinism + portability\n- **Codex plan is deterministic**: same SVG every time, no browser reflow surprises.\n- MathJax is *mostly* consistent but still depends on browser font metrics and rendering; usually fine, but not as \u201cbaked.\u201d\n\n## My recommendation (no hedging)\n### If your priority is **journal-grade look + offline single file**\nStick with Codex\u2019s **pre-rendered SVG** approach.\n\n**But**: upgrade it slightly so it\u2019s not a dead-end for usability:\n- For every SVG math chunk, also store the original TeX as:\n  - `data-tex=\"...\"` attribute, and/or\n  - a hidden `<span class=\"tex-source\">...</span>` for copy/search, and/or\n  - `aria-label=\"...\"` (at least something).\n- Consider embedding a hidden **MathML** representation if you care about accessibility (harder, but doable).\n\n### If your priority is **reading, selecting, searching, accessibility**\nUse **MathJax**, and accept that it\u2019s \u201cweb typesetting,\u201d not a PDF clone.\n\nA strong hybrid (often best in real usage):\n- **Pre-render display math** (big equations) to SVG for perfect look.\n- Render **inline math** with MathJax (CommonHTML) for selectable text.\nThis keeps the page fast-ish, readable, and still \u201cpaper-grade\u201d where it matters.\n\n## Quick critique of the plan you pasted (important)\n- The \u201clightweight LaTeX-to-HTML transform\u201d will work for *your* controlled outputs, but it will be **brittle** the moment LaTeX gets fancy (nested macros, custom environments, complicated tables, \\left...\\right weirdness, etc.).\n- Tabular parsing with \u201csplit on `&` and `\\\\`\u201d will break on common constructs (`\\multicolumn`, `\\cline`, `p{}`, `>{}` column specs).

It will break on real LaTeX, *and* pure SVG math is weak for accessibility/search unless you add an additional semantic layer.\n\n### The core decision\nFor **complicated LaTeX**, you want an exporter that leverages a **real TeX-to-HTML workflow**, not a hand-rolled parser.\n\nThat narrows you to two sane families:\n\n1) **TeX4ht / make4ht** (TeX engine-driven HTML conversion)  \n2) **LaTeXML** (parser-based, excellent semantics, but macro compatibility varies depending on packages)\n\nIn practice, **TeX4ht (make4ht)** is usually the most robust \u201cworks with gnarly LaTeX\u201d option because it runs TeX and hooks into the compilation process.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended architecture (robust + accessible + searchable)\n\n### \u2705 Best overall for your case: **make4ht + MathJax**\n**Pipeline**\n1. Use `make4ht` to convert the LaTeX document to HTML.\n2. Keep math as TeX (or MathML depending on config).\n3. Use **MathJax** in-page to render math and provide accessibility features.\n\n**Why this fits your needs**\n- **Complicated LaTeX**: TeX4ht is built for this kind of conversion.\n- **Accessibility**: MathJax can generate/assist with MathML and screen-reader support.\n- **Search**: searchable text + math source preserved; you can also add math indexing hooks.\n- You avoid writing a fragile custom LaTeX parser.\n\n**Tradeoff**\n- If you want *single-file offline*, bundling MathJax into one HTML file is possible but can make the file big. (You can also ship a local folder; but you asked single-file earlier\u2014this is the tension.)\n\n---\n\n## If you insist on TeX\u2192SVG for \u201cjournal-grade\u201d look\nYou can still do it, but you **must add a semantic layer** per equation.\n\n### \u2705 \u201cJournal look\u201d + accessibility/search: **SVG + hidden MathML/TeX**\nFor every rendered SVG formula, embed something like:\n\n- a hidden `<math>` MathML node, OR\n- a hidden plain text TeX string, plus `aria-label`, plus (optionally) a searchable index.\n\n**Important warning:** SVG alone is not accessibility-friendly; you need at least one of:\n- MathML (best for accessibility tooling)\n- Assistive text / aria labels (second-best)\n- A separate search index mapping tokens \u2192 locations\n\n**How to get MathML**\n- Either let **MathJax generate MathML** (even if you don\u2019t use it to render), or\n- use **LaTeXML** just for math fragments (less reliable for exotic macros), or\n- accept TeX source as the semantic layer (not as good as MathML for screen readers, but searchable).\n\nThis hybrid is totally viable, but it\u2019s more engineering than \u201crender SVG and inline it.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## What I would change in Codex\u2019s plan (direct critique)\n### 1) Drop the \u201clightweight LaTeX-to-HTML transform\u201d\nIf your LaTeX can be complicated, this will become a never-ending whack-a-mole:\n- macros, `\\newcommand`, `\\edef`, nested environments\n- `tabular` features (`\\multicolumn`, `\\multirow`, `p{}`, `array` column specs, math in tables)\n- `tcolorbox`, `tikz`, custom theorem environments, etc.\n\nInstead: **use make4ht** to produce the HTML structure.\n\n### 2) Treat accessibility/search as first-class output\nIf you go SVG math:\n- store original TeX in `data-tex=\"...\"`,\n- add `aria-label=\"...\"`,\n- and ideally include hidden MathML (generated by MathJax or another tool).\n\n### 3) Use MathJax even if you don\u2019t \u201ccare about copy\u201d\nYou care about accessibility/search; MathJax is one of the easiest ways to get that layer.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete recommendation (no extra questions)\n**Do this:**\n- Use **make4ht** as your LaTeX\u2192HTML backbone (robust for complicated documents).\n- Use **MathJax** for accessibility + math rendering (either CommonHTML or SVG output).\n- If you still want maximum \u201cjournal look\u201d, configure MathJax to **SVG output mode**, but keep its accessibility extensions enabled (so you get semantics).\n\nThat gives you:\n- robust conversion for complex LaTeX,\n- great accessibility,\n- searchable math (at least as TeX, often as MathML),\n- and very good visual output.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, paste a snippet of the *most complicated* LaTeX constructs you expect (tables, theorem envs, tikz, custom macros).

TeX4ht\u2019s trick is: it doesn\u2019t \u201cparse LaTeX like a normal compiler would\u201d; it **runs a real TeX engine** (LaTeX / XeLaTeX / LuaLaTeX) but with special hooks/macros that *redirect what would normally become typeset boxes* into **HTML tags + CSS + auxiliary files**.\n\nHere\u2019s the mental model.\n\n## What actually happens under the hood\n\n### 1) It runs a real TeX engine, but in \u201cHTML-emitting mode\u201d\nWhen you run something like:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht mydoc.tex\n```\n\n`make4ht` calls a TeX engine (often `latex`, `xelatex`, or `lualatex`) with TeX4ht-loaded configuration. That configuration:\n- redefines many LaTeX macros/environments (`\\section`, `\\emph`, lists, floats, etc.)\n- inserts \u201cwrite HTML\u201d instructions during compilation\n\nSo as TeX expands macros and builds the document, TeX4ht **writes HTML fragments** to output files (instead of only producing a DVI/PDF-like result).\n\n### 2) The TeX run produces an intermediate \u201cdevice\u201d output + side files\nDepending on engine:\n- classic route: `latex` \u2192 **DVI**\n- XeLaTeX: **XDV**\n- LuaLaTeX route varies (often still workable via TeX4ht configs)\n\nAlong the way, TeX4ht writes:\n- HTML body chunks\n- CSS\n- image references / generated images for things that can\u2019t be represented as HTML/CSS directly\n- metadata and mapping files that help assemble the final output\n\n### 3) Post-processing assembles \u201creal\u201d HTML\nAfter the TeX pass, TeX4ht tools (invoked by `make4ht`) stitch everything together:\n- merges chunks into `mydoc.html` (or multiple HTML files if split)\n- generates/adjusts CSS\n- handles images (often via `dvisvgm` or other converters depending on settings)\n- optionally runs tidy/cleanup filters\n\n`make4ht` is the wrapper that decides **which steps to run**, **in what order**, with **which options**, for **which output format**.\n\n## How complicated LaTeX survives better than regex conversion\nBecause TeX4ht is running a real TeX engine:\n- Your macros expand the way they normally do.\n- Packages that rely on TeX expansion logic still behave \u201cTeX-correctly\u201d (within TeX4ht support).\n- You\u2019re not trying to \u201cunderstand LaTeX\u201d with string processing; you\u2019re piggybacking on TeX itself.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s usually much more robust than \u201cstrip preamble + regex sections + detect `$...$`\u201d.\n\n## What about math?\nYou get to choose policy:\n\n- **Keep TeX math in the HTML and let MathJax render in the browser**  \n  Best for accessibility/search/robustness.\n\n- **Convert math to MathML (Mathematical Markup Language)** (sometimes possible; depends on config/packages)  \n  Great for semantics, but the success rate depends on macros and tooling.\n\n- **Convert math to SVG/PNG during export**  \n  Best for \u201cbaked\u201d look, worse for accessibility unless you add a semantic layer.\n\n## One-liner summary\n**`make4ht` produces HTML by running TeX normally, but with TeX4ht macros that intercept LaTeX structure and write HTML/CSS (plus images when needed), then it post-processes those files into final webpages.**\n\nIf you want, tell me your engine preference (pdfLaTeX vs XeLaTeX vs LuaLaTeX) and whether you want single-page or multi-page HTML, and I\u2019ll suggest a sensible `make4ht` command + config strategy that maximizes compatibility with \u201ccomplicated LaTeX.\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"afdbc9af-aab0-4ae2-a92e-660a9497cf0b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"0c561606-79be-435a-9c64-6bad88e4f4dd","turn_exchange_id":"1ba1d580-15fb-4902-ab36-4cce6c3d4360","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"0c561606-79be-435a-9c64-6bad88e4f4dd","children":["2cb3bbca-1a45-4dfb-b826-379ef10cc20c"]},"2cb3bbca-1a45-4dfb-b826-379ef10cc20c":{"id":"2cb3bbca-1a45-4dfb-b826-379ef10cc20c","message":{"id":"2cb3bbca-1a45-4dfb-b826-379ef10cc20c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770826866.321,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["i want to Convert math to SVG/PNG during export, accessibility criteria can be downgraded"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":["EjayNg-AI/agentic_browser"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"abe8b231-9c42-4566-b120-b9b4d04967dd","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"e3ad170a-1f48-4d0d-94c7-f04a2493aa54","resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4e0f5fa6-a94b-4154-8d32-14a017631cdf","children":["1ac2d416-9542-4681-996c-de942de68f43"]},"1ac2d416-9542-4681-996c-de942de68f43":{"id":"1ac2d416-9542-4681-996c-de942de68f43","message":{"id":"1ac2d416-9542-4681-996c-de942de68f43","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770826866.7324739,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"abe8b231-9c42-4566-b120-b9b4d04967dd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"2cb3bbca-1a45-4dfb-b826-379ef10cc20c","turn_exchange_id":"e3ad170a-1f48-4d0d-94c7-f04a2493aa54","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2cb3bbca-1a45-4dfb-b826-379ef10cc20c","children":["5a15129c-130d-435a-b426-3f92ff6d131b"]},"5a15129c-130d-435a-b426-3f92ff6d131b":{"id":"5a15129c-130d-435a-b426-3f92ff6d131b","message":{"id":"5a15129c-130d-435a-b426-3f92ff6d131b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770826866.230241,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Cool \u2014 if you want **math baked into SVG/PNG at export time**, the cleanest route (especially with complicated LaTeX) is still to let **TeX4ht/make4ht** handle the document structure, and configure it so math is *not* left as TeX for MathJax, but instead converted during export.\n\nA few key points first:\n\n- **Prefer SVG over PNG** unless you have a specific reason. SVG scales crisply; PNG will blur/alias and inflate size.\n- Pure SVG math is **not great for accessibility/search**, but you said it can be downgraded. Still, I\u2019d at least keep lightweight `alt`/`aria-label` with the original TeX as a cheap win.\n\n## Best approach: make4ht + dvisvgm (math \u2192 SVG at export)\n\n### How it works conceptually\n1. make4ht runs LaTeX with TeX4ht hooks \u2192 generates HTML skeleton.\n2. For math, TeX4ht can be configured to output math as images.\n3. Those math images are generated via a converter pipeline; for SVG this is commonly **dvisvgm** (sometimes via DVI/XDV intermediates).\n\n### Practical command to try\nStart with something like:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -f html5+svg mydoc.tex\n```\n\nThis \u201chtml5+svg\u201d format is often the right starting point for SVG-oriented outputs.\n\nIf you need to force the engine:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -f html5+svg -l -d outdir mydoc.tex\n```\n\nEngine forcing varies by setup; if you\u2019re using XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX, you may need a slightly different config (because the intermediate may be XDV rather than DVI). But the above is the usual first shot.\n\n## Where PNG comes in (if you really want PNG)\nPNG is typically produced via something like `dvipng` or by rendering PDF pages to bitmaps. That works, but it\u2019s more \u201cold school,\u201d and output quality is worse at normal web zoom levels.\n\nIf you do PNG:\n- choose a **high DPI** (e.g., 200\u2013300) or it will look bad\n- expect bigger files\n\n## What you should change in Codex\u2019s current plan\nSince your LaTeX can be complicated, I\u2019d flip the plan like this:\n\n### Replace the \u201clightweight LaTeX-to-HTML transform\u201d with TeX4ht\n- Don\u2019t strip the preamble and regex your way through `\\section`, `\\tabular`, etc.\n- Let TeX4ht decide how to emit HTML for those constructs.\n- This alone will save you from 80% of the \u201ccomplicated LaTeX\u201d failure cases.\n\n### Keep the \u201csingle-file HTML\u201d requirement, but be realistic\nmake4ht will naturally output:\n- an `.html`\n- a `.css`\n- images (math + figures)\n\nIf you **must** have a single file:\n- do a final \u201cpack\u201d step that inlines CSS and base64-embeds images.\n- this is deterministic and straightforward.\n\n## Minimal \u201cpack into single HTML\u201d post-step\nAfter make4ht finishes, you can run a packer script that:\n- reads the generated HTML\n- inlines the CSS `<style>...</style>`\n- replaces `<img src=\"...\">` with `data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` (or png base64)\n\nThis keeps your existing \u201csingle-file offline\u201d deliverable, but avoids hand-parsing LaTeX.\n\n## Recommended policy choices (hard stance)\n- **Math as SVG**: yes\n- **Keep TeX source as alt text**: cheap and worth it (even if accessibility is downgraded)\n- **Document structure conversion**: use make4ht/TeX4ht, not custom parsing\n- **Tables**: let TeX4ht handle; don\u2019t write your own tabular parser unless you enjoy suffering\n\n## Caveats you should expect\n- Some packages/environments (notably heavy TikZ or certain custom class files) can still cause TeX4ht pain.\n- Math as SVG can produce lots of tiny `<path>` elements; big documents may get heavy if you inline everything. (If you\u2019re packing into one HTML, consider keeping SVG as external files unless you truly need one file.)\n\n---\n\nIf you want, paste:\n1) the document class line (`\\documentclass{...}`) and  \n2) your key packages list (or the preamble)\n\n\u2026and I\u2019ll suggest the most compatible `make4ht` format + flags, and how to keep math as SVG reliably on your setup (pdfLaTeX vs XeLaTeX vs LuaLaTeX)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"abe8b231-9c42-4566-b120-b9b4d04967dd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"1ac2d416-9542-4681-996c-de942de68f43","turn_exchange_id":"e3ad170a-1f48-4d0d-94c7-f04a2493aa54","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"1ac2d416-9542-4681-996c-de942de68f43","children":["d5c20e8c-433c-4252-a9b1-49e753802ffb"]},"d5c20e8c-433c-4252-a9b1-49e753802ffb":{"id":"d5c20e8c-433c-4252-a9b1-49e753802ffb","message":{"id":"d5c20e8c-433c-4252-a9b1-49e753802ffb","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770826970.596,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\\documentclass[11pt]{article}\r\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}\r\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\r\n\\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}\r\n\\graphicspath{{diagrams/}}\r\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{0pt}\r\n\\setlength{\\parskip}{0.35em}\r\n\\newcommand{\\workingspace}[1][0.40\\textheight]{%\r\n  \\vspace{0.3em}\r\n  \\noindent\\rule{\\linewidth}{0.4pt}\r\n  \\vspace{#1}\r\n}\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\\begin{center}\r\n{\\LARGE \\textbf{Real Numbers: Notes and Practice}}\\\\\r\n{\\large Restructured reference and worksheet}\r\n\\end{center}\r\n\r\n\\tableofcontents\r\n\r\n\\newpage\r\n\\section{Part 1: Negative Numbers and Integer Operations}\r\n\r\n\\subsection{Negative Numbers: Addition and Subtraction}\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n7+12=19\r\n\\]\r\n\\textbf{Same sign} (both $+$), we \\textbf{add} numbers.\r\n\r\n\\[\r\n-7-12=-19\r\n\\]\r\n\\textbf{Same sign} (both $-$), we \\textbf{add} numbers ($7+12=19$).

You\u2019re in the \u201cshould work out of the box\u201d zone.\n\n## What to do (math \u2192 SVG during export)\n\n### 1) Basic run (HTML + SVG math/images)\nTry:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -f html5+svg -d web_out real_numbers.tex\n```\n\nWhat you should see:\n- `web_out/real_numbers.html`\n- `web_out/real_numbers.css` (or similarly named)\n- SVG assets for math (often in a subfolder, depending on config)\n- Your `diagrams/*.png` copied/linked (or kept referenced)\n\n### 2) If you want *all* images (including your diagrams) embedded later\nKeep make4ht\u2019s output as multi-file, then do your existing \u201cpack to single HTML\u201d post-step (inline CSS + base64 images). That\u2019s the clean separation:\n- make4ht handles LaTeX complexity correctly\n- your packer enforces \u201csingle-file offline\u201d\n\n## Why your document is easy for make4ht\n- `\\section`, `\\subsection`, `\\tableofcontents` are first-class.\n- Display math `\\[...\\]` and inline math `$...$` are standard.\n- `\\textbf{...}` maps cleanly.\n- `\\newpage` becomes a break marker in HTML (not a true page break, but you can style it).\n- Your custom macro `\\workingspace` is just rules + vspace; TeX4ht will likely translate it into some HTML-ish block (sometimes as images if it can\u2019t map it cleanly). You can override this nicely (see below).\n\n## Improve the one macro that matters: `\\workingspace`\nRight now it\u2019s \u201cTeX layout\u201d-ish. For web, you probably want it to become a semantic HTML div, like your Codex plan.\n\nYou can do that with a small TeX4ht config file.\n\n### Create `real_numbers.cfg` (or any name) alongside your `.tex`\nPut this in it:\n\n```tex\n\\Preamble{xhtml,svg}\n\\Configure{workingspace}{\\HCode{<div class=\"workingspace\"></div>}}\n\\Css{\n.workingspace{\n  margin: 0.5em 0;\n  border-top: 1px solid #444;\n  height: 40vh; /* default-ish */\n}\n}\n\\BeginDocument\n\\EndPreamble\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -c real_numbers.cfg -d web_out real_numbers.tex\n```\n\nThis makes `\\workingspace[...]` become HTML (instead of TeX spacing), which is what you want for a reflow page.\n\n*(If you want the optional argument `[#1]` to control height, that\u2019s possible too, but it\u2019s more TeX4ht macro plumbing. The simple fixed-height div is usually enough.)*\n\n## SVG vs PNG for math\n- With `html5+svg`, math should come out as **SVG** (crisp).\n- PNG math is usually a downgrade unless you\u2019re targeting ultra-old environments.\n\n## If something goes wrong\nCommon failure modes (and what they mean):\n- **\u201cmissing dvisvgm\u201d / SVG not produced** \u2192 install `dvisvgm` in your TeX distribution.\n- **math becomes images but not SVG** \u2192 your format/config isn\u2019t selecting SVG; use `-f html5+svg` or the `\\Preamble{xhtml,svg}` config.\n- **geometry margins ignored** \u2192 normal; HTML isn\u2019t paged. Use CSS margins instead.\n\n## Single-file offline (the realistic way)\nmake4ht won\u2019t naturally emit a perfect single HTML with everything inlined. The sane workflow is:\n\n1) `make4ht \u2026` \u2192 correct HTML structure + SVG math assets  \n2) packer step \u2192 inline CSS + base64 embed images/SVG \u2192 `index.html`\n\nThis is deterministic and keeps you away from brittle LaTeX parsing.\n\nIf you paste a few more \u201chard\u201d parts (tables, aligned environments, any custom environments), I can tell you what TeX4ht will do and where you might need 1\u20132 targeted configs."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"584f733a-8ce3-43af-be71-76535fa43a53","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"4afdb117-3b0a-4f5f-b17e-d5215bec09b1","turn_exchange_id":"14179cff-18a9-4892-884b-077d54291a65","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"4afdb117-3b0a-4f5f-b17e-d5215bec09b1","children":["858c45a1-7de4-4f30-9069-1bb09dc7f0fa"]},"858c45a1-7de4-4f30-9069-1bb09dc7f0fa":{"id":"858c45a1-7de4-4f30-9069-1bb09dc7f0fa","message":{"id":"858c45a1-7de4-4f30-9069-1bb09dc7f0fa","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770827026.833,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["So what instructions should I give codex?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":["EjayNg-AI/agentic_browser"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"3a71276f-a05c-46e4-bde3-68b23589ddc8","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"d9769879-fec5-4918-9f31-b49a35c2572c","resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bfac22dd-67a8-4d07-a2d6-999bbe683ea1","children":["e0120b0d-26a0-4fc5-a2a0-f16d602bb195"]},"e0120b0d-26a0-4fc5-a2a0-f16d602bb195":{"id":"e0120b0d-26a0-4fc5-a2a0-f16d602bb195","message":{"id":"e0120b0d-26a0-4fc5-a2a0-f16d602bb195","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770827027.2217793,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"3a71276f-a05c-46e4-bde3-68b23589ddc8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"858c45a1-7de4-4f30-9069-1bb09dc7f0fa","turn_exchange_id":"d9769879-fec5-4918-9f31-b49a35c2572c","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"858c45a1-7de4-4f30-9069-1bb09dc7f0fa","children":["057fd961-4c59-4195-b06a-6a15b1ef7100"]},"057fd961-4c59-4195-b06a-6a15b1ef7100":{"id":"057fd961-4c59-4195-b06a-6a15b1ef7100","message":{"id":"057fd961-4c59-4195-b06a-6a15b1ef7100","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770827027.458194,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking up make4ht instructions for TeX4ht pipeline","content":"I need to search the web for instructions on using make4ht with TeX4ht for SVG math configurations.

Start with:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -f html5+svg -d <out_dir> <tex_path>\n```\n\nThis is the canonical \u201cHTML5 with SVG\u201d target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n> Note: TeX4ht can convert \u201ccomplicated math\u201d to images; make4ht\u2019s docs explicitly describe image conversion support. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 2) Provide a TeX4ht config to map `\\workingspace` to HTML (optional but recommended)\nCreate a TeX4ht config file on the fly (write it into the temp folder) and pass via `-c`.\n\nExample config content:\n\n- Use an XHTML/HTML5 preamble with SVG enabled.\n- Override `\\workingspace` to emit `<div class=\"workingspace\">\u2026</div>` (so it becomes web-semantic, not a TeX vertical skip).\n\n(TeX4ht configuration is a standard mechanism; make4ht supports config-driven customization. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201)\n\n### 3) CSS handling\nOption A (simplest): keep the CSS file generated by make4ht next to the HTML.\n\nOption B (single-file): use make4ht\u2019s inline CSS format and then remove the leftover `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" ...>` tag if present:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -f html5+svg+inlinecss -d <out_dir> <tex_path>\n```\n\nInline-CSS is supported via make4ht tooling/filters, but may still leave the `<link>` tag, so do a deterministic post-pass that removes it. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 4) Single-file HTML (if required)\nAfter make4ht produces `*.html` + assets:\n\n- Parse the HTML (use a real HTML parser, not regex).\n- Inline CSS (if not already inlined).\n- For every `<img src=\"...\">` that points to local files:\n  - read bytes\n  - replace with `data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` or `data:image/png;base64,...`\n- For SVG assets referenced as `<object>`/`<embed>` (if any), convert similarly.\n\n(Using data URIs is standard for base64-embedded images in HTML. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search16\ue201)\n\n### 5) CLI\nReplace the old \u201cexport-web\u201d design with:\n\n```\nexport-web <session> [--out index.html] [--single-file] [--strict]\n```\n\n- Default: output folder with HTML + CSS + assets.\n- `--single-file`: run packer step to inline everything.\n\n### 6) Dependencies & checks\nBefore running:\n- Verify `make4ht` is installed and callable.\n- Verify `dvisvgm` exists (SVG math generation will be slow without it / will fail). For large math-heavy docs, dvisvgm is the bottleneck\u2014keep caching where possible. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 7) Caching math\nDon\u2019t implement per-formula caching yourself anymore; TeX4ht/make4ht already manages math/image generation at the document level.\nIf you still want speedups:\n- cache the entire make4ht build directory keyed on `(tex hash, config hash, tool versions)`.\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance criteria (what Codex should test)\n1) Complex LaTeX constructs compile via make4ht (no custom parsing regressions).\n2) Math appears as SVG (inspect generated assets or HTML references).\n3) Offline open works in browser.\n4) `\\workingspace` becomes HTML `<div class=\"workingspace\">` with the right height styling.\n5) `--single-file` produces one HTML with no external file refs.\n\n---\n\n## One sentence you can paste verbatim to Codex\n\u201cDrop the lightweight LaTeX-to-HTML parser; implement `export-web` by running `make4ht -f html5+svg` on the session\u2019s final `.tex`, optionally with a TeX4ht config that maps `\\\\workingspace` to an HTML div, then (only if `--single-file`) post-process the generated HTML to inline CSS and base64-embed all referenced local images/SVG assets.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a small Python `subprocess.run()` skeleton + a robust HTML inliner outline (BeautifulSoup/lxml-based) that Codex can paste straight into `web_exporter.py`."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search8\ue201","start_idx":810,"end_idx":856,"safe_urls":["https://github.com/michal-h21/make4ht","https://github.com/michal-h21/make4ht?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://texdoc.org/serve/make4ht/0","https://texdoc.org/serve/make4ht/0?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.kodymirus.cz/make4ht/make4ht-doc.html","https://www.kodymirus.cz/make4ht/make4ht-doc.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([texdoc.org](https://texdoc.org/serve/make4ht/0?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The make4ht build system","url":"https://texdoc.org/serve/make4ht/0?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1744629206.0,"snippet":"8 Apr 2021 \u2014 TEX4ht system supports several output formats, most notably XHTML, HTML 5 ... svg-height some SVG images produced by dvisvgm seem to have ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"The make4ht build system - Kodymirus","url":"https://www.kodymirus.cz/make4ht/make4ht-doc.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1 Introduction. make4ht is a build system for TeX4ht, TeX to XML converter.

For web, you probably want it to become a semantic HTML div.\r\n\r\nYou can do that with a small TeX4ht config file.\r\n\r\n#### Create `real_numbers.cfg` (or any name) alongside your `.tex`\r\n\r\nPut this in it:\r\n\r\n```tex\r\n\\Preamble{xhtml,svg}\r\n\\Configure{workingspace}{\\HCode{<div class=\"workingspace\"></div>}}\r\n\\Css{\r\n.workingspace{\r\n  margin: 0.5em 0;\r\n  border-top: 1px solid #444;\r\n  height: 40vh; /* default-ish */\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\\BeginDocument\r\n\\EndPreamble\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake4ht -c real_numbers.cfg -d web_out real_numbers.tex\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes `\\workingspace[...]` become HTML (instead of TeX spacing), which is what you want for a reflow page.\r\n\r\n*(If you want the optional argument `[#1]` to control height, that\u2019s possible too, but it\u2019s more TeX4ht macro plumbing. The simple fixed-height div is usually enough.)*\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2) Provide a TeX4ht config to map `\\workingspace` to HTML \r\n\r\nCreate a TeX4ht config file on the fly (write it into the temp folder) and pass via `-c`.\r\n\r\nExample config content:\r\n\r\n* Use an XHTML/HTML5 preamble with SVG enabled.\r\n* Override `\\workingspace` to emit `<div class=\"workingspace\">\u2026</div>` (so it becomes web-semantic, not a TeX vertical skip).\r\n\r\n(TeX4ht configuration is a standard mechanism; make4ht supports config-driven customization.)\r\n\r\n### 3) CSS handling\r\n\r\nUse make4ht\u2019s inline CSS format and then remove the leftover `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" ...>` tag if present:\r\n\r\nInline-CSS is supported via make4ht tooling/filters, but may still leave the `<link>` tag, so do a deterministic post-pass that removes it.\r\n\r\n### 4) Single-file HTML \r\n\r\nAfter make4ht produces `*.html` + assets:\r\n\r\n* Parse the HTML (use a real HTML parser, not regex).\r\n* Inline CSS (if not already inlined).\r\n* For every `<img src=\"...\">` that points to local files:\r\n\r\n  * read bytes\r\n  * replace with `data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` or `data:image/png;base64,...`\r\n* For SVG assets referenced as `<object>`/`<embed>` (if any), convert similarly.\r\n\r\n(Using data URIs is standard for base64-embedded images in HTML. ([Stack Overflow][5]))\r\n\r\n### 5) CLI\r\n\r\nReplace the old \u201cexport-web\u201d design with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport-web <session> [--out index.html] [--single-file] [--strict]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Default: output folder with HTML + CSS + assets.\r\n* `--single-file`: run packer step to inline everything.\r\n\r\n### 6) Dependencies & checks\r\n\r\nBefore running:\r\n\r\n* Verify `make4ht` is installed and callable.\r\n* Verify `dvisvgm` exists (SVG math generation will be slow without it / will fail). For large math-heavy docs, dvisvgm is the bottleneck\u2014keep caching where possible. ([tex4ht.tug.narkive.com][6])\r\n\r\n### 7) Caching math\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t implement per-formula caching yourself anymore; TeX4ht/make4ht already manages math/image generation at the document level.\r\nIf you still want speedups:\r\n\r\n* cache the entire make4ht build directory keyed on `(tex hash, config hash, tool versions)`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Acceptance criteria (what Codex should test)\r\n\r\n1. Complex LaTeX constructs compile via make4ht (no custom parsing regressions).\r\n2. Math appears as SVG (inspect generated assets or HTML references).\r\n3. Offline open works in browser.\r\n4. `\\workingspace` becomes HTML `<div class=\"workingspace\">` with the right height styling.\r\n5. `--single-file` produces one HTML with no external file refs."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":["EjayNg-AI/agentic_browser"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"a3e22837-2a4c-45f4-8b68-dc099f966415","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"0ae49387-a32e-4d53-a4cb-e4844009a5fc","resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dd9bd83e-c572-4dc2-9e71-466914f6d07f","children":["7d14b184-9e5b-4550-b136-e14ea4388ca6"]},"7d14b184-9e5b-4550-b136-e14ea4388ca6":{"id":"7d14b184-9e5b-4550-b136-e14ea4388ca6","message":{"id":"7d14b184-9e5b-4550-b136-e14ea4388ca6","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770827831.8495448,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"a3e22837-2a4c-45f4-8b68-dc099f966415","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"bf2341e5-969b-4fec-ba41-da8da7ae3b36","turn_exchange_id":"0ae49387-a32e-4d53-a4cb-e4844009a5fc","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bf2341e5-969b-4fec-ba41-da8da7ae3b36","children":["d3a673e9-3582-4214-a786-a4fe8cf5235c"]},"d3a673e9-3582-4214-a786-a4fe8cf5235c":{"id":"d3a673e9-3582-4214-a786-a4fe8cf5235c","message":{"id":"d3a673e9-3582-4214-a786-a4fe8cf5235c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770827830.982761,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes \u2014 **that\u2019s basically the right set of instructions**.

Run make4ht targeting HTML5 + SVG:\n\n```bash\nmake4ht -f html5+svg -d <tmp_dir> -c <cfg_path> <tex_path>\n```\n\n- If make4ht returns nonzero and `strict=True`, raise error.\n- If `strict=False`, still produce best-effort output if HTML exists, otherwise error.\n\n### 2) Provide a TeX4ht config file (generated on the fly)\n\nWrite a TeX4ht config into `<tmp_dir>/export.cfg` and pass `-c export.cfg`.\n\nConfig requirements:\n\n- Ensure SVG math/images output.\n- Map `\\workingspace` to semantic HTML (not TeX vertical space).\n\nConfig template (use this):\n\n```tex\n\\Preamble{xhtml,svg}\n\\Configure{workingspace}{\\HCode{<div class=\"workingspace\"></div>}}\n\\Css{\n.workingspace{\n  margin: 0.5em 0;\n  border-top: 1px solid #444;\n  height: 40vh;\n}\n}\n\\begin{document}\n\\EndPreamble\n```\n\n(If `\\Configure{workingspace}` doesn\u2019t catch it in practice, fallback: redefine the macro for this export by injecting `\\renewcommand{\\workingspace}[1][]{...}` in a temporary wrapper .tex, but only if needed.)\n\n### 3) Make output deterministic & offline\n\nAfter make4ht finishes, identify the main HTML file in `<tmp_dir>`:\n- Prefer `<pdf_stem>.html` if present, else pick the newest `.html`.\n\nThen post-process:\n\n- Inline any linked CSS (`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\">`) by replacing with `<style>...</style>`.\n- Base64-inline all local assets referenced by:\n  - `<img src=\"...\">`\n  - `<object data=\"...\">`\n  - `<embed src=\"...\">`\n  - CSS `url(...)` references inside stylesheets\n\nReplace with proper data URIs:\n- `image/svg+xml`\n- `image/png`\n- `image/jpeg`\n- `image/gif`\n\nUse a real HTML parser (BeautifulSoup/lxml), not regex.\n\nWrite final output to `out_html`.\n\n### 4) CLI\n\nAdd subcommand:\n\n```\nexport-web <session> [--out index.html] [--strict] [--no-single-file]\n```\n\nDefaults:\n- single-file ON by default\n- strict OFF by default\n\n### 5) Dependency checks\n\nBefore running make4ht, verify binaries exist:\n- `make4ht`\n- `dvisvgm`\n\nIf missing: print a clear install hint and fail.\n\n### 6) Acceptance tests\n\n1. Works on your \u201cReal Numbers\u201d session with your preamble.\n2. Output HTML opens offline (no external fetches).\n3. Math is SVG (confirm by presence of `data:image/svg+xml` or `.svg` assets that got inlined).\n4. `\\workingspace` becomes `<div class=\"workingspace\"></div>`.\n5. Handles `amsmath` display math and aligned environments.\n6. Complicated LaTeX doesn\u2019t rely on any custom parser.\n\n---\n\n## Two small fixes to your draft\n\n1) Your cfg snippet used `\\BeginDocument`; in TeX4ht configs the common safe pattern is **`\\begin{document}`** (as above). This avoids Codex fighting the wrong control sequence.\n\n2) Don\u2019t tell Codex to rely on \u201cinlinecss format\u201d (it\u2019s format/filter dependent and can be finicky). It\u2019s more deterministic to **always inline CSS in the post-pass**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want one extra \u201cinsurance\u201d instruction: tell Codex to **wrap the source TeX** for export (copy to temp) so it can safely inject any TeX4ht-specific tweaks without touching your canonical `.tex`."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3968,"end_idx":3968,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"a3e22837-2a4c-45f4-8b68-dc099f966415","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"7d14b184-9e5b-4550-b136-e14ea4388ca6","turn_exchange_id":"0ae49387-a32e-4d53-a4cb-e4844009a5fc","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"7d14b184-9e5b-4550-b136-e14ea4388ca6","children":[]}}}
