a breakdown of the recent major deals between **OpenAI\u2014AMD** and **OpenAI\u2014NVIDIA**, along with some observations and strategic implications.\n\n---\n\n## OpenAI \u2194 AMD Deal\n\n### Key Terms & Structure\n\n- OpenAI and AMD announced a **multi-year, multi-generation agreement** to deploy **6 gigawatts** of AMD GPUs for OpenAI\u2019s next-generation AI infrastructure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue201  \n- The deployment is staged: the **first 1 GW** of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs is to come online in the **second half of 2026**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news34\ue201  \n- AMD issues OpenAI a **warrant** to purchase up to **160 million shares** of AMD common stock (roughly ~10% of the company) at **$0.01 per share**, contingent on fulfilling performance and deployment milestones. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0search28\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n- The warrant vests in tranches aligned with milestone achievements (e.g. first GPU deployment, scale-ups). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue201  \n- The AI chip supply is forward-looking (i.e. future AMD GPU generations) \u2014 this is not just a one-time purchase but structural alignment across multiple future platforms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news34\ue201  \n\n### Strategic Rationale & Implications\n\n- **Diversification of compute supply**: OpenAI intends not to be solely reliant on NVIDIA, giving it supply flexibility and negotiating leverage. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news35\ue201  \n- **AMD\u2019s AI ambition**: For AMD, this is a landmark validation and opens a pathway to becoming a major player in large-scale AI infrastructure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news37\ue201  \n- **Huge revenue upside**: AMD expects to generate \u201ctens of billions\u201d annually from this and related AI deals; over a 4-year horizon, it anticipates more than **$100 billion** in new AI-related revenue. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news35\ue202turn0news37\ue201  \n- **Upward pressure on AMD\u2019s valuation**: The stock jumped sharply on the announcement, reflecting investor enthusiasm for AMD\u2019s AI roadmap. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news35\ue202turn0news37\ue201  \n- **Milestone risk & execution challenge**: The vesting of the warrants depends on ambitious deployment goals. Delays or technical hurdles could impair OpenAI\u2019s ability to realize its full option.  \n- **Complement, not exclusion**: This AMD deal does not cancel or replace OpenAI\u2019s ongoing compute plans with NVIDIA or other partners\u2014it adds another \u201cleg\u201d to its compute stack. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue202turn0news34\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## OpenAI \u2194 NVIDIA Deal\n\n### Key Terms & Structure\n\n- In **September 2025**, OpenAI and NVIDIA announced a **strategic infrastructure partnership** to deploy at least **10 gigawatts** of NVIDIA systems (i.e. GPUs and associated hardware) toward OpenAI\u2019s next-gen AI infrastructure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search25\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n- NVIDIA intends to **invest up to $100 billion** in OpenAI, gradually, as each gigawatt of infrastructure is deployed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- The **first gigawatt deployment** using NVIDIA\u2019s Vera Rubin architecture is targeted for **second half of 2026**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- OpenAI and NVIDIA will position NVIDIA as a \u201cpreferred strategic compute and networking partner.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search25\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- The partnership is formalized via a **letter of intent**, meaning many terms are pending final agreement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\n### Strategic Rationale & Implications\n\n- **Scale and certainty**: NVIDIA is doubling down on its leadership in AI compute by locking in a large, long-term customer with predictable GPU demand.  \n- **Financial and capital alignment**: Instead of a unilateral hardware sales relationship, NVIDIA is fronting capital and aligning its investment return with OpenAI\u2019s growth.  \n- **\u201cCircularity\u201d dynamics**: Some commentary suggests this deal could be circular \u2014 e.g. NVIDIA invests in OpenAI; OpenAI then uses some of that capital to purchase NVIDIA systems. But the scale and timing will determine real net benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search46\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- **Locking in technology co-optimization**: Joint roadmap alignment means that both hardware and software (OpenAI\u2019s models) can be better optimized together.  \n- **Dependence, but also risk-sharing**: Because NVIDIA is deepening its stake, delays or technical mismatch may carry more strategic and financial consequences on both sides.  \n- **Signaling to ecosystem**: The size and ambition of this deal elevate expectations for the scale of AI infrastructure, and it intensifies pressure on rivals to respond.  \n\n---\n\n## Comparison & Strategic Perspective\n\n| Feature | AMD Deal | NVIDIA Deal |\n|---|---|---|\n| Scale (committed GW) | 6 GW | \u226510 GW |\n| Timing of first deployment | H2 2026 | H2 2026 |\n| Financial commitment / investment | Warrant up to 160M shares (\u224810%) | Up to $100 billion capital investment |\n| Nature of alignment | Supply + equity alignment | Infrastructure + capital investment |\n| Role of vendor | \u201cCore strategic compute partner\u201d | \u201cPreferred strategic compute & networking partner\u201d |\n| Risk exposure | Milestone execution risk | Execution + capital risk + co-dependency |\n\nIn effect, OpenAI is hedging its bets: it is deepening with NVIDIA (which has long been the dominant GPU supplier for large AI models) while also forming a serious alternative in AMD, thereby reducing supplier concentration risk and gaining leverage.\n\nFrom AMD\u2019s standpoint, this is a watershed moment \u2014 it signals the potential for AMD to break into hyperscale AI compute, which historically has been strongly dominated by NVIDIA. For NVIDIA, the deal reinforces its centrality to the AI stack and locks in a large buyer for upcoming generation hardware, while tying capital upside directly to OpenAI\u2019s success.\n\nOne caveat: many of these agreements are still in early stages (e.g. letter of intent in the NVIDIA case), and execution at the scale of gigawatts will be extremely challenging (power, cooling, networking, software co-optimization, supply chain logistics, deployment pace, reliability). So the true test will be in how well and quickly these plans materialize.\n\nIf you like, I can dig into past compute-partner deals of OpenAI (e.g. with Microsoft, Broadcom, etc.) to see how this fits into a trend. Do you want me to do that?  \n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent media on these deals\ue202turn0news33,turn0news34,turn0news36\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news36\ue201","start_idx":361,"end_idx":431,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/a4714748ede46621863f4860f608ac98?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-with-openai-gives-it-option-take-10-stake-2025-10-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theverge.com/news/792650/amd-openai-five-year-ai-chip-agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AMD and OpenAI announce strategic partnership to deploy ...","url":"https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"21 hours ago \u2014 AMD and OpenAI have announced a multi-year partnership to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs, beginning with 1 gigawatt in 2026, ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AMD and OpenAI Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 6 ...","url":"https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"21 hours ago \u2014 Under this definitive agreement, OpenAI will work with AMD as a core strategic compute partner to drive large-scale deployments of AMD ...","attribution":"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc."},{"title":"OpenAI and chipmaker AMD sign chip supply partnership for AI infrastructure","url":"https://apnews.com/article/a4714748ede46621863f4860f608ac98?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI and AMD announced a strategic partnership in which AMD will supply high-performance graphics chips to OpenAI to support the development of its next-generation AI infrastructure.

OpenAI continues to diversify its chip strategy, maintaining relationships with Nvidia and developing its own silicon with Broadcom, while also remaining partnered with Microsoft.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AMD teams up with OpenAI to challenge Nvidia's AI chip dominance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/792650/amd-openai-five-year-ai-chip-agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"AMD has entered a five-year partnership with OpenAI to supply six gigawatts of processing power for AI data centers, challenging Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. The collaboration will begin with a one-gigawatt deployment of AMD\u2019s Instinct MI450 GPUs in the second half of 2026. AMD anticipates revenue from the deal to reach tens of billions of dollars, though specific financial details were not revealed. Following the announcement, AMD's stock surged 24% in pre-market trading.\n\nThis move comes after OpenAI's recent strategic partnership announcement with Nvidia, which includes plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of AI data centers using Nvidia GPUs and potentially investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. While Nvidia remains a \u201cpreferred strategic compute and networking partner,\u201d AMD is now considered a \"core strategic compute partner.\" As part of the agreement, OpenAI may acquire up to 160 million AMD shares at a cent per share contingent on milestone achievements.\n\nThis development reflects OpenAI\u2019s shift from an exclusive cloud partnership with Microsoft to engaging multiple compute providers, positioning itself for expanded infrastructure and a possible public offering in the future.","attribution":"The Verge"},{"title":"OpenAI and chipmaker AMD sign chip supply partnership for AI infrastructure","url":"https://apnews.com/article/a4714748ede46621863f4860f608ac98?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI and AMD announced a strategic partnership in which AMD will supply high-performance graphics chips to OpenAI to support the development of its next-generation AI infrastructure. As part of the deal, OpenAI will purchase AMD's upcoming Instinct MI450 chips, expected in 2026, and receive up to 6 gigawatts of computing power, starting with 1 gigawatt deployed in 2026. OpenAI is also granted a warrant to buy up to 160 million AMD shares\u2014about 10% of the company\u2014based on performance milestones.\n\nThis move reflects OpenAI\u2019s intention to diversify its hardware suppliers beyond Nvidia, whose chips have dominated the AI market. The deal significantly increases AMD\u2019s position in the high-demand AI chip space, prompting a 24% surge in AMD's stock price, while Nvidia\u2019s slipped by 1%. This announcement follows OpenAI\u2019s recent $100 billion partnership with Nvidia to build a massive computing infrastructure. Analysts suggest the AMD deal demonstrates the immense demand for AI computing power, even amid current infrastructure limitations.","attribution":"AP News"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn0search25\ue202turn0search18\ue201","start_idx":2961,"end_idx":3078,"safe_urls":["https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/openai-nvidia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://businesschief.com/news/behind-openai-and-nvidias-landmark-10gw-ai-data-centre-deal?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/OpenAI-and-NVIDIA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-to-Deploy-10-Gigawatts-of-NVIDIA-Systems/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/nvidia-to-invest-100-billion-in-openai-in-ai-computing-buildout?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/nvidia-and-openai-sign-100bn-deal?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/22/nvidia-openai-investment-100-billion?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/openai-nvidia-strategic-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([NVIDIA Investor Relations](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/OpenAI-and-NVIDIA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-to-Deploy-10-Gigawatts-of-NVIDIA-Systems/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI and NVIDIA Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 10 ...","url":"https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/OpenAI-and-NVIDIA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-to-Deploy-10-Gigawatts-of-NVIDIA-Systems/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1758574742.0,"snippet":"OpenAI and NVIDIA Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 10 Gigawatts of NVIDIA Systems.

Their partnership, lasting until 2030, still includes a two-way revenue-sharing agreement. This update comes amid reported tensions, as OpenAI requires vast computing power for its AI models, prompting it to establish a compute partnership with Oracle. A significant development is the joint Stargate data center venture with Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI. Additionally, there's an unusual clause that allows OpenAI to restrict Microsoft\u2019s access to certain models if AGI, deemed to generate over $100 billion in profit, is developed\u2014although this may be rescinded for more Microsoft funding.

Under the deal, AMD will supply OpenAI with hundreds of thousands of AI chips beginning in the second half of 2026, covering a deployment scale of six gigawatts\u2014enough to power 5 million U.S. homes. The agreement includes a provision granting OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million AMD shares, potentially giving it a 10% stake if deployment milestones are met.\n\nOpenAI, aiming to expand its AI infrastructure, will build a one-gigawatt facility using AMD's upcoming Instinct MI450 chips. This move diversifies OpenAI\u2019s supplier base, reducing its reliance on Nvidia, which recently inked a separate $100 billion deal with the AI firm. The AMD deal is one of the largest GPU arrangements to date and aligns with wider AI sector trends involving multiple industry players\u2014such as AMD, Broadcom, Oracle, and Nvidia\u2014collaborating on data center and infrastructure development.\n\nOpenAI is further expanding its U.S. footprint through the massive Stargate project and recent restructuring efforts to transition into a profit-oriented entity, despite legal objections from Elon Musk.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1759767833.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/open-ai-signs-multibillion-dollar-deal-with-amd-for-processors-9zgxv9hhj","title":"Open AI signs multibillion-dollar deal with AMD for processors","snippet":"OpenAI has signed a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD, marking a major step in its efforts to expand AI infrastructure and decrease reliance on Nvidia. Over the next five years, OpenAI will purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD's advanced AI processors, comparable to the peak electricity use of London. In addition, OpenAI has the option to acquire a 10% stake in AMD\u2014valued at $345 billion\u2014in exchange for purchasing up to 160 million AMD shares at one cent each. This agreement is expected to generate significant revenue growth for AMD; its stock surged over 27% following the announcement.\n\nThe partnership provides OpenAI with crucial computing resources to support advanced AI development. This move comes shortly after OpenAI\u2019s strategic, though not finalized, agreement with Nvidia, indicating a diversified hardware strategy. Critics, however, warn of potential market \"circularity\" and parallels to the dotcom bubble. Despite Nvidia's continuing dominance, the AMD deal signifies increasing competition in the AI hardware space. OpenAI also recently partnered with Samsung, SK Hynix, and is exploring developing its own chips.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1759775162.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/9bfe8410-a984-406c-a8ef-b0814a6c1647","title":"Sam Altman has a new project: building AI Inc","snippet":"Sam Altman's OpenAI is expanding rapidly, building data centers and forging deep, mutually dependent partnerships with key tech companies, particularly in the chipmaking sector. Recently, OpenAI struck a significant deal with AMD, mirroring a previous agreement with Nvidia. These are long-term commitments where OpenAI secures future AI chip supplies, while the suppliers, in turn, gain large revenue assurances and equity opportunities with OpenAI. AMD\u2019s deal is especially generous, potentially granting OpenAI a 10% stake worth $96 billion for just $1.6 million, contingent on performance and stock price milestones.\n\nThis strategic web of investments extends beyond AMD and Nvidia. Nvidia also has ties to CoreWeave, a data center firm partly owned by OpenAI, while Microsoft and Google are both partners and stakeholders in OpenAI. These interconnected relationships resemble historical corporate models like Japan\u2019s keiretsu and past cross-shareholding systems seen in Germany and the U.S.\n\nWhile possibly risky if OpenAI\u2019s growth stalls, the structure aligns the interests of major tech players with OpenAI\u2019s success. Altman's approach is seen as shrewd empire-building, turning OpenAI into a central pillar of the AI industry\u2019s ecosystem.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1759767539.431,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.barrons.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/coreweave-stock-price-meta-deal-ai-cloud-computing-cae34937","title":"CoreWeave Stock Climbs on Meta Deal.

Microsoft retains first refusal rights and continues to have exclusive access to OpenAI's technology for its products like Copilot, with OpenAI\u2019s API remaining exclusive to Azure. Their partnership, lasting until 2030, still includes a two-way revenue-sharing agreement. This update comes amid reported tensions, as OpenAI requires vast computing power for its AI models, prompting it to establish a compute partnership with Oracle. A significant development is the joint Stargate data center venture with Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI. Additionally, there's an unusual clause that allows OpenAI to restrict Microsoft\u2019s access to certain models if AGI, deemed to generate over $100 billion in profit, is developed\u2014although this may be rescinded for more Microsoft funding. These changes follow organizational and operational challenges, including discontent within OpenAI and Microsoft's recruitment of key AI personnel.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1737502187.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI","title":"OpenAI","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1759780162.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreWeave","title":"CoreWeave","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":53},"pub_date":1757230219.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom","title":"Broadcom","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":55},"pub_date":1759073078.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC","title":"Stargate LLC","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":56},"pub_date":1759001742.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-joins-chip-race-partners-with-us-semiconductor-giant-broadcom/articleshow/123720346.cms","title":"ChatGPT-maker OpenAI joins chip race, partners with US semiconductor giant Broadcom","snippet":"OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is set to enter the semiconductor industry by designing its first AI chip in collaboration with U.S. semiconductor company Broadcom.

These show how OpenAI\u2019s strategy has evolved from relying on cloud vendors & GPU suppliers to diversifying across hardware, custom silicon, and hybrid models.\n\n---\n\n## Key Past Compute & Infrastructure Partnerships\n\n### Microsoft / Azure\n\n- In **2019**, Microsoft made a **$1 billion investment** in OpenAI, coupling it with access to Azure compute and credits. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- Over time, this evolved into a broader, multi-year, multibillion-dollar partnership to support OpenAI\u2019s research and deployment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- In **January 2025**, OpenAI and Microsoft revised their compute agreement: OpenAI gained the right to build additional capacity beyond Azure (i.e. using outside compute providers), while Microsoft retains a **right of first refusal** on new capacity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- Under the revised terms, Microsoft still gets \u201cpreferred access\u201d to OpenAI technology (for embedding in its services, e.g. Copilot), but OpenAI is less strictly bound to Azure as the exclusive compute provider. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n**Implication / Evolution**: What began as a deep lock-in to Azure is gradually becoming more flexible, reflecting OpenAI\u2019s need for compute scale beyond what a single cloud provider can reliably deliver (and the desire for plurality of supply).\n\n---\n\n### CoreWeave\n\nThis is a more recent and quite material partnership in 2025 \u2014 less \u201chistorical,\u201d but relevant for how OpenAI is structuring compute via external cloud/hyperscaler providers.\n\n- In **March 2025**, OpenAI signed a **five-year cloud computing contract** with CoreWeave (value ~ $11.9 billion). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search34\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n  - As part of that deal, OpenAI acquired a stake in CoreWeave (~ $350 million) via a private placement tied to the contract. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search34\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n- In **May 2025**, they added ~$4 billion more capacity. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n- In **September 2025**, they expanded further by up to $6.5 billion, bringing the total compute allocation to ~ $22.4 billion. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search25\ue201  \n\nThis relationship is more \u201ccompute capacity outsourcing\u201d than deep hardware co-design. CoreWeave effectively becomes a trusted provider for training/inference workloads, tackling scale demands OpenAI may not host internally.\n\n---\n\n### Oracle\n\n- In 2025, OpenAI reportedly struck an agreement to buy **$300 billion** in compute capacity from Oracle over ~5 years. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search30\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n- Earlier, there were indications of a smaller \u201c$30 billion per year\u201d deal in press reporting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news32\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- This is more in the class of \u201clease compute / cloud infrastructure\u201d rather than co-developing hardware. The scale is large, intended to back OpenAI\u2019s ambitious \u201cStargate\u201d infrastructure expansion. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search30\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n\nOracle\u2019s deal helps illustrate OpenAI\u2019s pivot into more diverse compute sourcing, reducing dependence on a small set of hardware partners.\n\n---\n\n### OpenAI + Broadcom / Custom Silicon (Toward Self-Designed Chips)\n\nTo reduce dependence on GPU vendors and improve performance / cost control, OpenAI has begun edging into custom silicon territory.\n\n- In **October 2024**, Reuters reported OpenAI is collaborating with **Broadcom** and **TSMC** to build its first in-house AI chip. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n- Later sources say the custom chip is focused on **inference workloads** (\u201crunning AI models post-training\u201d) rather than heavy training. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search32\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n- As of early 2025, OpenAI is finalizing the custom chip design (with tape-out phases) with plans for production in ~2026 on TSMC\u2019s N3 process node. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search29\ue201  \n- The chips (or rack systems) are referred to in some sources as **XPUs**, custom accelerators suited to AI workloads. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search23\ue201  \n- Broadcom is expected to \u201cshepherd\u201d the OpenAI \u201cTitan\u201d XPU (inference chip) and contribute systems-level engineering (not just the silicon die). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n\nThis move is more nascent compared to GPU supply deals, but strategically crucial: for OpenAI, owning some of its hardware stack gives control, margin, and supply security.\n\n---\n\n## Interpretation: Trends & Strategy\n\nFrom the above, a few patterns and strategic lessons emerge:\n\n1. **Compute sourcing has shifted from \u201call in Azure + NVIDIA\u201d toward multi-vendor, hybrid, and in-house**  \n   - The Microsoft/Azure partnership was foundational, but over time OpenAI\u2019s compute strategy has diversified (Oracle, CoreWeave, AMD, custom silicon)  \n   - Flexibility is increasingly built in (e.g. right of first refusal vs strict exclusivity)  \n\n2. **Scale drives complexity and risk**  \n   - The sheer compute demand for large models strains any single vendor\u2019s supply chain, hardware roadmap, or capital capacity.  \n   - This likely motivates the huge multi-year contracts with external providers (Oracle) as well as the custom chip initiatives.\n\n3. **Vertical integration as defense**  \n   - By designing its own chips (via Broadcom/TSMC), OpenAI is hedging against external vendor lock-in, pricing pressure, and supply bottlenecks.  \n   - Custom inference accelerators complement GPU usage \u2014 GPUs remain strong for training and general compute, but inference at scale has different constraints (energy, latency, memory).\n\n4. **Co-investment and equity alignment**  \n   - In several deals, OpenAI doesn\u2019t merely buy compute \u2014 it takes equity stakes (CoreWeave, AMD warrant) or mandates joint investment (NVIDIA\u2019s $100B intention)  \n   - These \u201cskin in the game\u201d structures align incentives and reduce pure \u201cvendor vs customer\u201d adversarial dynamics.\n\n5. **Compute is not just arms-length procurement \u2014 it\u2019s strategic infrastructure**  \n   - OpenAI is treating compute deals more like infrastructure projects: akin to utilities or energy contracts.  \n   - Large commitments (GW scales), power, cooling, real estate, networking\u2014all must be synchronized with compute contracts.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can prepare a **timeline view** of OpenAI\u2019s compute deals (with approximate sizes, tech shifts) or compare with how other AI / cloud firms (Google, Meta, Anthropic) manage compute partnerships. Do you want me to build that?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":512,"end_idx":584,"safe_urls":["https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://law.stanford.edu/2025/03/21/ai-partnerships-beyond-control-lessons-from-the-openai-microsoft-saga/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/index/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI and Microsoft extend partnership","url":"https://openai.com/index/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jan 23, 2023 \u2014 This multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft follows their previous investments in 2019 and 2021, and will allow us to continue our ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AI Partnerships Beyond Control Lessons from the OpenAI ...","url":"https://law.stanford.edu/2025/03/21/ai-partnerships-beyond-control-lessons-from-the-openai-microsoft-saga/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Mar 21, 2025 \u2014 OpenAI's ties with Microsoft keep making headlines.

The deal is part of OpenAI's ambitious \"Stargate\" initiative, launched with SoftBank in January 2025, to invest up to $500 billion in building data centers globally, backed by $50 billion from founding partners including Oracle and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX fund. Oracle, which will construct multiple U.S. data centers and expand an existing 1.2GW facility in Abilene, Texas, has seen its shares surge to record highs as a result. The contract significantly boosts Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business, which earned $10.3 billion in 2025, and aligns with founder Larry Ellison\u2019s goal of making Oracle the leading cloud infrastructure provider. Oracle also plans to invest $25 billion in capital expenditure next year and purchase $40 billion worth of Nvidia\u2019s powerful GB200 chips. This move reflects OpenAI's strategy to diversify beyond Microsoft, its largest investor and former exclusive cloud provider, by securing additional capacity through new partnerships with providers like Google and CoreWeave.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Massive AI-Data Center Deals Are Running on Debt","url":"https://www.channelfutures.com/data-centers/big-ai-data-center-deals-of-oracle-peers-run-on-debt?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Oracle stunned markets last week when it announced a $300 billion cloud compute deal with OpenAI.

The order includes custom-designed AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking components, targeting inference workloads on a massive scale\u2014potentially involving 1\u20132 million processors distributed across thousands of racks. OpenAI's new chip, reportedly developed with Broadcom, is expected to feature a systolic array architecture and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and to be manufactured using TSMC\u2019s advanced 3nm N3-series process. \n\nThe client has officially qualified the hardware, indicating readiness for mass deployment set to begin in Q3 2026. The move signals a major strategic shift for OpenAI, traditionally reliant on Microsoft Azure with AMD or Nvidia GPUs, to owning its infrastructure and optimizing AI performance while also gaining leverage in vendor negotiations. This large-scale investment places OpenAI firmly in the ranks of top hyperscalers like Meta, AWS, and Microsoft, who are also investing heavily in AI infrastructure. While there is no official confirmation of OpenAI as the customer, the scale and timing of the deployment align with known plans for its custom silicon roll-out.","attribution":"Tom's Hardware"},{"title":"Broadcom Lands Shepherding Deal For OpenAI \u201cTitan\u201d XPU","url":"https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/09/05/broadcom-lands-shepherding-deal-for-openai-titan-xpu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"...
