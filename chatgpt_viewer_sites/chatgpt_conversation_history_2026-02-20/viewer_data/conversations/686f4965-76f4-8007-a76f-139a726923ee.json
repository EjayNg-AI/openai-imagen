Wolf shares his personal connection to immigration, touching upon his parents' escape from the Nazis. Pritchett, drawing from his extensive experience and research, argues that restrictions on immigration significantly misallocate resources in the global economy, with barriers to movement representing one of the largest price distortions. He emphasizes that the benefits of facilitating labor mobility vastly outweigh traditional foreign aid and development programs.\n\nPritchett suggests that developed countries, due to declining birth rates and increasing dependency ratios, will inevitably need more immigrants to sustain their economies. He proposes a system of temporary labor mobility to address these needs while mitigating political and social concerns. This system includes overseeing recruitment, preparation, placement, and ensuring the return of workers to their home countries to maintain social coherence and economic benefits for both sending and receiving countries.\n\nThe discussion delves into the political resistance to immigration, motivated by fears of cultural change and loss of control. Pritchett asserts that managed temporary labor programs could reconcile these concerns while meeting labor demands, drawing examples from practices in countries like Japan and Germany. The episode concludes with a thoughtful reflection on the complex dynamics of immigration and its essential role in economic sustainability.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1734411630.074,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686f4970dce88007a1918008553b4005","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"da2d80c5-4da4-4eba-bd7a-fa1e8111acdc","request_id":"95cd8257fdf03ffa-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"da2d80c5-4da4-4eba-bd7a-fa1e8111acdc","children":["d4281176-10cb-4f39-a707-d19cf1057a65"]},"d4281176-10cb-4f39-a707-d19cf1057a65":{"id":"d4281176-10cb-4f39-a707-d19cf1057a65","message":{"id":"d4281176-10cb-4f39-a707-d19cf1057a65","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752123762.664562,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n

It slows the rise in the old-age-dependency ratio for the next 20-40 years because most migrants arrive in the prime working ages, pay into tax and pension systems, and raise (slightly) more children than natives.  But if **native and second-generation fertility stay well below replacement and inflows dry up**, the arithmetic catches up and the support ratio will start to deteriorate again.  Long-run sustainability therefore still requires a broader mix of policies\u2014family-friendly reforms that lift fertility, later retirement ages, productivity-boosting technology, prefunded pensions, and (probably) **continuing but well-managed immigration in smaller waves rather than a one-off surge**.\n\n---\n\n## 1  How immigration changes the demographic maths\n\n| Mechanism | Immediate effect | When it wears off |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Young migrants enter workforce** | Lowers dependency ratio by adding 20- to 40-year-olds | ~25\u201330 years later, when they retire |\n| **Fiscal contribution** | Positive lifetime net taxes if integration succeeds | Turns negative if large cohorts retire poor |\n| **Second-generation children** | Enlarge the future labour force, offset native shrinkage | Only if they stay and remain economically active |\n\n* Example: In the United States, the Census/MPI projections show that keeping today\u2019s immigration rate would add **~12 million extra working-age people by 2040**, whereas a \u201czero-immigration\u201d scenario would shrink the workforce by ~17 million. Most of that buffer actually comes from the U.S.-born children of today\u2019s immigrants, not from fresh arrivals alone. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201\n\n* IMF modelling for Europe finds that a steady net inflow equal to only **0.3 % of population per year** can hold the support ratio roughly constant through mid-century, giving public pension systems decades of breathing room. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n* The U.N.\u2019s 2024 World Population Prospects counts **50 countries** where positive net migration is the only thing preventing outright population decline this century. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\nIn other words, immigration does not \u201csolve\u201d ageing, but it **flattens the curve** and prevents a sudden crunch in tax revenues and care-giving capacity.\n\n---\n\n## 2  The catch: immigrants also age, and their descendants converge to local fertility norms\n\nResearch on Finland, France, Sweden and the U.S. shows a regular pattern:\n\n1. **First-generation migrants** often have higher total fertility (TFR) than natives.\n2. **Second-generation migrants** almost always **converge to, or undershoot, the host-country TFR** within one generation.  \n   \u2013 A 2024 Finnish register study even finds *lower* first-birth hazards among 2nd-generation and mixed-parentage adults than among natives. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201\n\nBecause of this convergence, you cannot bank on permanently higher birth rates from earlier migration cohorts.  Absent other policy changes, you would need **recurrent inflows** every couple of decades\u2014a political hard sell in many electorates.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Fiscal sustainability considerations\n\n* **Tax and pension systems**: Because migrants arrive after childhood, host governments avoid 18\u201320 years of schooling and health-care costs; the average lifetime net fiscal contribution of recent U.S. immigrants is estimated at **~US $173 000**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n  \u2013 The gain is contingent on labour-market integration; low-skilled, low-wage inflows can flip the sign.\n\n* **Health and long-term care**: Migrants who retire poor, uninsured or linguistically isolated can add pressure to public services.  Prefunding (e.g. via individual accounts such as Singapore\u2019s CPF or Norway\u2019s sovereign fund) dampens this risk.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Is it merely \u201ckicking the can\u201d? \u2014 A dynamic, not a static, problem\n\nThink of the support ratio as a **moving target** determined by four levers:\n\n1. **Births**\n2. **Deaths** (life expectancy)\n3. **Net migration**\n4. **Labour-market behaviour** (participation, retirement age, productivity per worker)\n\nLow-fertility societies must adjust at least *one* of the other three.  Immigration tackles lever 3; it also indirectly helps lever 1 (slightly higher migrant fertility) and lever 4 (fills skill gaps).  **Without it, you would have to pull the remaining levers much harder**\u2014for example, raising the retirement age beyond 70 or accepting rapid population shrinkage.\n\nThus, immigration is **not just deferral**; it can be part of a *controlled transition path*:\n\n> \u201cA significant inflow of young workers during the years of greatest native decline allows a gradual, more manageable adjustment.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 5  Policy package for long-run viability\n\n| Pillar | Rationale | Illustrative tools |\n|--------|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Selective, pace-controlled immigration** | Keeps age-structure favourable while avoiding social backlash | Points-based systems (Canada, Australia), rotating \u201cskill visas,\u201d or time-limited guest-worker models \u00e0 la Pritchett \ue200cite\ue202turn0news30\ue201 |\n| **Family-friendly reforms to lift fertility** | Reduce reliance on immigration in next generation | Affordable childcare, flexible work, tax credits, housing policies |\n| **Later and more flexible retirement** | Aligns working life with longer healthy life expectancy | Gradual retirement options, actuarially neutral pension adjustments |\n| **Productivity & automation push** | Higher output per worker offsets fewer workers | R&D incentives, AI adoption, retraining programmes |\n| **Prefunded or mixed pension systems** | Break link between cohort size and benefits | Mandatory savings pillars, sovereign funds, auto-enrolment |\n| **Integration & up-skilling of immigrants** | Maximises lifetime fiscal surplus and social cohesion | Language and credential programmes, anti-discrimination enforcement |\n\nWell-designed immigration policy **buys time** for these deeper structural shifts.  Relying on it *alone* simply sets up the same debate for the 2050s.\n\n---\n\n## 6  Bottom line\n\n* **Yes**, today\u2019s immigrants will age\u2014but they give the economy 25-30 years of extra contributors before they draw benefits.  \n* **No**, immigration is not a silver bullet; fertility recovery and systemic reforms are still needed.  \n* **Strategically managed inflows**, alongside productivity gains and pro-family policies, let societies glide rather than crash into demographic ageing.\n\nSo it is not mere procrastination\u2014it is **demographic risk-management**.

Wolf shares his personal connection to immigration, touching upon his parents' escape from the Nazis. Pritchett, drawing from his extensive experience and research, argues that restrictions on immigration significantly misallocate resources in the global economy, with barriers to movement representing one of the largest price distortions. He emphasizes that the benefits of facilitating labor mobility vastly outweigh traditional foreign aid and development programs.\n\nPritchett suggests that developed countries, due to declining birth rates and increasing dependency ratios, will inevitably need more immigrants to sustain their economies. He proposes a system of temporary labor mobility to address these needs while mitigating political and social concerns. This system includes overseeing recruitment, preparation, placement, and ensuring the return of workers to their home countries to maintain social coherence and economic benefits for both sending and receiving countries.\n\nThe discussion delves into the political resistance to immigration, motivated by fears of cultural change and loss of control. Pritchett asserts that managed temporary labor programs could reconcile these concerns while meeting labor demands, drawing examples from practices in countries like Japan and Germany. The episode concludes with a thoughtful reflection on the complex dynamics of immigration and its essential role in economic sustainability.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6618,"end_idx":6618,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"The Overlooked Impact of Immigration on the Size o.. | migrationpolicy.org","url":"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/immigrant-origin-population-2040","attribution":"Migration Policy Institute"},{"title":"Can Immigration Solve the Demographic Dilemma? \u2013 IMF F&D","url":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/03/can-immigration-solve-the-demographic-dilemma-peri","attribution":"IMF"},{"title":"[PDF] World Population Prospects 2024: Summary of Results","url":"https://population.un.org/wpp/assets/Files/WPP2024_Summary-of-Results.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"World Population Prospects"},{"title":"(PDF) Fertility Trends Across Migrant Generations Reexamined: Insights from Finnish Administrative Data","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375291453_Fertility_Trends_Across_Migrant_Generations_Reexamined_Insights_from_Finnish_Administrative_Data","attribution":"ResearchGate"},{"title":"Transcript: Is mass immigration inevitable?","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/fe3e9f6b-4889-436a-8c87-a0dbaef328b7?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Financial Times"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/immigrant-origin-population-2040","https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/03/can-immigration-solve-the-demographic-dilemma-peri","https://population.un.org/wpp/assets/Files/WPP2024_Summary-of-Results.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375291453_Fertility_Trends_Across_Migrant_Generations_Reexamined_Insights_from_Finnish_Administrative_Data","https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/03/can-immigration-solve-the-demographic-dilemma-peri","https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/03/can-immigration-solve-the-demographic-dilemma-peri","https://www.ft.com/content/fe3e9f6b-4889-436a-8c87-a0dbaef328b7?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"migrationpolicy.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/immigrant-origin-population-2040?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"The Overlooked Impact of Immigration on the Size of the Future U.S. ...","snippet":"In the context of today's declining birth rates and population aging, significantly limiting immigration would rapidly shrink the U.S. labor ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1730678400.0,"attribution":"migrationpolicy.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"sciencedirect.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X2300120X?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Fertility and immigration: Do immigrant mothers hand down their ...","snippet":"We examined whether the fertility pattern of immigrant mothers is handed down to the next generation.

This shift is driven by an aging population and low birth rates, with the population expected to lack 11 million workers by 2040. Despite efforts to broaden recruitment to include more women, elderly workers, and immigrants, these measures are insufficient. As a result, Japan is increasingly investing in digital technology and automation under the government's \"Society 5.0\" initiative. \n\nRetail giants like 7-11 and FamilyMart are implementing fully automated stores and cleaning robots, while the transport and agricultural sectors are integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for tasks like truck unloading and tomato harvesting. In industry, there is a trend towards collaborative robots (cobots) to perform complex tasks, with companies like Omron developing adaptable platforms for small and medium-sized businesses. However, the high short-term costs of automation mean many companies still prefer to hire human workers. The success of these technological advancements depends on their acceptance by users and effective collaboration between developers and businesses.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1710807661.0,"attribution":"www.lemonde.fr"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686f4970dce88007a1918008553b4005","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9b832239-607c-4cac-ae78-cb03e61b4abd","request_id":"95cd947f1a23cdf2-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9b832239-607c-4cac-ae78-cb03e61b4abd","children":["2d3db8f3-887b-4b6b-8aa3-72f9603cd9b7"]},"2d3db8f3-887b-4b6b-8aa3-72f9603cd9b7":{"id":"2d3db8f3-887b-4b6b-8aa3-72f9603cd9b7","message":{"id":"2d3db8f3-887b-4b6b-8aa3-72f9603cd9b7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752124509.00626,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into pension reforms","content":"I\u2019ve already gathered relevant sources on Singapore's fertility data and immigration debate, along with pronatalist policies from other countries and automation options.
