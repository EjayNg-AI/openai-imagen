He arranges all of the cubes into a cuboid. The \r\nperimeter of the top of the cuboid is 22cm. Each side of the cuboid has a length \r\ngreater than 2 cm. Find the height of the cuboid.\r\nSolution\r\nFirstly, understand that if all the cubes are 1 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a3, it implies that 144 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a3 is the volume of the \r\nfinal cuboid.\r\nSecondly, realize that prime factorization is going to be a useful tool to determine the dimension \r\nof the cuboid.\r\n144 = 24 \u00d7 32\r\n144 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\r\nLet the three dimensions of the cuboid be \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\r\nNote that the dimensions of the cuboid will be made up of multiples of the prime factors \r\n(no more, no less. Exactly four 2s and two 3s). So we can only pick factors of \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 from \r\nthe four 2s and the two 3s available.\r\nSince the perimeter of the top surface is 22cm (i.e. 2\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + 2\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 22), that means two of the \r\ndimensions (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66) must add up to be 11cm.\r\nTrial and Error 1:\r\nOne possible way is to let \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 = 3 \u00d7 3 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 2 and the remaining 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\r\nSince \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 9 + 2 = 11 satisfies the criteria for perimeter of 22.\r\nHowever, the question has a criteria that the lengths must be greater than 2. So this will \r\nnot work.\r\nTrial and Error 2:\r\nLet \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 3 and \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\r\nSince \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 8 + 3 = 11 and all the lengths are greater than 2. This dimensions satisfies \r\nall the criteria. \r\nTherefore, the height is 6\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 .","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 32 / 34>","Unauthorized copying and distribution prohibited.

So we can only pick factors of \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 from \r\n[L533] the four 2s and the two 3s available.\r\n[L534] Since the perimeter of the top surface is 22cm (i.e. 2\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + 2\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 22), that means two of the \r\n[L535] dimensions (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66) must add up to be 11cm.\r\n[L536] Trial and Error 1:\r\n[L537] One possible way is to let \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 = 3 \u00d7 3 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 2 and the remaining 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\r\n[L538] Since \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = 9 + 2 = 11 satisfies the criteria for perimeter of 22.\r\n[L539] However, the question has a criteria that the lengths must be greater than 2.
