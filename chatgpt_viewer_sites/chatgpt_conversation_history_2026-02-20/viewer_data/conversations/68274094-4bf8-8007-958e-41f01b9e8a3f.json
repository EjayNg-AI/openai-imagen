Thought leaders, such as Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff, highlight its potential to drive productivity without increasing human staffing, possibly reshaping organizational structures and reducing labor costs. A McKinsey report reveals top executives underestimate current AI usage by employees, suggesting a disconnect in perception. Forecasts indicate a near-future shift to human/AI hybrid teams, with HR leaders expecting 61% of workers to retain roles amid a 19% cost reduction. Additionally, newer AI-native startups operate with minimal staff and fluid hierarchies. The Office Therapy segment addresses adapting to disruptive new leadership amid organizational flux, suggesting strategies to navigate changing corporate culture. Other features cover topics including remote workers juggling multiple jobs, changes to white-collar wage dynamics, and rising concerns over the return on higher education.

Cross-cutting meta-skills\n\n1. **Systems thinking & causal inference** \u2013 to diagnose emergent behaviours in opaque model ecosystems.  \n2. **Moral philosophy & negotiation** \u2013 aligning many stakeholders with divergent risk tolerances.  \n3. **Transdisciplinary literacy** \u2013 stitching biology \u21c4 computing \u21c4 arts.  \n4. **Rapid meta-learning** \u2013 ability to re-skill every ~5 years as toolchains mutate.  \n5. **Embodied craftsmanship** \u2013 tactile fields (surgery, haute cuisine, precision repair) remain human-led longer.\n\nMcKinsey notes that **STEM + healthcare + \u201cother high-skill\u201d professions gain share**, while clerical roles shrink \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Strategic questions for researchers & policymakers\n\n1. **Which human capacities remain economically scarce once cognition is cheap?**  \n2. **Can credentialing systems pivot from degree-centric to competency-verified at the pace tech demands?**  \n3. **How do we finance lifelong transitions without entrenching inequality?**  \n4. **What global governance architecture keeps frontier AGI research open, safe, and competitive?**  \n5. **How do we embed psychological and cultural safety nets for a partial-post-work society?**\n\n---\n\n### Take-aways\n\n- **Job creation is real but uneven**: net +78 million by 2030 on current projections \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201, with roles clustering around *governance, augmentation, creative synthesis, and planetary stewardship*.  \n- **Human differentiators\u2014creativity, ethics, empathy\u2014define the next labour frontier.**  \n- **Dynamic reskilling infrastructure** becomes the central economic institution of the AI age.  \n\nUse this map as a **living hypothesis**\u2014update it as capability benchmarks and regulatory moves unfold."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0news18\ue201","start_idx":1116,"end_idx":1147,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/15312fbd-acfd-46d8-8040-f36c6d33de18?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/a-new-future-of-work-the-race-to-deploy-ai-and-raise-skills-in-europe-and-beyond?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/a-new-future-of-work-the-race-to-deploy-ai-and-raise-skills-in-europe-and-beyond?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/15312fbd-acfd-46d8-8040-f36c6d33de18?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The race to deploy generative AI and raise skills - McKinsey","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/a-new-future-of-work-the-race-to-deploy-ai-and-raise-skills-in-europe-and-beyond?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1716249600.0,"snippet":"Our updated modeling of the future of work finds that demand for workers in STEM-related, healthcare, and other high-skill professions would rise.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"McKinsey & Company"},{"title":"Are the agents coming for your job?","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/15312fbd-acfd-46d8-8040-f36c6d33de18?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747239315.242,"snippet":"This edition of the \"Working It\" newsletter explores the growing impact of agentic AI on global workforces. Agentic AI, which autonomously completes multi-step tasks, is being rapidly integrated into workplace processes like onboarding, expense approvals, and project collaboration. Thought leaders, such as Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff, highlight its potential to drive productivity without increasing human staffing, possibly reshaping organizational structures and reducing labor costs. A McKinsey report reveals top executives underestimate current AI usage by employees, suggesting a disconnect in perception. Forecasts indicate a near-future shift to human/AI hybrid teams, with HR leaders expecting 61% of workers to retain roles amid a 19% cost reduction. Additionally, newer AI-native startups operate with minimal staff and fluid hierarchies. The Office Therapy segment addresses adapting to disruptive new leadership amid organizational flux, suggesting strategies to navigate changing corporate culture. Other features cover topics including remote workers juggling multiple jobs, changes to white-collar wage dynamics, and rising concerns over the return on higher education.
