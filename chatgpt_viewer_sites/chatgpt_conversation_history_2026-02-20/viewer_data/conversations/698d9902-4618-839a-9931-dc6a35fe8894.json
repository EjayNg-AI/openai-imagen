I need to inspect the images carefully. The first page has multiple questions asking to express fractions in simplest form or with a single denominator. The second page has a question regarding simplifying expressions, and I'll need to check if Farrah's answer is correct.\n\n**Breaking down algebraic word problems and transcription**\n\nFor Q8, the user needs help with a word problem on distance and speed, and for Q9, a tap problem calculating time when both taps are used simultaneously. I must provide clear algebraic steps without unnecessary detail. I'll transcribe the expressions carefully, especially for Q1 parts like (a) and (b), avoiding mistakes in simplification.\n\n**Reviewing algebra expressions for accuracy**\n\nI\u2019ve transcribed the expressions for Q1 parts (c) to (j) and Q2 parts (a) to (e). A few noteworthies to double check: the denominator in (e) is indeed 2pq, and there's some confusion in Q2 (c) with differing denominators \u2013 it's 9/(2c) - 10/(cr), which is correct. I\u2019ll need to ensure full clarity before moving to the next step.\n\n**Inspecting expressions and transcription for Q3 and Q4**\n\nI\u2019ve checked through Q2(d) and (e), and confirmed the expression \"5 - 6/(7pq)\" is correct. There\u2019s also some fine-tuning for Q3 and Q4, like ensuring proper fractions. Now, I\u2019ll prepare to move on to Page 2 and continue the transcription for the next set of problems in the exercise.\n\n**Clarifying expressions and corrections**\n\nI now have Q5 parts (a) to (h) all clearly written out. For Q6, Farrah\u2019s attempted solution for simplifying the expression seemed incorrect. She missed adding the second fraction and incorrectly combined terms. The correct approach involves using a common denominator to combine the fractions into a final expression of (2x + 5)/((x - 2)(x + 2)).\n\n**Breaking down time and tap rate problems**\n\nFor Q8, staying at point B for 15 minutes is equivalent to 1/4 hour. Adding the return time, the total time is 3/x + 1/4 + 3/(x-2). This can be simplified by combining the fractions carefully.\n\nFor Q9, I\u2019m calculating the time for two taps filling the tank. Tap P fills the tank in x minutes, and Tap Q in x+3 minutes. Combining the rates of both taps, I get the time as x(x+3)/(2x+3). I'll make sure to show each step clearly.\n\n**Simplifying the fraction addition**\n\nFor Q1(a), I want to add 1/(2a) and 1/(4a). To do this, I'll need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) is 4a. I\u2019ll rewrite the fractions as 2/(4a) and 1/(4a), then add them together, getting 3/(4a).\n\n**Simplifying the fraction addition for (b)**\n\nFor (b), I have 3/(10w) + 2/(15w). To combine these, I need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) is 30w. I\u2019ll rewrite the fractions as 9/(30w) and 4/(30w), then add them, giving 13/(30w).\n\n**Simplifying (c)**\n\nFor (c), we have 5/(2m) + 7/(mn). To combine these, I need to get a common denominator. The LCD is 2mn. I\u2019ll rewrite the fractions as 5n/(2mn) and 14/(2mn), then add them up to get (5n + 14)/(2mn).\n\n**Simplifying (d)**\n\nFor (d), we have 4a/(3x) + 5x/(7a). To combine the fractions, I'll need a common denominator. The LCD is 21ax. Rewriting each fraction: (4a * 7)/(21ax) = 28a/(21ax) and (5x * 3)/(21ax) = 15x/(21ax). Now, add them: (28a + 15x)/(21ax).\n\n**Simplifying expression further**\n\nI realized Sympy didn\u2019t combine the fractions because of different variables, but I can still combine them by finding a common denominator of 21ax. This gives me the expression (28a^2 + 15x^2)/(21ax). Now, I\u2019ll proceed with computing and simplifying further.\n\n**Verifying simplification**\n\nI considered whether I could simplify further using the greatest common divisor (GCD), but there isn\u2019t one, so the expression seems final. Moving on to the next task: simplifying 1 + 13/(2pq). It combines as a single fraction: (2pq + 13)/(2pq). Let\u2019s verify that\u2019s correct!\n\n**Verifying fractional addition**\n\nFor the expression 9/(xy) + 2/(yz), I need a common denominator of xyz. When I update the fractions: 9/(xy) becomes 9z/(xyz) and 2/(yz) becomes 2x/(xyz). So, the sum is (9z + 2x)/(xyz). Let\u2019s double-check this step to make sure everything checks out!\n\n**Defining variables for fraction addition**\n\nFor the expression 3/(uv) + 5/(2u\u00b2), I don\u2019t have the variables u and v defined yet, so I\u2019ll just create them. I need to assign values or define what they represent before proceeding with simplifying or combining these fractions. Let's define those and continue!\n\n**Simplifying expression with common denominator**\n\nFor 7/(2w) + 4/(5w\u00b2), I\u2019ll find the least common denominator (LCD) to combine them. The LCM of 2w and 5w\u00b2 is 10w\u00b2. Multiplying the first fraction by 5w and the second fraction by 2 gives the numerator (35w + 8), which simplifies to (35w + 8)/(10w\u00b2). Now let's check if it matches.\n\n**Verifying common denominator**\n\nFor 4/(c\u00b2d) + 9/(cd\u00b2), I need a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) for c\u00b2d and cd\u00b2 is c\u00b2d\u00b2. I\u2019ll adjust each fraction to have this denominator. Once they\u2019re combined, I\u2019ll verify the result. Let me check these steps carefully!\n\n**Verifying common denominator for (j)**\n\nFor 11/(6ab\u00b3) + 8/(21a\u00b2b), I\u2019m looking for a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) between 6ab\u00b3 and 21a\u00b2b will involve both a factor for a\u00b2 and b\u00b3. Once I find that and adjust the numerators, I\u2019ll combine the fractions and double-check everything!\n\n**Verifying fraction simplification for (a)**\n\nFor 1/(3w) - 1/(12w), I\u2019m getting a common denominator of 12w and combining the fractions: (4-1)/(12w), which simplifies to 3/(12w) and then to 1/(4w). I\u2019ll double-check this. Looks good since the numerator and denominator match the expected simplified form!\n\n**Simplifying (b) with variable z**\n\nFor 4/(21z) - 3/(14z), I\u2019ll need to get a common denominator. The least common denominator for 21z and 14z is 42z. I can adjust the fractions accordingly: 4/(21z) becomes 8/(42z), and 3/(14z) becomes 9/(42z). Now, I can combine them.\n\n**Simplifying (c)**\n\nFor 9/(2c) - 10/(cr), I need a common denominator. The least common denominator here is 2cr. I\u2019ll adjust the fractions: 9/(2c) becomes 9r/(2cr), and -10/(cr) becomes -20/(2cr). Now, I can combine these expressions to simplify it.\n\n**Verifying formula for (d)**\n\nFor p/q - r/s, the method to subtract fractions is correct: we multiply the numerators and denominators appropriately. (ps - qr)/(qs) is the right result \u2014 we cross-multiply the fractions, subtract the products of the diagonals and combine them over the common denominator. Looks good!\n\n**Computing equation (e)**\n\nFor 5 - 6/(7pq), I need to make sure I handle the fraction part carefully. First, treat it as \\(5 - \\frac{6}{7pq}\\). Combining the terms requires a common denominator. I can proceed with a step-by-step approach here to simplify completely. Let\u2019s evaluate!\n\n**Simplifying equation (f)**\n\nFor (2c/(5k)) - (5k/(2c)), I need to analyze it carefully since it includes two fractions with different variables. I'll need a common denominator to combine these terms. So let's find that common denominator to simplify the expression step by step. Let's proceed with the calculations!\n\n**Simplifying equation (g)**\n\nFor the expression (7/(pq)) - (6/(qr)), I need a common denominator. Since the variables involved are p, q, and r, I can rewrite both fractions with a denominator of pqr. Then, I\u2019ll subtract the numerators: (7r - 6p). This seems correct, so let me verify!\n\n**Computing equation (h)**\n\nFor the expression 5/(6xy^2) - 13/(2x^3y), I see that the variables are x and y. To subtract them, I\u2019ll need a common denominator. After rewriting both fractions with this common denominator, I'll combine the numerators. Let\u2019s proceed with that. Time to compute!\n\n**Computing equation (a)**\n\nFor the expression 2/(d-3) - 3/(8d), I need to find a common denominator. I'll rewrite both terms with that common denominator and then subtract the numerators. I\u2019ll check if simplification is possible after that. Let\u2019s work through this step by step!\n\n**Computing expression (b)**\n\nFor 1/(w + 2) + 1/(w - 2), I'll find a common denominator. The common denominator will be (w + 2)(w - 2), and then I'll combine the numerators. I'll check if any simplification is possible afterward. Let's work through the steps now!\n\n**Simplifying expression (c)**\n\nFor 3/(p + 7) - 2/(p - 8), my job is to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be (p + 7)(p - 8). Then, I\u2019ll combine the numerators accordingly. I'll work through this and check if simplification is possible afterward. Let's go for it!\n\n**Simplifying expression (d)**\n\nFor 8/(4x - 3) - 4/(x + 2), I\u2019ll need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is (4x - 3)(x + 2). Once that's found, I'll adjust both fractions accordingly and subtract their numerators. Let\u2019s work through this and check if any simplification is possible afterward!\n\n**Simplifying expression (e)**\n\nFor 5/(4x - 7) - 2/(3x + 1), I need to find a common denominator, which will be (4x - 7)(3x + 1). After that, I\u2019ll adjust both fractions accordingly and subtract their numerators. Once I have everything in place, I\u2019ll check if any further simplification is needed.\n\n**Simplifying (f)**\n\nFor 7/(t - 9) - 3/(5t - 4), I need to find a common denominator, which is (t - 9)(5t - 4). After adjusting both fractions to have this denominator, I\u2019ll subtract their numerators and simplify. I\u2019ll make sure everything is in the simplest form after combining.\n\n**Simplifying Q4(a)**\n\nI have m/(m - n) - (n + m)/(n - m). Since (n - m) equals -(m - n), the second term becomes -(n + m)/(m - n). After simplifying, I get m/(m - n) + (m + n)/(m - n). This combines to (2m + n)/(m - n). I\u2019ll verify this calculation with sympy.\n\n**Simplifying the Sympy Expression**\n\nThe expression is a bit messy because of the signs. I should simplify it directly, perhaps by factoring out the negative signs and consolidating terms, so it\u2019s clearer. This should make it easier to check against our result and verify the calculation.\n\n**Simplifying the expression**\n\nFor the second part, the second term can be simplified since \\(7 - 2y = -(2y - 7)\\), making it \\(-5/(2y-7)\\). Combining the terms then, I get \\((9 - 5)/(2y - 7) = 4/(2y - 7)\\). I'll verify this calculation now to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n**Simplifying the expression**\n\nFor this one, I recognize that \\( 2n - 8v \\) can be factored as \\( 2(n - 4v) \\), so the second term becomes \\( \\frac{7w}{2(n - 4v)} \\). Subtracting the terms gives me \\( \\frac{10w - 7w}{2(n - 4v)} = \\frac{3w}{2(n - 4v)} \\). I'll verify this calculation now to ensure it's correct.\n\n**Simplifying the terms**\n\nI recognize that \\( 3b - 6a \\) can be factored as \\( 3(b - 2a) \\), which is equivalent to \\( -3(2a - b) \\). The second term becomes \\( -\\frac{7}{3(2a - b)} \\). Subtracting the terms gives me \\( \\frac{4}{2a - b} + \\frac{7}{3(2a - b)} \\), and simplifying this results in \\( \\frac{19}{3(2a - b)} \\). I'll verify now.\n\n**Breaking down Q5(a)**\n\nI\u2019m looking at \\( \\frac{3}{x^2-4} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{x-2} \\). Noticing that \\( x^2 - 4 \\) factors to \\( (x-2)(x+2) \\), I want a common denominator. After converting both terms to have the same denominator, I get \\( \\frac{2x + 7}{(x-2)(x+2)} \\) and will check if expanding the denominator leads to \\( x^2 - 4 \\). Let\u2019s verify.\n\n**Verifying Q5(a) solution**\n\nI tried combining terms using their common denominator but realized I may have overcomplicated things. Factoring \\( x^2 - 4 \\) simplifies the work. After combining terms, I got \\( \\frac{2x+7}{x^2-4} \\), which matches the denominator I originally derived. Let's verify if this is indeed correct by simplifying the expression.\n\n**Simplifying Q5(b)**\n\nI started by factoring \\( x^2 - 9 \\) as \\( (x-3)(x+3) \\) and found the common denominator. Then, I combined the terms, resulting in \\( \\frac{7x-25}{(x+3)(x-3)} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{7x-25}{x^2-9} \\). I\u2019ll verify that this is indeed correct by simplifying the expression further.\n\n**Simplifying Q5(c)**\n\nI factored \\( x^2 - 49 \\) as \\( (x-7)(x+7) \\) and recognized that \\( 7 - x = -(x-7) \\). After finding the common denominator and combining the terms, I simplified the expression to \\( \\frac{-6x - 41}{(x-7)(x+7)} \\), which is equivalent to \\( \\frac{-(6x+41)}{x^2-49} \\). Let me double-check everything.\n\n**Simplifying Q5(d)**\n\nHere, I factored \\( 25x^2 - 1 \\) as \\( (5x-1)(5x+1) \\) to find the common denominator. After combining the terms, I simplified the expression to \\( \\frac{15x - 1}{(5x-1)(5x+1)} \\), which is equivalent to \\( \\frac{15x - 1}{25x^2 - 1} \\). Let me verify.\n\n**Simplifying Q5(e)**\n\nI combined the terms by using a common denominator of \\( (y+2)^2 \\). After simplifying the expression, I got \\( \\frac{y+6}{(y+2)^2} \\). This should be correct; I'll verify just to be sure!\n\n**Simplifying Q5(f)**\n\nI combined the terms using a common denominator of \\( (r-9)^2 \\) and simplified the numerator to \\( 7r - 65 \\). The expression became \\( \\frac{7r-65}{(r-9)^2} \\). I think this looks good, but I\u2019ll double-check to ensure it's correct!\n\n**Simplifying Q5(g)**\n\nFor this one, I tried to combine the terms by noticing that \\(w^2 - 2w + 1\\) factors to \\( (w-1)^2 \\). After finding a common denominator, simplifying gave me \\( \\frac{12 - 7w}{(w-1)^2} \\). I think it's correct, but I\u2019ll double-check to be sure!\n\n**Simplifying Q5(h)**\n\nI noticed that \\(z^2 + 10z + 25\\) can be factored to \\((z+5)^2\\), so I converted the expression into terms with this common denominator. After simplifying, I got \\( \\frac{4z+23}{(z+5)^2} \\). It looks good, but I\u2019ll double-check to make sure it's correct!\n\n**Verifying Q6**\n\nFor this expression, I\u2019ve simplified \\( 2/(x-2) + 1/(x^2-4) \\), and after factoring \\( x^2-4 \\) into \\( (x-2)(x+2) \\), I arrived at \\( (2x+5)/((x-2)(x+2)) \\). It seems like it should be correct, but I\u2019ll double-check to make sure everything adds up properly!\n\n**Checking factorization and equality**\n\nI see that Sympy\u2019s expression is using unfactored terms. After factoring \\( x^2-4 \\) as \\( (x-2)(x+2) \\), the denominator becomes \\( (x-2)^2(x+2) \\). However, I used a common denominator of \\( (x-2)(x+2) \\) to simplify the expression to \\( (2x+5)/((x-2)(x+2)) \\). Now, I\u2019m checking if both forms are indeed equal.\n\n**Verifying simplified expression**\n\nI\u2019ve broken down the expression \\( 4/(x+4) - 2x/(x^2-16) - 3/(4-x) \\) and swapped \\( 4-x \\) for \\( -(x-4) \\), leading me to rewrite the final expression as \\( (5x-4)/(x^2-16) \\). Now, I\u2019ll check if this can be factored. Let\u2019s verify the result with Sympy.\n\n**Simplifying the second expression**\n\nFor \\( 2/(q^2+4q+4) - 1/(q^2-4) \\), I note that \\( q^2+4q+4 \\) factors as \\( (q+2)^2 \\), and \\( q^2-4 \\) is \\( (q-2)(q+2) \\).
