It often develops silently, and many people are unaware they have it. However, some **early warning signs and symptoms** may emerge:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Common Symptoms and Signs of Pre-diabetes**\n\nWhile many people with pre-diabetes are asymptomatic, these are potential indicators:\n\n#### **1. Increased Thirst and Frequent Urination**\n- Caused by excess glucose in the blood pulling fluid from tissues.\n- Often subtle compared to full-blown diabetes.\n\n#### **2. Fatigue**\n- Your body is less efficient at using glucose for energy, leading to persistent tiredness.\n\n#### **3. Blurred Vision**\n- Fluctuating blood sugar levels can affect fluid levels in the eyes, impacting vision.\n\n#### **4. Slow Healing of Cuts and Wounds**\n- High blood sugar impairs circulation and immune response.\n\n#### **5. Darkened Skin (Acanthosis Nigricans)**\n- Especially around the neck, armpits, or groin.\n- A classic sign of insulin resistance.\n\n#### **6. Unexplained Weight Gain or Difficulty Losing Weight**\n- Especially if fat accumulates around the abdomen (visceral fat).\n\n#### **7. Tingling or Numbness in Hands or Feet (Early Neuropathy)**\n- Nerve damage can begin even before full diabetes develops.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea **Objective Risk Indicators**\nEven without symptoms, you may have pre-diabetes if you have:\n\n- **Fasting Blood Glucose**: 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L (100\u2013125 mg/dL)\n- **HbA1c**: 5.7% to 6.4%\n- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**: 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L (140\u2013199 mg/dL)\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Risk Factors**\nEven in absence of symptoms, you\u2019re at higher risk if you:\n\n- Are overweight (especially abdominal obesity)\n- Have a sedentary lifestyle\n- Are age 40+\n- Have a family history of type 2 diabetes\n- Had gestational diabetes or gave birth to a baby >4kg\n- Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n- Are of Asian, African, or Hispanic ancestry\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **What to Do**\nIf you're concerned about pre-diabetes, here\u2019s what\u2019s next:\n\n- **Request a fasting blood glucose or HbA1c test**\n- **Begin lifestyle changes**: diet, physical activity, and weight management\n- **Track symptoms**: especially fatigue, thirst, and changes in skin or vision\n- **Consult a doctor**: early intervention can prevent or delay diabetes\n\n---\n\nWould you like a checklist or a printable one-pager you can use for screening or education purposes?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"0c2a65ba-c00f-48be-a836-c863756a2153","request_id":"933dfcaa9c6efdc2-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0c2a65ba-c00f-48be-a836-c863756a2153","children":[]}}}
