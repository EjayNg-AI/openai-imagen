That line is the earliest secure waypoint in the story: by\u202fc.\u202f1208\u202fBCE a community calling itself Israel clearly existed. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### From Canaanite Roots to an Israelite People  \n\nArchaeology shows what Merneptah\u2019s scribe could not: in the decades after 1200\u202fBCE hundreds of tiny, unwalled villages suddenly appeared in the hill\u2011country of Ephraim and Judah.  Their pottery and house plans look Canaanite, yet pig bones all but vanish from their refuse heaps, hinting at new food taboos, while the four\u2011room \u201cpillar\u201d house becomes their preferred dwelling.  Most scholars now think these villagers were former Canaanites and other marginal groups who\u2014amid the general Late Bronze Age collapse\u2014re\u2011branded themselves as \u201cIsrael\u201d around shared customs and the worship of a desert deity called **Yahweh**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue202turn0file1\ue201  \n\n### Legendary Beginnings  \n\nIn later centuries Israelites told older tales\u2014of Abraham leaving Mesopotamia, of Isaac and Jacob, of Joseph in Egypt.  Those patriarch stories anchor Israel\u2019s memory deep in the second millennium, yet nothing in the ground names those individuals.  The weight of evidence suggests they are treasured ancestral legends, stitched together during the monarchy to explain kinship with neighboring peoples and Israel\u2019s claim to the land. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### The Exodus Memory  \n\nEqually formative was the saga of slavery in Egypt and the mighty deliverance under Moses.  No trace of a mass escape has turned up in Egyptian records or Sinai surveys, and the scale described in the Book of Exodus is widely judged implausible.  Still, many scholars think a **smaller group**\u2014perhaps Levites or other Semites who once served in Egypt\u2014did flee north and later fused their liberation story with the highlanders\u2019 own memories, giving Israel a unifying drama of rescue and covenant. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### Tribes without a King  \n\nThrough the twelfth and eleventh centuries the hill clans lived as a loose confederation.  They farmed terraces, pastured herds, and sometimes rallied behind charismatic \u201cjudges\u201d against foes like Midianites or Philistines.  Poems such as the Song\u202fof\u202fDeborah remember these days as rough but heroic, when \u201cthere was no king in Israel.\u201d  Archaeology agrees: there is no sign of state bureaucracy in the highlands before\u202fc.\u202f1000\u202fBCE. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue202turn0file1\ue201  \n\n### A Modest Kingdom under David and\u202fSolomon  \n\nSometime around 1000\u202fBCE a Judahite leader named **David** forged a wider coalition, captured the Jebusite fortress of Jerusalem, and established a dynasty that his neighbors soon called the **House\u202fof\u202fDavid**\u2014a title carved on the ninth\u2011century Tel\u202fDan Stele.  David\u2019s son **Solomon** built a temple to Yahweh and fortified key towns.  The Bible depicts a glittering empire; archaeology sees a small hill\u2011country kingdom whose reach probably never exceeded its immediate neighbors, but whose dynasty was real and long\u2011lived. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n\n### Two Hebrew Kingdoms  \n\nAfter Solomon\u2019s death (c.\u202f930\u202fBCE), northern tribes broke away to form the Kingdom of **Israel**, while Judah kept the Davidic line.  Israel soon eclipsed Judah in size and wealth\u2014its capital Samaria, its kings Omri and Ahab, and its conflicts with Damascus are all confirmed by enemy stelae such as the Mesha Stone and by Assyrian annals.  Judah, smaller and more conservative, held fast to Jerusalem and the Temple.  Both kingdoms worshipped Yahweh, though Israel mixed in Baal and Asherah; prophets like Elijah and Hosea thundered against that blend. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n\n### The First Temple Age  \n\nSolomon\u2019s temple\u2014built on a typical Levantine three\u2011room plan\u2014became Judah\u2019s ritual and political heart.  Over the next three centuries it drew pilgrims for Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot; its priests managed royal treasuries and stored harvest tithes.  Reforming kings such as Hezekiah and Josiah later tried to shut down every outlying shrine so that sacrifice happened **only** in Jerusalem, a move that strengthened both monarchy and emerging monotheism. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201  \n\n### Imperial Pressures and Exile  \n\nThe northern kingdom fell first: Assyria captured Samaria in 722\u202fBCE and deported much of its elite.  Judah survived as a vassal but was eventually caught between Egypt and rising Babylonia.  In 586\u202fBCE Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s armies burned Jerusalem, razed the Temple, and exiled leading Judeans to Babylon.  That catastrophe ended the First Temple period yet crystallized Jewish identity: even far from home, the exiles preserved their language, laws, and devotion to the one God of their fathers. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201  \n\n### Looking Back  \n\nThus, the Jewish people emerged not from a single dramatic conquest or migration but from centuries of local evolution: Canaanite villagers adopting new customs, a remembered escape from Egypt, tribal leagues, a Davidic dynasty, and the central shrine in Jerusalem.  Despite gaps and legends, the broad outline is firm: by the late Iron Age the descendants of those highland settlers already called themselves **Judahites**\u2014\u201cJews\u201d\u2014and their story, shaped by both triumph and exile, was well on its way to becoming a shared national memory."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":396,"end_ix":417,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"1.1 -
