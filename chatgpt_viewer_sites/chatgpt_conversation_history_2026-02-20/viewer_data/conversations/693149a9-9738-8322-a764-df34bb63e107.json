That effectively positions the decoder at the last frame.\n- `-i input.mp4` \u2013 your source video.\n- `-frames:v 1` \u2013 output exactly one video frame.\n- `-q:v 2` \u2013 JPEG quality (1 = best, 31 = worst; 2 is very high quality).\n- `last_frame.jpg` \u2013 output filename.\n\nThis will:\n\n- Read the video at its native resolution.\n- Decode the last frame.\n- Save that frame as `last_frame.jpg` with the **same width and height** as the original video.\n\nIf you want to overwrite an existing file without being prompted:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -sseof -0.001 -i input.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 last_frame.jpg\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Extract the `.7z` archive into `C:\\ffmpeg` so you end up with something like:\n\n   ```text\n   C:\\ffmpeg\\bin\\ffmpeg.exe\n   C:\\ffmpeg\\bin\\ffprobe.exe\n   ...\n   ```\n\n(You can use 7-Zip or the built-in Windows extractor for `.zip`; `.7z` needs 7-Zip.)\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Add `ffmpeg` to your PATH\n\n1. Press **Win+R**, type:\n\n   ```text\n   sysdm.cpl\n   ```\n\n   and hit Enter. This opens **System Properties**.\n2. Go to **Advanced** \u2192 **Environment Variables\u2026**.\n3. Under **System variables** (or **User variables** if you only want it for your account), find `Path` \u2192 **Edit**.\n4. Click **New** and add:\n\n   ```text\n   C:\\ffmpeg\\bin\n   ```\n\n5. Click **OK** on all dialogs to save.\n\n(These steps mirror standard FFmpeg-on-Windows guides.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search8\ue201)\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Verify in PowerShell\n\nOpen a **new** PowerShell window and run:\n\n```powershell\nffmpeg -version\n```\n\nIf you see version info, you\u2019re good.\n\nNow from the folder where your video is:\n\n```powershell\ncd \"C:\\path\\to\\your\\video\"\n\nffmpeg -sseof -0.001 -i \"input.mp4\" -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 \"last_frame.jpg\"\n```\n\nThat will grab the last frame at the video\u2019s native resolution and save it as `last_frame.jpg` in the same directory.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your Windows version (10 vs 11) and whether you\u2019re okay using `winget`, I can narrow this down to a minimal set of commands tailored to your setup."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201","start_idx":631,"end_idx":689,"safe_urls":["https://transloadit.com/devtips/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-a-complete-guide/","https://transloadit.com/devtips/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-a-complete-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://winget.run/pkg/Gyan/FFmpeg","https://winget.run/pkg/Gyan/FFmpeg?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html","https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/","https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Download FFmpeg","url":"https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Linux Static Builds. 64-bit static and shared builds.

`-sseof -0.001` = seek to 1 ms before the end (so you get the last frame),\n  - `-frames:v 1` = output exactly one frame,\n  - `-q:v 2` = high JPEG quality.\n\nThat should now produce a `last_frame.jpg` with dimensions **1080\u00d71680** (same as the video).\n\nIf you ever see the same error again with other screenshots/thumbnails, the same `-strict unofficial` trick applies.\n\n---\n\n## Fix 2 (very robust): output PNG instead of JPEG\n\nIf you\u2019re not religious about JPEG specifically, PNG bypasses the MJPEG encoder entirely and avoids this class of issues:\n\n```powershell\nffmpeg -sseof -0.001 -i \"z01.mp4\" -frames:v 1 \"last_frame.png\"\n```\n\nYou still get:\n\n- exact last frame,\n- original resolution,\n- lossless image.\n\nIf you *then* really want JPEG:\n\n```powershell\nffmpeg -i \"last_frame.png\" -q:v 2 \"last_frame.jpg\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Alternative trick: overwrite to guarantee the *very* last frame\n\nIf you ever run into weird timestamp edge cases, another robust pattern is:\n\n```powershell\nffmpeg -sseof -1 -i \"z01.mp4\" -q:v 2 -update 1 -strict unofficial \"last_frame.jpg\"\n```\n\n- `-sseof -1` = start 1 second before the end.\n- ffmpeg decodes all frames from there to EOF.\n- `-update 1` = keep overwriting the same file as new frames come in.\n- Final contents of `last_frame.jpg` = **true last frame**.\n\nThis is slightly heavier (decodes up to ~16 frames for your 16 fps source) but bulletproof.\n\n---\n\nIf you run one of these and still get an error, paste the *new* log and we can dissect it line by line."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2451,"end_idx":2451,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"stackoverflow.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10957412/fastest-way-to-extract-frames-using-ffmpeg?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Fastest way to extract frames using ffmpeg?
