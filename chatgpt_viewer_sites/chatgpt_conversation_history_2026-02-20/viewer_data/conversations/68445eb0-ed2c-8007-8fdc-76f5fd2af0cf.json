far the most promising method and it seemed like it was my only\r\n34:25\r\nreal option and I decided to give it a try so I just went ahead and jumped\r\n34:31\r\nright into it and the first thing that I did was go over to my solvent cabinet and I pulled out my\r\n34:37\r\nDMSO i then started pouring about 200 mls of this solvent into a large flask\r\n34:43\r\nand when it was all loaded in I turned on the stirring after that I lowered in\r\n34:49\r\na little tube that was attached to my argon tank and I started shooting in argon to push out all the air i don't\r\n34:57\r\nthink this was absolutely necessary but at the same time this reaction was going\r\n35:02\r\nto produce a lot of hydrogen gas and I was kind of paranoid that it could mix with the air in the flask and\r\n35:09\r\npotentially explode but with that being said the flask was now full of argon and\r\n35:14\r\nwhat I had to do next was add the first main ingredient which was a bunch of white powder this was all something\r\n35:22\r\ncalled sodium boroh hydide which is a strong reducing agent and very soon this\r\n35:28\r\nwas the stuff that would be releasing the hydrogen right now though it was still relatively tame and when it was\r\n35:35\r\neventually all added I let it stir for about 10 minutes just to give it some\r\n35:40\r\ntime to dissolve then when I eventually felt that it was looking good I went and got\r\n35:45\r\nthe second main ingredient which was 9.6 6 g of my beautiful acetic acid and I\r\n35:52\r\nstarted to slowly add it this almost immediately caused there\r\n35:58\r\nto be a bunch of bubbling along with a pretty clear fizzing sound and this was because the acetic acid was reacting\r\n36:04\r\nwith the sodium borohydide and releasing some of that hydrogen gas that I mentioned earlier more importantly\r\n36:11\r\nthough it was supposed to be forming an intermediate known as sodium triactoxy\r\n36:17\r\nborohydide which right now might not look like anything useful but it'll be\r\n36:23\r\nvery important in a bit also I should mention that the 9.6 g that I was using\r\n36:29\r\nhere was only around 10% of the acetic acid that I had and this is because at\r\n36:34\r\nthis point I still had absolutely no idea if this reaction actually worked\r\n36:40\r\nand I was too scared to risk more than this but anyway once I had added\r\n36:45\r\neverything I again had to let it stir for several minutes to make sure that it all fully reacted while this was\r\n36:53\r\nhappening though I had to prepare the next major ingredient and to do this I\r\n36:58\r\nstarted by adding an addition funnel above the flask with this in place I\r\n37:04\r\nthen went and got another chemical called methane sulfonic acid and I added\r\n37:09\r\n53.8 8 g of this syrupy liquid into the funnel on top of this I also added\r\n37:17\r\nanother 200 mls of DMSO which easily mixed with it except in theory I\r\n37:24\r\nprobably shouldn't have been adding a solvent to an acid i mean in this case I\r\n37:29\r\nknew it would be fine but that can't always be assumed and for example if I had done this with sulfuric acid and\r\n37:36\r\nwater it probably would have boiled and potentially sprayed out of the funnel\r\n37:42\r\nbut either way once it was all mixed I sealed the top with a stopper and now I\r\n37:48\r\nwas ready to make some ethanol so I just went over to the valve on the addition funnel and I very carefully opened it to\r\n37:56\r\ndropwise add the methane sulfonic acid and almost immediately I could see that\r\n38:02\r\nit was reacting this was because there were a bunch of very small bubbles that quickly appeared which was all hydrogen\r\n38:10\r\ngas that was forming as the acid attacked the sodium borohydide as far as I know though this\r\n38:17\r\nwas mostly just a side reaction and what I actually wanted the acid to do was\r\n38:23\r\ncatalyze a reaction between the sodium borohydide and the sodium triacettoxy\r\n38:29\r\nborohhydide that I made earlier the paper itself unfortunately didn't give\r\n38:34\r\nany details about this reaction but what I think is likely is that the sodium borohydide was splitting apart the\r\n38:42\r\nsodium triacettoxy borohydide and turning it into something called\r\n38:47\r\nacetalahhide this was then probably getting attacked again by the sodium borohydide which would be reducing it\r\n38:53\r\neven further and hopefully turning it into some amazing ethanol overall I thought that this was\r\n39:01\r\nall pretty exciting except what did concern me was that the paper also didn't give any real details about the\r\n39:08\r\nreaction process itself and unfortunately even though it was still very early on it was looking like it was\r\n39:16\r\ngoing to be a temperamental one this is because after barely adding any acid it\r\n39:22\r\nwas already warming up and at this point it was getting up to around 40C it was\r\n39:28\r\nalso looking like it was slowly getting foamier and foamier which would only get worse as it heated up and I was\r\n39:35\r\ndefinitely going to have to cool it down so I just quickly added a large dish under the flask and I filled it with a\r\n39:42\r\nbunch of water and this very quickly brought the temperature down to around 15\u00b0 C which I was very happy to see this\r\n39:52\r\nis because the crisis seemed to be over and even though it was still bubbling it\r\n39:57\r\nappeared to be much more controlled and now I figured that I just had to add the\r\n40:02\r\nrest of the acid so that was exactly what I did and what I thought was really\r\n40:07\r\ninteresting was that as I added it the reaction seemed to go through a few different phases for example for some\r\n40:15\r\nreason despite the cooling it all started getting frothier and frothier again except right when I started\r\n40:22\r\ngetting concerned that it might eventually foam out of the flask it all suddenly thinned out this then made me\r\n40:30\r\nthink that I was basically in the clear and that I was past the worst of it but\r\n40:35\r\nthen it suddenly started thickening way worse than before and it actually ended up completely freezing at the same time\r\n40:43\r\nit was also slowly puffing up which was very concerning except it again just\r\n40:50\r\nsuddenly started thinning out and it wasn't long before it completely liquefied this constant back and forth\r\n40:57\r\nthough made it so that I absolutely didn't trust it anymore and I became constantly worried that at some point it\r\n41:04\r\ncould just start foaming uncontrollably except that thankfully never happened this is because it\r\n41:11\r\nactually ended up being super tame and when I eventually added the last bit of acid I was left with a nice and slightly\r\n41:20\r\ngray solution at this point though the reaction wasn't quite done yet and I was\r\n41:26\r\ngoing to have to let it stir like this for a bit longer so while I was waiting I went and got a beaker and I added\r\n41:33\r\nabout 180 mls of water then after that I dumped in 20 g of sodium hydroxide drain\r\n41:40\r\ncleaner and I turned on the stirring and I waited for it to fully dissolve when\r\n41:46\r\nthis eventually happened I had a nice and clear solution and at this point it had been about 15 minutes so I went back\r\n41:54\r\nto my reaction which now should have been done and I started pouring all of\r\n41:59\r\nthis into it this strongly basic solution was then quenching the reaction\r\n42:04\r\nand it was destroying any sodium borohydide or acid that remained for\r\n42:10\r\nwhatever reason it also caused the whole thing to clear up quite a bit and I started noticing little drops of\r\n42:16\r\nsomething oily appearing on the side of the flask but moving on what I had to do\r\n42:23\r\nnext was get all of the ethanol that I hopefully made out of this mixture of\r\n42:28\r\nchemicals according to the paper this was also relatively easy and apparently\r\n42:34\r\nall I had to do was some more distillations so I just immediately got started with that by getting rid of the\r\n42:41\r\nwater dish and then I quickly added a stopper a fractional column and another\r\n42:46\r\nstopper and I put together pretty much the same setup that I just did for the\r\n42:52\r\nacetic acid i then cranked up the heating and it wasn't long before the\r\n42:57\r\nfirst stuff started coming over at around 35C which I assumed was that oily\r\n43:03\r\njunk that I saw before more specifically though I was pretty sure that this was\r\n43:08\r\nall something called dimethyl sulfide which was supposed to be a major side product in this reaction the only\r\n43:15\r\nunfortunate part was that it was also supposed to smell absolutely horrible but at such a low boiling point I\r\n43:23\r\nfigured that it would be removed pretty easily with that being said I then just kept collecting it until the temperature\r\n43:31\r\nsuddenly started spiking and when it eventually got to about 80 C I swapped\r\n43:37\r\nthe flask for a fresh one this was because at this point if there were any ethanol in there this was when it would\r\n43:44\r\nstart coming over the only tricky part was that it wasn't going to be coming over as pure ethanol and it would\r\n43:51\r\ninstead be a combination of ethanol and water this in turn meant that to get all\r\n43:57\r\nof the ethanol I was also going to have to collect all of the water that was in there which was around 200 ms and over\r\n44:05\r\nthe next couple hours the volume in the flask slowly rose at the same time the\r\n44:11\r\namount in the main flask slowly went down and with less and less water a bunch of solid stuff started forming and\r\n44:19\r\nthis was all just junk from the reaction that was being left behind going back to\r\n44:24\r\nthe other flask though it did eventually get to the point that it was around 200\r\n44:30\r\nmilliliters and right when this happened I turned off the heating i then quickly\r\n44:36\r\npopped off the flask and what I had now was at least in theory around 5% ethanol\r\n44:42\r\nwhich I thought was pretty exciting however just by looking at it and seeing all of the little oil drops that were\r\n44:50\r\nstill somehow floating around it was obvious that I was going to have to clean it a bit more so I decided to do\r\n44:57\r\nanother distillation except this time I would use a much more efficient fractional column which would hopefully\r\n45:04\r\ngive me a better separation of ethanol and water i then just went ahead and\r\n45:09\r\ncranked up the heating and I basically did the same thing as before where I rejected everything that came over below\r\n45:17\r\nADC the major difference this time though was that I wasn't going to be collecting all the water and I was\r\n45:24\r\nactually going to try to leave behind as much as possible by pulling off the flask the moment that the temperature\r\n45:31\r\ngot to 100C so that was exactly what I did and\r\n45:36\r\nthen I very carefully transferred everything that I got to a little vial and at this point I was pretty happy\r\n45:43\r\nwith how things were going this was because assuming that the reaction had worked what I had now should have been\r\n45:51\r\nrelatively clean ethanol to fully confirm this though I was going to have to run it through my NMR so that was\r\n45:59\r\nwhat I did and well it told me that it wasn't super pure but it was for sure\r\n46:05\r\nethanol to get its concentration I then did another test by putting a few drops\r\n46:11\r\nof the ethanol onto something known as a refratoter and when I looked into it it\r\n46:16\r\ntold me that it was at least 80% which was actually better than I\r\n46:22\r\nexpected the only unfortunate part was that when I went to do the very necessary smell test I was not very\r\n46:32\r\nimpressed this is because instead of getting a nice and clean ethanol smell it was almost unbearably sulfury with a\r\n46:41\r\nhorrible rotten cabbage stench i also almost

I just went ahead and jumped right into it. The first thing I did was go over to my solvent cabinet and pull out my DMSO. I started pouring about 200 mL of this solvent into a large flask, and when it was all loaded in, I turned on the stirring.

With this in place, I then went and got another chemical called methanesulfonic acid, and I added 53.88 grams of this syrupy liquid into the funnel. On top of this, I also added another 200 mL of DMSO, which easily mixed with it\u2014except, in theory, I probably shouldn\u2019t have been adding a solvent to an acid.

So while I was waiting, I went and got a beaker and added about 180 mL of water.

However, just by looking at it and seeing all of the little oil drops that were still somehow floating around, it was obvious that I was going to have to clean it a bit more, so I decided to do another distillation\u2014except this time, I would use a much more efficient fractional column, which would hopefully give me a better separation of ethanol and water.\n\nI then just went ahead and cranked up the heating, and I basically did the same thing as before, where I rejected everything that came over below 80\u00b0C. The major difference this time, though, was that I wasn\u2019t going to be collecting all the water, and I was actually going to try to leave behind as much as possible by pulling off the flask the moment the temperature got to 100\u00b0C. So that was exactly what I did, and then I very carefully transferred everything that I got to a little vial, and at this point, I was pretty happy with how things were going. This was because, assuming that the reaction had worked, what I had now should have been relatively clean ethanol.\n\nTo fully confirm this, though, I was going to have to run it through my NMR, so that was what I did. Well, it told me that it wasn\u2019t super pure, but it was for sure ethanol. To get its concentration, I then did another test by putting a few drops of the ethanol onto something known as a refractometer, and when I looked into it, it told me that it was at least 80%, which was actually better than I expected. The only unfortunate part was that when I went to do the very necessary smell test, I was not very impressed. This is because instead of getting a nice and clean ethanol smell, it was almost unbearably sulfury, with a horrible rotten cabbage stench. I also almost immediately knew that this was..."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"7c43cec3-c0f1-4235-a90a-57931d8b0334","request_id":"94c147703ea15fb3-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7c43cec3-c0f1-4235-a90a-57931d8b0334","children":[]}}}
