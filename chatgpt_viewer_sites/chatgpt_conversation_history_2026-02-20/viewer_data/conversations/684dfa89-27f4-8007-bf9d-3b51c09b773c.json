The model, akin to OpenAI's o1, delivers accurate, step-by-step responses but at a much lower development cost, sparked by using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate human feedback processes. R1's efficiency has caused a stir in Silicon Valley, outperforming some models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Another notable innovation is DeepSeek's ability to create smaller, efficient models using data generated by the R1 model. These advancements suggest that powerful AI models can now be developed with reduced computational resources and costs, setting a new precedent in the field.

The release has sparked intense debate among major US AI companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind about maintaining their technical dominance. Liang, using funds from his quant trading hedge fund High-Flyer, assembled a highly skilled team and efficiently utilized resources to achieve significant AI advancements despite restrictions on importing powerful Nvidia chips due to export bans. This revelation has turned Liang into a national icon in China and highlighted DeepSeek's focus on research over commercialization.

Contrary to the old notion that China imitates rather than innovates, DeepSeek's emergence highlights China's strength in software and AI. Unlike typical Chinese firms, DeepSeek operates like a Silicon Valley start-up with ambitions for achieving AGI, relying on open-source models and focusing on language.

This has garnered attention from the US tech community and posed a challenge to companies like OpenAI, which has monetized its AI models. DeepSeek's approach, which uses pure reinforcement learning, emphasizes reasoning capabilities without supervised data, showing impressive advancements in AI research.

The model demonstrated unexpected behavior by switching between English and Chinese during problem-solving tasks, reducing performance when restricted to one language. This behavior is attributed to a new training approach that prioritizes correct answers over human-legible reasoning. Researchers fear this could lead AI systems to develop inscrutable ways of thinking, potentially creating non-human languages for efficiency. Similar research by Meta indicated that freeing AI from human language constraints might enhance reasoning performance but at the cost of transparency. This development poses a risk for AI safety, as it could hinder our ability to monitor and understand AI decision-making processes. Despite some researchers advocating for human-legible reasoning, the push towards optimizing AI performance without language constraints could complicate efforts to ensure AI aligns with human values and operates safely.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1738170433.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-model-ai","title":"How Chinese AI Startup DeepSeek Made a Model that Rivals OpenAI","snippet":"On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, an open source model that surpasses industry leaders like OpenAI on various math and reasoning benchmarks. DeepSeek, initially a deep-learning research branch of High-Flyer hedge fund, has focused on software-driven resource optimization rather than relying heavily on advanced hardware. Founded by Liang Wenfeng, it emphasizes collaborative innovation and basic scientific research over commercial gains. Despite US export controls on advanced chips impacting the firm, DeepSeek optimized its model using custom engineering techniques, making their models extremely efficient. Their success challenges US export controls by demonstrating that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with fewer resources.
