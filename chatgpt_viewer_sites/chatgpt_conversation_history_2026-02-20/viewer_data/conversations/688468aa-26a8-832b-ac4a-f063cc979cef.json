Due to diffraction, each produces an intensity pattern with a central peak and sidelobes.\n\n**Rayleigh\u2019s Criterion says:**\n- The two sources are just resolvable if the angular separation \\( \\Delta \\theta \\) between them equals the angle to the first diffraction minimum:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{a}\n\\]\n\nIf the separation is **less than** \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\), the two patterns significantly overlap, and the sources cannot be distinguished.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcca **Interpretation and Importance**\n\n- This criterion defines the **diffraction-limited resolution** of an optical system.\n- In practice, it limits the **resolving power** of telescopes, microscopes, and cameras.\n- Reducing the slit width \\( a \\) increases diffraction and decreases resolution (makes the angular width of the central peak larger).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Caveats and Real-World Considerations**\n\n- Rayleigh's criterion is not an absolute physical law\u2014rather a **convention** based on the perceptual threshold of distinguishability.\n- More sophisticated criteria (e.g. Sparrow or Dawes limits) or computational deconvolution techniques are used in modern imaging.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Summary\n\n| Aspect                     | Rayleigh's Criterion in Single Slit Diffraction                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Condition for resolution  | Central maximum of one pattern coincides with first minimum of the other |\n| Minimum resolvable angle  | \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\)                                |\n| Implication               | Sets the angular resolution limit due to diffraction             |\n| Assumptions               | Monochromatic, coherent light; far-field (Fraunhofer) conditions |\n\nLet me know if you'd like the derivation or extension to circular apertures (Airy discs)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"965186032d0a44a1-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"da03aacb-cc5d-4799-a56a-746c115cf241","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"da03aacb-cc5d-4799-a56a-746c115cf241","children":[]}}}
