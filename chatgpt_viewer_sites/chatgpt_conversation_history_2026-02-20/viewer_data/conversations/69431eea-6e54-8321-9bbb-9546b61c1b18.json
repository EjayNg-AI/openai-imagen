Some energy escapes as neutrinos and very penetrating particles, but **a large fraction ends up as heat/radiation in a region around the track/shower**.\n\nSo the \u201cdestructive power\u201d is real, but it\u2019s more like an *intense, localized radiation/energy dump* than a macroscopic battering ram.\n\n## 3) Could one proton destroy\u2026?\n\n### A bacterium  \n**Yes, if it actually passes through it.**  \nEven much lower-energy radiation can kill bacteria by breaking DNA or creating lethal chemical damage. A single high-energy proton track can deposit enough energy in micrometer scales to be fatal *if it hits the right place*. The caveat is **probability**: a lone proton might miss the bacterium entirely.\n\n### A small piece of wood  \nAt **LHC energies** (microjoule): **no noticeable macroscopic damage**\u2014maybe a microscopic track, some ionization, but nothing you\u2019d see.  \nAt **cosmic-ray extreme** (~16 J): still **not \u201cblow up the wood\u201d**. You\u2019d get a particle shower and localized heating/ionization, but 16 J is not much thermal energy for bulk wood.\n\nIf you crank the proton up to **kilojoules or more**, then yes: it could deposit enough energy to char/vaporize material locally, and at sufficiently high energies create a small explosive event.\n\n### A house  \nTo \u201cdestroy a house\u201d you\u2019re talking **gigajoules** (roughly comparable to hundreds of kg to tons of TNT, depending on what you mean by \u201cdestroy\u201d).  \nA *single* proton could carry gigajoules **in theory**, but it would require fantastically extreme \\(\\gamma\\) (and energies far beyond anything observed in nature).\n\nIf you did have, say, **a few gigajoules** in one proton and it deposited most of it in/near the structure, the effect would be comparable to a **small bomb** (plus a lot of prompt ionizing radiation). So: **in theory yes**, but it\u2019s an absurd energy scale for one particle.\n\n### A star  \n**No, not in any remotely meaningful sense.**  \nA star\u2019s gravitational binding energy is enormous (for the Sun, ~\\(10^{41}\\,\\text{J}\\) order of magnitude). One proton, even \u201cas close to \\(c\\) as you like,\u201d would need **astronomical** energy to compete with that, and even then the star is so large that \u201cone-track deposition\u201d doesn\u2019t couple efficiently to \u201cdestroy the whole star\u201d unless you\u2019re essentially positing an energy payload comparable to stellar-scale catastrophes.\n\n## Bottom line  \n- A single proton can be **biologically destructive** (radiation damage) at energies that are *not* macroscopic.  \n- To destroy **macroscopic objects**, you need **macroscopic energy** (joules \u2192 kilojoules \u2192 gigajoules), and getting that into **one proton** requires unimaginably high energies.  \n- Destroying a **star** is on a completely different tier: essentially **no**.\n\nIf you tell me what you mean by \u201cdestroy\u201d for the house (break windows? collapse walls? level it?), I can translate that into an approximate joule/TNT range and then into the corresponding single-proton energy and \u201chow close to \\(c\\)\u201d that implies."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"0cb42736-dda8-4fe2-a4eb-ebb6981c9a11","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"15dbfe23-41e2-431c-8090-eeb967c60933","turn_exchange_id":"4ae92df7-7382-4f31-87eb-363364244128","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"15dbfe23-41e2-431c-8090-eeb967c60933","children":["2de2bc8b-24b9-481f-a90b-9153e7c25a6c"]},"2de2bc8b-24b9-481f-a90b-9153e7c25a6c":{"id":"2de2bc8b-24b9-481f-a90b-9153e7c25a6c","message":{"id":"2de2bc8b-24b9-481f-a90b-9153e7c25a6c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766006945.143,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Destroy = Could in the right situation and with enough accuracy cause a star to go supernova, or some equivalent dramatic event of similar scale.\n\nCan a proton possess the 10^41 J of energy needed, even if only in theory?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"65093333-2358-474f-a330-ff77ff65a0d9","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"598b35a0-2c65-4577-beec-4382a8a48941","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c72cbdd8-ec9b-4538-8791-dc168e05f81c","children":["f2707ad0-17aa-4dbe-ad1e-308e58b8721c"]},"f2707ad0-17aa-4dbe-ad1e-308e58b8721c":{"id":"f2707ad0-17aa-4dbe-ad1e-308e58b8721c","message":{"id":"f2707ad0-17aa-4dbe-ad1e-308e58b8721c","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766006945.9417815,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"65093333-2358-474f-a330-ff77ff65a0d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"2de2bc8b-24b9-481f-a90b-9153e7c25a6c","turn_exchange_id":"598b35a0-2c65-4577-beec-4382a8a48941","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2de2bc8b-24b9-481f-a90b-9153e7c25a6c","children":["85b092a8-69fd-4826-8010-f12276d162ca"]},"85b092a8-69fd-4826-8010-f12276d162ca":{"id":"85b092a8-69fd-4826-8010-f12276d162ca","message":{"id":"85b092a8-69fd-4826-8010-f12276d162ca","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766006949.180262,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering proton energy and potential black hole formation","content":"I'm considering whether a proton could have 10^41 J of energy.

You can make the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma\\) as large as you like, hence \\(K=(\\gamma-1)m_pc^2\\) as large as you like.\n\nWith that said:\n\n## Can a proton have \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) of kinetic energy (in the star frame), even \u201cin theory\u201d?\nIn plain special relativity: **yes**.\n\nNumerically, it\u2019s absurdly extreme:\n\n- Proton rest energy: \\(m_pc^2 \\approx 1.50\\times10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\).\n- Required Lorentz factor:\n  \\[\n  \\gamma \\approx 1+\\frac{10^{41}}{1.50\\times10^{-10}}\\approx 6.7\\times10^{50}.\n  \\]\n- Speed would be so close to \\(c\\) that\n  \\[\n  1-\\frac{v}{c}\\approx \\frac{1}{2\\gamma^2}\\sim 10^{-102}.\n  \\]\nSo \u201cclose to light speed\u201d is an understatement; it\u2019s \\(c\\) minus a decimal point followed by ~101 zeros.\n\nAlso, that energy corresponds to an **equivalent mass-energy**\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{c^2}\\approx \\frac{10^{41}}{9\\times10^{16}}\\approx 1.1\\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{kg},\n\\]\nabout **0.2 Earth masses** worth of energy, packed into one particle\u2019s kinetic energy *in that frame*.\n\n## Would that be enough to trigger \u201ca supernova or equivalent dramatic event\u201d?\nTwo separate issues:\n\n### (A) Energy scale\n- \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) is in the ballpark of the **gravitational binding energy of a Sun-like star** (order \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\)). Depositing that much energy *efficiently* could plausibly **unbind** a Sun-like star (i.e., blow it apart), which is certainly \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n- But a **core-collapse supernova** typically involves energies around \\(10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) in the exploding ejecta (and even more in neutrinos). So \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) is **~1000\u00d7 smaller** than \u201ccanonical supernova\u201d kinetic-energy scales.\n\nSo: \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) might be \u201cblow-apart-a-Sun-like-star\u201d scale, but it\u2019s not automatically \u201csupernova-equivalent\u201d across the board.\n\n### (B) Coupling/where the energy goes\nEven if the proton carries \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\), whether it *causes a star to supernova* depends on **where and how fast** the energy is deposited:\n\n- A single ultra-energetic proton will initiate a **particle cascade** (a hadronic shower) and dump energy along a path and in secondary showers\u2014not like a bomb uniformly heating the core.\n- Supernovae are not just \u201cadd energy and boom.\u201d A core-collapse supernova is mainly about **gravitational collapse of the core**, neutrino transport, and shock revival. Dumping energy could just **ablate** outer layers or create an enormous localized explosion without producing the supernova mechanism you have in mind.\n\nSo the best honest statement is:\n- **If you could deposit \\(\\sim 10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) deep inside a Sun-like star on a short timescale**, you could plausibly **disrupt/unbind** it.\n- That is not guaranteed to look like a normal supernova; it may be a different kind of catastrophic stellar disruption.\n\n## The big \u201ctheory caveat\u201d\nAt \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) you are **far** beyond energies where our extrapolations are trustworthy (you\u2019re enormously above the Planck scale where quantum gravity should matter). Special relativity still says \u201cno upper bound,\u201d but the detailed outcome of such an event is no longer something we can compute confidently with known physics.\n\n**Answer in one line:**  \nIn idealized special relativity, **yes**, a proton can have \\(10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) kinetic energy (in a chosen frame), but whether that would *trigger a supernova* is not guaranteed\u2014and at those energies you\u2019re well outside the regime where established physics can be applied reliably."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"65093333-2358-474f-a330-ff77ff65a0d9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d28657fe-a9f6-4612-a64f-8ed0e1a7075e","turn_exchange_id":"598b35a0-2c65-4577-beec-4382a8a48941","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"d28657fe-a9f6-4612-a64f-8ed0e1a7075e","children":["c57610d6-b5c2-4817-8c37-d33278da25f6"]},"c57610d6-b5c2-4817-8c37-d33278da25f6":{"id":"c57610d6-b5c2-4817-8c37-d33278da25f6","message":{"id":"c57610d6-b5c2-4817-8c37-d33278da25f6","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766007295.388,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Ah, but I now considered, say, an asteriod having 10^44 J of energy -- yes, absurdly high but can I consider such an object even if only in theory?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"c7975f99-5c98-47f8-a23c-da5f094968fd","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"5579eab2-3c33-4610-b307-737fa4b2d7de","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e2fd165d-cebf-46f5-beea-5421aefdb6d6","children":["e8f9b5c0-698c-442f-86ae-1aad92992b46"]},"e8f9b5c0-698c-442f-86ae-1aad92992b46":{"id":"e8f9b5c0-698c-442f-86ae-1aad92992b46","message":{"id":"e8f9b5c0-698c-442f-86ae-1aad92992b46","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766007296.2177634,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"c7975f99-5c98-47f8-a23c-da5f094968fd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c57610d6-b5c2-4817-8c37-d33278da25f6","turn_exchange_id":"5579eab2-3c33-4610-b307-737fa4b2d7de","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c57610d6-b5c2-4817-8c37-d33278da25f6","children":["29e3c3e6-03cf-4182-8057-9c932db3c25a"]},"29e3c3e6-03cf-4182-8057-9c932db3c25a":{"id":"29e3c3e6-03cf-4182-8057-9c932db3c25a","message":{"id":"29e3c3e6-03cf-4182-8057-9c932db3c25a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766007298.559523,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering theoretical energy of an asteroid","content":"The user is asking about the theoretical possibility of an asteroid having 10^44 J of energy.
