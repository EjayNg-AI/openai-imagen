I\u2019ll make sure to use natural logarithms (ln) for all of them and ignore change-of-base rules. I will stick to the two methods in the section\u2014removing logs when both sides or one side has a log. I\u2019ll give plenty of checks for undefined terms!\n\n**Working through method 1 and 2**\n\nFor the first method, I'll convert constants to logs, combine them, equate the arguments, and solve the polynomial. The second method involves moving the logs to one side, combining them, and then exponentiating. For the self-practice problems, the text is garbled due to OCR, so I might need to look at the rendered images of the pages.\n\n**Deciding how to extract text and create questions**\n\nI need to extract the text from pages 3-6, but the OCR has some issues. The easiest might be to convert the pages into images using container tools or PyMuPDF, though I could also rely on the parsed text. My main aim is to create questions, focusing on logarithmic equations, and ensuring I cover both methods while avoiding change-of-base rules.\n\n**Designing representative practice questions**\n\nIn Part 3, I'll make sure to use \"ln\" instead of \"lg,\" as per the user's request. I'll focus on creating 15 questions that match the section, such as solving equations with \"ln\" on both sides, involving log laws and exponentiation. I'll include \"Find y in terms of x\" and possible simultaneous equations, staying focused on Part 3.\n\n**Designing questions with ln and avoiding change of base**\n\nThe task requires creating 15 questions focused on solving log equations with ln. I need to avoid change-of-base rules, so I'll keep everything to ln. I'll include questions like \"Find y in terms of x using ln,\" equations like ln(1 - x^2) = ln(2 - x) + ln(2 + x), and challenges involving logarithmic identities and potential extraneous solutions.\n\n**Designing ln-based questions and constants**\n\nI must use natural ln forms while avoiding base changes. For constants, I can use ln(e^k) or ln integers like ln(20) or ln(27). I'll want equations such as ln(x+2) + ln(4-x) = ln(6), and adapt from base-specific examples to ln-form questions. The goal is clarity, while sticking to ln rules.\n\n**Designing ln-based questions with variety and pedagogy**\n\nI need to create 15 questions focused on natural logarithms (ln), avoiding change-of-base rules. There should be a mix, including equations where both sides have logs and others with just one side, reflecting Part 3 of the worksheet. I'll also highlight domain restrictions for extraneous solutions. I'll include guidance like \"Remember to check and reject any answers that make the ln term undefined.\"\n\n**Designing 15 ln-based questions with clear boundaries**\n\nI need to ensure the task consists of exactly 15 questions, each clearly numbered. Subparts (like a, b, c) will be counted as separate questions. I'll create equations where I solve for x or find y in terms of x, always using ln for the logs. I'll base some of the questions on the examples and avoid change-of-base rules.\n\n**Choosing constants for nicer solutions in ln equations**\n\nI'm considering constants like ln 8 and ln 5 to avoid complex exponentiation or irrational constants. For example, ln(x + 2) + ln(4 - x) = ln8 leads to a manageable polynomial with integer solutions. Similarly, I adjust other equations with log terms to make them solvable without excessive complexity.\n\n**Refining the quadratic solution and factoring errors**\n\nI\u2019m working on solving an equation, but I noticed an error in my factoring. I started by analyzing ln(5 - x) = 2 ln(x - 1), but after solving, I reconsidered where extraneous solutions could arise. I quickly realized that I made a mistake with my factorization in the quadratic expression.\n\n**Creating log and exponential equation problems**\n\nI'm designing math problems with natural logarithms. For example, by adjusting constants, I created an equation like ln((x-1)(x-4)) = 0, whose solutions are rational but not super neat, so I tweaked it to make it easier. I also designed a method where one side of the equation has a logarithm, while keeping the solutions rational.\n\n**Designing logarithmic equation problems**\n\nI'm crafting log equation problems and balancing complexity. Some solutions lead to irrational numbers like \"e\", but they\u2019re acceptable as long as they don't require bases to be changed. I'll keep most questions solvable algebraically, while using natural logs. Problems like \"solve for y in terms of x\" can vary the method for additional challenge.\n\n**Designing logarithmic equation problems and self-practice sets**\n\nLet's create four manageable logarithmic equations to solve for y in terms of x, and 11 additional solve-for-x equations that adhere to the user\u2019s guidelines. We\u2019ll ensure that no change of base is required, stick to ln notation only, and keep constants or numeric values separate from logarithmic expressions. I'll add a note for checking for undefined solutions and cite the worksheet appropriately.\n\n**Creating manageable equations with domains and solutions**\n\nI\u2019m checking each equation carefully to make sure it follows domain restrictions and allows real solutions. For some questions, I\u2019ll ensure there are extraneous solutions to reject, as part of the pedagogy. I\u2019ll also adjust constants, like using ln(2) for clean rational solutions, avoiding complexities with base e where possible, and keeping the focus on natural logarithms only.\n\n**Deciding on constants for natural log equations**\n\nI'm exploring the balance between using integer constants and using constants in ln form for natural logarithm problems. To maintain pedagogical consistency and avoid complexities with base e, I think it's better to use constants as ln of integers. That way, solutions remain rational or simple without introducing unnecessary approximations.\n\n**Checking valid solutions for log equations**\n\nHmm, the worked example indicates that x = -4 is rejected, but x = 20 is accepted. I thought x = -4 would make the log undefined. It seems they might have used the power rule, converting -2 log2 x into -log2 x^2, which works for x \u2260 0. Still, x must be positive.\n\n**Reevaluating solutions and domain restrictions**\n\nI\u2019m checking the domain and rewriting rules for logarithms. I can\u2019t rewrite -2 log2 x as -log2 x^2 for negative x, since log2 x doesn\u2019t exist for negative values. Both x = -4 and x = 20 don\u2019t work: x = -4 due to log2 x being undefined, and x = 20 due to domain restrictions.\n\n**Reaffirming domain and possible errors**\n\nThe log2 x term is the issue\u2014log2 x is undefined for negative x, so x = -4 is not a valid solution. For x = 20, it's invalid due to the domain restriction (7 - x). They might have considered a mistake or meant log2 x^2, but they likely would've instructed to reject undefined solutions. So, no valid solutions.\n\n**Reviewing equation design and self-practice**\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear if they intended to reject x = -4, since the \"Rej\" placement was confusing. But for the design of our question, we can include both valid and invalid solutions to practice rejection effectively. Let\u2019s check the self-practice 3a, 3b on pages 3-6 for more equation examples.\n\n**Designing similar logarithmic equations**\n\nPage 3 has several examples for finding y in terms of x using logarithms. The questions involve combining log terms with coefficients and constants. To create our own, we should use natural logarithms (ln). For instance, we could try something like \"2 ln y - 2 = 3 ln(x+2)\", where constants like \"-2\" aren\u2019t inside the logarithm.\n\n**Mirroring logarithmic equations and solving**\n\nTo replicate a similar problem, I could use the equation \"2 ln y - 2 = 3 ln(x+2).\" By isolating ln terms and applying logarithmic rules, I arrive at \"y = e (x+2)^(3/2),\" which mirrors the form \"y = 3(x+2)^(3/2)\" but uses e as the base. For the second equation, I solve for y, yielding \"y = ((1 - e^3)/(2 + e^3)) x.\"\n\n**Matching logarithmic constants**\n\nFor the question, replacing the constant 3 with log base 2 of 8 works out nicely, giving a comparable form for the expression. Using ln to convert the constant yields a solution like \"y = -0.7x.\" While they may want nice solutions, including constants like ln 8 can avoid complicating things with e^3.\n\n**Replicating log equations using ln**\n\nFor Self-Practice 3a question 2, we see a variety of log base 3 equations. To replicate these using ln, I can use ln constants like ln 3 or ln 27. For question 2b, converting log base 3 to ln gives a similar solution structure as ln x + ln(x+2) = ln 3, where the solution is x=1.\n\n**Replicating solutions using ln**\n\nFor the equation x(x+2) = 3, the solutions are 1 or -3, but with the domain restriction x > 0, x = 1. To replicate similar problems, I can use ln with constants inside it, ensuring the solutions yield nice integers. Now, moving on to Self-Practice 3b on pages 5-6!\n\n**Reviewing Self-Practice 3b**\n\nFor problem 1, the solution is x = 2/9. For problem 2, x = 0 or 2. And in problem 3, the solutions are x = 10 or x = -2. Now, I'll take a look at page 6 to continue with the exercises and check for any further steps needed.\n\n**Reviewing page 6 and considering ln use**\n\nFor problem 4, the solution is x = -1 (not applicable) or 9. For problem 5, we have x = -3 and y = 1. The challenge here is that part 3 involves mixed log bases, but I need to use natural logarithms (ln). I'll create similar simultaneous equations that incorporate ln, likely with bases like e. Just need to ensure they all follow the ln-only rule.\n\n**Crafting simultaneous equations with ln**\n\nI\u2019m considering including exponentials in the first equation, but I'd prefer both equations to feature ln to meet the \"natural logarithms\" requirement. So, my system might look like this:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\ln(e^{x} \\cdot e^{2y}) = -1 \\\\\n\\ln(y - x) - \\ln 9 = \\ln(x + 4)\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThis ensures ln appears in both equations, though the first one simplifies to x + 2y = -ln5, which might be too simple.\n\n**Using ln relationships in equations**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about using ln(2^x), which simplifies to x ln 2. That\u2019s in line with logarithmic rules and doesn't require change-of-base. As for creating simultaneous equations, I could follow their example and use ln directly, like ln(5^x * 25^y) = ln(0.2). It includes ln, but I\u2019ll ensure to stick with ln-focused equations for consistency.\n\n**Creating ln-based simultaneous equations**\n\nFor part 3, I\u2019ll create two equations using only ln, like ln(x+1) + ln(y-2) = ln(12) and ln(x+1) - ln(y-2) = ln(3). These are ln-only and fine for the task. To replicate their structure, I could consider adding an exponential equation with ln, but it\u2019s not strictly necessary. For the next problem, I\u2019ll use a similar approach to solve with ln.\n\n**Planning 15 ln-based questions**\n\nTo create 15 questions, we'll break it into two sections, following the worksheet style. First, for part 1a-1d, we\u2019ll create 4 problems asking to find y in terms of x using ln. Then, for part 2a-2k, there will be 11 problems solving equations with ln. We\u2019ll ensure all questions involve ln\u2014with no change-of-base\u2014and cover a range of equation types. I'll aim for diversity, including product/quotient forms, ln fractions, and systems. We'll clarify that there are 15 total subparts.\n\n**Creating similar ln-based problems**\n\nTo create original questions based on ln, I'll adjust constants slightly to make them unique but still similar. For example:\n\n1a) 3 ln y - ln 8 = 2 ln(x - 1), leading to y = 2(x-1)^(2/3).  \n1b) ln(x + y) + ln 5 = ln(3x - 2y), solving for y = -(2/7)x with domain conditions.  \n1c) ln y = ln 2 + 4 ln x, giving y = 2x^4.  \n1d) ln(y - 1) = ln 50 - (1/2) ln x, transforming to y = 50/\u221ax + 1.\n\n**Designing ln-based problems**\n\nI'm adapting some equations with natural logarithms that will allow for solutions involving factors or radicals:\n\n2a) ln(x + 4) + ln(x - 1) = ln(3x + 2), solving gives x \u2248 2.449.  \n2b) ln(x) + ln(x + 2) = ln 3, solving gives x = 1.  \n2c) ln(x - 2) = ln 27 - ln(x + 1), leads to a quadratic that isn't factorable, so I'll try another constant like ln 12 or ln 15 to ensure a factorable solution. Still, I may need to test different constants to find one that works.\n\n**Creating new ln-based problems**\n\nFor 2d), I created: 2 ln 3 + ln(x+2) = ln 5 + ln(2x+1). Solving gives x = 13, with the valid domain of x > -2.\n\nFor 2e), ln(1 - 2x) - 2 ln x = ln 10 - ln(2 - 5x) simplifies nicely, solving to x = 2/9, valid as x > 0 and within domain limits.\n\nFor 2f), I reworked ln(x+1) + ln(5-x) = ln6, resulting in solutions x \u2248 0.268 and x \u2248 3.732, both valid.\n\n**Creating variations of logarithmic equations**\n\nI worked through different log equations, ranging from ln(x^2) - ln(2x+5) = ln4 and found solutions like x = 10 and x = -2, which are valid for certain domain restrictions. To construct new problems, I used modified constants, such as ln9 or ln5, and thought through their solvability. The goal is to design problems with integer solutions or meaningful results.\n\n**Creating new equations with neat roots**\n\nI designed a new equation: ln(x^2) - ln(4x + 5) = 0. This simplifies to x = 5 or -1, where both solutions are valid with proper domain restrictions, and the equation is neat with integer roots. I also explored variations, keeping the structure intact and ensuring valid answers for each scenario (e.g., ln((x-1)/(x+2)) = ln 2).\n\n**Creating practice equations with ln**\n\nTo create a balanced set of equations, I\u2019ve crafted questions where the natural logarithm (ln) appears on one or both sides. I want to ensure a mix of both methods: when ln appears on both sides (method 1) and when only one side has ln (method 2). Some equations should have numerical constants for variety as the user requested. Furthermore, I'll add a reminder noting that ln is undefined when its argument is \u2264 0.\n\n**Verifying uniqueness and solvability of problems**\n\nI\u2019m ensuring the set of 15 questions is unique and appropriate for the user\u2019s request, sticking strictly to natural logs (no change of base). I\u2019ve detailed the solvability for each equation, checking for domains and removing any extraneous solutions.

I'll maintain the same style but provide solutions with minimal steps. I'll focus on the key changes and avoid unnecessary extraneous solutions. For Q1(a), it\u2019s about expressing y in terms of x. I\u2019ll adjust for the updated questions and make sure to check each response carefully.\n\n**Solving logarithmic equations systematically**\n\nFor the equations in 5(a) to 5(d), and 9 through 15, I'll treat the domains properly, where each argument of the ln function must be greater than zero. I'll start by solving systematically, step-by-step, ensuring I handle the updating questions (Q11, Q15) and the domain constraints like x>-2 in the first equation while solving.\n\n**Analyzing equation domains and solving step-by-step**\n\nFor the equation 1(b), I analyze the cube root of (x+2) which is defined for all real x. However, since ln(2+x) requires 2+x to be positive, x must be > -2. In the second part, solving for y involves exponentiating and adjusting terms. Considering the domain restrictions, x must be > 0 for valid solutions.\n\n**Continuing with logarithmic equations and domain checks**\n\nFor equation 1(c), I simplified using logarithmic rules and found y = e^2 * x^3, with the domain x > 0. For 1(d), the equation becomes y = e^4 / \u221ax - 1, ensuring that x > 0 for validity, and y+1 remains positive. Moving on to 5(a), I bring in a product rule.\n\n**Solving logarithmic equations with domains**\n\nFor the equation involving ln terms, I simplified and solved to find x = 0 for 5(a). For 5(b), I evaluated the quadratic equation and found x = -1 + sqrt(1+e). Then, for 5(c), I solved x = 3 by checking domains, and for 5(d), x = 13, validated with domains. Moving to 9 next.\n\n**Solving logarithmic equations and checking domains**\n\nFor the equation with ln(x+2) and ln(4-x), I found x \u2248 2/9 after simplifying. Then, in the equation where I solved for x using the quadratic formula, I concluded that two solutions, x \u2248 2.269 and x \u2248 -0.269, are valid. Also, for subsequent equations, I found that x = 10 and x \u2248 12.062 satisfy the domains.\n\n**Solving logarithmic equations and simultaneous equations**\n\nFor the logarithmic equations (13 and 14), the solutions are x = (5 + sqrt(13))/2 and x = 1, respectively, after solving and checking domains. For the simultaneous equations (15), x = -3 and y = 1 are the solutions after substituting values. I'll now update the question list and provide concise steps.\n\n**Revising worksheet questions and providing concise solutions**\n\nI'll provide the 15 questions with any necessary changes and then give concise solutions underneath each one. The key is to maintain the same style and pedagogy as the original worksheet. For each solution, I'll keep the process minimal, such as using direct exponentiation to simplify the steps without too much extra detail. I'll keep everything clear and concise for maximum clarity.\n\n**Updating questions and solutions concisely**\n\nI'll update questions 11 and 15 as requested, and provide concise solutions to all 15 questions.
