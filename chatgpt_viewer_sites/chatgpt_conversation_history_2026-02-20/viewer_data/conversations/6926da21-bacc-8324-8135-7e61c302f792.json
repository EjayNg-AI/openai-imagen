The parenthetical condition in your statement\n  \\[\n  \\exists k_1<k_2\\ \\forall\\varepsilon>0:\\ \n  f\\bigl((a-\\varepsilon,a+\\varepsilon)\\setminus\\{a\\}\\bigr)\\subset (k_1,k_2)\n  \\]\n  is just *local boundedness* near \\(a\\).\n\nFor a general real function, there is a fourth possible type:\n\n- **Infinite-limit discontinuity at \\(a\\)**: \\(|f(x)|\\to\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to a\\) (in some extended-real sense).\n\nYour question (i) is basically: for a bounded function, this last type is impossible, so only the first three remain.\n\n---\n\n## (i) Bounded function: only three types of discontinuity\n\n**Assume:** \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is bounded and is discontinuous at \\(x=a\\).\n\nBecause \\(f\\) is bounded on all of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), there is some \\(M>0\\) with\n\\[\n|f(x)|\\le M \\quad\\text{for all }x\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\nIn general (no boundedness assumption), every discontinuity of a real function falls into exactly one of these four classes:\n\n1. Removable  \n2. Jump  \n3. Infinite-limit (i.e. \\(|f(x)|\\to\\infty\\))  \n4. Oscillatory (function does not approach any finite or infinite limit, but stays bounded in every deleted neighbourhood of the point).\n\nThe \u201cinfinite oscillating\u201d terminology in your statement is just the oscillatory type with explicit mention of boundedness near \\(a\\).\n\nSo the only nontrivial thing to check is: **an infinite-limit discontinuity is impossible for a bounded function.**\n\nSuppose for contradiction that \\(f\\) had an infinite-limit discontinuity at \\(a\\). By definition, say\n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = +\\infty\n\\]\nin the extended-real sense; that is,\n\\[\n\\forall K>0\\ \\exists \\delta>0\\ \\forall x\\ (0<|x-a|<\\delta \\Rightarrow f(x) > K).\n\\]\nTake \\(K := M+1\\), where \\(M\\) is the global bound of \\(f\\). Then the definition says there is \\(\\delta>0\\) such that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), we have\n\\[\nf(x) > M+1.\n\\]\nBut that contradicts \\(|f(x)|\\le M\\).\n\nSimilarly, you cannot have \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=-\\infty\\) or one-sided infinite limits, because all of these would violate the bound \\(|f(x)|\\le M\\) near \\(a\\).\n\nSo **no infinite-limit discontinuity is possible** for a bounded function.\n\nThus, every discontinuity of \\(f\\) at \\(a\\) must be one of:\n\n- removable,\n- jump, or\n- oscillatory while locally bounded (your \u201cinfinite oscillating discontinuity\u201d).\n\nThat proves (i).\n\n> If you want a slightly more structural picture: for a bounded \\(f\\), you can define upper and lower limits near \\(a\\),\n> \\[\n> M(\\varepsilon) = \\sup_{0<|x-a|<\\varepsilon} f(x),\\quad\n> m(\\varepsilon) = \\inf_{0<|x-a|<\\varepsilon} f(x),\n> \\]\n> with \\(M(\\varepsilon)\\) decreasing and \\(m(\\varepsilon)\\) increasing as \\(\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0\\). Their limits\n> \\[\n> M_0 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} M(\\varepsilon),\\quad\n> m_0 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} m(\\varepsilon)\n> \\]\n> are finite. If \\(M_0=m_0\\), the full limit exists; if the value at \\(a\\) differs, it\u2019s removable. If you resolve this one-sided and find distinct left and right limits, you get a jump; if one-sided limits fail while the function stays bounded, that\u2019s the oscillatory case.\n\n---\n\n## (ii) The extension \\(h\\) and vertical asymptotes of \\(g\\)\n\nNow let\n- \\(g:\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{a\\}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\),\n- define \\(h:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) by\n  \\[\n  h(x) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    g(x), & x\\ne a,\\\\\n    0, & x=a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\nAssume:\n\n- \\(h\\) is discontinuous at \\(x=a\\),\n- and that discontinuity is **neither** jump, nor removable, nor infinite oscillating (in the sense of (i): bounded oscillatory).\n\nWe want to show: **then \\(g\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=a\\).**\n\nHere is where definitions matter. There are two common notions:\n\n1. **Strong (limit) definition**:  \n   \\(x=a\\) is a vertical asymptote if\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{x\\to a} g(x) = \\pm\\infty\n   \\]\n   (i.e. for every \\(K>0\\) there exists \\(\\delta>0\\) such that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\Rightarrow |g(x)|>K\\)).\n\n2. **Weak (local unboundedness) definition** (used in many calculus texts):  \n   \\(x=a\\) is a vertical asymptote if \\(g\\) is unbounded in every neighbourhood of \\(a\\), i.e.\n   \\[\n   \\forall K>0 \\ \\forall \\delta>0\\ \\exists x\\ (0<|x-a|<\\delta \\ \\text{and} \\ |g(x)|>K),\n   \\]\n   equivalently, \\(\\limsup_{x\\to a} |g(x)| = +\\infty\\).\n\nYour argument (via (i)) supports **definition 2**. Under definition 1, the statement is false (I\u2019ll give an explicit counterexample below).\n\n### What we can prove cleanly\n\nBecause \\(h\\) is discontinuous at \\(a\\) but *not* of the three types from (i), the contrapositive of (i) tells you the following:\n\n> If a real function is **locally bounded** near a point and has a discontinuity there, then that discontinuity must be of one of the three types: removable, jump, or bounded oscillatory.\n\nSo if \\(h\\) is **not** of those three types at \\(a\\), it **cannot** be locally bounded near \\(a\\).\n\nFormally:  \nFor every \\(k_1<k_2\\) and every \\(\\varepsilon>0\\), there is some\n\\[\nx\\in (a-\\varepsilon,a+\\varepsilon)\\setminus\\{a\\}\n\\]\nwith \\(h(x)\\notin (k_1,k_2)\\). Equivalently, for every \\(K>0\\), every neighbourhood of \\(a\\) contains some point where \\(|h(x)|>K\\).\n\nBut near \\(a\\) and away from the point \\(a\\) itself we have \\(h(x)=g(x)\\). So the same statement holds for \\(g\\):\n\n> For every \\(K>0\\) and every \\(\\delta>0\\), there exists \\(x\\) with \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) and \\(|g(x)|>K\\).\n\nThat is exactly **local unboundedness at \\(a\\)**, i.e. \n\\[\n\\limsup_{x\\to a} |g(x)| = +\\infty.\n\\]\n\n**Under the \u201cweak\u201d definition of vertical asymptote (local unboundedness):**  \nthis is precisely what it means for \\(x=a\\) to be a vertical asymptote of \\(g\\). So with that definition, (ii) is proved.\n\n### Subtlety: if you insist on the strong definition\n\nIf you require the stronger condition \n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to a} g(x) = \\pm\\infty\n\\]\n(i.e. eventually **all** nearby values of \\(g\\) are large in magnitude), then the statement as written is **false**.\n\nCounterexample:\n\n\\[\ng(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{1}{x}, & x\\in\\mathbb{Q},\\ x\\ne 0,\\\\\n0, & x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q},\\ x\\ne 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nDefine \\(h\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) by \\(h(x)=g(x)\\) for \\(x\\ne 0\\), \\(h(0)=0\\).\n\n- \\(h\\) is **unbounded** on every neighbourhood of \\(0\\) because of the rational points and the \\(1/x\\) term; so its discontinuity at \\(0\\) is not removable, not a jump, and not bounded oscillatory.\n- But for every \\(\\delta>0\\), there are plenty of irrational \\(x\\) with \\(0<|x|<\\delta\\) and \\(g(x)=0\\). So there is **no** \\(\\delta>0\\) such that \\(0<|x|<\\delta\\Rightarrow |g(x)|>K\\) even for \\(K=1\\). Thus\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x\\to 0} g(x)\n  \\]\n  does **not** equal \\(\\pm\\infty\\); the function does not tend uniformly to infinity in any punctured neighbourhood.\n\nSo under the strong \u201climit \\(=\\pm\\infty\\)\u201d definition of vertical asymptote, (ii) fails.\n\nUnder the weaker\u2014and very common\u2014\u201cunbounded near \\(a\\)\u201d definition, (ii) is correct and the argument via (i) is exactly what you want:\n\n1. If the discontinuity of \\(h\\) at \\(a\\) were locally bounded it would, by (i), be one of the three types.\n2. We are told it is none of them.\n3. Hence \\(h\\), and therefore \\(g\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{a\\}\\), must be locally unbounded near \\(a\\).\n4. That is precisely \u201c\\(g\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=a\\)\u201d in the local-unboundedness sense.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- (i) For a bounded real function, infinite-limit discontinuities are impossible. So any discontinuity must be:\n  - removable (limit exists but value is wrong),\n  - a jump (distinct finite one-sided limits), or\n  - bounded oscillatory (no finite one-sided limit but values stay within a finite vertical strip).\n\n- (ii) Extending \\(g\\) to \\(h\\) at \\(a\\) and assuming \\(h\\)\u2019s discontinuity at \\(a\\) is not of those three types forces \\(h\\) (and hence \\(g\\)) to be locally unbounded near \\(a\\).  \n  Interpreting \u201cvertical asymptote\u201d as \u201clocally unbounded near \\(a\\)\u201d this proves the claim.  \n  If instead you insist that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} g(x)=\\pm\\infty\\) in the strong sense, you can construct counterexamples, so the statement needs to be weakened accordingly."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"157ebb4f-4a1d-4abb-8c56-a873e7e323b4","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"471f56f9-881a-4ddd-85ef-ee2d515947a7","turn_exchange_id":"9cbb5e2f-dc5e-4e93-b393-c371f154279b","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"471f56f9-881a-4ddd-85ef-ee2d515947a7","children":[]}}}
