May 2024, Anthropic conducted a notable experiment to explore the interpretability of large language models (LLMs), focusing on their AI model, Claude 3 Sonnet.\ue204 \ue203The researchers identified specific \"features\" within Claude's neural network\u2014combinations of neuron activations associated with particular concepts.\ue204 \ue203One such feature corresponded to the Golden Gate Bridge.\ue204 \ue203By artificially amplifying this feature's activation strength, they created a version of Claude that persistently referenced the Golden Gate Bridge, regardless of the conversation's context\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue203This modified model, dubbed \"Golden Gate Claude,\" exhibited behaviors such as:\ue204\ue206\n\n- \ue203Describing itself as the Golden Gate Bridge when asked about its physical form.\ue204\n- \ue203Incorporating references to the bridge in responses to unrelated queries, like suggesting a drive across the bridge when asked how to spend $10.\ue204\n- \ue203Persistently steering conversations back to the bridge, even when prompted to discuss other topics\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue203The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate that specific concepts within an LLM can be isolated and manipulated, affecting the model's behavior in predictable ways.\ue204 \ue203This approach differs from traditional methods like prompt engineering or fine-tuning, offering a more direct means of understanding and controlling AI behavior.\ue204 \ue203Such insights are valuable for enhancing AI safety, enabling the identification and mitigation of undesirable behaviors by adjusting related features within the model\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201.\ue206\n\n\ue203\"Golden Gate Claude\" was available for public interaction for a limited 24-hour period, serving as a demonstration of these interpretability techniques.\ue204 \ue203The experiment highlighted both the potential and the challenges of feature-level manipulation in AI models, marking a step forward in the quest for more
