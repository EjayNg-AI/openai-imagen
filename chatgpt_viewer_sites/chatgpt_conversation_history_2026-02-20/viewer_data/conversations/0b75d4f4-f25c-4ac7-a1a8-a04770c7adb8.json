Here are some top recommendations:\n\n1. **Adobe Acrobat Pro DC**: Adobe offers powerful OCR capabilities and can handle complex layouts like those found in academic papers containing mathematical expressions. It doesn't directly convert to LaTeX but provides highly accurate text extraction that can be further processed.\n\n2. **Mathpix Snip**: Specifically designed for converting images and PDFs of mathematical expressions into LaTeX. Mathpix is highly regarded for its accuracy in recognizing and converting complex mathematical notation. It's an excellent choice if your primary focus is converting mathematical expressions.\n\n3. **InftyReader**: This is an OCR software dedicated to converting scientific documents, including those with complex mathematical expressions, into LaTeX, HTML, and XML formats. It's particularly useful for academic and research purposes where precision in mathematical expressions is crucial.\n\n4. **ABBYY FineReader**: Known for its high accuracy in OCR, ABBYY FineReader can handle multi-language documents and complex layouts. While it doesn't convert directly to LaTeX, its text extraction is precise enough to be used as a first step before converting to LaTeX with other tools.\n\n5. **pdftotext**: Part of the Xpdf software suite, pdftotext is a straightforward command-line tool that is effective for converting simple PDFs to text files. For more complex needs, especially involving LaTeX, you would likely need to couple it with another tool for LaTeX conversion.\n\nFor the highest degree of precision in converting mathematical expressions into LaTeX, **Mathpix Snip** and **InftyReader** are particularly strong choices. They are tailored for academic and scientific texts, ensuring that the complexity of mathematical formulas is accurately captured and converted."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"da1749d7-ed5a-41f4-b8ea-371a4c6746a2","request_id":"87f92bb8c8038350-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"da1749d7-ed5a-41f4-b8ea-371a4c6746a2","children":[]}}}
