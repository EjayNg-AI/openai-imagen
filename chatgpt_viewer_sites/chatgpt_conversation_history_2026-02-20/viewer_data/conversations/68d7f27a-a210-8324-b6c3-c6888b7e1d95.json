If \\(f'(x)\\) exists, **every** way of letting \\(y\\to x\\) gives the same limit; in particular this constrained way does.\n\nThis requires only differentiability of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\) (no continuity assumption on \\(f'\\)).\n\n### 2) Mean Value Theorem (gives a convergence rate under \\(C^1\\))\nFor \\(q\\) near \\(1\\), there exists \\(c\\) between \\(x\\) and \\(qx\\) with\n\\[\nf(qx)-f(x)=f'(c)\\,(qx-x).\n\\]\nHence \\(D_q f(x)=f'(c)\\). If \\(f'\\) is continuous at \\(x\\), then \\(c\\to x\\) as \\(q\\to 1\\) and \\(D_q f(x)\\to f'(x)\\).\n\nIf \\(f\\in C^2\\) near \\(x\\), Taylor\u2019s theorem yields a quantitative error:\n\\[\nD_q f(x)-f'(x)=\\tfrac12 (q-1)x\\,f''(\\xi)\n\\]\nfor some \\(\\xi\\) between \\(x\\) and \\(qx\\). So the error is \\(O(|q-1|\\,|x|)\\).\n\n---\n\n## Caveats and edge cases\n\n- **At \\(x=0\\).** The formula \\((f(q\\cdot 0)-f(0))/((q-1)\\cdot 0)\\) is undefined. Standard practice sets \\(D_q f(0):=f'(0)\\) (if it exists) or defines it by continuous extension \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}D_q f(x)\\) when that limit exists.\n\n- **Existence of the limit vs differentiability.** If the limit \\(\\lim_{q\\to 1}D_q f(x)\\) exists along the multiplicative approach \\(y=qx\\), that **does not by itself** guarantee \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x\\); it\u2019s a limit along a restricted set of \\(y\\)\u2019s. Differentiability requires the difference quotient to have the same limit along **all** sequences \\(y\\to x\\).\n\n- **Sign conventions.** Some texts use \\(\\frac{f(x)-f(qx)}{(1-q)x}\\), which is equivalent. A symmetric version also appears:\n  \\[\n  D_q^{\\mathrm{sym}} f(x)=\\frac{f(q^{1/2}x)-f(q^{-1/2}x)}{(q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2})x},\n  \\]\n  and it too tends to \\(f'(x)\\) as \\(q\\to 1\\).\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual takeaway\n\nThe Jackson derivative is just an **additive difference quotient taken along multiplicative steps** \\(x\\mapsto qx\\). Letting \\(q\\to 1\\) shrinks the multiplicative step \\((q-1)x\\) to \\(0\\), so you recover the ordinary derivative. Your heuristic captures that; the rigorous version is the change of variables \\(y=qx\\) plus the standard definition of \\(f'(x)\\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"wfr_019993604ea27b608b06d16aa3dfc233","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"446078aa-5e47-4860-8579-6f6a4a093396","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"446078aa-5e47-4860-8579-6f6a4a093396","children":["50343c72-40da-4c70-9d3b-267c4b3a1331"]},"50343c72-40da-4c70-9d3b-267c4b3a1331":{"id":"50343c72-40da-4c70-9d3b-267c4b3a1331","message":{"id":"50343c72-40da-4c70-9d3b-267c4b3a1331","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759114809.384,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Is it possible to generalize this to letting y be any continuous function of x?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98683a86fdfe601c-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b2afc42d-6e80-4f06-aee2-f0577de5944e","children":["33818b49-de76-4502-acf5-87486ad44995"]},"33818b49-de76-4502-acf5-87486ad44995":{"id":"33818b49-de76-4502-acf5-87486ad44995","message":{"id":"33818b49-de76-4502-acf5-87486ad44995","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1759114811.842333,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Defining a limit**\n\nI'm examining how continuous functions y(x) can approximate the derivative of f(x) using a one-parameter family of functions y_t(x), with y_1(x) = x, and defining D f(x) as lim_{t->1} (f(y_t(x)) - f(x))/(y_t(x)-x).\n\n**Evaluating product rule**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how the product rule applies to D_y and D_T for various transformation operators, leading to a more general algebraic identity in difference calculus, including the Lie derivative.\n\n**Exploring derivatives**\n\nI\u2019m looking into the T-derivative's behavior in 1D and its product rule and chain rule, which ties into generalized difference calculus and umbral calculus.\n\n**Clarifying conditions**\n\nI\u2019m noting that to define the limit for derivative using any continuous function y(x), a parameterized family y_\u03b5(x) approaching x as \u03b5\u21920 is crucial for mitigating pathological examples and ensuring clear differentiability.\n\n**Clarifying derivative conditions**\n\nI\u2019m noting that differentiability requires the limit to exist for all families y_t(x) approaching x, not just specific monotone sequences, to avoid issues like one-sided derivatives and degenerate cases.\n\n**Connecting concepts**\n\nI\u2019m linking the transformation T(x) with the generalized derivative, considering examples like q-derivatives and conformable derivatives, to illustrate how the limit structure adapts these ideas.\n\n**Clarifying limitations**\n\nI\u2019m noting that using a single continuous function y(x) for the derivative isn't enough;

Then\n\\[\nD_{\\varphi_\\varepsilon}f(x)=\\frac{f(y_\\varepsilon)-f(x)}{y_\\varepsilon-x}\\;\\xrightarrow[\\varepsilon\\to 0]{}\\;f'(x),\n\\]\nbecause this is just the difference quotient along the path \\(y\\to x\\). No smoothness in \\(\\varepsilon\\) is needed; mere convergence \\(y_\\varepsilon\\to x\\) suffices.  \n**Caveat:** if you only look along one *one-sided* path (e.g., always \\(y_\\varepsilon>x\\)), you can get a one-sided derivative at a nondifferentiable point; so existence of this limit along a single family does **not** imply differentiability.\n\n---\n\n## 2) If you fix a single \\(\\varphi\\) (no parameter)\n\nDefine the **\\(\\varphi\\)-difference operator**\n\\[\nD_\\varphi f(x):=\\frac{f(\\varphi(x))-f(x)}{\\varphi(x)-x}\\quad(\\varphi(x)\\neq x).\n\\]\nThis is a perfectly sensible operator; it reduces to familiar cases:\n\n- **Forward difference:** \\(\\varphi(x)=x+h\\) gives \\(D_\\varphi f(x)=\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\).\n- **Jackson (q-)difference:** \\(\\varphi(x)=q x\\) gives \\(D_\\varphi f(x)=\\frac{f(qx)-f(x)}{(q-1)x}\\).\n- **Hahn/Jackson\u2013N\u00f6rlund:** \\(\\varphi(x)=q x+\\omega\\) gives \\(\\frac{f(qx+\\omega)-f(x)}{(q-1)x+\\omega}\\).\n- **(p,q)-difference:** \\(\\varphi(x)=p x\\) but normalize against \\(q x\\): \\(D_{p,q}f(x)=\\frac{f(px)-f(qx)}{(p-q)x}\\).\n\nFor general \\(\\varphi\\), you don\u2019t get a scalar factor on monomials; instead\n\\[\nD_\\varphi(x^n)=\\frac{\\varphi(x)^n-x^n}{\\varphi(x)-x}=\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\varphi(x)^{\\,n-1-k}x^{\\,k}.\n\\]\nSo many of the elegant \\(q\\)-arithmetic simplifications disappear unless \\(\\varphi\\) has special form (affine or multiplicative).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Algebraic structure you *do* keep\n\nEven for arbitrary \\(\\varphi\\), you retain a \u201ctwisted\u201d Leibniz rule:\n\\[\nD_\\varphi(fg)(x)=(D_\\varphi f)(x)\\,g(x)+f(\\varphi(x))\\,(D_\\varphi g)(x).\n\\]\nThis is the hallmark of a **\\(\\sigma\\)-derivation** with \\(\\sigma(f):=f\\circ\\varphi\\). It\u2019s exactly the \\(q\\)-Leibniz rule with \\(qx\\) replaced by \\(\\varphi(x)\\).\n\nA clean \u201cchain rule\u201d generally fails in closed form, but you always have the divided-difference factorization\n\\[\nD_\\varphi(f\\!\\circ\\! g)(x)\n=\\underbrace{\\frac{f(g(\\varphi(x)))-f(g(x))}{g(\\varphi(x))-g(x)}}_{\\text{divided difference of }f\\text{ at }(g(\\varphi(x)),g(x))}\n\\cdot D_\\varphi g(x).\n\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(g(x)\\) and \\(\\varphi_\\varepsilon\\to\\mathrm{id}\\), this tends to \\(f'(g(x))\\,g'(x)\\), as expected.\n\n---\n\n## 4) A more structural generalization: flows and generators\n\nIf you want a *nontrivial* limit that depends on how \\(x\\) is moved, consider a smooth one-parameter family \\(\\varphi_t\\) with \\(\\varphi_0=\\mathrm{id}\\). Two natural \u201cderivatives\u201d are:\n\n- **Input-normalized (secant) derivative:**  \n  \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{t\\to 0}\\frac{f(\\varphi_t(x))-f(x)}{\\varphi_t(x)-x}=f'(x)\\)  \n  (independent of the flow, provided \\(f\\) is differentiable).\n\n- **Parameter-normalized (generator/Lie) derivative:**  \n  \\(\\displaystyle \\mathcal{L}_V f(x):=\\lim_{t\\to 0}\\frac{f(\\varphi_t(x))-f(x)}{t}=f'(x)\\,V(x),\\)  \n  where \\(V(x):=\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0}\\varphi_t(x)\\).  \n  This *does* depend on the chosen flow (e.g., dilation flow gives \\(V(x)=x\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}_V f=x f'(x)\\)).  \n  The Jackson difference corresponds to a finite step along the dilation flow, normalized by the input change rather than by \\(t\\).\n\n---\n\n## 5) Connections you might care about\n\n- **Time scales calculus (Hilger derivative):** unifies difference and differential calculus by using a \u201cforward jump\u201d \\(\\sigma(t)\\). At right-scattered points,  \n  \\(f^\\Delta(t)=\\frac{f(\\sigma(t))-f(t)}{\\sigma(t)-t}\\), i.e., a special case of \\(D_\\varphi\\) with \\(\\varphi=\\sigma\\).\n- **Noncommutative/umbral calculus:** \\(D_\\varphi\\) is a standard example of a \\(\\sigma\\)-derivation used to build skew (Ore) extensions and generalized polynomial calculi.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Practical takeaways (with a critique of the intuition)\n\n- Your intuition \u201creplace \\(x\\) by \\(y(x)\\) and let \\(y(x)\\to x\\)\u201d *is correct* **provided** you view \\(y\\) as part of a family approaching the identity. Then the limit recovers the classical derivative.\n- If you just pick a single continuous \\(\\varphi\\), you haven\u2019t defined a new notion of derivative\u2014only a particular **divided difference** \\(D_\\varphi\\). It\u2019s useful (and has a twisted Leibniz rule), but its value at a point does **not** characterize differentiability.\n- If you want a deformation with rich structure like \\(q\\)-calculus (q-numbers, basic hypergeometric series), you typically restrict to affine or multiplicative \\(\\varphi\\) (e.g., \\(qx+\\omega\\)) so that algebra closes nicely.\n\n---\n\n### Example (nonlinear \\(\\varphi\\))\nLet \\(\\varphi_h(x)=x+h\\sin x\\). Then for \\(f(x)=x^2\\),\n\\[\nD_{\\varphi_h}f(x)=\\frac{(x+h\\sin x)^2-x^2}{h\\sin x}=2x+h\\sin x.\n\\]\nAs \\(h\\to 0\\), this \\(\\to 2x=f'(x)\\) wherever \\(\\sin x\\neq 0\\). At points with \\(\\sin x=0\\) you either define \\(D_{\\varphi_h}f\\) by continuity (limit \\(2x\\)) or handle the removable singularity explicitly\u2014illustrating the fixed-point caveat \\(\\varphi_h(x)=x\\).\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can formalize a **\u201c\\(\\varphi\\)-calculus\u201d cheat sheet**: assumptions on \\(\\varphi\\), product/chain rules, how to define a \\(\\varphi\\)-integral (left inverse), and which choices of \\(\\varphi\\) preserve nice polynomial bases."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"wfr_0199935fc90e7103b2e9cfa60f4c723b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"33818b49-de76-4502-acf5-87486ad44995","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"33818b49-de76-4502-acf5-87486ad44995","children":[]}}}
