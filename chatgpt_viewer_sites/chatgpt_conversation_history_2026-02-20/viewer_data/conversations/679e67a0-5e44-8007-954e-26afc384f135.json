Our present era is no different.\r\nThe emergence of new and disruptive digital \r\ntechnologies is re-ordering social and economic \r\nstructures, and affecting the geopolitical \r\nlandscape. To survive and thrive, Singapore must \r\nbuild up deep digital technology capabilities. \r\nThis is why we launched the Smart Nation \r\nmovement: to improve lives; to make Singapore \r\na great place to live, work and play; and to stay \r\nrelevant and competitive as an economy. \r\nWe have made progress. We are building a \r\ntrusted, nationwide digital identity system using \r\nSingPass Mobile. E-payment is becoming more \r\nprevalent, benefiting businesses and consumers. \r\nGovernment services online are becoming more \r\ncitizen and business-centric. At the backend, \r\nthe Government has been building the basic \r\ndigital infrastructure to share and use data \r\nsecurely, and to rapidly build and deploy \r\ndigital applications and services. \r\nBut we have much more to do. Technology \r\nis constantly evolving. In particular, Artificial \r\nIntelligence (AI) has progressed dramatically, and \r\nwill become a big part of our lives. For example, \r\nAI algorithms can pick out tumours from medical \r\nimages more accurately than doctors. \r\nThey power ride hailing platforms like Grab and \r\nUber. They optimise factory production lines. \r\nThey work in the background of our smart-phone \r\napps, like Apple\u2019s Siri or Spotify.\r\nThe National AI Strategy is a key step in our \r\nSmart Nation journey. It spells out our plans to \r\ndeepen our use of AI technologies to transform \r\nour economy, going beyond just adopting \r\ntechnology, to fundamentally rethinking\r\nbusiness models and making deep changes\r\nto reap productivity gains and create new\r\nareas of growth. \r\nAs a small country, Singapore lacks the scale of \r\nlarge markets and R&D ecosystems. But we can \r\nmake up for this by building up AI research, and \r\nworking together cohesively across Government, \r\nindustry, and research, to develop and deploy\r\nAI solutions in key sectors. At the same time,\r\nwe must also anticipate the social challenges \r\nthat AI will create, by maintaining public trust \r\nand building capabilities to manage and \r\ngovern AI technologies, and guarding against \r\ncybersecurity attacks and breaches to data \r\nprivacy. We are confident that we will succeed \r\nin making Singapore a leading country in AI, and \r\nmore broadly a Smart Nation for our citizens. \r\nLee Hsien Loong\r\nForeword by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore\r\nFOREWORD\r\nThe National AI Strategy is a key step in \r\nour Smart Nation journey. It spells out our \r\nplans to deepen our use of AI technologies \r\nto transform our economy, going beyond \r\njust adopting technology, to fundamentally \r\nrethinking business models and making\r\ndeep changes to reap productivity gains\r\nand create new areas of growth.6 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 7 \r\nSingapore has a unique opportunity to harness digital disruption and propel ourselves onto a new \r\ngrowth trajectory to sustain our future national competitiveness and improve the lives of Singaporeans. \r\nWe have made good progress through our Smart Nation movement, and have put in place the data and \r\ndigital infrastructure to accelerate our whole-of-nation drive to transform our Government, economy, \r\nand society.\r\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next frontier of technological opportunities. Often, the \r\nbottleneck to reaping the full benefits of AI is not in the readiness of the technology, but in our ability \r\nto redesign processes, systems, and regulation to deploy them. Singapore is well-positioned to do this \r\nat a national scale. We have made significant and early investments into AI research and are recognised \r\nas a global thought leader in AI ethics and governance. We are a global hub for digital and AI talent, \r\nwith a vibrant tech startup ecosystem and a highly educated workforce that understands the value and \r\npotential of technology. Most importantly, we are able to bring Government, industry, and researchers \r\ntogether to work together on deploying AI solutions to address key national priorities.\r\nVision\r\nThe National AI Strategy is a living document to place Singapore at the forefront in the development \r\nand deployment of scalable, impactful AI solutions, in sectors of high value and relevance to our \r\ncitizens and businesses. \r\n\u2022 Singapore will be a global hub for developing, test-bedding, deploying, and scaling AI solutions.\r\nThis includes learning how to govern and manage the impact of AI.\r\n\u2022 Government and businesses will use AI to generate economic gains and improve lives. AI will raise \r\nthe Government\u2019s capability to deliver anticipatory and personalised services, and will also be a \r\nstrong driver of growth in key sectors of Singapore\u2019s economy.\r\n\u2022 Singaporeans will understand AI technologies and the benefits it can bring; our workforce will\r\nbe equipped with the necessary competencies to participate in the AI economy.\r\nTo achieve this, we will focus on delivering National AI Projects and strengthening our\r\nAI ecosystem enablers.\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 8 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 9 \r\nBuilding the AI Ecosystem\r\nOur National AI Projects will generate momentum for AI deployment and demonstrate the value of AI. \r\nTo enjoy sustained benefits from AI, we will strengthen ecosystem enablers that drive AI innovation\r\nand adoption across the economy. Our strategy identifies 5 critical ecosystem enablers:\r\n\u2022 Triple Helix Partnership between the Research Community, Industry and Government \u2013 enable \r\nthe rapid commercialisation of fundamental AI research and deployment of AI solutions, through \r\nharnessing stakeholder synergies through collaboration.\r\n\u2022 AI Talent and Education \u2013 address the shortfall in the quantity and quality of talent across the\r\nentire range of AI-related job roles.\r\n\u2022 Data Architecture \u2013 enable quick and secure access to high-quality, cross-sectoral datasets.\r\n\u2022 Progressive and Trusted Environment \u2013 strengthen trust in AI technologies to enable an \r\nenvironment for test-bedding, developing, and deploying AI solutions.\r\n\u2022 International Collaboration \u2013 work with international partners to shape the international\r\nAI discourse and develop the other horizontal enablers.\r\nWorking Together\r\nWe have established a National AI Office under the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office to\r\nset the national agenda for AI and partner the research community and industry to implement the \r\nNational AI Strategy. The National AI Strategy requires a whole-of-nation effort, and we welcome\r\nideas and contributions from individuals and companies to help deliver our AI vision for Singapore.\r\nNational AI Projects\r\nWe will embark on an initial tranche of 5 National AI Projects, to deliver strong social and/or economic \r\nimpact for Singapore and Singaporeans. These projects will guide investment in AI research, generate \r\nlead demand to anchor talent and capabilities in Singapore, and guide how Singapore builds up its \r\nsupporting digital infrastructure. We will continue to identify other high impact National AI Projects\r\nto pursue.\r\n\u2022 Intelligent Freight Planning \u2013 to optimise the movement of freight to improve productivity\r\nfor businesses and traffic efficiency.\r\n\u2022 Seamless and Efficient Municipal Services \u2013 to make municipal services more responsive,\r\nreliable and timely.\r\n\u2022 Chronic Disease Prediction and Management \u2013 to help prevent and better manage chronic diseases.\r\n\u2022 Personalised Education through Adaptive Learning and Assessment \u2013 to help teachers to better \r\ncustomise and improve the learning experience for every student.\r\n\u2022 Border Clearance Operations \u2013 to strengthen border security while improving traveller experience.10 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 11 \r\nWHY A NATIONAL 1 AI STRATEGY? \r\n\u2022 What AI has to offer\r\n\u2022 What we hope to achieve from a National Strategy\r\n\u2022 Why we can succeed12 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 13 \r\nWhat AI has to offer \r\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is the capability to simulate intelligent, human-like behaviour in computers. \r\nThe theory behind many of today\u2019s AI techniques has been around since the 1980s, but advances in \r\ncomputing power have now brought practical applications of AI within reach. \r\nMachine learning, which includes techniques like neural networks and deep learning, has emerged \r\nas the primary enabler of this wave of AI progress. Machine learning algorithms improve their ability \r\nto perform a particular task by learning from data over time. This allows computers to adapt to \r\nunpredictable situations that defy codification by static rules. Such tasks include steering a car\r\nthrough traffic, or conversing with a customer to learn what she wants. On occasion, the computer\r\nmay even adopt a novel solution not previously conceived by humans. \r\nThus, AI is a general purpose technology. It has applicability in any field, ranging from cancer diagnosis \r\nto urban planning and fraud detection. It also has the potential to offer breakthrough solutions that \r\nare incomparably better than existing approaches. \r\nLike the advent of electricity, the potential impact of AI on society, economy, and Government cannot \r\nbe understated. Any nation able to master this technology will be able to create tremendous social\r\nand economic value for its citizens. Societies that cannot adapt will fall behind. \r\nThe rise of applicable, deployable AI represents a golden opportunity for Singapore to open new \r\nfrontiers of growth and transcend our geographical limits. For the nation, AI should transform national\u0002level planning and significantly raise the quality of public goods like transport, education and \r\nhealthcare. For the economy, AI should augment our workforce to raise productivity, and enable us to \r\ncreate valuable products and solutions for the Singapore market and beyond. For our people, AI should \r\nbring about greater convenience, safety and security, and most importantly, improve their lives.\r\nWhat we hope to achieve from a National Strategy\r\nWe need a national strategy to fully harness the benefits of AI. This strategy serves three purposes.\r\nFirst, the strategy identifies areas to focus attention and resources at a national level. Singapore cannot \r\nbe world leading on all fronts, and larger economies will continue to have significant advantages in \r\ncertain fields of AI. We need to be deliberate about choosing where we should build our own world\u0002class capabilities, and where we should tap on the advances made by others.\r\nSecond, the strategy sets out how Government, companies, and researchers can work together to \r\nrealise positive impact from AI. Talent, data, regulation, and effective deployment are key elements \r\nneeded to enable AI applications that serve society. We need a coherent plan that brings these \r\nelements together, across organisational boundaries. \r\nThird, the strategy addresses areas where attention is needed to manage change and/or manage new \r\nforms of risks that arise when AI becomes more pervasive. These include workforce adaptation and\r\nthe governance of decision making by machines. By being proactive in tackling these emerging issues, \r\nwe will be better prepared and more confident as a nation to advance AI technologies. \r\nWhy we can succeed\r\nFirst, we have consistently invested in ICT technologies, beginning with our National Computerisation \r\neffort in the 1980s. In recent years, we embarked on our Smart Nation journey to use digitalisation \r\nto transform our Government, economy and society. The build-up of our digital capabilities and \r\ninfrastructure has given us a running start in developing and deploying AI. \r\nSecond, we have already made significant and early investments into AI, both in the public R&D \r\necosystem and the private sector. We are also a leading nation in AI ethics and governance.\r\nThis provides a good base from which we can anchor world-leading capabilities in various niches\r\nof excellence and build a progressive and trusted environment for AI innovation.\r\nThird and more broadly, we are a small, advanced country with a highly educated population that \r\nunderstands the value and potential of technology. We have the capability to organise and coordinate \r\nwell across public and private institutions, and are able to make practical decisions, as a society,\r\non the adoption of AI for social and economic good. \r\nThese factors should give us a measure of confidence in being able to use AI well to succeed as\r\na nation, even if we are lacking in the sheer size and scale of other economies.14 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 15 \r\nVISION AND \r\n2 APPROACH16 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 17 \r\n3. Strengthen the AI Deployment Loop\r\nThere are three aspects of effective deployment: \r\nAI Deployment Loop\r\nThese three aspects mutually support one another in a virtuous cycle that we label the\r\n\u201cAI deployment loop\u201d. \r\nWithin each of the nine key sectors, we will identify and initiate impactful use cases to start \r\ncollaborative AI projects. We call these the \u201cNational AI Projects\u201d. Through these projects, we intend\r\nto create gains, draw lessons, and progressively tighten the feedback loop between problem definition, \r\ndevelopment/testing and scaling. In this way, we will be able to innovate on AI in cycles that will be \r\nincreasingly shorter. \r\nVISION \r\nBy 2030, Singapore will be a leader in developing and deploying \r\nscalable, impactful AI solutions, in key sectors of high value and \r\nrelevance to our citizens and businesses. \r\nSingaporeans will trust the use of AI in their lives. This confidence is borne out of a clear awareness \r\nof both the benefits and implications of the technology. Our workforce will have the necessary \r\ncompetencies to be part of the AI economy, and our engineers and entrepreneurs will innovate\r\nand create new AI solutions for the local and global markets. \r\nDomestically, our private and public sectors will use AI decisively to generate economic gains and \r\nimprove lives. Internationally, Singapore will be recognised as a global hub in innovating, piloting,\r\ntest-bedding, deploying and scaling AI solutions for impact. \r\nAPPROACH \r\n1. Emphasise deployment\r\nWe will work jointly across public, private and research institutions to enable effective deployment of \r\nAI solutions. The objective of effective deployment will anchor our efforts in R&D, regulatory review, \r\nand capability development. \r\n2. Focus on key sectors\r\nWe will focus on driving AI deployment in key sectors with high social or economic value for Singapore, \r\nand for which we can build on existing strengths.\r\nWe have identified nine such sectors: Transport & Logistics, Manufacturing, Finance, Safety & Security, \r\nCybersecurity, Smart Cities & Estates, Healthcare, Education and Government.\r\n3. Scaling\r\nHow well we can\r\nproductionise and scale\r\nthe tested solutions, and \r\ncontinuously improve them.\r\n2. Development and Testing\r\nHow fast we can design, test, \r\nand prototype AI algorithms \r\nto arrive at solutions\r\nto these problems.\r\n1. Problem Definition\r\nHow well we can identify and \r\nscope problems in Government, \r\nindustry and society, for which\r\nAI can be put to good use.18 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 19 \r\n4. Adopt a human-centric approach\r\nFirst and foremost, we will focus on benefits to citizens and businesses, i.e. getting AI to serve human \r\nneeds, rather than developing the technology for its own sake. This is aligned with our Smart Nation \r\napproach, and our focus on effective deployment in key sectors of high socio-economic value.\r\nSecond, we will be proactive in addressing the risks and governance issues that come with the \r\nincreasing use of AI. In particular, we need to guard against the dilution of our societal and\r\ninstitutional responsibilities and accountabilities towards one another, even as we use AI more \r\nfrequently to automate, detect, and predict. \r\nThird, we will build an AI-ready population and workforce. At the societal level, as part of the \r\noverall promotion of digital literacy, we will raise awareness of AI, so that citizens are prepared for \r\ntechnological change, and are engaged in thinking about AI\u2019s benefits and implications for the nation\u2019s \r\nfuture. At the workforce level, we will prepare our professionals to adapt to new ways of working,\r\nin which workers are augmented by AI capabilities. \r\nA*STAR\u2019s Human-Centric AI R&D programme \r\nCurrently, AI systems often do not understand the context and complex nuances of human \r\ninteractions; and humans do not fully understand why and how decisions are made by\r\nAI systems. \r\nTo advance human-centricity and understanding of AI, the Human-Centric AI Programme,\r\nled by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), brings together research \r\ngroups across Singapore to develop AI technologies that learn like humans, understand\r\nhumans, and can explain their inner workings to humans. \r\nThe team has started to create capabilities that enable robots to understand human interactions \r\nsuch as speech, gestures and touch. The team aims to make robots that can be \u201ctaught\u201d by \r\ninstruction and demonstration. This will allow robots to work collaboratively with humans \r\nwithout the need for specialised infrastructure or dedicated setup. The programme will also \r\nintegrate social sciences, such as psychology and sociology, in the development of AI. This will \r\nallow AI systems to better understand culture and social norms (especially Asian cultures and \r\nnorms) and human intentions. \r\nHuman-Centric AI Programme20 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 21 \r\nSTRATEGY \r\nThe National AI Strategy consists of two components: \r\nNational AI Projects\r\nWe will progressively identify National AI Projects in key sectors of high social and/or economic impact, \r\nand apply the AI deployment loop from problem definition to deployment. These projects will guide \r\ninvestment in AI research, generate lead demand to anchor talent and capabilities in Singapore,\r\nand guide how Singapore builds up its supporting digital infrastructure. \r\nIn Section 3, we have sketched out a portfolio of 5 National AI Projects in the areas of transport\r\nand logistics, smart cities and estates, healthcare, education and safety and security. Beyond these\r\nfive projects, we will continue to identify future projects of similar impact level to pursue within\r\nthe key sectors.\r\nAI Ecosystem Enablers\r\nThe National AI Projects will generate momentum for AI deployment and demonstrate the value of AI. \r\nTo enjoy sustained benefits from AI, we will strengthen ecosystem enablers that drive AI innovation \r\nand adoption across the economy. In Section 4, we explain our plans to build up 5 critical ecosystem \r\nenablers: Triple Helix Partnership, AI Talent and Education, Data Architecture, Progressive and Trusted \r\nEnvironment, and International Collaboration.22 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 23 \r\nNATIONAL 3 AI PROJECTS \r\n\u2022 Intelligent Freight Planning\r\n\u2022 Seamless and Efficient Municipal Services\r\n\u2022 Chronic Disease Prediction and Management\r\n\u2022 Personalised Education through Adaptive Learning \r\nand Assessment\r\n\u2022 Border Clearance Operations24 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 25 \r\nCREATING IMPACT THROUGH\r\nNATIONAL AI PROJECTS\r\nThe 5 National AI Projects address key national challenges for \r\nSingapore in transport and logistics, smart cities and estates, \r\nhealthcare, education, and safety and security. Implementing them \r\nwill require our research institutes, industry, and Government to \r\nwork collectively to develop and deploy AI solutions.26 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 27 \r\nIntelligent routing and scheduling of trucks. \r\nAI could also be deployed to help companies \r\nbetter plan the routing and scheduling of their \r\ntrucks to our ports and container depots, which \r\nwill help to reduce waiting times and localised \r\ntraffic congestion. This will enable companies to \r\nimprove business margins and strengthen their \r\nbusiness competitiveness. It will also create \r\nbetter and higher value-added jobs for\r\nworkers in the industry.\r\nAI-enabled planning and modelling for better \r\nurban planning. Data collected from the \r\necosystem will also enable Government to \r\nconduct data-driven policy reviews and do\r\nbetter urban planning to improve the overall \r\nefficiency of Singapore\u2019s logistics ecosystem.\r\nChallenge\r\nHow can we optimise the movement \r\nof freight to improve productivity for \r\nbusinesses, and traffic efficiency? \r\nMoving freight is a complex operation that \r\ninvolves many players such as port operators, \r\nfreight forwarders, container depot operators, \r\nhauliers and third-party logistics service \r\nproviders. Many processes in this sector are \r\nstill highly manual, and use independently\u0002operated systems that are not connected across \r\nthe different parties in the chain. These result in \r\ninefficiencies in the transportation process and \r\ncongestion around logistics nodes such as our \r\nports and container depots, thus reducing the \r\noverall productivity of our trucks and drivers. \r\nObjective\r\nSeamless and efficient freight \r\nmovement, more productive \r\ncompanies and workers.\r\nWe aim to create a freight movement ecosystem \r\nwhere key parties leverage AI to share \r\ninformation and collaborate in an integrated \r\nmanner, to enable more efficient freight and \r\ntruck movement across Singapore. \r\nPooling and dynamic assignment of trucking \r\njobs. Through the digitalisation of assets and the \r\nuse of AI, jobs could potentially be pooled and \r\ndynamically assigned to trucks to ensure that \r\ntrips are revenue generating both ways, instead \r\nof one-way. This would make each truck trip \r\nmore productive, and improve asset utilisation \r\nand driver productivity for companies. \r\n1. INTELLIGENT\r\nFREIGHT PLANNING\r\nKey Benefits\r\n\u2022 Businesses increase revenue through \r\nimproving asset utilisation and job sharing.\r\n\u2022 In-house transport planners are trained\r\nto use digital solutions to do smarter \r\ntransport planning.\r\n\u2022 Truck drivers can be more productive with\r\nless time spent waiting to complete a job.\r\n\u2022 Businesses and the public benefit from\r\nless traffic congestion and a more efficient \r\ndomestic logistics ecosystem.\r\nOur First Steps\r\nWe will need to strengthen data flows and \r\nconnectivity between parties in the ecosystem, \r\nto create a foundation upon which to build \r\nintelligent applications. We will explore building \r\na common and trusted data exchange platform \r\nto facilitate planning and optimisation of\r\ntruck trips.\r\nWe will focus our initial efforts on piloting and \r\ndeploying AI applications that facilitate planning \r\nand optimisation of truck trips to and from the \r\nsea gateway. In the longer term, we will scale \r\nthe deployment of intelligent freight planning \r\nsolutions to our air and land gateways.\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\nRoute Planning & Schedule\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n128 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 29 \r\nChallenge\r\nHow can municipal services be \r\ndelivered to residents in a more \r\nresponsive, reliable and timely \r\nmanner? \r\nMunicipal services are an essential part of daily \r\nlife. From cleaning public spaces to maintaining \r\nroads and footpaths, 10 Government agencies \r\nand 16 Town Councils work tirelessly to ensure \r\nthat Singapore residents enjoy a high\u00b9 standard \r\nof municipal services. \r\nSeveral of these services are high-volume and \r\nresource-intensive. While residents today help \r\nby informing us of municipal issues they face, \r\nwe also need to undertake more pre-emptive \r\ninspections with the limited workforce we \r\nhave, and better plan our living environment to \r\nprevent issues from arising in the first place.\r\n\u00b9 More than 75% of residents are satisfied with the \r\ndelivery of municipal services (Source: Municipal \r\nServices Survey 2018, conducted by the Municipal \r\nServices Office).\r\n2. SEAMLESS AND EFFICIENT\r\nMUNICIPAL SERVICES\r\nAt times, residents might find it challenging to \r\nprovide agencies with sufficient information to \r\nfollow up on their feedback. This lengthens the \r\ntime taken to resolve the more than 1 million \r\nfeedback cases that agencies receive each year. \r\nThere is scope to employ AI to guide residents \r\nalong the feedback process and eventually \r\nshorten case resolution time. \r\nObjective\r\nMore responsive, reliable, and timely \r\nneighbourhood services.\r\nTell us once, just the way you see it. Residents \r\ncan report issues seamlessly, without the need \r\nto worry about which agency to report their \r\nfeedback to, or how to describe the issue.\r\nAn AI-powered chatbot can guide them along \r\nand get to the heart of the issue. \r\nBetter-maintained estates. Sensors and \r\nAI algorithms can be deployed in the \r\nneighbourhood, such as in lifts, to alert us to \r\nwould-be faults before they occur, and help \r\nus pre-emptively address issues to minimise \r\ninconvenience to residents.\r\nWorking with residents to improve the living \r\nenvironment. AI can help us better understand \r\nhow our residents, their families and the \r\ncommunity are using various neighbourhood \r\nfacilities. With this knowledge, we can then\r\nwork towards the planning and building of \r\nfacilities that best serve residents\u2019 needs.\r\nKey Benefits\r\n\u2022 Residents can report municipal issues more \r\nefficiently and seamlessly.\r\n\u2022 Resident can enjoy better-maintained estates, \r\nand more reliable municipal infrastructure \r\nand services without having to report them.\r\n\u2022 Residents will enjoy facilities that will better \r\nserve their needs. \r\nOur First Steps\r\nWe will start with an AI-powered chatbot to \r\nguide residents when they report an issue.\r\nThe chatbot will identify the correct agency to \r\ndirect the issue to. It will also prompt residents \r\nfor mandatory case details in real-time, thereby \r\nminimising the need for agencies to call them \r\nback for additional case information. 30 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 31 \r\nClinical decision support for primary care \r\ndoctors. AI can be used to support primary \r\ncare doctors and care teams in developing \r\npersonalised care plans that take into account \r\na patient\u2019s risk profile. As each care team may \r\nlook after a large number of patients, AI can also \r\nassist in monitoring the progress of patients, \r\nand alert care teams to patients whose progress \r\nshow cause for concern so that timely action\r\ncan be taken.\r\nEmpower patients to better manage their \r\nchronic diseases. AI can make it easier for \r\npatients to self-manage their conditions. \r\nPatients can use AI to monitor their health \r\nstatus, and receive timely reminders to eat \r\nhealthily, increase physical activities, take\r\ntheir medication and report for check-ups. \r\nChallenge\r\nHow can we help prevent and better \r\nmanage chronic diseases such as \r\ndiabetes, high blood pressure and \r\nhigh cholesterol, to reduce the risk \r\nof complications like heart disease, \r\nstroke and kidney failure?\r\nMany Singaporeans have chronic diseases \r\nsuch as diabetes, hypertension and high blood \r\ncholesterol. They may be unaware that they\r\nhave these conditions as the symptoms may\r\nnot be noticeable early on. If not well controlled, \r\nthese diseases can lead to serious complications \r\nsuch as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and\r\neven death. \r\n3. CHRONIC DISEASE\r\nPREDICTION AND MANAGEMENT\r\nObjective\r\nBetter control over chronic diseases \r\nsuch as diabetes, hypertension and \r\nhigh blood cholesterol.\r\nPersonalised risk score for chronic diseases.\r\nAI can be used to analyse clinical data, medical \r\nimages, health behaviours and genomic data to \r\ncreate a personalised risk score for individuals. \r\nThis score can help individuals to take \r\nappropriate preventive measures as well\r\nas receive earlier and more targeted \r\ninterventions from their care teams. \r\nKey Benefits\r\n\u2022 Singaporeans will enjoy improved health \r\noutcomes, and will be empowered to better \r\nself-manage chronic diseases.\r\n\u2022 Patients at higher risk of complications \r\nare identified earlier and provided with more \r\nintensive management and monitoring in the \r\nprimary care setting, to reduce the likelihood \r\nof medical complications.\r\n\u2022 Healthcare providers will be more productive \r\nand can better help patients control chronic \r\ndisease conditions.\r\nOur First Steps\r\nWe will deploy the Singapore Eye LEsioN Analyser \r\n(SELENA+), which analyses retinal photographs \r\nusing a Deep Learning System to detect 3 major \r\neye conditions: diabetic eye disease, glaucoma \r\nand age-related macular degeneration. SELENA+ \r\ncan analyse retinal photographs as accurately \r\nand faster than human graders. This increases \r\nthe productivity of human graders by up to\r\n70 per cent, and allows them to dedicate more \r\ntime to patients with complex cases. SELENA+\u2019s \r\ncapabilities in analysing retinal images will \r\nalso be extended to develop a predictive risk \r\nassessment model for cardiovascular disease. \r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n5\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n6\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n6\r\n1\r\n3\r\n5\r\n7\r\nRISK S CORE\r\n3\r\n5\r\nPA TIEN T_ 01 93 132 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 33 \r\nChallenge\r\nHow can we help teachers to better \r\ncustomise and improve the learning \r\nexperience for every student, \r\nparticularly those with learning \r\ndifficulties? \r\nDifferent students have different learning needs, \r\nstarting points and aptitudes for different \r\nsubjects. They also have different strengths \r\nand interests. There is also a limit to how much \r\nteachers can customise the learning experience \r\nor provide continuous and detailed feedback for \r\nevery student. Routine tasks also take up time \r\nthat teachers could use to value-add to students\u2019 \r\nlearning experiences. \r\n4. PERSONALISED EDUCATION THROUGH\r\nADAPTIVE LEARNING AND ASSESSMENT\r\nObjective\r\nMore personalised learning and \r\nassessment for every student.\r\nWe will leverage AI through the Singapore \r\nStudent Learning Space (SLS), an online learning \r\nplatform for all students and teachers in the \r\nnational school system, launched in May 2018. \r\nStudents\u2019 learning experiences with the SLS \r\nwill be enhanced by an AI-enabled Adaptive \r\nLearning System. The adaptive learning system \r\nwill use machine learning to enable it to tell how \r\neach student responds to learning materials \r\nand activities, and to recommend a step-by-step \r\npathway customised for each learner. \r\nTeachers will be able to assess students\u2019\r\nwork more efficiently and effectively with\r\nan AI-enabled Automated Marking System.\r\nThe automated marking system will be able to \r\nassess open-ended student responses such as \r\nshort-answer response questions and essays, \r\nand provide quick feedback to students\u2019 work.\r\nWe will also support students\u2019 holistic \r\ndevelopment through an AI Learning Companion\r\nthat could motivate the student, keeping her \r\nengaged during challenging tasks, help the \r\nstudent reflect on her learning experience,\r\nand recommend further learning activities.\r\nKey Benefits\r\n\u2022 Students will have a more personalised \r\nlearning experience, tailored to their \r\nindividual strengths and weaknesses. \r\n\u2022 Teachers will spend less time on routine \r\nassessment tasks, and can guide students\u2019 \r\nlearning more effectively through data\u0002driven insights.\r\n\u2022 In the long run, students of diverse learning \r\nneeds, as well as low-progress learners,\r\nwill be better supported, raising their \r\nachievement level.\r\nOur First Steps\r\nWe will pilot an AI-enabled automated marking \r\nsystem for English Language with selected \r\nprimary and secondary schools in 2020.\r\nWe will also trial the adaptive learning system \r\nthrough the SLS for specific topics in the \r\nMathematics curriculum, starting with upper \r\nprimary and lower secondary levels. We will \r\nconduct a pilot with selected schools by 2022. 34 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 35 \r\nChallenge\r\nHow do we continue to strengthen \r\nborder security while improving \r\ntraveller experience? \r\nThe demand for secure and efficient immigration \r\nclearance is expected to grow amidst the \r\nheightened security climate and the anticipated \r\nincrease in global travel and commerce. However, \r\nincreasing security often comes at a price; from \r\ninvasive body searches, to long queues\r\nat immigration checkpoints.\r\nSingapore has long been a destination for \r\nbusiness and leisure travel and a popular \r\nembarkation point for those wanting to explore \r\nthe rest of Asia. To maintain Singapore\u2019s image \r\nas a welcoming and safe tourism and business \r\ndestination, we need to continue to provide \r\na fast and hassle-free immigration clearance \r\nexperience for all our travellers, without \r\ncompromising security. This will be especially \r\nchallenging amidst our tightening resident \r\nlabour force and space constraints.\r\n5. BORDER CLEARANCE\r\nOPERATIONS\r\nObjective\r\n100% automated immigration \r\nclearance for all travellers.\r\nWe aim to deploy AI to achieve 100% automated \r\nimmigration clearance for all travellers, including \r\nfirst-time social visitors. Singaporeans and \r\ndeparting visitors will experience \u201cBreeze\u0002Through\u201d immigration clearance, without\r\nthe need to present their passports.\r\nEven though our border security will be \r\nenhanced, for most travellers, these security \r\nmeasures will work quietly in the background, \r\nenabling them to experience the convenience\r\nof hassle-free international travel.\r\nKey Benefits\r\n\u2022 Singaporeans and visitors will be empowered \r\nto process their own clearance through the \r\nautomated immigration facilities, and enjoy a \r\nfaster and more seamless travel experience.\r\n\u2022 Singaporeans will enjoy greater safety\r\nand security through our strengthened\r\nborder security. \r\n\u2022 Immigration officers will achieve productivity \r\ngains and can focus on higher value work. \r\nOur First Steps\r\nSingapore will explore using AI to assist \r\nimmigration officers in evaluating the risk \r\nprofile of travellers before they arrive at our \r\ncheckpoints, and to tier the level of security \r\nscreening accordingly. To enable this, we will \r\ncollect and analyse data from various sources, \r\nincluding the Singapore Arrival Cards submitted \r\nby travellers and advance passenger information \r\nfrom airlines. We will also study how to redesign \r\nour immigration clearance process to enable \r\nall travellers to enjoy secure and seamless \r\nimmigration clearance experience via\r\nautomated clearance facilities.36 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 37 38 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 39 \r\nBUILDING THE 4 AI ECOSYSTEM\r\n\u2022 Triple Helix Partnership between the Research \r\nCommunity, Industry and Government\r\n\u2022 AI Talent and Education\r\n\u2022 Data Architecture\r\n\u2022 Progressive and Trusted Environment\r\n\u2022 International Collaboration40 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 41 \r\nEven as Singapore embarks on National AI Projects,\r\nwe must build a vibrant and sustainable AI ecosystem\r\nto anchor AI innovation and adoption across the economy.\r\nWe have identified five ecosystem enablers:\r\nTHE ECOSYSTEM ENABLERS42 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 43 \r\nAI Singapore \u2013 Singapore\u2019s national programme for AI \r\nEstablished by the National Research Foundation in 2017, AI Singapore (AISG) is a national \r\nprogramme for AI that brings together Singapore researchers and companies to jointly develop \r\ninnovative AI solutions and grow a pipeline of AI talent for industry. AISG\u2019s work is anchored on\r\n3 key pillars: AI Research, AI Technology, and AI Innovation. \r\nAI Research aims to build deep AI research capabilities in Singapore, invent the \r\nnext generation of AI techniques/algorithms and position Singapore as a key \r\nplayer on the global stage. \r\nAI Technology seeks to create significant economic and social impact by tackling \r\nnational or global challenges using AI. AISG\u2019s first Grand Challenge, launched in \r\nJune 2018, was in healthcare. \r\nAI Innovation focuses on accelerating industry\u2019s adoption of AI technology \r\nthrough projects and talent development. Its programmes include the\r\n100 Experiments Programme and the AI Apprenticeship Programme.\r\nTRIPLE HELIX PARTNERSHIP\r\n\u2013 Research Community, Industry and Government \r\nThe research community, industry, and Government play important, interconnected roles to enable the \r\ndevelopment and deployment of AI solutions. It is critical for Singapore to enhance partnerships across \r\nthese stakeholders to strengthen our collective capabilities and drive our overall national AI effort.\r\nKey Thrust 1.1 Deepen investments in AI-related R&D across the\r\nresearch ecosystem\r\nSingapore has built substantive AI R&D capabilities from our early investments. In 2019, Singapore \r\nranked first in the world based on the impact of our AI scientific publications, according to Elsevier \r\nSciVal. Four of the ten most promising young AI researchers ranked by the Institute of Electrical\r\nand Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2018 are based in Singapore.\r\nWe have already committed over S$500m for AI-related research, innovation and enterprise activities \r\nunder the RIE2020 Plan, and will invest more going forward. Singapore will build on our strengths\r\nin AI R&D and continue to maintain a portfolio of AI R&D investments. This portfolio balances\r\n(a) game-changing fundamental research; (b) research that enables more widespread adoption of AI \r\n(e.g., explainable AI, \u201cdata-lite\u201d AI, collaborative and human-centered AI, and digital trust technologies); \r\nand (c) applied research targeted at the needs of the nine key sectors. \r\nAccess to supercomputing infrastructure will also be an important driver of fundamental AI research. \r\nOver the next 5 years, Singapore will be investing S$200m to upgrade both our supercomputing \r\ncapability and network speed and quality. This will raise our supercomputing resources from 1 petaflop \r\nto 15-20 petaflops, to support high-end compute performance needs. Specifically for AI, the enhanced \r\nsupercomputing platform will support the development and training of new AI algorithms and models. \r\nECOSYSTEM ENABLER 1 44 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 45 \r\niii) Reproducibility \u2013 to enable others to reproduce the same output from AI models.\r\niv) Realism \u2013 to introduce a human element into AI.\r\nv) Responsibility \u2013 to build ethics and ethnics into AI and AI for benefiting society. \r\n3. What is your favourite part about conducting AI research in Singapore?\r\nFirst, there are many existing digital systems in Singapore that generate significant amounts \r\nof data. This provides opportunities for researchers to customise AI algorithms to analyse \r\nthe variety of datasets, develop human-centric AI models, test-bed and optimise them,\r\nso that solutions may be quickly adapted by companies. \r\nSecond, Singapore has also set up tech platforms that bring together a consortia of partners \r\nfrom different parts of the value chain where system level integration is required. This allows \r\nresearchers to collaborate with industry on effective implementation of AI systems.\r\nThird, as a small but well-connected digital nation with a heterogeneous population, \r\nSingapore presents vast opportunities for researchers to leverage our datasets and develop \r\nalgorithms that contribute towards Smart Nation, Healthcare, Finance and Insurance,\r\nand many other areas that are critical for Singapore\u2019s economy and society. \r\nProf Ong Yew Soon \u2013 AI researcher in Singapore\r\nProf Ong Yew Soon is President\u2019s Chair Professor of Computer Science at the School of Computer \r\nScience and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, and the Chief AI \r\nScientist at A*STAR. \r\nProf Ong\u2019s contributions have helped propel NTU to be one of the leading computer science and \r\nengineering departments globally, especially in AI research.\u00b2 He founded the Data Science and \r\nArtificial Intelligence Research Centre (DSAIR) at NTU. Prof Ong also established the first cognitive \r\n& AI corporate lab in Singapore \u2212 the S$42.4 million Singtel Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence \r\nLab for Enterprises (SCALE@NTU), where he currently serves as Director.\r\nWe interviewed him to find out more about his life as an AI researcher:\r\n1. What made you decide to become an AI researcher?\r\nI did my postgraduate study at the University of Southampton under the BAE-Rolls Royce \r\nUniversity Technology Partnership research scholar programme. There, I became really \r\ncurious about which were the most suitable optimisation solvers or algorithms for designing \r\ndifferent forms of aircraft wing structures. This led to my PhD topic on \u201cArtificial Intelligence \r\nTechnologies in Complex Engineering Design\u201d, which explored and investigated state-of the\u0002art AI techniques to uncover new insights about optimisation solvers. \r\n2. What is something exciting that you are researching now? \r\nOne of my coolest work has been developing IntelliK, an AI platform that enables creative \r\npeople to develop AI-powered digital games and gamified Apps without any programming \r\nskills. More broadly, my research interest is now in AI Research for Society, which looks at how \r\nAI can contribute towards sustainability as well as supporting people with special needs. \r\nThere are five unique cornerstones, or AI.Rs, of AI Research for Society: \r\ni) Rationalisability \u2013 to interpret and logically explain the workings on deep neural\r\n network models.\r\nii) Resilience \u2013 to be able to retain high predictive accuracy for AI models even in the\r\n face of adversarial attacks.\r\n\u00b2 NTU was ranked 1st in Asia for Computer Science and Engineering by the Academic Ranking of World \r\nUniversities, 4th by the US News Global University Ranking and listed as one of the Top 3 universities in\r\nAI research globally by The World University Ranking.\r\nProf Ong Yew Soon designed IntelliK to create AI-powered digital games and\r\ngamified Apps without the need to know coding.46 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 47 \r\nIMDA-SUTD Partnership in Smart Estates\r\nTo support our Built Environment sectoral transformation efforts under the Smart Estates \r\nInitiative, Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Singapore University of \r\nTechnology and Design (SUTD) are launching a new research-industry-Government collaboration \r\nto leverage AI applications to achieve greater effectiveness and efficiency in designing and \r\nmanaging Smart Estates in Singapore and the region.\r\nApplications of AI in Smart Estates could provide benefits such as manpower and cost savings\r\nin estate management, improved urban sustainability, and better planning and design.\r\nThere are already ongoing trials to use AI to improve estate management:\r\n1. Energy and utility management, fault detection, and predictive maintenance for\r\nbuilding facilities.\r\n2. Automated surveillance monitoring and detection of safety and security.\r\n3. Unmanned retail concept store offering personalised shopping experience.\r\nThe IMDA-SUTD partnership will further advance Smart Estates development through\r\na multi-faceted effort over the next 2 years:\r\nKey Thrust 1.2 Drive partnerships between the research community\r\nand industry\r\nResearch collaborations with industry will enable the research community to sharpen their focus \r\non societal/market needs and gain access to relevant data. Industry also benefits from research \r\ninnovations that they can incorporate into their products and services, and from access to the pipeline \r\nof research talent. Such public-private partnerships can also support the commercialisation of\r\nAI technologies.\r\nWe have made a good start in driving partnerships between research and industry. There are currently \r\nmore than 15 AI public-private partnerships and joint labs in Singapore. We will continue to attract and \r\nanchor AI R&D and product teams from leading global and local technology companies in Singapore, \r\nand encourage them to partner with our research institutions and Institutes of Higher Learning to \r\nestablish joint labs and invest in training programs. \r\nSingtel-NTU AI Lab \r\nSingtel has partnered with NTU and the National Research Foundation (NRF) to establish \r\nthe Singtel Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Lab for Enterprises (SCALE@NTU) to develop \r\napplications for use in the areas of public safety, smart urban infrastructure, transportation, \r\nhealthcare and manufacturing. Under the collaboration, Singtel\u2019s subsidiary NCS has developed \r\nnext-generation products & platforms to tackle the challenges faced by cities. These include \r\ninnovations in the areas of advanced machine learning and AI algorithms for intelligent \r\ntransport, IoT, robotics, computer vision and audio analytics. \r\nOne key development is in the area of multimodal sensation with vision and speech intelligence \r\nto understand customer behaviour & emotion and to assist human-machine interaction.\r\nOur research and development in deep learning technologies have been applied to robotics and \r\nIoT capabilities for dynamic optimisation and planning. For the healthcare industry, a potential \r\napplication would include non-invasive tracking and monitoring of patients and their vital \r\nsigns. In the case of Smart Urban Infrastructure industries, the work focuses on applying edge \r\nintelligence through visual and video analytics for a safer and more effective workplace.\r\nThese capabilities have been pursued in various Proof of Concepts to bring across the\r\nbenefits to our customers.\r\nWe will bring together \r\nestate owners, technology \r\nproviders, and researchers \r\nto co-develop innovative \r\nAI applications, with \r\nco-funding support from \r\nIMDA, with the aim of \r\nscaling up deployment \r\nlocally and overseas.\r\nWe will work with data \r\nowners to pilot AI toolsets \r\nthrough a Data Lake \r\nfor Smart Estates.

This requires investing in \r\ndigital infrastructure and engineering capabilities, as well as fostering an innovative culture. To assist \r\ncompanies in doing so, Singapore will make more resources available for them to adopt AI solutions \r\nand develop AI-related applications:\r\n\u2022 Industry digital transformation and AI deployment plans. As part of the SMEs Go Digital programme, \r\nSMEs can leverage the sector-specific Industry Digital Plans, which provide a step-by-step guide on \r\nthe digital solutions to adopt at each stage of a company\u2019s growth. The programme aims to curate \r\nmore AI-enabled solutions to benefit businesses in various industries as they embark on their\r\ndigital transformation journey. \r\n\u2022 AI Singapore\u2019s 100 Experiments programme. The 100 Experiments (100E) programme supports \r\ncompanies in deploying AI in a co-investment model by providing them with access to talent from \r\nAISG\u2019s AI Apprenticeship Programme. AISG has undertaken more than 38 AI projects with company \r\npartners, of which 10 have had AI deployed into production.\r\n\u2022 The AI Makerspace is a new national platform developed by AI Singapore to support SMEs and \r\nstart-ups to jumpstart their AI journey. It provides access to resources for AI experimentation such\r\nas off-the-shelf, pre-built AI solutions (\u2018Bricks\u2019), curated datasets from industry and Government, \r\ncutting-edge AI libraries and tools, and supercomputing resources. AI Makerspace will also aim to \r\ngrow local companies to be able to deliver these solutions to our SMEs over the next 2\u22123 years. \r\nAI Makerspace50 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 51 \r\n\u2022 Accreditation@SGDigital and SG:D Spark programmes help companies identify and engage quality \r\nSingapore-based AI solution providers and start-ups. These programmes give buyers the assurance \r\nof reliable digital and AI solutions when working with these companies and startups, allowing for\r\na more streamlined approach to integrating digital solutions. At the same time, both the \r\nAccreditation@SGD and SG:D Spark programmes help grow and scale promising and innovative \r\nSingapore-based startups and companies. \r\n\u2022 Through the Tech Depot on SME Portal, local SMEs can access \u201cReady-to-Go\u201d AI solutions developed \r\nby A*STAR to enhance their productivity and expand their business. Companies can also gain access \r\nto a broader range of AI expertise in A*STAR to grow their own AI capabilities by leveraging A*STAR\u2019s \r\nT-UP programme. \r\n\u2022 IMDA\u2019s Digital Services Lab provides a suite of tools to help companies develop AI solutions and \r\nleverage AI technologies. This includes the National Speech Corpus and the Intelligent Sensing \r\nToolbox. This suite of tools, developed to address the needs in the services sectors, is continually \r\nbeing expanded and is made easily accessible for companies through platforms such as the\r\nAI Makerspace. \r\nFrom 100 Experiments to Scaling Startups\r\nAutomatic Assessment of Chronic Wounds in Diabetic and Elderly Patients\r\nChronic wounds are a common clinical problem in hospitals. AI Singapore worked with a local \r\nstart-up, KroniKare, to develop a Computer Vision system on an AI-driven mobile and web \r\nplatform to capture, analyse and diagnose chronic wound conditions. This enables healthcare \r\ninstitutions to better triage patients and allocate resources for wound management, resulting\r\nin improved patient outcomes in terms of early detection and faster intervention for major \r\nwound complications.\r\nFollowing the successful Proof of Concept study with AI Singapore, Integrated Health Information \r\nSystems (IHiS) facilitated the scaling, validation, regulatory approval, and planned deployment \r\nof Kronikare\u2019s solution. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) provided scientific and regulatory \r\nadvice and the device underwent HSA\u2019s priority review scheme to obtain regulatory approval.\r\nKronikare has now deployed its scanner in St Andrew\u2019s Community Hospital and a nursing home \r\nat Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital. It has also completed operational trials at Changi General Hospital \r\nwith promising results. IHiS continues to work with companies like Kronikare to support the \r\nintegration of the results into the clinical Electronic Medical Record systems.\r\nA nurse can use KroniKare Wound Scanner to\r\ncapture an image of the wound for full assessment \r\nand documentation under 30 seconds at a patient\u2019s \r\nbedside.\r\nUploaded data vectors are automatically \r\ncompiled into medical reports for monitoring \r\nwound progress and prioritising serious \r\ncases using a tablet.52 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 53 \r\nDC Frontiers \u2013 a local SG:D Accredited AI company\r\nDC Frontiers Pte Ltd is a local SG:D Accredited data analytics and AI technology startup.\r\nFounded in 2011, DC Frontiers offers a suite of corporate intelligence solutions to give \r\norganisations greater visibility over risks.\r\nTheir award-winning Machine Learning technology is known as Handshakes SEER.

A key initiative is the Punggol Digital District, a living test bed for \r\ndeploying and integrating new technologies into the everyday lives of citizens. \r\nPunggol Digital District (PDD)\r\nA greenfield project developed and masterplanned by JTC Corporation, PDD offers the \r\nopportunity to fundamentally review how technology can transform what it means to work, \r\nlearn, live and play in a smart district. It will showcase concepts on future living, and provide \r\ncompanies opportunities for test-bedding technologies such as AI.\r\nPDD will house an Open Digital Platform that will integrate various technology verticals including \r\nfacilities management systems, district cooling system, autonomous goods delivery systems, \r\nand security systems. The data gathered from the platform can be used by companies to test\u0002bed new innovations and district managers to provide personalised and anticipatory services, \r\nand deliver energy and manpower savings by optimising operations and resource consumption \r\nwithin the district. \r\nThe co-location of the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and JTC Business Park will \r\nfacilitate close collaboration between the digital industry and academia. \r\nArtist\u2019s impression of PDD54 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 55 \r\nECOSYSTEM ENABLER 2 \r\nAI TALENT AND EDUCATION\r\nTalent is both the foundation of, and critical bottleneck for, realising Singapore\u2019s AI vision. We need\r\na range of multidisciplinary talent (AI, digital, business domain) to develop and deploy AI solutions\r\nto the key sectors:\r\n\u2022 Research and Development \u2013 AI researchers/scientists with relevant industry or corporate\r\nresearch and development experience;\r\n\u2022 Data Engineering \u2013 Data engineers/technicians with experience in using data to continually\r\ndevelop and improve AI solutions;\r\n\u2022 Product Development \u2013 AI engineers/translators/developers who can design and build\r\nuser-centric products to drive large-scale adoption; and\r\n\u2022 Implementation \u2013 Application developers, infrastructure engineers/developers and systems \r\nintegrators with experience in building and operating large-scale machine learning systems.\r\nSingapore will track the supply and demand of AI talent and manpower to identify shortfalls and guide \r\nmanpower strategy and talent initiatives. We will also make a concerted push to strengthen AI training \r\nfor Singaporeans and attract AI talent to Singapore. \r\nKey Thrust 2.1 Train more Singaporeans for high-quality AI jobs\r\nSingapore will establish more local talent pipelines to increase the quantity and quality of our AI \r\nworkforce in the longer-term. We will do so by creating AI conversion programmes and corporate\u0002backed AI academies to upskill the latent pool of STEM and digital workers into higher-value\r\nAI-related job roles.\r\n\u2022 Post-graduate Scholarships. The Singapore Government currently works with companies such as \r\nAlibaba, Nvidia, Sensetime, and Grab to provide full-time postgraduate students with industry\u0002relevant training in preparation for R&D roles in industry. We will establish more of such \r\npartnerships to train more AI PhDs with industry experience.\r\n\u2022 AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP). The AIAP is a full-time 9-month programme by AI Singapore to \r\ngroom AI engineers for industry. Apprentices will work on real-world industry projects, from scoping \r\nproblem statements to deploying models. AI Singapore has produced 60 engineers to date, and \r\nplans to train up to 500 Singaporean AI engineers over the next 5 years.\r\n\u2022 TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) offers various programmes to support ICT and non-ICT professionals\r\nto upgrade and acquire new skills for the digital economy. \r\n\u2212 TeSA collaborates with companies on job placement programmes, where fresh and mid-level \r\n professionals will undergo structured learning courses and on-the-job training to acquire skills \r\n and competencies in AI.\r\n\u2212 To support conversion of non-ICT professionals and upskilling of tech professionals, TeSA \r\n supports full-time bootcamp or mentorship & coaching opportunities offered by global education \r\n providers and established academic institutions.\r\n\u2212 For tech professionals who aspire to upskill/reskill through short-form training, TeSA also funds \r\n professional development courses in AI.\r\n\u2212 Underpinning these programmes is the Skills Framework for ICT, a reference guide of in-demand \r\n job roles and their required skills, to help individuals and employers plan career pathways and \r\n facilitate hiring. The framework will be updated with AI-related skills and job roles.\r\n\u2022 To further help Singaporeans understand the fundamentals and applications of AI, be it in their \r\nworkplace or daily lives, SkillsFuture Singapore has partnered with major technology partners, to \r\nenhance the SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme with the inclusion of relevant AI content.56 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 57 \r\nShirlene Liew \u2013 an AI Apprentice\u2019s journey\r\nA mechanical engineer by training, Shirlene worked on science policy and industry development \r\nin a Government agency after graduation. She first encountered data analytics when she \r\nfurthered her studies in healthcare systems and operations. That was when she became \r\nproficient in the programming language R, and also picked up some Python. She took 2 years off \r\nto be a full-time mother after the birth of her daughter, and chanced upon the AI apprenticeship \r\nprogramme from AI Singapore\u2019s website when she was ready to re-enter the workforce.\r\nUnder the AI Apprenticeship Programme, Shirlene had the opportunity to work for a health-tech \r\nclient and helped to develop models for fraud detection in healthcare images. Although there \r\nwere times when she found the AI equations and concepts to be daunting, her personal interest \r\nin healthcare, and the supportive learning environment in the apprenticeship programme, \r\nhelped her through the challenges and made her journey a positive experience.\r\nShirlene believes that to grow in a field, it is important to be part of a community, and keeps in \r\ntouch with her peers. She now works as a product manager with a data security AI start-up. \r\nGoh Yong Liang \u2013 a Grab post-graduate scholar \r\nThe Grab-NUS AI lab was officially launched on 18 July 2018 to develop and nurture local AI talent. \r\nNUS post-doctoral research scientists and PhD students can work with Grab\u2019s data and apply \r\ntheir AI expertise to create smart urban transportation solutions for Singapore and Southeast \r\nAsia. Grab has since successfully recruited 5 AI PhD graduates from the NUS School of computing \r\nand Institute of Data Science.\r\nGoh Yong Liang joined Grab in 2019 under the post-graduate scholarship programme. \r\nWe interviewed him to find out why he chose to pursue an AI PhD.\r\n1. Why are you interested in AI?\r\nWith the increased footfall of digital services, companies are starting to collect more high\u0002quality data. AI, to me, is a tool to create standalone digital products, and I hope to acquire \r\nthe knowledge to build them.\r\n2. What made you decide to pursue a PhD in AI, and how does this link to your career \r\naspirations?\r\nWhile working as a data scientist for three and a half years, I was constantly looking for \r\navenues to further my technical knowledge. The Grab post-graduate scholarship opportunity \r\ncame up and this felt like a great opportunity to invest my time in work that could have\r\nmajor impact. I felt that to effectively lead a technical team, I first have to establish a strong \r\nfoundation in the field, and a PhD offers that opportunity.\r\n 3. Why did you choose an industry post-graduate \r\n programme instead of an academic PhD programme? \r\n I chose the industry post-graduate scholarship as it \r\n allowed me to work on problems that are relevant to \r\n industry. At the same time, I have always aspired to \r\n translate research work to tangible products, and the \r\n programme enabled this.58 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 59 \r\nKey Thrust 2.2 Teach basic computing skills and computational thinking to all\r\nAs AI becomes more accessible and prevalent, Singapore will need to develop AI-ready individuals \r\nwho can understand and apply AI in their respective domains. We will layer the teaching of computer \r\nscience across all learners\u2019 journeys, with the aim of developing \u201cbilingual individuals\u201d who can \r\napply computer science and AI concepts in their respective domains. Students should learn basic \r\nfoundational concepts to spark their interest in AI at an early age. Later on, they should develop\r\nbasic AI competencies and literacy, and have further opportunities to deep-dive into AI applications \r\nduring higher education.\r\n\u2022 Develop AI-ready graduates. We will encourage our Institutes of Higher Learning to introduce \r\ndomain-specific AI courses, to ensure that our undergraduates understand how to apply AI\r\nto their areas of expertise and are able to leverage AI tools in their work.\r\n\u2022 AI for Industry. We will train 25,000 professionals in basic AI coding and implementation by 2025.\r\n\u2022 AI for Everyone, AI for Kids and AI for Students. We will scale AI literacy courses to 100,000 adult \r\nSingaporeans and school-going children by 2025. \r\nKey Thrust 2.3 Attract top-tier global AI talent\r\nIn addition to grooming our local talent pool, Singapore must remain open to top-tier AI talent\r\nfrom around the world. These talents will help bring cutting-edge technology to Singapore, develop\r\nour local capabilities by mentoring budding AI researchers and engineers, and grow our global\r\ntalent networks. \r\n\u2022 Tech@SG Programme for Technology Companies. The Economic Development Board (EDB) and \r\nEnterprise Singapore (ESG) will pilot a programme with fast-growing technology companies to \r\nfacilitate Employment Pass applications for their core team members, which may include \r\nprofessionals equipped with deep technical skills in frontier areas such as AI. This will help \r\ncompanies tap on skilled global talent to strengthen their tech capabilities and scale quickly.\r\nSkillsFuture Singapore partners IBM Singapore to train AI talent \r\nOn 4 Oct 2019, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) announced a partnership with IBM Singapore\r\nto launch a suite of programmes in AI. The programmes will help our workers build deep\r\nknowledge and capabilities in AI and boost the implementation of relevant AI solutions\r\nwithin local enterprises. \r\nIBM is one of the first major technology partners to deliver industry-led AI training programmes \r\nfor Singaporeans. Through this partnership, IBM and SSG aim to train 2,500 Singaporeans in AI \r\nand emerging skills within the next three years. The focus will be on helping individuals apply \r\nand contribute to their work-related projects with the most up-to-date AI resources\r\nand networks.\r\nSSG and IBM have also incorporated AI content into the curriculum of the SkillsFuture for\r\nDigital Workplace programme. This will help Singaporeans understand the fundamentals\r\nof AI technology, and how they can apply AI in their workplaces and daily lives.60 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 61 \r\nECOSYSTEM ENABLER 3 \r\nDATA ARCHITECTURE\r\nData is the foundation that anchors AI collaboration between Government, industry, and research. \r\nDespite Singapore\u2019s small size, we have natural comparative advantages in data. We can leverage our \r\nunique common identifiers to curate rich, cross-sectoral datasets. Our heterogeneous, multi-ethnic \r\npopulation gives us an edge in developing exportable AI solutions in sectors such as healthcare, \r\nbecause AI algorithms trained on Singapore\u2019s population could potentially be scalable across Asia.\r\nSingapore\u2019s key value proposition to global companies and talent lies in our ability to provide timely \r\nand secure access to rich, high quality datasets. We must manage our data as strategic national assets \r\nand establish an ecosystem to acquire, clean, fuse, and distribute data across the public and private \r\nsectors. At the same time, we must proactively build institutional capabilities to manage and govern \r\ndata, to protect against cyberattacks, safeguard our citizens\u2019 data privacy, and ensure that data is used \r\nfor the public good. We will continually study industry and global best practices to identify new and \r\ninnovative ways of safeguarding data, while facilitating its effective usage. This will include enhancing \r\nour policies, legislation, technical safeguards, and organisational structures, as well as keeping abreast \r\nof and adopting frontier data security technologies. \r\nWe will begin by consolidating the data assets required for each of the National AI Projects, and put in \r\nplace the necessary data sharing frameworks and legislation to enable companies to share and exploit \r\ndata securely.\r\nKey Thrust 3.1 Establish frameworks for public-private data collaboration\r\nWe will enhance our regulatory and policy frameworks to provide greater clarity on the scope, \r\ngovernance, and technical safeguards for data sharing across the public and private sectors.\r\nThis will encourage organisations to share and use data more pervasively for legitimate use cases,\r\nand help anchor public-private data collaboration and innovation. \r\n\u2022 Private Sector Data Sharing Framework. IMDA has published the Trusted Data Sharing Framework\r\nto guide companies in establishing data sharing partnerships with each other. The Framework \r\narticulates the key legal, regulatory, and technical considerations and safeguards that each \r\norganisation should take into account, and provides sample legal clauses and templates to\r\ndraft data sharing agreements.\r\nTrusted Data Sharing Framework62 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 63 \r\n\u2022 Public-Private Data Sharing Framework. As the nation\u2019s custodian of personal and administrative \r\ndata, the Government holds a data resource that many companies find valuable. The Government \r\ncan help drive cross-sectoral data sharing and innovation by curating, cleaning, and providing \r\nthe private sector with access to Government datasets. The envisaged Public-Private Data Sharing \r\nFramework will facilitate the sharing of Government data with non-Government entities (NGEs) and \r\nkey commercial partners, by defining the scope, type, granularity, and safeguards (people, process, \r\nand technical) of Government data that can be shared with the private sector. As a start, we will work \r\nclosely with the domain agency leads to develop this Framework to support the implementation of \r\nthe National AI Projects. We will develop a similar framework for NGEs and companies to share\r\ndata with Government agencies.\r\nKey Thrust 3.2 Establish trusted data intermediaries for public-private\r\ndata exchange \r\nThe Government will identify organisations to serve as trusted data intermediaries for data fusion and \r\ndistribution. These trusted entities could be situated in either the private or public sector, depending \r\non the sector, type of data, and where the majority of data are sited. \r\n\u2022 Define and promulgate common data standards to ensure data interoperability. To facilitate data \r\nfusion, the Government will work with companies in key sectors to define and promulgate a set of \r\ncommon data standards for the sector (e.g. standards for health records across restructured \r\nhospitals, private GPs and research institutes). \r\n\u2022 Curate and publish a meta-data catalogue of public-private datasets required to implement the \r\nNational AI Projects. We will also work with the trusted data intermediaries to define common data \r\nstandard and technical safeguards to anonymise, secure, and provide companies and researchers \r\nwith access to these data. This will help facilitate data discovery and anchor data and AI \r\ncollaboration between Government agencies, industry, and researchers.\r\nGovernment Data Architecture (GDA)\r\nIn June 2018, Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation and Digital Government Office launched a Government \r\nData Strategy that sets out action plans to manage data as a strategic asset and deepen the \r\nGovernment\u2019s use of data by 2023. \r\nThe GDA is a key thrust of the Government Data Strategy, and aims to enable secure data sharing \r\nbetween Government agencies within 7 working days. It is centred on the Government putting in \r\nplace the organisational structures, technical systems, and processes and capabilities to manage \r\nand use data across its lifecycle, from problem statement definition to exploitation.\r\nThe Government has done a stocktake of its data assets and identified an initial tranche of core \r\ndatasets that are highly relevant for policy, planning, operations, and service delivery. It has \r\nestablished common definitions and standards and assigned agencies to serve as Single Sources \r\nof Truth to maintain, clean, and distribute these core Government datasets. It has also organised \r\nthese core data assets around four Trusted Centres (Individuals, Businesses, Geospatial, and \r\nSensors), which are tasked with fusing and distributing these datasets. In addition, it has built\r\ncentral digital infrastructure for public officers to securely use data and protect the identity\r\nof individuals while leveraging analytics to improve policies and services. Vault.Gov.SG is a\r\none-stop shopping portal for discovering and requesting access to core Government datasets, \r\nand Analytics.Gov.SG provides a secure virtual environment with commonly-used tools for\r\ndata analytics. \r\nThe GDA will be operationalised in phases, beginning from Oct 2019. At the same time, we are \r\nalso preparing for the future, to extend the use of data as a strategic asset at the national level \r\nand to apply digital technologies such as AI to enrich the value of our data assets.\r\nOverview of Government Data Architecture64 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 65 \r\nECOSYSTEM ENABLER 4 \r\nPROGRESSIVE AND\r\nTRUSTED ENVIRONMENT\r\nSingapore\u2019s governance and regulatory regime must strike the right balance between fostering \r\ntechnology and business innovation, while safeguarding citizens\u2019 interests.\r\nKey Thrust 4.1 Establish citizens\u2019 trust on the responsible use of AI \r\nSingapore has established an industry-led Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data.\r\nThe Council advises the Government on issues arising from the commercial deployment of AI that\r\nmay require policy or regulatory attention, and industry on the responsible development and \r\ndeployment of AI. \r\nIn January 2019, Singapore published Asia\u2019s first Model AI Governance Framework that provides\r\ndetailed and readily implementable guidance to private sector organisations to address key ethical\r\nand governance issues when deploying AI solutions. \r\nAs AI developments move beyond the confines of a research lab into our daily life, Singapore must \r\nguide and shape how AI will interact with citizens, institutions and society. We will:\r\n\u2022 develop sector-specific AI governance frameworks, including codes of practice and professional \r\ncodes of conduct for different sectors and application contexts;\r\n\u2022 curate technical solutions that enable explainable AI that industry can use to augment their\r\nAI models;\r\n\u2022 develop training and certification in AI ethics and governance for professionals managing AI \r\nsolutions and implementing AI projects, which will be overseen by Singapore Computer Society\u2019s \r\nnewly formed AI Ethics and Governance Steering Committee; and\r\n\u2022 publish assessment guides for organisations to assess the alignment of their AI governance \r\nprocesses with the Model AI Governance Framework.\r\nSingapore will also apply multidisciplinary and human-centered approaches to study the systemic \r\nrisks and long-term impact of AI, and develop potential solutions to address them. Risk assessment \r\nin AI development should not be narrowly confined to the engineering disciplines, but also include \r\nsociologists, ethicists, economists, lawyers and policy makers. Today, Singapore\u2019s universities are \r\nactively studying the societal implications of AI, and we will tap on their expertise. \r\n\u2022 The Singapore Management University\u2019s Centre for AI and Data Governance will explore potential \r\noptions to address longer-term issues as AI becomes more pervasive.\r\n\u2022 The Singapore University of Technology and Design\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities\r\nis collaborating with local think-tank Live with AI and AI company DataRobot to research AI\u2019s\r\nimpact on jobs. \r\nSingapore\u2019s balanced approach to AI ethics and governance has attracted international attention. \r\nSingapore has been invited to take part in influential international fora such as the Organisation for \r\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Expert Group on AI and the European Commission\u2019s \r\nHigh-Level Expert Group on AI. In April 2019, Singapore\u2019s work on AI Governance and Ethics won the\r\ntop award at the prestigious World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Prizes in the category\r\nof \u201cEthical Dimensions of the Information Society\u201d. In November 2019, Singapore was invited to\r\npresent its human-centric approach to AI at the Paris Peace Forum. 66 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 67 \r\nVeritas \u2013 an implementation framework for AI governance in the\r\nfinance sector\r\nArtificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) driven decisions, without proper governance\r\nand accountability structures, may potentially erode the fabric of financial services. For these \r\nreasons, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) worked with the financial industry to\r\nco-create a set of principles to guide the responsible use of AIDA in financial services.\r\nCentred around trust, the principles consist of four key pillars \u2013 Fairness, Ethics, Accountability \r\nand Transparency (FEAT) and were released in 2018. The principles have established a standard \r\nacross the financial sector in Singapore and various jurisdictions have adopted similar principles \r\nto guide the adoption of AIDA.\r\nNevertheless, the practical implementation of the FEAT principles remains challenging for the \r\nindustry. This is to be expected \u2013 translating philosophical concepts into mathematical and \r\nscientific language is a daunting exercise. These challenges have curtailed the adoption of\r\nAIDA in the industry. To overcome these challenges and accelerate AIDA adoption in the\r\nfinancial industry, MAS is collaborating with multiple parties to create a standardised\r\nmodular implementation framework of the FEAT principles, called Veritas. \r\nWe envisage that Veritas will comprise tools for institutions to validate their models against the \r\nFEAT principles. Veritas will be applicable to different business lines, different principles as well \r\nas differing regulatory and legal regimes. The goal is to produce the world\u2019s first framework that \r\nfinancial institutions can use to evaluate their governance of AIDA.\r\nSMU\u2019s Centre for AI and Data Governance \r\nThe Research Programme on Governance of AI and Data Use was setup at Singapore Management \r\nUniversity (SMU) School of Law in 2018 with funding for S$4.5m over five years. It complements \r\nother technical R&D initiatives in Singapore and aims to achieve the following: \r\n1. Promote cutting edge thinking and practices in AI and data policies and regulations;\r\n2. Inform AI and data policy and regulation formulation in Singapore through research \r\npublications and stakeholder engagement activities; and\r\n3. Establish Singapore as the global thought leader in AI and data policies and regulations.\r\nThe research agenda for the initial 5 years includes:\r\n1. AI & Society: Understand issues that bear on most members of the public, such as attitudes \r\ntowards AI and data protection.\r\n2. AI & Business: Examine issues relevant to the corporate sector as a whole, such as\r\nintellectual property and trade.\r\n3. AI in Specific Industries: Focus on three specific domains, namely autonomous vehicles, \r\ndispute resolution, and the financial industry.\r\nIMDA supports the Research Programme by engaging local and international stakeholders\r\nto partner the Centre to conduct industry-relevant research on AI ethics and governance.\r\nOn 24 September 2018, Singapore Management University launched the Centre for AI and\r\nData Governance (CAIDG).

Its 2019 report covers 3 pillars: (i) AI & Work; (ii) AI & Healthcare; \r\nand (iii) AI & Society.\r\nAI & WORK\r\nIn 2019 the Live with AI community, in partnership with the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative \r\nCities and DataRobot, researched the impact AI has on multiple tasks within jobs, in order to \r\nbetter understand the workforce disruption and potential scenarios which may happen\r\nin different industries. The findings were as follows:\r\n1. AI won\u2019t simply replace Humans \r\nThe AI revolution will not only create jobs for computer specialists. Thanks to the principle\r\nof comparative advantage, AI-enhanced human roles will emerge as well. \r\n2. AI and Work: Equal to the Task \r\nAI disrupts jobs task by task and not job by job. All workers can take advantage of this\r\nto disrupt disruption. We can use tasks to better track technology impact, chart clearer \r\npathways between jobs, and improve work prospects for people. \r\n3. How to Work with AI: Strengthening your\r\nHuman Skills \r\nTo get prepared for the AI revolution,\r\nemployees must focus on enhancing\r\ntheir innately human skills. \r\n4. Automation Needs You to Think More about\r\nHumans, Not Less\r\nTaking into account the \u201chuman cause\u201d in an\r\nautomation journey means augmenting a task\r\nthat satisfies the worker, not replacing it.\r\nKey Thrust 4.2 Provide a top-class IP regime and accelerated patent initiatives \r\nfor AI\r\nAI companies seeking to grow and expand internationally will need to develop a clear intangible asset \r\n(IA) and intellectual property (IP) strategy. To support companies, the Intellectual Property Office of \r\nSingapore (IPOS) has launched a new enterprise engagement arm, IPOS International, to provide\r\nthem with customised IA solutions and programmes.\r\nWe will review Singapore\u2019s IP legislation to ensure that our laws support the development and \r\ncommercialisation of new AI technologies. Having clear legislation will provide certainty for AI \r\ninnovators in commercialising new products and services. \r\nIPOS has also introduced the Accelerated Initiative for Artificial Intelligence (AI\u00b2), the world\u2019s fastest \r\npatent-acceleration programme\u00b3 that grants applicants an AI patent within six months. A new ASPEC\u0002AIM (Acceleration for Industry 4.0 Infrastructure and Manufacturing) initiative by the ASEAN IP offices \r\nalso allows applicants to fast-track patent applications for key emerging technologies in the region.\r\n\u00b3 Average pendency times between first office action and final decision range between 9.2mths to 95.1mth.\r\nSource: WIPO World Intellectual Property Indicators 2018\r\nStrengthen Your Human Skills70 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 71 \r\nAlibaba granted AI patent within three months\r\nIn June 2019, IPOS received an application for an AI invention by Alibaba Group Holdings Limited \r\n(Alibaba) via its online application portal (IP2SG), which included a separate application for \r\neligibility under the AI\u00b2 scheme. The application fulfilled the requisite conditions under the \r\nscheme and was eligible for fast-track examination. The assigned patent examiner conducted \r\nextensive global searches to ensure the patentability of the AI invention. Given the well-drafted \r\npatent specification, the examiner was able to issue a positive search and examination report, \r\nsubsequently leading to the expedited grant of the patent within three months.\r\nComplementing Singapore\u2019s efforts in supporting enterprises to accelerate their go-to-market \r\nstrategy, Dr Benjamin Bai, Vice President and Chief IP Counsel of Ant Financial, Alibaba said: \r\n\u201cCompanies looking to implement AI solutions globally have grown exponentially. Against this \r\nbackdrop, the speed at which a patent can be granted is critical. Singapore plays a pivotal role\r\nas it facilitates our entry into markets of our interest rapidly. We applaud the efficiency and \r\nspeed of Singapore\u2019s IP office, and look forward to filing more patent applications in Singapore \r\nunder this initiative.\u201d\r\nMs Sharmaine Wu, Director, Registries of Patents, Designs and Plant Varieties,\r\nIPOS presents the patent grant certificate to Dr Benjamin Bai, Vice President and\r\nChief IP Counsel, Ant Financial, Alibaba.\r\nECOSYSTEM ENABLER 5\r\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\r\nInternational collaboration is essential for driving sustainable development of AI. Singapore has \r\na meaningful role to play to support this global effort. We will continue to be an open and neutral \r\nplatform where international researchers and businesses can work together. \r\nKey Thrust 5.1 Contribute to global standards for AI-related policies\r\nand guidelines\r\nSingapore will strive to be a useful contributor and thought leader in setting AI-related policies and \r\nstandards. We will collaborate with influential industry advocates to apply these principles in industry, \r\nand work closely with key international organisations and standard-setting organisations such as the \r\nWorld Economic Forum (WEF), the OECD, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO),\r\nand the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to participate in the standards setting and \r\nnorm-shaping processes actively. 72 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 73 \r\nCollaboration with the WEF on the Model AI Governance Framework\r\nSingapore collaborated with the WEF Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) to \r\nenhance the Model AI Governance Framework and to promote its adoption. To this end,\r\nthe C4IR has been conducting industry workshops in San Francisco to solicit input, feedback,\r\nand obtain use cases from companies within its network. \r\nThe output of these workshops will be incorporated into the Model AI Governance Framework\r\nto provide organisations implementing AI solutions useful examples and practices on \r\nresponsible use of AI.\r\nModel AI Governance workshop conducted in San Francisco with 40+ CTOs\r\nand tech leaders from around the world on 1 August 2019 in collaboration with\r\nWorld Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\r\nKey Thrust 5.2 Collaborate on multi-national AI projects\r\nMany AI projects during their testing phase will need to test their products internationally for \r\nexternal validation; Singapore can play a role in bringing together an international network\r\nof multi-site test beds for AI solutions, starting with the 5 National AI Projects. \r\nInternational Collaboration in AI research by AI Singapore\r\nAI Singapore has established ties with many countries to catalyse joint AI research pursuits. \r\nAn example is the AI partnership between Singapore and France, which aims to advance \r\ninnovation and research in areas of mutual interest to achieve world-class scientific and \r\ntechnical results, leading to new and innovative technologies. In July 2018, AI Singapore, the \r\nFrench Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), the French National \r\nCentre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and the French Institute of Health and Medical Research \r\n(INSERM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on research collaboration in five focus areas: \r\nAI in Healthcare, Explainable AI, Federated and Distributed Learning, Natural Language Processing \r\nand Privacy, Trust & Accountability in AI and Data Sharing.\r\nThe MOU on AI cooperation was signed in July 2018 in the presence of Singapore\u2019s \r\nMinister for Trade and Industry Mr Chan Chun Sing, France\u2019s Minister for Higher \r\nEducation, Research and Innovation Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vidal, Deputy Chief of Mission, \r\nEmbassy of Singapore in Paris Karen Ong, CEO of Inserm Yves Levy, CEO of INRIA \r\nBruno Sportisse and CEO of CNRS Antoine Petit. 74 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 75 \r\nWORKING\r\n5 TOGETHER 76 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 77 \r\nORGANISING OURSELVES FOR \r\nSUSTAINABLE SUCCESS\r\nWe have established a National AI Office under the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office.\r\nThe National AI Office will set the national agenda for AI and catalyse efforts across research, industry, \r\nand Government stakeholders to work on national AI priorities. \r\nThe National AI Strategy requires a whole-of-nation effort, with Singaporeans, businesses, researchers \r\nand the Government working closely together. Singapore will also need to work with international \r\npartners to advance the deployment of AI in Singapore. \r\n1. National AI Projects. We have announced a first tranche of five National AI Projects centred on key \r\nchallenges. We invite researchers, companies, and individuals to propose solutions, or to suggest \r\nnew National AI Projects. \r\n2. Transform your business with AI. No matter the size of your company, you can begin your AI\r\n transformation journey today by building up your technological capabilities and digital \r\ninfrastructure. There are many avenues where companies can receive support from the Government. \r\nIf you are a company that is already adopting AI, take part in data sharing initiatives to promote \r\ngreater use of AI, and contribute to a trusted environment by adopting AI governance initiatives. \r\n3. Participate in Singapore\u2019s AI ecosystem. As we transform our key sectors through AI, there will\r\nbe an abundance of opportunities for businesses to research, develop and deploy AI solutions\r\nin Singapore for the region. Both local and international investors can consider establishing an\r\nAI team in Singapore, and leveraging Singapore\u2019s research ecosystem to enhance and validate\r\nnew AI methodologies. \r\n4. Learn about AI. Given that AI can be applied to any field, it will be important for workers to \r\nunderstand how AI can be applied in their respective domains. Find out about the opportunities\r\nfor you to learn the skills necessary to participate in the AI economy. \r\nFor more information on how to be involved in the National AI Strategy, visit go.gov.sg/AIStrategy\r\nConclusion\r\nWe will develop and implement the National AI Strategy iteratively, to respond to the rapidly changing \r\ntechnology landscape and to seize new opportunities. The 5 National AI Projects and 5 ecosystem \r\nenablers are but a first step in our multi-year AI journey. We will continue to embark on more National \r\nAI Projects and adjust the enablers as we learn through implementation. This is a whole-of-nation \r\neffort, and we welcome ideas and action from individuals and companies to help deliver our AI vision \r\nfor Singapore. Let us work together to build a Smart Nation, to improve lives and make Singapore an \r\noutstanding place to live, work and play.78 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 79 \r\nWHAT THE\r\n6 EXPERTS SAY80 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 81 \r\nWHAT THE EXPERTS SAY\r\n Mr Andreas Ebert\r\n Worldwide National Technology Officer, Microsoft Corporation\r\nWith computers capable of understanding humans for the first time, the world is at an inflection\r\npoint \u2212 with implications extending beyond technology into economy and national development. \r\nAlready a global thought leader on AI ethics and governance, the publication of the National\r\nAI Strategy is evidence that Singapore is taking a holistic and inclusive approach on how the nation \r\ncan be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology that is empowered by a focus on building national \r\ncapabilities. When you underpin all of these with trust, through Singapore\u2019s Trusted Data Sharing \r\nFramework and international digital economy agreements, this geographically little island nation is \r\nexcellently positioned to play a leading role in facilitating cross border data flows that will realize\r\nAI applications and services to improve people\u2019s lives and local businesses. Microsoft is committed \r\nto the success of Singapore\u2019s AI and data journey, and we look forward to contributing to the \r\nimplementation of the Strategy.\r\n Dr Andrew Ng\r\n CEO and Founder, Landing AI\r\nThe world has caught on to the power of artificial intelligence, but we have still barely scratched\r\nthe surface. To move the world forward, we will need millions more AI engineers. We also need to \r\neducate our leaders across government, businesses and academia so they can build AI solutions\r\nthat bring positive change to their communities.\r\nHaving grown up in Singapore, I\u2019ve seen firsthand its excellent educational system, which gives \r\nstudents a strong foundation in math and science, as well as its international connections and ability \r\nto attract ideas and talent from around the world. Singapore already has a strong foundation on top \r\nof which to build AI. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy outlines several important, actionable \r\nsteps that build on these strengths. These include:\r\n\u2022 Thoughtful regulations. Singapore has an opportunity to enact thoughtful regulations that\r\nallow for innovation and experimentation while protecting citizens\u2019 safety. Sound regulations \r\nempower Singaporean AI engineers to work on cutting-edge problems that can immediately\r\nbenefit their community.\r\n\u2022 Human-centric approach. Singapore is simultaneously training talent to work on major technological \r\ndevelopments and investing resources in retraining and education programs. Building social \r\nprograms and technology in parallel, Singapore can prepare its citizens for changes and transitions \r\nin an AI-powered future. \r\n\u2022 Sectoral transformation. Singapore\u2019s AI Strategy focuses on several use cases that can immediately \r\nbenefit the nation. These use cases \u2212 spanning healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, security, \r\neducation and more \u2212 will merge Singapore\u2019s engineering talent together with real companies\r\nin order to develop more impactful real-world solutions.\r\nSilicon Valley and Beijing have been global leaders in AI research and developing AI-first startups. \r\nBut Singapore\u2019s vision lies in becoming a leader in developing and deploying scalable, impactful \r\nAI solutions in key sectors by 2030. I commend Singapore for leading the way in globalizing and \r\ndemocratizing the next wave of artificial intelligence. \r\nSingapore has all the pieces needed to become a regional AI hub. To everyone working on\r\nbuilding this vision, I say: Majulah Singapura! \r\n Professor Ho Teck Hua\r\n Executive Chairman, AI Singapore\r\n Senior Deputy President and Provost, and Tan Chin Tuan Centennial Professor, \r\n National University of Singapore\r\nThe Singapore government has always been deliberate in envisioning, planning, and executing\r\nits Smart Nation initiatives.\r\nThe National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (NAIS) maps out a bold and concrete plan to develop and \r\ndeploy digital and AI technologies across economic sectors. The NAIS identifies powerful use cases that \r\nhave the potential to transform industry and improve the lives of people in Singapore. AI has the power \r\nto amplify human potential and multiply our productivity. It will create many new and exciting jobs\r\nand power the growth of our digital economy.\r\nAI Singapore is excited to be a key implementer of the NAIS. We will champion deep research and \r\ntechnology translation, accelerate AI adoption by industry, and develop a strong pipeline of AI talent. \r\nWe will help to build a strong and vibrant AI Ecosystem, to attract global AI talent and companies,\r\nand to make Singapore a leading hub for AI.82 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 83 \r\nElement AI is strongly committed to partnering with Singapore in its mandate to develop a nation \r\ndriven by innovation between government, academia and industry. Our role as a member of this \r\necosystem is to bring world-class research and technology to ensure the NAIS delivers sustainable \r\ngrowth and positive impact from AI, both at a national level and across the region.\r\n Mr Jeff Zhang\r\n Chief Technology Officer, Alibaba Group\r\n President, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence\r\nThe launch of the National AI Strategy further affirms our decision to work closely with Singapore \r\nto build its digital economy. Singapore has consistently demonstrated its foresight and tenacity to \r\nfulfil the nation\u2019s objectives, as demonstrated in its strong talent base and world-leading research \r\ninstitutions. This is what first drew us to set up Alibaba Cloud\u2019s international headquarters and Alibaba \r\nCloud\u2019s first overseas research institute in Singapore. We have subsequently embarked on partnerships \r\nwith A*STAR, the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University to expand \r\nAI ecosystems across advanced manufacturing, fintech, retail, tourism and smart city management \r\nunder the Smart Nation initiative. With the launch of the National AI Strategy, Singapore is well placed \r\nto harness the transformative potential of AI and data intelligence to empower industry across sectors.\r\n Dr Richard Socher\r\n Chief Scientist, Salesforce\r\nSingapore is a regional and global leader when it comes to AI. Singapore\u2019s National AI Strategy (NAIS) \r\nwill help propel Singapore to continue to harness AI effectively and develop these skills\r\nand capabilities locally. \r\nThis is evidenced in Salesforce\u2019s Research Asia hub in Singapore, our first outside the United State\r\nto develop AI talent and the AI ecosystem. A deliberate decision, based on Singapore\u2019s AI focus\r\nand capability. \r\nI congratulate the Government of Singapore on the NAIS, a forward-looking vision to steer\r\nSingapore to the forefront of AI.\r\n Professor Isaac Ben Israel\r\n Chairman, Israel Space Agency\r\n Director, Blavatnik Cyber Research Centre, Tel-Aviv University\r\n Co-chair, Israel National Task Force for AI\r\nThe dominant technology of our century is computer technology, and its latest application is AI. \r\nAI is impacting nearly every facet of our lives, with machine learning becoming more capable\r\nand improving efficiencies in daily life. Thus, understanding and developing AI is key for the\r\nfuture of our world.\r\nSingapore has all the ingredients to be, within a decade or so, a world leader in this\r\nemerging technology. \r\nActually, Singapore has some relative advantages that promise an excellent start: educated people\r\nand highly developed education system, knowledge based economy and effective government.\r\nWith the right strategy, AI can transform national-level planning and significantly raise the quality \r\nof public goods like transport, education and healthcare, raise productivity, and enable the creation \r\nof valuable products and solutions for the Singapore market and beyond, and overall improving \r\nsignificantly the lives of Singaporeans. \r\nAltogether, Singapore took today a huge step ahead, leading the way to a more efficient future.\r\n Mr Jean Francois Gagn\u00e9\r\n Co-Founder and CEO, Element AI\r\nThe pace of change in the field of AI is dramatic and being an inspiring leader is the only way to\r\nunlock transformative value for society. Singapore is becoming a leader in AI, with its increased\r\nfocus and investments across its burgeoning AI ecosystem which is supported by its sound\r\ngovernance and regulatory frameworks.\r\nThe National AI Strategy (NAIS) is an ideal starting point from which the public and private sectors\r\ncan rally behind key national initiatives and ensure that AI initiatives improve the lives of \r\nSingaporeans. Element AI is a strong advocate of using human-centric principles that are ethical, \r\ntransparent and trustworthy for the design, deployment and adoption of AI. 84 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 85 \r\n Professor Tang Xiao\u2019ou\r\n Founder, SenseTime\r\n Professor, Chinese University of Hong Kong\r\nThe National AI Strategy (NAIS) is the turnkey to drive whole-of-nation AI innovation and adoption,\r\nand to build long-term industry trust through responsible AI governance in Singapore. It is an \r\nambitious plan that will position Singapore as a leading AI hub in the region.\r\nThe NAIS will further empower SenseTime, an AI technology platform company, to establish\r\nour Singapore base as a living lab to test and scale innovative AI solutions for the global stage,\r\nand to facilitate international collaboration. \r\nWe are confident in further contributing to Singapore\u2019s AI ecosystem and the empowerment of \r\nSingapore\u2019s various strategic industries. The NAIS\u2019 concrete talent development plan, in particular, \r\naligns with our commitment to harness the local talent pool to strengthen our core capabilities\r\nin Singapore and beyond.\r\n V.K. Rajah, SC\r\n Chairman, Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data\r\nThe launch of the National AI Strategy is timely. In the near future, AI is likely to pervasively affect \r\nand influence all aspects of our lives in many ways. As a society, we must be alive to its benefits and \r\npotential pitfalls. Trust is crucial to the adoption of AI, and building trust is a multi-stakeholder\r\neffort involving public, private and people sectors.\r\nSingapore has shown thought leadership in developing a human-centric approach to AI governance \r\nthat balances the need for innovation and consumer protection. Our voluntary Model AI Governance \r\nFramework was the first national framework in Asia that provides practical guidance to organisations\r\non how to implement AI responsibly. This is just the start of a never ending journey. We need to \r\ncontinue to identify and address the ethical concerns that AI brings. The Advisory Council on the\r\nEthical Use of AI and Data fully supports this national effort to create an enabling environment\r\nfor our businesses and citizens.\r\n Dr Yan Shuicheng\r\n Chief Technology Officer, Yitu Tech\r\nIn the past decade, Singapore\u2019s AI researchers have made fruitful contributions to fundamental\r\nAI research. Their accomplishments have been recognised by the international AI research community, \r\nwith frequent awards in flagship AI competitions and many high-impact AI publications. Now, it is\r\ntime for us to take a step forward and consider how to transform these AI research capabilities into \r\nactual impact and value for our society and economy. To realise such a transformation, building an\r\nAI ecosystem is very crucial, as is identifying the proper business scenarios that would benefit from AI. \r\nThe 5 national AI projects and 5 ecosystem enablers proposed in the National AI Strategy (NAIS) will \r\ngenerate great momentum for the transformation process.\r\nBeyond nurturing AI talents, how to attract and anchor these AI talents is an even bigger challenge. \r\nIt is believed that the best way to do so is to incubate more fast-growing local startups. When more \r\nSingapore-based startups are internationally recognised, even more AI talents would be willing to join \r\nthem and relocate to work in Singapore, thus gradually forming a strong and healthy talent community. \r\nThe NAIS provides great opportunities for incubating fast-growing local startups through offering help \r\nin building the different key AI ecosystem enablers, including talents, data, business scenarios,\r\nand global collaborations. I am excited by the opportunities ahead and am confident that Singapore \r\nwill be a leading player in AI.86 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy\r\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY\r\nPARTNERING AGENCIESPublished November 2019\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 by Smart Nation Digital Government Office.

Our early investment in AI led to the establishment of about 150 teams working on research and development, and 900 startups exploring new ideas with AI. Since then, we\u2019ve witnessed significant breakthroughs in AI, resulting in the development of new products, enhanced capabilities, and transformative interactions.\n\nIn 2023, we launched the Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0) in our ongoing pursuit of setting the pace.\n\nSingapore National AI Strategy 2.0 - 2023\n\nSingapore National AI Strategy - 2019\n\n## Singapore National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0)\n\nTo propel ourselves further as leaders in the field AI, three key shifts from our initial National AI Strategy are imperative for NAIS 2.0:\n\nNecessity \n\nFrom Opportunity   \nto Necessity\n\nThe expanded landscape of opportunities and risks brought forth by AI today make clear that AI is indispensable for the continued prosperity and relevance as a nation. We must master AI, rather than think of it merely as an accessory or a luxury.  \n\nGlobal \n\nFrom Local   \nto Global\n\nSingapore must operate, from the outset, with a global outlook for AI. We must connect to global networks, working with the best and pooling resources among the like-minded to overcome the complex challenges that plague AI today.  \n\nSystems \n\nFrom Projects   \nto Systems\n\nWe must further enhance our capability, infrastructure and resource foundations, and accelerate ideas exchange at scale, to amplify and manage the impact of AI across various sectors, and in economy and society at large.  \n\n### Goals of NAIS 2.0\n\nGuided by the vision \u201cAI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World\u201d, NAIS 2.0 seeks to attain the twin goals of:\n\nExcellence \n\nExcellence\n\nSingapore will selectively develop peaks of excellence in AI, to advance the field and maximise value creation. We intend to direct AI towards addressing the needs and challenges of our time, such as in areas of global importance like population health and climate change.  \n\nEmpowerment \n\nEmpowerment\n\nSingapore will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust. We intend for AI to be the great equaliser, which equips our people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to thrive in an AI-enabled future.  \n\n### Working through 10 Enablers to achieve our vision and goals\n\nTo achieve our vision and goals, we will direct efforts under NAIS 2.0 toward 3 Systems working through 10 Enablers.

The \r\nmost powerful AI models provide human-like intelligence, or a close proxy of it, to do \r\nanything from clinical diagnoses to self-driving cars. \r\nThese advances have also precipitated many important conversations \u2013 about the \r\npotential of AI, its harms, and even on what it means to be human.\r\nSingapore believes in the transformative potential of AI. Our second National AI Strategy, \r\nor NAIS 2.0, represents Singapore\u2019s commitment to realise the benefits of AI, and to create \r\nexciting new opportunities. It outlines our vision for Singapore to be a place where AI \r\nserves as a force for good, and where we harness AI to uplift and empower our people \r\nand businesses. \r\nSingapore may be a small island state, but we have big dreams and plans. We will participate \r\nfully in AI research and deployment, to do things that were not possible before, and bring \r\nbenefits to ourselves and others outside Singapore. Hence, our vision for NAIS 2.0 is to \r\nachieve AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World. \r\nThis report spells out how we will achieve our vision. It sets out our plans to build a \r\nthriving AI ecosystem; develop our workforce to take on new opportunities; provide enough \r\ninfrastructural capacity to achieve our ambitions; and foster a trusted environment that \r\nprotects users and facilitates innovation. \r\nIn the end, our plans are only as good as our collective ability to implement them. That\u2019s \r\nwhy we welcome all stakeholders and partners to join us in this shared endeavour. Let us \r\nwork together to realise the full potential of AI in our lives. \r\nLAWRENCE WONG\r\nDeputy Prime Minister & Minister for Finance\r\nForewordINTRODUCTION | 5\r\nSince the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on 30 November 2022, Artificial Intelligence \r\n(AI)1 has gone mainstream. Recent breakthroughs, particularly those in the realm \r\nof Generative AI, have resulted in AI proliferating quickly. AI is moving beyond \r\nits traditional, narrow approaches, towards more general, almost human-like \r\ncharacteristics. The ability of ChatGPT to draft, depict, translate, understand \r\ncontext, and provide seemingly meaningful responses to our questions, has \r\ncaptured the imagination of not just scientists and experts, but all of us. For \r\ngovernments, these developments have raised new and critical questions around \r\nthe risks and responsibilities associated with the development and use of such a \r\npowerful technology, even as AI continues to reinforce and remind us of what it \r\nmeans to be human.\r\nIn Singapore, where the vast majority of our people already frequently interact \r\nwith digital technologies to transact with the Government and businesses, and are \r\nalso digitally engaged at work, AI has been both commonplace and an uncommon \r\nforce. \r\nIntroduction\r\n1 AI refers to a set of capabilities through which computer systems can demonstrate human\u0002like behaviour and complete tasks which typically require human intelligence. It is considered a \r\ngeneral-purpose technology which can be applied across a wide range of sectors. Some of its varied \r\napplications include advanced web search, recommendation and decision systems, advanced \r\nproblem-solving, understanding speech and natural language, perception (for applications like \r\nfacial recognition, image labelling, or autonomous vehicles), and Generative AI tools (including \r\nLarge Language Models) that can produce various types of content, including text, images, audio, \r\nand synthetic data.6 | INTRODUCTION\r\nFundamentally, Singapore believes that:\r\n\u25b6 AI can be a potent force for good, to uplift human potential:\r\n\u25fc AI is a technology that will transform cognitive and physical tasks. We \r\nexpect its benefits to be immense, making today\u2019s jobs easier, while \r\nbringing within reach activities that were previously computationally \r\nimpossible.\r\n\u25fc This requires us to steer AI for the Public Good. We must harness AI \r\nin a sustainable way to create positive impact \u2013 for new opportunities, \r\nbetter jobs, and safer, more meaningful connections.\r\n\u25b6 AI is strategically important. We must invest in it to:\r\n\u25fc Unlock the next frontier of economic growth. We must master AI \r\nto overcome our labour and productivity challenges. This requires \r\ninvestments in our people, enterprises, and digital infrastructure, so \r\nthat we can create new jobs and participate in industries of the future.\r\n\u25fc Address risks from the potential abuse and mismanagement of AI. These \r\ninclude the misuse of AI to amplify harms (e.g. scams, cyberattacks, and \r\nmis/disinformation) across society, especially toward vulnerable groups.INTRODUCTION | 7\r\nSingapore is not starting from scratch. Some earlier moves in AI include:\r\n\u25b6 National AI Strategy. In 2019, Singapore was one of the first countries to \r\nintroduce a National AI Strategy. We embarked on National AI Projects in \r\nareas like Education, Healthcare, and Safety & Security, and invested in \r\nenablers to strengthen our ecosystem.\r\n\u25b6 Dedicated investments in AI Research and Development (R&D). We have \r\ncommitted more than S$500 million through AI Singapore (AISG) under the \r\nResearch, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 and 2025 plans.\r\n\u25b6 AI Governance. Singapore launched the world\u2019s first Model AI Governance \r\nFramework in 2019. In 2022, we also launched AI Verify, an AI governance \r\ntesting framework and software toolkit, and made it open source for \r\ndevelopers in June 2023.8 | INTRODUCTION\r\nThese early investments have borne fruit. We have:\r\n\u25b6 Built strong foundations for our AI ecosystem. Singapore is well-regarded, \r\nranking among the top 10 in the world by several international metrics.2\r\nOver 80 active AI research faculty, 150 AI R&D and product teams, and 1,100 \r\nAI start-ups call Singapore home.\r\n\u25b6 Harnessed AI to improve Singaporeans\u2019 lives. Today, AI powers many public \r\nservices, such as adaptive learning systems in our schools, and chronic \r\nhealth management systems in our hospitals. We also use AI to support \r\nimmigration and customs clearance, and to detect and deter online scams.\r\n\u25b6 Forged international partnerships. Singapore is recognised as an active \r\ncontributor to global AI discourse, spanning issues from innovation to \r\ngovernance. We advocate for the responsible and ethical use of AI. We \r\nare active participants in multi-stakeholder platforms such as the Global \r\nPartnership on AI (GPAI), the World Economic Forum (WEF) AI Governance \r\nAlliance, and most recently the United Nations (UN) High-Level Advisory \r\nBody on AI. Singapore\u2019s initiatives, like AI Verify, have been welcomed as \r\npragmatic contributions to the growing body of work on AI governance.\r\n2 For instance, Singapore ranks 1st in per capita terms in the Stanford Global AI Vibrancy Index \r\n(2021); 2nd in the Oxford Insights Government AI Index (2021); and 3rd in the Tortoise Media Global \r\nAI Index (2022).INTRODUCTION | 9\r\nThe recent breakthroughs in AI demand a renewed focus by Singapore to refine \r\nour national strategies for AI:\r\n\u25b6 Greater capabilities. AI is now more powerful and accessible. We therefore \r\nneed to work with producers and users of AI in a more concerted manner, \r\nbecause responsible development and deployment do not happen by chance.\r\n\u25b6 Greater concerns. There are growing concerns over the safety and security \r\nrisks of AI, particularly Generative AI models. These range from fears over \r\nmalicious attacks on AI models, to the current inscrutability of large language \r\nmodels (LLMs), which calls into question the validity, credibility, and legality \r\nof their output. Such concerns have garnered attention from many around \r\nthe world.\r\nThere are also new competitive realities around AI:\r\n\u25b6 Resources and talent for AI are scarce. These are concentrated within a few \r\ncompanies and countries, intensifying economic competition, as well as \r\ngeostrategic and resilience risks.\r\n\u25b6 Other smaller countries are also moving quickly to attract AI investments \r\nand talent. While acquisitions for AI may be costly, they can confer enduring \r\nvalue and deepen capabilities, if properly integrated within the ecosystem.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, Singapore aspires to be a pace-setter \u2013 a global leader in \r\nchoice AI areas, that are economically impactful and serve the Public Good.10 | INTRODUCTION\r\nWe will therefore make three shifts from our first National AI Strategy:\r\nFrom Opportunity to Necessity. People \u201cmust know\u201d AI, not just see it \r\nas a \u201cgood to have\u201d. We need both technical experts and savvy users to \r\nmaximise AI\u2019s potential for Singapore.\r\nFrom Local to Global. Our people and businesses should operate with the \r\nambition to be world-leading in AI. Singapore should be well-connected \r\nto global innovation networks, working with the best to overcome complex \r\nchallenges surrounding AI today (e.g. energy, data, and ethics). Singapore \r\nmust contribute to AI breakthroughs and products that the world values.\r\nFrom Projects to Systems. For AI to have widespread and positive impact \r\non our economy and society, Singapore has to move beyond flagship \r\nNational AI Projects. We will take a systems approach, bringing together \r\nstakeholders within and outside Singapore to add to our resources, \r\ncapabilities, and infrastructure, accelerate the exchange of ideas, and \r\nadminister AI-enabled solutions at scale.INTRODUCTION | 11\r\nWe believe that Singapore can and will succeed, given (a) our position as a trusted \r\nglobal partner and major business hub, (b) our pro-innovation and business\u0002friendly operating environment, (c) our strong knowledge base and capable \r\nworkforce, and (d) our successful track record in transforming our economy. We \r\nare a nation of industrious people, known for being reliable and trustworthy, and \r\nin whose hands AI may flourish.\r\nIt is with these convictions that we set out Singapore\u2019s second National AI \r\nStrategy (NAIS 2.0), which will also drive the next bound of our Smart Nation \r\njourney. Working together with our international network of friends and partners, \r\nwe shall use AI to be a force for good, generating new economic opportunities \r\nand improving societies everywhere.NATIONAL AI STRATEGY 2.0 | 13\r\nNational AI \r\nStrategy 2.0\r\nDeveloped through extensive engagements, NAIS 2.0 starts with the conviction \r\nthat we must do our utmost to harness AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and \r\nthe World. Singapore will be a place where AI can:\r\n\u25b6 Address the needs and challenges of our time. For example, in areas of global \r\nimportance such as population health and climate change.\r\n\u25b6 Be the great equaliser. We shall uplift and empower our people and \r\nbusinesses, equipping them with the capabilities and resources to thrive in \r\nan AI-enabled future.\r\nNAIS 2.0 seeks to attain the twin goals of:\r\nOur Vision and Goals\r\nExcellence. We will selectively develop peaks of excellence in AI, to \r\nadvance the field and maximise value creation.\r\nEmpowerment. We will raise up individuals, businesses, and communities \r\nto use AI with confidence, discernment, and trust.14 | NATIONAL AI STRATEGY 2.0\r\nTo achieve our vision and goals, we will direct efforts under NAIS 2.0 toward three \r\nSystems, working through 10 Enablers.\r\n\u25b6 System 1: Activity Drivers (Enablers: Industry, Government, Research). \r\nIndustry, Government, and public research performers have deep technical \r\ncapabilities that can be applied to deliver value. We need to orchestrate \r\nthem around meaningful use cases and problem statements to transform \r\nour economy and society.\r\n\u25b6 System 2: People & Communities (Enablers: Talent, Capabilities, Placemaking). \r\nWe will attract more top-tier researchers and engineers to work with and \r\nfrom Singapore. More of our technology workforce should work to scale \r\nnovel AI solutions, that form part of the toolkit which a confident base of \r\nenterprises and workers can use.\r\n\u25b6 System 3: Infrastructure & Environment (Enablers: Compute, Data, Trusted \r\nEnvironment, Leader in Thought and Action). We will ensure that Singapore \r\nhosts the necessary infrastructure and provides a trusted environment for \r\nAI innovation. This will make us a credible leader and preferred site for AI \r\ndevelopment, deployment, and adoption.\r\nThis strategy statement outlines 15 Actions that Singapore will undertake across \r\nthese systems and enablers, to support our ambitions over the next 3-5 years. We \r\nwill continually review these Actions to respond to fast-moving developments in \r\nAI, across domains.\r\nOur PlansNATIONAL AI STRATEGY 2.0 | 15SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS | 17\r\nActivity Drivers\r\nSYSTEM 1\r\nIndustry, Government, and Research drive AI activity, from basic science to product \r\nR&D and adoption. Together, they help Singapore leverage the rapid innovation \r\ncycles in AI for the economy and our society.\r\nSingapore has built up a strong and promising base of AI capabilities, which we \r\nshould harness to significantly uplift the broader ecosystem. We will encourage \r\ngreater experimentation and collaboration, focusing on interesting and impactful \r\nchallenges, to reap greater benefits from AI.\r\nAI Trailblazers\r\nFeature Story\r\nIn July 2023, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), Digital Industry \r\nSingapore (DISG), Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), together with \r\nGoogle Cloud, launched AI Trailblazers. This rapid prototyping initiative was a world\u2019s \r\nfirst, giving businesses and government agencies free access to Google Cloud\u2019s AI toolsets \r\nfor up to three months, with the aim of generating 100 Generative AI use cases in 100 \r\ndays, across the private and public sectors.\r\nMrs. Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and \r\nInformation, at the launch event for the AI Trailblazers initiative \r\nat the Google Asia Pacific campus.\r\nBy working with the best-in-class to provide \r\nan innovation sandbox for AI development, \r\nSingapore was not only able to spark more \r\nexperimentation, but also gave many more \r\nbusiness owners the confidence to invest \r\nfurther resources once they were able to see \r\nthe potential of AI in delivering their business \r\nobjectives.18 | SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS\r\nWe shall steer AI toward developing select peaks of excellence, which can deliver \r\noutsized impact to Singapore and the lives of Singaporeans.\r\n\u25b6 AI in Domains. We will encourage AI innovation and adoption in key domains, \r\nincluding:\r\n\u25fc Leading Economic Sectors, which form a sizeable share of Singapore\u2019s real \r\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) and for which AI innovation could catalyse \r\nthe next bound of economic growth. Examples include Manufacturing, \r\nFinancial Services, Transport & Logistics, and Biomedical Sciences.\r\n\u25fc Smart Nation Priorities, where AI assists our national development, \r\nand unlocks new value propositions for social impact. These include \r\nHealthcare, Education & Manpower, Trust & Safety, and Public Service \r\nDelivery.\r\n\u25b6 Cross-cutting Capabilities. We will invest in cross-cutting areas that can \r\naccelerate the development and deployment of AI solutions across all \r\ndomains, including:\r\n\u25fc AI for Business Operations, where AI can optimise and transform business \r\nfunctions (e.g. customer relationship management, finance, human \r\nresources, legal, sales and marketing, and supply chain management).\r\n\u25fc AI for Science, where the use of AI can accelerate research productivity \r\nacross scientific domains (e.g. drug discovery).\r\n\u25fc Foundational AI, where scientific advancements are still needed to \r\nimprove AI\u2019s abilities. For a start, we will double down on three specific \r\nthemes \u2013 Reasoning AI, Resource-Efficient AI, and Responsible AI3 \u2013 with \r\na view to making AI less costly, more widely-used, and most importantly, \r\ntrusted.\r\n3 Reasoning AI improves AI systems\u2019 ability to understand logical and physical concepts, and \r\nexplain their output; Resource-efficient AI can help reduce AI\u2019s growing reliance on data and \r\ncompute, while still ensuring performance gains; Responsible AI is critical to mitigate the risks of \r\nAI and ensure that AI is trustworthy, safe, and secure. SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS | 19\r\n* E.g. customer relationship management, finance, human resources, legal, sales and marketing, and supply chain. 20 | SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS\r\nSingapore\u2019s knowledge-intensive economy is especially exposed to AI. Our \r\nindustries and enterprises need to be responsive, and ready to create AI-driven \r\nopportunities that will strengthen Singapore\u2019s economic competitiveness. This \r\nwill help workers and industries set the pace and shape their own future, rather \r\nthan face untimely disruption.\r\nMany companies have already embarked on AI-enabled innovation projects, \r\nwhich are often focused on the Application layer. While these are useful and have \r\nmade a difference, there is scope for us to go further. Deep and transformative \r\nAI innovation today increasingly requires integrated capabilities from across the \r\nentire technology stack (i.e. including Model and Infrastructure layers). There \r\nmust also be a stronger nexus between sophisticated end-users and leading\u0002edge AI innovators and producers.\r\nTo anchor transformative AI innovation and value creation in Singapore, the \r\nGovernment has a key role in curating the right incentives (e.g. targeted grants), \r\nresources (e.g. compute and talent), regulatory frameworks, and partners. For \r\na start, we will adopt a sector-specific, use case-centric approach, and we will \r\nfocus our initial efforts on Leading Economic Sectors assessed to be most ready \r\nfor AI-driven transformation.\r\nDone well, we will have a thriving industry ecosystem in Singapore, with significant \r\nvalue creation from AI, and capabilities across the AI technology stack. AI will \r\ncomplement our workforce, boost our productivity, and be a differentiating factor \r\nin attracting best-in-class companies to Singapore. We will also seed a virtuous \r\ncycle where industry end-users can tap into a dense network of AI producers, who \r\nin turn are motivated by the presence of strong, industry-relevant lead demand \r\nand product mandates.\r\nENABLER 1\r\nIndustrySYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS | 21\r\nAnchor new AI Centres of Excellence (CoEs) across \r\ncompanies, and explore establishing Sectoral AI CoEs \r\nto drive sophisticated AI value creation and usage in \r\nkey sectors\r\nAction 1\r\nWe will attract and anchor new AI CoEs in Singapore-based companies that are \r\nleading-edge producers (e.g. technology companies, start-ups) and sophisticated \r\nend-users, in order to conduct value creation activities across the AI stack. These \r\nAI CoEs will (a) concentrate and deepen companies\u2019 innovation capabilities across \r\nthe AI stack; (b) own core AI product charters and functions; and (c) align with \r\nthe peaks of excellence that Singapore aims to build. Their roles could include \r\ncreating new intellectual property, products, and services, beyond optimising \r\nbusiness processes.\r\nIn addition, we will explore establishing a new model of Sectoral AI CoEs to \r\nintensify sophisticated AI value creation and usage in selected economic sectors. \r\nWe will work with Industry Champions4 to identify sector use cases and crowd in \r\na broader base of researchers and companies in the sector.\r\n4 Industry Champions refer to enterprise leaders that can form lead demand for AI solutions, \r\nboost their sector\u2019s competitiveness, uplift the capabilities of their supply chains, and generate \r\nspin-offs for the broader sector ecosystem.22 | SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS\r\nAmerican Express Decision Science CoE\r\nFeature Story\r\nIn December 2022, American Express set up a Decision \r\nScience CoE in Singapore focusing on data science \r\napplications in the areas of credit and fraud risk model \r\ndevelopment using AI, Machine Learning (ML), and \r\nnatural language processing (NLP). American Express \r\nexpanded the CoE in November 2023 to also use AI and \r\nML to optimise its customer marketing and service, and \r\ncreate personalised and relevant experiences across \r\ndigital channels. The CoE will also create a Generative \r\nAI R&D practice focused on new AI applications for \r\nservicing, risk, and technology.\r\nJacqueline Poh, Managing Director, Economic \r\nDevelopment Board (EDB) and Anna Marrs, \r\nGroup President, Global Commercial Services \r\nand Credit & Fraud Risk, American Express at \r\nthe official opening of the American Express \r\nDecision Science Center of Excellence.\r\n(Photo credit: American Express)SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS | 23\r\nStrengthen our AI start-up ecosystem, including \r\nattracting AI-focused accelerator programmes to spur \r\nrapid AI experimentation\r\nAction 2\r\nIn concert with private sector partners, we will strengthen the AI start-up \r\necosystem along several pillars. This includes attracting more venture builders \r\nand developing more accelerator programmes. We want to speed up AI value \r\ndiscovery across industry, and nurture a pipeline of disruptive, AI-native start-ups. \r\nThese accelerator programmes could be led by a mix of big technology companies \r\nand venture capital firms. They will provide the capital, business and technical \r\nexpertise, infrastructure, and market networks to spur rapid AI experimentation. \r\nWe will nurture globally-oriented AI innovators to create intellectual property \r\nand scale to more markets.24 | SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS\r\nThe Government is committed to the continuous improvement of public service \r\ndelivery for our people and businesses. We will harness AI to serve the public in \r\nmore impactful ways.\r\nENABLER 2\r\nGovernment\r\nOneService Chatbot\r\nFeature Story\r\nThe Municipal Services Office and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) launched \r\nthe OneService chatbot to enable citizens to lodge complaints and provide information \r\non them via commonly used social messaging apps (i.e. WhatsApp and Telegram).\r\nPowered by AI, the chatbot can (a) automatically identify and classify complaints into the \r\nappropriate category (e.g. litter, illegal parking), (b) extract the relevant details of the \r\nincident that need attention, and (c) identify and inform the relevant Government agency \r\nto follow up on the case.\r\nWith this, citizens can easily provide municipal feedback without having to figure out \r\nwhich agency they should contact. Agencies can also attend to cases more quickly.\r\nWe also recognise the positive spin-offs from such efforts. These include providing \r\nlead demand for commercial AI tools, demonstrating AI-led transformation for \r\nthe rest of the economy and society, spurring private sector investment in AI, and \r\nmainstreaming AI adoption.SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS | 25\r\nFor the Government to better harness AI, we need to:\r\n\u25b6 Develop, deploy, and integrate more useful and powerful AI-enabled products. \r\nThese include customised or commercial off-the-shelf solutions. They can \r\nsupport the Government\u2019s needs, both general (e.g. smart transcription \r\ntools for citizen support services) and specialised (e.g. detecting anomalies \r\nin financial statements and transactions to assist anti-money laundering \r\nefforts).\r\n\u25b6 Drive mass awareness and adoption of AI across the Public Service. This \r\nwill encourage public officers to use AI-enabled products and services \r\nconfidently, for more efficient and effective public service delivery.\r\n\u25b6 Work with industry and the public to better identify use cases and address \r\npain points using AI. This can be done through well-structured ideathons, \r\nhackathons, and incubator programmes.\r\nFeature Story\r\nPair is a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered suite of tools for Government officers \r\nthat allows the safe and secure use of LLMs within the Government\u2019s IT systems. Its base \r\ncapabilities include ideation, drafting, text and natural language processing, coding, and \r\ndata analysis, making it a versatile tool for various tasks that public officers commonly \r\nundertake.\r\nPair Chat is the first application to be developed within the suite. It functions on a \r\nquestion-and-answer format, powered by the same LLMs underlying ChatGPT.

This will take place at two levels:\r\n\u25b6 Smart Nation Priorities. Government agencies equipped with the specialised \r\nknowledge, technical capabilities, and regulatory tools for these domains \r\n(e.g. Healthcare and Education) will develop and lead sector-specific AI \r\nstrategies, to address the needs and challenges of these domains.\r\n\u25b6 Whole-of-Government functional domains. These include Finance, Human \r\nResources, and Service Delivery, which are key to transforming government \r\nprocesses and services for the better. All Government agencies that lead \r\nsuch functions will identify and optimise specific business lines with AI, and \r\nbuild internal capabilities to deliver business outcomes.\r\nThe Government will coordinate the resources needed to support public sector AI \r\nadoption. For example, through central funding to support or scale-up novel and \r\nimpactful use cases, facilitating cross-agency data sharing, providing access to \r\nhigh-performance compute and associated engineering capabilities (e.g. through \r\nAI Trailblazers), and issuing facilitative policy guidelines.\r\nWe will also uplift the AI literacy baseline and sharpen the AI proficiency of all \r\npublic officers. We will develop and roll out targeted courses to impart AI skills, \r\nfor different public sector workforce segments (e.g. senior management, policy, \r\nand operational roles).SYSTEM 1: ACTIVITY DRIVERS | 27\r\nA strong community of scientists and researchers contributes to a vibrant AI \r\necosystem in Singapore.\r\n\u25b6 They add to our overall technical heft, making us attractive to other top \r\nresearchers, investors, and entrepreneurs, to create new value in AI. This can \r\ngenerate other economic spin-offs, such as the creation of well-paying jobs, \r\nstart-up growth, and sophisticated venture capital investments.\r\n\u25b6 Their research breakthroughs can also translate into commercial products, \r\nwhich can be used by our companies and across government agencies to \r\nrealise better outcomes.\r\n\u25b6 Their presence helps secure an enduring competitive advantage in AI for \r\nSingapore. Over the last few decades, innovators in Silicon Valley and other \r\nAI research hubs (e.g. Beijing, Boston, Montreal, Seattle, and Toronto) have \r\nled these places\u2019 technological prowess.

They identify key technologies that are driving change, and their \r\nimpact on individual job roles. As existing job roles evolve and new job roles emerge, JTMs \r\nalso identify the pathways for employers to transform jobs and for workers to acquire \r\nrequisite skills. JTMs serve as a useful compass for employers and workers to prepare \r\nthemselves for the future of work as technology becomes more pervasive in their sectors.\r\nOne example is the Financial Services JTM, which studied the impact of AI, advanced \r\nanalytics, and automation on jobs and skills in the Financial Services sector in 2019. The \r\nJTM helped prioritise the industry\u2019s efforts to reskill and redeploy employees in segments \r\nthat were identified as likely to experience significant changes, such as consumer banking, \r\ninsurance, and operations.\r\nMAS and the Institute of Banking & Finance, with support from WSG, will be studying how \r\nGenerative AI will transform the financial sector, including where Generative AI might be \r\ndeployed, and by when. This will further inform our understanding of how Generative AI \r\nwill impact jobs in the sector, and provide advice on how the workforce should upskill and \r\nreskill to perform new and augmented roles.42 | SYSTEM 2: PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES\r\nIn a vibrant ecosystem, diverse talent can readily connect with one another \r\nand forge meaningful partnerships. There are many talented AI Creators and \r\nPractitioners today, with good ideas that can expand the frontier of AI. The \r\nopportunity to spar and collaborate with like-minded peers can enrich these ideas, \r\nand accelerate the translation into products and new value. Such synergies are \r\nseen in global AI hubs such as San Francisco, where stakeholders working across \r\nall parts of the AI ecosystem are found in close proximity, and the vibrancy of the \r\ncommunity in turn attracts the participation of even more talented individuals, \r\ncompanies, and capital.\r\nTo realise similar benefits, Singapore intends to provide more platforms which \r\ncan bring our AI community together. We want to engage with more of our talent \r\npool, and connect them to global AI experts for greater opportunities to interact \r\nand collaborate. Over time, we hope these connections will create a sense of \r\nidentity and fraternity, and build up a broader Singapore AI community that can \r\nattest to the support and inspiration that this network provides.\r\nENABLER 6\r\nPlacemakingSYSTEM 2: PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES | 43\r\nEstablish an iconic AI site to co-locate AI creators \r\nand practitioners, and nurture the AI community in \r\nSingapore\r\nAction 9\r\nSingapore will establish a dedicated physical place for AI in Singapore.

They suggested that this site be:\r\n\u25b6 Supported by a full calendar of AI-related programming, including community-run \r\nevents such as hackathons, demo days, guest lectures, seminars, and social functions, \r\nwhich create opportunities to build relationships across the community.\r\n\u25b6 Enhanced with a \u201cdigital community\u201d layer, to enable online collaborations and \r\nremote participation in community events by Singapore-linked AI talent who are \r\nnot physically based in Singapore. Through such virtual interactions, the local \r\nAI community can connect more frequently, including with other AI innovation \r\ncommunities elsewhere.\r\nThe Government will explore such suggestions and other ways to support efforts that \r\nstrengthen our AI community. For instance, we will work with industry and public research \r\npartners to organise more AI-related events, and increase the cadence of AI community \r\nnetworking events such as the ongoing Neural Networking series. Building on the inaugural \r\nRAISE.SG, we will organise regular gatherings of AI experts with a Singapore nexus, as well \r\nas arrange engagements with prominent foreign-based AI experts and practitioners who \r\nvisit Singapore.\r\nFeature StorySYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 47\r\nInfrastructure & \r\nEnvironment\r\nSYSTEM 3\r\nSuccessful AI value creation requires robust and conducive infrastructure and a \r\nfacilitative environment, where all stages of the AI life cycle are well supported, \r\nand everything works the way it should.\r\nFor Singapore, this will involve:\r\n\u25b6 Availing compute and data for AI innovation. These are important building \r\nblocks to serve our AI ambitions.\r\n\u25b6 A trusted environment where AI-enabled innovations and systems are robust \r\nand safe, so that our people can engage with AI with confidence.\r\n\u25b6 Safeguarding Singapore\u2019s AI interests in the international arena. We hope to \r\nparticipate in shaping the international rules of the road that are emerging \r\naround AI.48 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nThe increasing scale and proliferation of AI models have driven exponential \r\ngrowth in demand for chips that can support AI workloads (compute), such as \r\nGPUs. However, GPUs are in short supply, and we face intense global competition \r\nto access them. In addition, the resource-intensive nature of AI workloads requires \r\nadequate and sustainable infrastructure capacity, which we have to prepare for.\r\nTo support high value AI activities, Singapore must ensure reliable, localised \r\naccess to high-performance compute, so that industry, academia, and the \r\nGovernment have the means to innovate and build here.\r\n\u25b6 Careful management is needed, as this infrastructure will take up significant \r\npower, carbon, water, and land, all of which are limited in Singapore.\r\n\u25b6 While most of the compute supply is expected to go toward industry use, we \r\nwill direct a small proportion towards meritorious use cases that build up \r\nour local research and industry capabilities, or are in service of the Public \r\nGood.\r\nWe will also work with sustainability leaders in this space, to help Singapore \r\nachieve our AI ambitions while meeting our sustainability goals.\r\nENABLER 7\r\nComputeSYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 49\r\nSignificantly increase high-performance compute \r\navailable in Singapore\r\nAction 10\r\nWe will actively crowd in a significant amount of compute to Singapore to support \r\nour growing AI needs, especially in areas of national interest. To this end, we will:\r\n\u25b6 Deepen our substantive partnerships with major compute players, ranging \r\nfrom chipmakers to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), to secure local access to \r\ncompute capacity.\r\n\u25b6 Support Singapore-based compute with the required resource envelope. \r\nWe will ensure that there is sufficient carbon budget and power allocated \r\nto support data centres, that house GPUs or their equivalents, to process \r\nAI workloads in the near term. In the medium to longer term, we will chart \r\na roadmap towards the growth of net-zero, green data centres that are \r\npowered by renewable energy. This includes continued collaborations with \r\nindustry on innovative proposals to push the sustainability envelope.\r\n\u25b6 Manage a small subset of Singapore-based GPUs or their equivalent, to \r\nsupport meritorious use cases for capability building, innovation, and the \r\nPublic Good.50 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nAI activity is built upon confident, reliable access to high-quality, relevant \r\ndatasets. Data remains one of the essential factors of production for AI.\r\nToday, there are more avenues for AI development to overcome the traditional \r\nobstacles of data availability and access. The open-source movement has made \r\nlarge quantities of data available, while private sector data marketplaces also \r\nfacilitate the commercial trading of datasets. Meanwhile, it has become easier \r\nto create and augment structured datasets for AI, including through the use of \r\nsynthetic data.\r\nNational efforts to maximise value from data should therefore pivot away \r\nfrom access and availability, to address other emerging factors. These include \r\nimproving the quality of datasets, and ensuring that data use for AI development \r\nis context-appropriate and operates within trusted data sharing frameworks. We \r\nare also keen to make more government datasets available to solve AI problems \r\nof high national priority. Done well, we will demonstrate to AI developers that \r\nSingapore is a conducive place for responsible AI development.\r\n\u25b6 We want to uncover and avail more good data that AI Activity Drivers can \r\nleverage. While Singapore may not have the biggest datasets where size of \r\npopulation is the key determinant, the breadth and depth of our economic \r\nbase suggest that meaningful datasets can still be mined to generate useful \r\ninsights and derive new value.\r\nENABLER 8\r\nDataSYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 51\r\n\u25b6 Singapore should continue to lean forward to support industry efforts to \r\nemploy data for AI. Importantly, given increased concerns around data \r\nsecurity, we should invest in Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), and \r\nother novel approaches that can address barriers around data protection \r\nand sharing, to encourage more data flows.\r\n\u25b6 The Government should also support the data needs of meritorious use \r\ncases that serve the Public Good, particularly if these are aligned with our \r\nnational priorities but are not commercially attractive. This will ensure that \r\nsuch projects do not fall through the cracks.52 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nBuild capabilities in data services and Privacy\u0002Enhancing Technologies\r\nAction 11\r\nSingapore will build up our data management capabilities so that more of us \r\ncan store, manage, share, and govern the data that we have, enabling us to draw \r\nnew insights and uncover more value. To do so, we will need to harness new \r\ntechnologies that will enable safe and trusted data sharing, and grow more \r\ncapabilities to do so at scale.\r\n\u25b6 We will develop capabilities in PETs. PETs enable businesses to access other \r\ndatasets in a privacy-preserving manner, hence extending the pool of data \r\nfrom which they can derive insights. The Government will support research \r\nand development for PETs, especially in targeted areas like synthetic \r\ndata generation, data annotation, federated learning, and homomorphic \r\nencryption, and expand practical measures like regulatory sandboxes and \r\nguidelines to promote experimentation with PETs.\r\nPET Sandbox\r\nFeature Story\r\nTo facilitate industry experimentation with PETs, IMDA launched Singapore\u2019s first PET \r\nSandbox in July 2022, to provide opportunities for companies to work with trusted PET \r\nsolution providers to develop use cases and pilot PETs. This recognises that PETs are still \r\nin their infancy, and there is much to learn about using them in a real-world environment.\r\nThe PET Sandbox matchmakes use case owners to a panel of PET digital solution providers, \r\nprovides grant support to user companies to scope and implement pilot projects, and \r\nprovides regulatory support to ensure that the deployment of PETs meets compliance \r\nguidelines.SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 53\r\nUnlock Government data for use cases that serve the \r\nPublic Good\r\nAction 12\r\nSingapore will selectively unlock more public sector data for AI development \r\nthat serves the Public Good. We will assess the feasibility of setting up a \u201cdata \r\nconcierge\u201d within the Government, to engage AI Activity Drivers and Creators, \r\nand identify and facilitate access to the datasets that they require for their AI \r\ndevelopment activities.\r\n\u25b6 For public sector datasets, the data concierge will help AI Activity Drivers and \r\nCreators discover and obtain access to appropriate public sector datasets. \r\nWhere these are not already open-access, the data concierge will help unlock \r\nclosed datasets through brokering data sharing agreements. It could also \r\nwork upstream with agencies to collect data based on the client\u2019s needs. \r\nThis will be underpinned by a data-sharing evaluation framework that takes \r\nthe \u201cPublic Good\u201d dimension into account.\r\n\u25b6 For private sector datasets, the Government can consider stepping in for \r\nselected high-value use cases where we can play a catalytic role. In such \r\ncases, the data concierge can explore facilitating handshakes between \r\nprivate industry entities as a trusted intermediary, to aggregate and produce \r\ndata derivatives.\r\nWe will continue our thought leadership around the progressive use of data \r\nfor AI development, such as advocating for trusted cross-border data flows and \r\nproviding guidelines to businesses to educate and facilitate greater data use.54 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nTrust and safety underwrite confidence in Singapore\u2019s AI landscape. They lie at \r\nthe heart of our interventions to deliver AI for the Public Good.\r\n\u25b6 We will endeavour for AI to be developed and deployed in a safe, trustworthy, \r\nand responsible manner. The Government will institutionalise appropriate \r\ngovernance and security frameworks for AI systems. The ultimate aim is to \r\nestablish a trusted environment for AI, where people can have the confidence \r\nthat their interests are protected when interacting with AI.\r\n\u25b6 We must retain agility in our regulatory approaches. AI will continue to \r\nevolve, and no party has full sight of the risks that might emerge. It is \r\nonly through experimentation and exploration that the AI community can \r\ndeepen its understanding of AI, and discover and address potential risks. \r\nThe Government must therefore take a pragmatic approach \u2013 supporting \r\nexperimentation and innovation, while still ensuring that AI is developed \r\nand used responsibly, in line with the rule of law and the safeguards we have \r\nput in place. Where existing regulatory frameworks need to be updated, we \r\nwill do so thoughtfully and in concert with others, accounting for the global \r\nnature of AI.\r\nENABLER 9\r\nTrusted EnvironmentSYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 55\r\nThere is a range of potential risks around AI, spanning from concerns around \r\nmodel quality and fair use, to fears around the loss of control and existential \r\nrisks. Singapore remains open to engaging with all perspectives, to enhance our \r\nunderstanding of the risk landscape and to inform our most urgent priorities for \r\nrisk mitigation. For a start:\r\n\u25b6 We must ensure that AI systems are well-developed, reliable, and resilient. \r\nThis requires paying close attention to the model development process, to \r\nensure that the output of models is not biased, inaccurate, or erroneous. \r\nAI models should also be aligned with the appropriate set of human and \r\ncultural values. Existing international conversations around AI governance \r\nand safety are largely centred on these concerns.\r\n\u25b6 We must prevent AI models from being used in malicious or harmful ways, \r\nand secure them against adversarial attacks. If AI is used carelessly, it can \r\npotentially amplify negative outcomes like discrimination, anti-competitive \r\nbehaviours, or intellectual property infringement. It can also be deliberately \r\nmisused against us, to supercharge existing threats (e.g. scams, cyber\u0002attacks, and mis/disinformation) in terms of scale, speed, and sophistication. \r\nWe must remain vigilant against these risks to maintain digital trust.\r\nThe Government will take differentiated approaches to managing risks to and \r\nfrom AI, ranging from regulatory moves to voluntary guidelines, recognising that \r\nAI will continue to evolve. We will need a deeper understanding of how AI works, \r\nwhat benchmarks to use, and what testing is appropriate, and we look forward to \r\ndeveloping these perspectives together with other stakeholders.56 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nEnsure fit-for-purpose regulatory environment for AI\r\nAction 13\r\nThe Government will continue to maintain a regulatory environment for AI that is \r\npro-innovation while ensuring appropriate guardrails. We will:\r\n\u25b6 Update AI governance frameworks to address novel risks. We will regularly \r\nreview and adjust frameworks like the Model AI Governance Framework \r\nand AI Verify to reflect emerging principles, concerns, and technological \r\ndevelopments (e.g. Generative AI). As part of this, it will be important to \r\nestablish clear responsibilities for actors across the AI supply chain. This \r\nbaseline guidance will give clarity to AI developers and users on how to be \r\nresponsible in the design and use of AI.\r\nAI Verify\r\nFeature Story\r\nAI Verify is an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit developed by IMDA. \r\nThe testing framework consists of 11 AI ethics principles which are consistent with \r\ninternationally recognised frameworks around the world. AI Verify helps organisations \r\nvalidate the performance of their AI systems against these principles through standardised \r\ntests. IMDA first released AI Verify in May 2022 for an international pilot.\r\nIn June 2023, IMDA also set up the AI Verify Foundation to harness the collective power \r\nand contributions of the global open-source community, in developing AI Verify testing \r\ntools. The not-for-profit Foundation will boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to \r\nmeet the needs of companies and regulators globally.\r\nSince its launch in June 2023, the AI Verify Foundation has \r\ngrown to have over 90 corporate members, who work to de\u0002velop AI testing tools to enable responsible AI.SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 57\r\n\u25b6 Continue working with partners on R&D, particularly around alignment \r\nand evaluations. We will work with partners to translate guidelines into \r\nappropriate technical standards, tools, and services that can be practically \r\napplied. These will also be supported by policy measures including regulatory \r\nsandboxes, pilots for solutions such as watermarking and model cards, \r\nand capability development to nurture a domestic Testing, Inspection, and \r\nCertification (TIC) sector.\r\n\u25b6 Design interventions that are risk-based, tiered, and adapted for specific \r\nvertical sectors and horizontal applications. This recognises that every use \r\ncase carries a different set of considerations and risks, and would therefore \r\nrequire different risk thresholds and context-specific risk management \r\napproaches. For instance, using AI to improve the user experience for video \r\ngames would differ considerably from a use case where AI assists hiring \r\nmanagers in selecting potential candidates. To ensure coherence with our \r\nnational position on AI governance, the Government will also establish a \r\ncommon platform for regulatory agencies to coordinate on AI developments \r\nin their sectors, and share best practices when governing AI.\r\n\u25b6 Consider updates to broader standards and laws to support effective AI use.\r\n\u25b6 Contribute actively to international discourse on AI governance, to raise \r\ncapacity, share best practices, and shape rules around AI, together with the \r\ninternational community.\r\nUN High-Level Advisory Body on AI\r\nFeature Story\r\nIn October 2023, the UN Secretary-General announced the creation of a new multi\u0002stakeholder High-Level Advisory Body (HLAB) on the risks, opportunities, and international \r\ngovernance of AI. The HLAB comprises 39 experts from across UN Member States, and it \r\nwill support the international community\u2019s efforts to govern AI. Dr He Ruimin, the Chief AI \r\nOfficer and Deputy Chief Digital Technology Officer of the Government of Singapore, has \r\nbeen selected as one of the members of the HLAB.58 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nRaise security and resilience baseline for AI\r\nAction 14\r\nThe Government will also elevate the security and resilience baseline for all \r\nsystem owners using AI.\r\n\u25b6 In the short term, we will work with partners to update cybersecurity \r\ntoolkits for enterprises and individual users, to address AI-related risks. \r\nThese include advisories and actionable guidelines on how system owners \r\ncan augment their cybersecurity foundations to enable secure AI adoption.\r\n\u25b6 In the longer term, we will also coordinate efforts to share best practices and \r\nensure alignment to improve AI security, including through the development \r\nof standards and solutions for AI security. This will involve working with the \r\nprivate sector to co-create technical guidelines and solutions to secure AI use \r\ncases, and to leverage crowdsourcing initiatives to evaluate risks to AI (e.g. \r\njoint red teams to test AI systems). Such close partnerships with the private \r\nsector, including on capacity building and public education programmes, \r\nwill raise baseline AI security capabilities across the ecosystem.SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 59\r\nToday\u2019s international AI landscape is contested and fragmented.\r\n\u25b6 AI has become a major front of competition. Global powers like the US and \r\nChina dominate the global AI landscape in research outcomes, innovation \r\ncapacity, and talent networks. In turn, critical and emerging technologies \r\nlike AI have become a pre-eminent domain for geostrategic contestation.\r\n\u25b6 While the international community is working to develop consensus around \r\nthe responsible development and deployment of AI, efforts remain nascent \r\nat this point. All countries recognise the importance of managing AI well, \r\nand several have offered ideas on how the international community might \r\ncooperate on this. It is still early days, and it will take some time before the \r\ninternational community converges around any set of agreed principles.\r\nENABLER 10\r\nLeader in \r\nThought and Action60 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nNevertheless, it remains critical for Singapore to stay engaged internationally, in a \r\nmulti-party, multi-stakeholder fashion, to work towards a common understanding \r\non AI.\r\n\u25b6 AI is a technology \u201cwithout a passport\u201d. Its impact cannot be easily contained \r\nwithin any single country. It is therefore crucial for all countries to converge \r\non efforts to make AI systems safer, and to avoid AI creating strategic risks \r\nand instability. This will require all countries to set aside the instincts of \r\nprotectionism, to steer AI as a force for good. Singapore is determined to play \r\nour part, and we will continue to participate constructively at international \r\nfora on AI.\r\n\u25b6 Such conversations on the trajectory of AI must be inclusive. AI will affect \r\nand potentially disrupt all of us. It is therefore important to widen the \r\nconversation, beyond the few who are developing cutting-edge models, \r\nto take in views from other countries and stakeholders, and build up the \r\ncapacity for meaningful efforts to address AI\u2019s impact.\r\n\u25b6 Industry also plays a critical role to shape more responsible AI. We welcome \r\nongoing industry-led efforts, including those by leading AI companies, as \r\nvaluable contributions to the broader conversation on how to govern AI \r\nmodels better. We look forward to learning together with them.SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 61\r\nEstablish Singapore as an ambitious and pragmatic \r\ninternational partner on AI innovation and governance\r\nAction 15\r\nSingapore is committed to being a serious and reliable international partner on \r\nAI. This is important for sustaining our international position as a trusted hub. \r\nWe will:\r\n\u25b6 Continue to grow Singapore\u2019s international networks with key partner \r\ncountries and leading AI companies.\r\n\u25b6 Increase international mindshare in practical and risk-based approaches to \r\nAI. Singapore has gained global attention because of early efforts to integrate \r\nAI in key sectors such as finance, trade, and healthcare, as well as pragmatic \r\nGovernment tools such as Pair. We have developed governance frameworks \r\nand open-source testing toolkits such as AI Verify. These demonstrate \r\nSingapore\u2019s commitment to developing and deploying AI well, and we will \r\nleverage these gains to be a global pace-setter at the forefront of AI.62 | SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT\r\nWe will contribute to international AI developments by:\r\n\u25b6 Anchoring key bilateral relationships with selected partners from government \r\nand industry, through substantive initiatives and technical cooperation. \r\nThese will allow Singapore to \u201cstart small and move quickly\u201d, to establish \r\ncommon ground with like-minded partners, as pathfinders to broad-based \r\nmultilateral cooperation.\r\n\u25b6 Demonstrating alignment with key international fora and supporting \r\nworthwhile platforms. Singapore will support and actively participate in \r\nsubstantive multilateral, multi-stakeholder, or plurilateral initiatives, that \r\nseek to achieve an inclusive, practical, and rules-based global environment \r\nfor AI.\r\n\u25b6 Sharing Singapore\u2019s experience and curating meaningful partnerships for \r\ncapacity building. We will actively profile Singapore\u2019s approaches to AI \r\nthrough public engagements and conferences such as Asia Tech x Singapore \r\nand SCAI. We are the convenor of the Forum of Small States (FOSS)7, which now \r\nhas a digital pillar of engagement. Together with government and industry \r\npartners, we will develop AI-related capacity building initiatives to benefit \r\nthe 108 members of FOSS.\r\n7 Singapore established FOSS as an informal and non-ideological grouping of small states in \r\n1992, and has served as its Chair since. FOSS now comprises 108 countries across all geographical \r\nregions and at all levels of development, and meets several times a year to discuss issues of \r\nconcern to small states. In 2022, we introduced Digital FOSS as a new pillar of engagement within \r\nFOSS.SYSTEM 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT | 63\r\nATxSG brings together leaders and industry decision-mak\u0002ers across the global technology ecosystem to discuss the \r\nlatest trends in technologies including AI.\r\nAsia Tech x Singapore\r\nFeature Story\r\nAsia Tech x Singapore (ATxSG) is a platform to empower the technology community to \r\ndiscuss the latest trends and explore the critical intersections of technology, economy, \r\nand society. The third edition of ATxSG, organised by IMDA, was held in June 2023, and \r\nbrought together over 17,000 global leaders and industry decision-makers across the \r\nglobal technology ecosystem.\r\nA key track of ATxSG is the ATxAI Conference, where thought leaders, industry experts, \r\nand policy makers from leading AI countries convene and discuss strategic values of AI \r\ngovernance and technology trends, as well as showcase real-life implementations of AI. \r\n64 speakers and over 2,900 attendees from around the world have participated in ATxAI \r\nover the past three years.A WHOLE-OF-NATION MOVEMENT | 65\r\nTo realise the broad and transformative impact of AI, we will actively forge multiple \r\npartnerships across our economy, society, and the world. Singapore\u2019s NAIS 2.0 is \r\ntherefore designed to unfold as a national movement on the global stage.\r\nAI will not only contribute to Singapore\u2019s sustained economic growth and the \r\nglobal competitiveness of our industries, it will also create better jobs, a more \r\nproductive labour force, and substantially improve the quality of life for our \r\npeople.\r\nSingapore is ready.

This report aims to provide a brief overview of the Singapore\u2019s National AI Strategy (NAIS). Furthermore, it also provides a glance towards the Singapore\u2019s effort in the development of AI governance. \n\nFebruary 26, 2024  Order details \n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n  * Watchlist \n  * Print \n  * Send via email \n  *  Share  \n\n## Share\n\n        \n\n# Background\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT in December 2022, the world has witnessed the transformative power of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), which is rapidly emerging as one of the most important technological advancements in human history. Its human-like intelligence has opened doors to countless possibilities in reshaping industries and solving global challenges. On the other hand, the rapid evolution of AI is an uncharted territory, in which regulations and standards are not yet in place to mitigate the risks of potential misuse of AI. Policymakers have identified the urgency to come up with national AI strategies, hoping to steer the development and deployment of AI technologies to harness the benefits, while working to develop AI governance framework and standards in response to the rising concerns of AI risks.\n\nSingapore, eyeing to become a world leader in AI development, introduced its first version of National AI Strategy in 2019 and has recently released an updated version in December 2023. This report aims to provide a brief overview of the Singapore\u2019s National AI Strategy (NAIS). Furthermore, it also provides a glance towards the Singapore\u2019s effort in the development of AI governance.\n\n# Singapore National AI Strategy (NAIS)\n\n### NAIS 1.0 (2019)\n\nSince the launch of its Smart Nation Initiatives in 2014, Singapore underwent remarkable digital transformation in key sectors including health, transport, finance, education and public sector. As AI plays a crucial role in these Initiatives, Singapore launched the National AI Strategy (NAIS) in 2019, under the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office\u2019s National AI Office. NAIS outlined three key visions:\n\n  * To develop Singapore as a global hub for AI at a national level.\n  * To generate new business models and deliver innovative services to improve lives.\n  * To equip the workforce to adapt in the future of AI economy.\n\nNAIS focused on two main areas:\n\n  * 5 National AI projects: healthcare (chronic disease), municipal solutions, education, custom (border clearance operations) and logistics (freight).\n  * 5 Key enablers that are crucial for a thriving AI ecosystem: multi-stakeholder partnerships (government, researchers, industry), data architecture, trusted environment, talent and education and international collaboration.\n\nSince the launch of NAIS, Singaporean government has made invested more than S$500 million through AI Singapore (AISG) under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE). It has led to the establishment of about 150 teams working on research and development, and 1100 startups exploring new ideas with AI.\n\n### NAIS 2.0 (2023)\n\nIn response to the recent breakthrough of generative AI demonstrated by ChatGPT and increasing concern over safety and security of AI, as well as intensifying international competition for AI investments and talent resources, Singapore launched its second National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0) in December 2023 with the title \u201cAI for the Public Good\n\nFor Singapore and the World\u201d. Comparing to the NAIS 1.0 that prioritized on building national AI projects and expanding AI ecosystem, NAIS 2.0 has a broader coverage and more concrete targets. It also represents a shift from flagship projects to a systems approach, from AI as a \u201cgood to have\u201d opportunity to a \u201cmust know\u201d necessity and further secure Singapore\u2019s position to be an impactful world leader in the field.\n\nNAIS 2.0 identifies and details 15 key actions across 3 systems (Activities Drivers, Communities and People and Infrastructure) and 10 enablers (e.g.\u00a0 industry, research, infrastructure, talent, the regulatory environment, international partnerships and more). These actions aim to meet NAIS 2.0\u2019s goals of developing \u201cpeaks of excellence\u201d in AI, and empowering people and businesses to use AI with confidence. Some key actions are:\n\n  * Establish new AI Centres of Excellence (CoEs) across companies.\n  * Strengthen AI startup ecosystem.\n  * Accelerate public sector adoption of AI.\n  * Triple the number of AI talent to 15,000.\n  * Update AI R&D plan.\n  * Establish an iconic site to nurture AI community.\n  * Unlock government data for public good.\n  * Ensure fit-for-purpose regulatory environment for AI.\n  * Enhance cybersecurity and resilience to AI-related risks.\n  * Establish Singapore as an international partner on AI innovation and governance.\n\n# Singapore\u2019s AI Governance Landscape\n\nLast year, AI governance and regulation has gained global attention due to the increasing popularity of the generative AI systems. Singapore is adopting a pragmatic approach and has no intention to set mandatory rules for AI yet. Nevertheless, Singapore is proactive in promoting responsible AI practices through various initiatives and projects through collaboration with industry, research organizations and other governments. The three Key stakeholders of drafting the AI Framework are the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data (Advisory Council). Below is the overview of the Model AI Governance Framework and the AI Verify, which is the world\u2019s first AI testing toolkit.\n\n### Model AI Governance Framework\n\nIn 2019 the PDPC released the first version of Model AI Governance Framework aiming to provide private sector organisations detailed and ready-implemented voluntary guidance on key ethical and governance issues when deploying AI solutions. In 2020, an updated version was released to further refine the original Model Framework for greater relevance and usability by adding an Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organisations (ISAGO) and two volumes of Compendium Use Cases. All has been developed in close collaboration between government agencies, corporations, major tech companies, and academia.\n\nAligned with global frameworks, The Model is based on two overarching guiding principles - 1) Decision made by AI should be explainable, transparent and fair; 2) AI solutions should be human-centric. These core principles are then developed into four areas of guidance: 1) internal governance structures and measures, 2) human involvement in AI-augmented decision-making, 3) operations management and 4) stakeholder interaction and communication.\n\nIn January 2024, a draft Model Framework specifically for generative AI was proposed by the Verify Foundation (AIVF) and IMDA in response to the new risks brought by generative AI (hallucination, copyright infringement, value alignment). The proposal framework identifies nine dimensions to support a trusted AI ecosystem (e.g. Accountability, Data, Testing and Assurance, Security, AI for Public Good etc.) The draft is currently under consultation phase and the finalized version is expected to be released in mid-2024.\n\n### AI Verify\n\nLaunched by the IMDA and the PDPC in 2022, AI Verify is an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit that allows to test AI systems under a set of principles developed by international AI frameworks such as those from EU and OECD. By using AI Verify, organizations can use a combination of technical tests and process-based checks to conduct a voluntary self-assessment of their AI systems within their own operating environment. The system, in turn, helps companies attempt to objectively and verifiably demonstrate to stakeholders that their AI systems have been implemented in a responsible and trustworthy manner.\n\nAI Verify consists of two parts. The first is a Testing Framework, which references eleven internationally accepted AI ethics and governance principles (e.g. transparency, explainability, security). The second is a Toolkit that organizations use to execute technical tests and to record process checks from the Testing Framework.\n\nTo further develop open source AI testing tools to enable responsible AI, the AI Verify Foundation has been established by the IMDA. The Foundation aims to boost testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of companies and regulators worldwide. It also serves as a community and platform for networking, collaboration and education. The Foundation has seven premier members including tech giants like Google, IBM and Microsoft, who will set strategic directions and development roadmap of AI Verify. \u00a0\n\n# Global AI Race\n\nWith the huge potential for AI to transform and disrupt societies and economies, the race for AI has just begun and will certainly intensify in the coming years. Singapore, with its highly efficient government and reputation as the melting pot of technological innovation, has strong competitive advantages in Asia to attract global talents and investment. Its success is reflected by the high ranking among the top AI hubs in different indexes, including the Government AI Readiness Index (2023), The Global AI Index (2023) as well as Asia Pacific AI Readiness Index (2023).\n\nOn the other hand, Singapore has demonstrated its ability to contribute to global discourse on AI governance and regulation through the experience of Model Framework and AI Verify. As the Chair of the ASEAN Digital Ministers\u2019 Meeting (ADGMIN) and Related Meetings in 2024, Singapore is taking a leading role to draft the ASEAN AI Guide, which is expected to be released in early 2024. The drafted ASEAN AI Guide will provide guidance for domestic regulations and leaves specifics to companies and local regulators. It encourages consideration of countries' cultural differences in drafting AI regulations. The ASEAN AI Guide is regarded as a direct response to the upcoming EU AI Act, which takes a more stringent approach and will be legal binding to all EU member states. The drafting of the final text of the EU AI Act is still in progress and is expected to be released in mid-2024. How Singapore will adjust its AI governance approach to the EU AI Act remains to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, Singapore is active in international collaboration. Singapore has shown interest in developing \u201cinteroperability on AI governance, AI standards and testing frameworks\u201d with the EU as shown in the EU-Singapore Digital Partnership Agreement (EUSDP). On the other hand, In October 2023, Singapore published Interoperable AI Governance Framework with the US, the first-of-its-kind agreement, with alignment of the AI Verify and the US\u2019s AI Risk Management Framework (RMF). All these show Singapore\u2019s pragmatic approach on the international level in addressing interoperability with key emerging global AI regulatory frameworks and its ambition to become a key player in shaping the global AI landscape.\n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n  \n\nKAS Country Report- SIngapore's National AI Strategy.pdf \n\n Download  \n\nContact\n\n###  Ming Yin Ho \n\n1658733177617 \n\nProgramme Manager for Digital Transformation \n\nmingyin.ho@kas.de  +65 66036167 \n\n## comment-portlet\n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n##  Topics \n\n Digitalisation   Artificial Intelligence  \n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n AI and Elections: New dynamics of digital democracy in Germany   Greater capacity for action for public administration with artificial intelligence   Creating the Space for Competitive & Resilient Digital Europe   Tools for \u2018smart\u2019 urban development: Urban Digital Twins   Synergies of Blockchain and AI  \n\nHidden  \n\n  * Print \n  * Send via email \n  *  Share  \n  * Go to top \n\n## Share\n\n        \n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n## Asset Publisher\n\n###### Address\n\nKonrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V.

We invite you to explore our previous pieces on the UK\u2019s AI consultation and compliance with President Biden\u2019s Executive Order on AI Governance.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nWith the rise of Generative AI, firms are facing increased pressure to implement trustworthy AI systems. This has led to a need for organizations to update their current model governance frameworks to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a controlled manner. In January of 2024, the AI Verify Foundation, in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) introduced a Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI. This framework marked the Singaporean government\u2019s first step in expanding their existing AI landscape to address risks specific to Generative AI.\n\nThe new framework encourages organizations to align their practices with nine AI governance principles. These principles are consistent with other frameworks such as the EU AI Act (recently endorsed by all EU members), or the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and they center around widely known areas such as accountability, data transparency, privacy, security, and principles. In addition to addressing these standard AI risks, Singapore\u2019s authorities have flagged the relevance of incident reporting, the use of third-party entities for testing and assurance, and the independent validation of AI systems. The Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI is the latest initiative as part of a broader AI ecosystem that Singapore began developing in 2019.\n\nIn this article, we deep dive into how these initiatives are shaping the national strategy on AI risk management, aiming to help practitioners leverage the wealth of information available within the extensive AI Singapore ecosystem.\n\n## 2. The National AI Strategy\n\nSingapore\u2019s AI landscape is designed to position the nation alongside leading global AI initiatives, such as President Biden\u2019s Executive Order on AI in the US, the Pro-Innovation Approach to AI Regulation in the UK, or the EU AI Act in Europe. Modeled after similar global efforts and involving extensive consultations and collaborations with international AI firms, Singapore\u2019s national strategy encompasses a governance framework and toolkits that offers tests, reporting guidelines, and industry-derived use cases. These resources are designed to assist AI practitioners apply the Generative AI principles effectively. The goal is to encourage Singapore\u2019s industries to think ahead, and initiate the work in their respective fields to broaden their risk frameworks and address the unique challenges posed by the use of generative AI.\n\nSingapore\u2019s vision for AI is captured through a series of initiatives spanning from 2019 to 2024 (see Table 1). The journey begun in 2019 with the National AI Strategy, aimed at deploying AI across critical sectors including education, healthcare, and safety & security, alongside fostering the AI innovation ecosystem. 2020, saw the introduction of the Model AI Governance Framework, offering ethical and governance guidance for AI deployment in the private sector.\n\nYear Initiative Description   \n2019 National AI Strategy Implement AI solutions across national projects in key sectors: education, healthcare, and safety & security. Invest in the development of the AI ecosystem to support innovation within the country.  \n2020 Model AI Governance Framework Guidance for private sector organizations on ethical and governance considerations when deploying AI solutions.  \n2023 AI Verify Governance and Testing Framework Open-source AI governance testing framework and software toolkit. IMDA also set up the AI Verify Foundation to use the collective power and contributions of the open-source community to develop AI Verify.  \n2023 Guidelines on Data Privacy in AI Advise on the use of personal data to develop machine learning (ML) AI models or systems, as well as the collection and use of personal data in such ML systems for decisions, recommendations, and predictions.  \n2023 Discussion Paper on GenAI Evaluate risk assessment methods for the adoption of Generative AI.  \n2023 Veritas Toolkit Open-source toolkit developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to conduct assessments on Fairness, Principles, Accountability, and Transparency (FEAT) principles within the financial industry.  \n2024 Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI Builds upon Singapore\u2019s existing AI governance framework, to specifically address GenAI risks.  \n\nTable 1: Timeline of key initiatives launched by Singapore to govern and guide the use of AI in the country.\n\nThree AI Governance Frameworks\n\nAmong these diverse set of initiatives are three AI governance frameworks proposed by Singaporean authorities and institutions:\n\n  1. Model AI Governance Framework (January 2020)\n  2. AI Verify Governance and Testing Framework (June 2023)\n  3. Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI (January 2024)\n\nThe principles of these three frameworks demonstrate significant overlap, as depicted in Figure 1. The boxes colored in gray indicate shared principles across frameworks\u2014such as explainability, transparency, fairness, well-being, and safety. The diagram distinguishes between two principle sets: the gray ones, which align with global AI initiatives, and the colored ones, which are unique to each framework. The latter may reflect Singapore\u2019s specific focus or emphasis on areas such as research and development, content provenance, human oversight, and testing and assurance.\n\nModel AI GovernanceModel AI Governance\n\nFigure 1: AI principles across the three AI Governance frameworks: Model AI Governance, AI Verify Governance and Testing and Model AI Governance for Generative AI.\n\n### 2.1. Model AI Governance Framework\n\nSingapore\u2019s involvement in AI governance began in January 2019 with the introduction of the Model AI Governance Framework at the World Economic Forum in Davos. This framework was designed to provide detailed and actionable guidance to organizations on key ethical and governance issues when deploying AI systems.\n\nIn 2020, an expanded edition of the framework was released, which included expanded guidance and application of the principles using examples of detailed quantitative metrics and the reporting of validation test results across various industries and use cases. The framework suggests five core AI principles for guiding the development, deployment, and management of AI systems, as detailed in Table 2.\n\nPrinciple Description   \nExplainability Ensure AI decisions and processes are as understandable to humans as possible.  \nTransparency Be open about AI systems\u2019 functionality and management, including data, models, and decision frameworks.  \nFairness Strive to eliminate biases in AI, guaranteeing equitable and nondiscriminatory AI systems.  \nWell-Being Consider AI\u2019s broader societal impacts, emphasizing its positive contributions to human welfare.  \nSafety Prioritize reliable and safe AI operations, minimizing undue risks.  \n\nTable 2: The five principles of the Model AI Governance Framework.\n\nTo effectively implement AI principles, the framework has identified four key governance areas, as shown in Table 3. These governance areas are designed to help firms better monitor and mitigate AI risks based on the AI principles detailed in the table above.\n\nPrinciple Description   \nRisk Governance Establish accountability, compliance, and risk management frameworks for AI systems.  \nHuman Supervision Emphasize the crucial role of human oversight in AI decisions, ensuring AI complements human judgment.  \nOperations Management Manage AI systems, including data handling, model development, and maintenance, with a focus on performance and ethical integrity.  \nStakeholder Management Engage and communicating with external stakeholders about AI systems, especially regarding AI risks and limitations.  \n\nTable 3: The four governance areas of the Model AI Governance Framework.\n\nTo ensure that the Model AI Governance Framework aligns with globally accepted AI principles, Singapore has actively engaged in international collaborations with organizations and institutions such as the EU, OECD, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As a result, the framework is designed to be algorithm-agnostic, technology-agnostic, and sector-agnostic, making it a baseline for organizations operating in any sector and use case.\n\n### 2.2. AI Verify Governance and Testing Framework\n\nIn response to the demand for effective AI governance, the AI Verify Foundation has developed AI Verify, a tool designed for the testing and evaluation of AI systems. This move is in line with the global need for examples and references of AI testing capabilities and governance to satisfy both corporate and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s initiative is supported by a coalition of technology leaders, including: the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Aicadium (Temasek\u2019s AI Centre of Excellence), IBM, Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, and Salesforce. These entities are set to guide the future development of the AI Verify roadmap.\n\nThe AI Verify toolkit is designed to integrate into existing company operations. Its key function is to enable users to perform technical assessments on AI models and document the processes thoroughly. This toolkit aims to promote transparency in AI systems, generating reports to facilitate understanding among shareholders and stakeholders. However, it is noted that these reports, while comprehensive, must be contextualized within the broader workings of the AI system for full transparency. Effective model documentation, adhering to best practices, is essential in achieving this goal.\n\nAs of April 2024, AI Verify is available as a minimum viable product (MVP). This initial version does not yet include capabilities to assess generative AI or LLMs. However, the Foundation is actively exploring the expansion of the AI Verify Toolkit to include these areas. The Generative AI Evaluation Sandbox, a newly established component of AI Verify, serves as a testbed for real-world evaluations of AI systems. Insights from these tests are instrumental in the ongoing development of the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI, ensuring its applicability in the dynamic field of AI.\n\nWhile the AI Verify testing framework and the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI operate independently, their objectives are closely linked. The latter specifically aims to guide Singaporean institutions in using generative AI in compliance with industry regulations, while the former focuses on providing concrete tools for quantitative assessment and reporting. Supporting these efforts is IMDA\u2019s AI Verify framework, which includes 11 AI principles that align with international AI standards. These principles aim to form the basis for evaluating AI systems, focusing on responsible AI practices through the use of industry-standard tests. The coordinated development of these initiatives is expected to significantly contribute to the field of AI, both locally and internationally.\n\nSupporting these efforts is IMDA\u2019s AI Verify framework, which includes 11 AI principles that align with international AI standards (Table 4).\n\nPrinciple Description   \nTransparency AI systems should be open in their operations, allowing stakeholders to understand how they function and are used.  \nExplainability AI decisions and processes should be understandable by humans, providing clarity on how conclusions are reached.  \nReproducibility AI systems should consistently produce the same results under the same conditions, ensuring reliability.  \nSafety AI systems must operate safely under all conditions, minimizing risks to users and the environment.  \nSecurity AI systems should be protected against unauthorized access and cyber threats.  \nRobustness AI systems should be resilient and function correctly even when faced with challenges or changes in their environment.  \nFairness AI systems should make decisions impartially, equitably, and without bias.  \nData Governance The management of data used by AI systems should be ethical and compliant with relevant standards and regulations.  \nAccountability There should be mechanisms in place to hold the appropriate entities responsible for the AI system\u2019s performance and outcomes.  \nHuman Oversight AI systems should support human decision-making and actions, with adequate human control over their operation.  \nWell-Being AI systems should contribute positively to societal and environmental progress and not exacerbate inequalities.  \n\nTable 4: Overview of the AI Principles Included in IMDA\u2019s AI Verify Framework.\n\n### 2.3. Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI\n\nThrough consultations and discussions with various stakeholders, including industry experts and policymakers, IMDA and the AI Verify Foundation have jointly identified nine guiding principles designed to tackle the specific risks emerging from Generative AI. Table 5 presents a list of these principles and their key guidelines.\n\nPrinciple Description   \nAccountability Create incentives for all parties in the AI development chain to prioritize end-user welfare. Develop clear guidelines and responsibilities for each stakeholder.  \nData Integrity Utilize only trusted and verified data sources. Establish clear policies for the use of sensitive or contentious data. Ensure transparency and fairness in data usage.  \nTrusted Development and Deployment Adopt industry best practices for AI development and evaluation. Implement transparent disclosure policies akin to \u201cfood label\u201d transparency. Encourage regular audits and reviews of development processes.  \nIncident Reporting Set up robust mechanisms for monitoring and reporting AI-related incidents. Create a centralized database for incident tracking and analysis.  \nTesting and Assurance Encourage the use of third-party testing and assurance services. Develop and adhere to common standards for AI testing. Support independent verification of AI systems to build trust.  \nSecurity Adapt existing information security frameworks to include AI-specific concerns. Develop and implement new testing tools for AI security.  \nContent Provenance Ensure transparency in the origins and creation process of AI-generated content. Provide tools and methods for end-users to verify content provenance.  \nSafety and Alignment R&D Invest in research and development focused on AI model safety. Foster global collaboration among AI safety institutes.  \nAI for Public Good Promote the use of AI for societal benefits and upliftment. Enhance AI access and adoption in the public sector.  \n\nTable 5: Key Principles of the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI.\n\n## 3. Regulatory Approach and Legislation\n\nSingapore has not yet issued legislation that specifically regulates the general use of AI. As such, there are no direct penalties for non-compliance with AI regulations per se. This is in contrast to countries and regions where more prescriptive approaches to AI regulation have been taken, with significant penalties for non-compliance, such as the EU, US or UK. However, organizations must still comply with relevant laws when deploying AI technology, such as those relating to safety, personal data protection, fair competition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles or finance. Non-compliance with these regulations could lead to financial penalties.\n\nKey laws affecting AI systems include:\n\n  * Data Protection:\u00a0The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) govern AI systems processing personal data. Firms must ensure data safety, conduct pre-rollout testing, implement advanced security measures, and establish incident reporting systems.\n  * Intellectual Property:\u00a0The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy emphasizes the importance of IP rights in AI innovation. Companies must obtain necessary approvals from copyright holders before using their IP to train AI models.\n  * Financial Sector and AI:\u00a0The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency (FEAT) in the use of AI and data analytics. Financial sector firms must align their AI applications with these principles.\n\n## 4. The Road Ahead\n\nIf Singapore aims to position itself among the leading global powers in AI, it must recognize that this ambition does not come without challenges\u2014challenges that other nations are currently facing. Therefore, we believe it is important to share some of the obstacles that Singapore, like other countries, will face in the coming years. Key among these are balancing regulatory pace with rapid technological advancement, ensuring international consistency, effective incident reporting and transparency, and maintaining technological neutrality and flexibility.\n\nTo better understand these challenges, we outline several key issues that need careful consideration:\n\n  * Regulatory Pace: The\u00a0rapid development\u00a0of AI technologies, including generative AI, often\u00a0impacts the\u00a0ability of regulators to\u00a0adapt, leading\u00a0to a gap where\u00a0new AI applications\u00a0may operate without\u00a0clear guidelines.\n  * International Consistency: Discrepancies in regulatory approaches across jurisdictions can complicate the global deployment of AI solutions and may lead to regulatory arbitrage, where companies choose to operate in regions with more favorable regulatory environments. This inconsistency can undermine efforts to establish common standards and principles that ensure the responsible use of AI technologies worldwide.\n  * Reporting Transparency: Effective incident reporting and transparency can be challenging, especially when dealing with third-party AI vendors or handling private data under regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Ensuring that AI developers and deployers disclose relevant information about their models and operations requires a level of transparency that may be difficult to achieve universally. Additionally, concerns about disclosing proprietary information or sensitive data can further complicate efforts to standardize disclosure practices.\n  * Neutrality: Governance frameworks should aim to be technologically neutral, avoiding favoritism towards specific AI technologies or methodologies. This neutrality is important to prevent stifling innovation by inadvertently promoting certain approaches over others. Furthermore, as AI technology continues to evolve, governance frameworks must be flexible enough to adapt to new developments and challenges. This flexibility is crucial for ensuring that regulations remain relevant and effective in addressing the dynamic nature of AI technologies.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nAs the landscape of AI regulation evolves rapidly, staying updated and identifying the applicability and value of each framework present significant challenges. In response, we have compiled the wealth of information available within Singapore\u2019s AI landscape to highlight what we believe holds considerable value for both developers and those in AI governance roles. It is worth mentioning that while guidelines are useful, we must be careful to avoid establishing redundant rules that echo existing principles. We encourage Singaporean authorities to continue developing these valuable AI tools and governance frameworks and welcome the unification of principles and initiatives. We hope that this article helps practitioners navigate the extensive details on principles and tools and equips them with accessible and practical insights to unlock their AI potential.\n\nInterested in learning more?

In the global discourse on AI ethics and governance, Singapore believes that its balanced approach can facilitate innovation, safeguard consumer interests, and serve as a common global reference point.\u00a0\n\nAI Verify\u00a0\n\nIMDA had developed AI Verify, an AI governance testing framework and a software toolkit. The testing framework consists of 11 AI ethics principles* which jurisdictions around the world coalesce around, and are consistent with internationally recognised AI frameworks such as those from EU, OECD and Singapore\u2019s Model AI Governance Framework. AI Verify helps organisations validate the performance of their AI systems against these principles through standardised tests.\n\n\u00a0*The 11 governance principles are transparency, explainability, repeatability/reproducibility, safety, security, robustness, fairness, data governance, accountability, human agency and oversight, inclusive growth, societal and environmental well-being.  \n\nThe testing processes comprises technical tests and process checks. The AI Verify toolkit is a single integrated software toolkit that operates within the user\u2019s enterprise environment. It enables users to conduct technical tests on their AI models and record process checks. The toolkit then generates testing reports for the AI model under test. User companies can be more transparent about their AI by sharing these testing reports with their shareholders.\n\nAI Verify can currently perform technical tests on common supervised-learning classification and regression models for most tabular and image datasets.\u00a0AI Verify cannot test Generative AI/LLMs. AI Verify does not set ethical standards, neither does it guarantee AI systems tested will be completely safe or be free from risks or biases.\n\nAI Verify was first developed in consultation with companies from different sectors and of different scales. These companies include AWS, DBS, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Singapore Airlines, NCS/LTA, Standard Chartered, UCARE.AI and X0PA. AI Verify was subsequently released in May 2022 for an international pilot, which attracted the interest of over 50 local and multinational companies, including Dell, Hitachi and IBM.\n\nAIVerify_Logo_RGB_Horizontal_Color\n\nAs AI testing technologies are still nascent and growing, there is a need to crowd in the best expertise globally to advance in this area. IMDA has therefore set up the AI Verify Foundation to harness the collective power and contributions of the global open source community to develop AI Verify testing tools for the responsible use of AI. The Foundation will boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of companies and regulators globally.\n\nThe not-for-profit Foundation will:\n\n  * Foster a community to contribute to the use and development of AI testing frameworks, code base, standards, and best practices\n  * Create a neutral platform for open collaboration and idea-sharing on testing and governing AI\n  * Nurture a network of advocates for AI and drive broad adoption of AI testing through education and outreach\n\nAI Verify Foundation has seven premier members, namely, Aicadium, Google, IBM, IMDA, Microsoft, Red Hat and Salesforce, who will set strategic directions and development roadmap of AI Verify. The Foundation also has more than 60 general members. For more information, visit our Foundation website.\n\n## Model AI Governance Framework\n\nOn 23 January 2019, the PDPC released its first edition of the Model AI Governance Framework (Model Framework) for broader consultation, adoption and feedback. The Model Framework provides detailed and readily-implementable guidance to private sector organisations to address key ethical and governance issues when deploying AI solutions. By explaining how AI systems work, building good data accountability practices, and creating open and transparent communication, the Model Framework aims to promote public understanding and trust in technologies.\n\nOn 21 January 2020, the PDPC released the second edition of the Model Framework.\u00a0\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\nCheckbox tick Decisions made by AI should be  \nEXPLAINABLE, TRANSPARENT & FAIR\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Checkbox tick AI systems should be   \nHUMAN-CENTRIC\u00a0  \n\n## From Principles to Practice\n\nInternal Governance Structures and Measures\n\nInternal Governance Structures and Measures\n\n  * Clear roles and responsibilities in your organisation\n  * SOPs to monitor and manage risks\n  * Staff training\n\nDetermining the Level of Human Involvement in AI-Augmented Decision-Making\n\nDetermining the Level of Human Involvement in AI-augmented Decision-making\n\n  * Appropriate degree of human involvement\n  * Minimise the risk of harm to individuals\n\nOperations Management\n\nOperations Management\n\n  * Minimise bias in data and model\n  * Risk-based approach to measures such as explainability, robustness and regular tuning\n\nStakeholder Interaction and Communication\n\nStakeholder Interaction and Communication\n\n  * Make AI policies known to users\n  * Allow users to provide feedback, if possible\n  * Make communications easy to understand\n\nThe second edition includes additional considerations (such as robustness and reproducibility) and refines the original Model Framework for greater relevance and usability. For instance, the section on customer relationship management has been expanded to include considerations on interactions and communications with a broader network of stakeholders. The second edition of the Model Framework continues to take a sector- and technology-agnostic approach that can complement sector-specific requirements and guidelines.\n\nAccess the second edition of the Model Framework and the primer.\n\n## Implementation and Self Assessment Guide for Organisations (ISAGO)\n\nIntended as a companion guide to the Model Framework, ISAGO aims to help organisations assess the alignment of their AI governance practices with the Model Framework. It also provides an extensive list of useful industry examples and practices to help organisations implement the Model Framework.\n\nISAGO is the result of the collaboration with World Economic Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution to drive further AI and data innovation. ISAGO was developed in close consultation with the industry, with contributions from over 60 organisations.\n\nAccess the ISAGO.\n\n## Compendium of Use Cases\u00a0\n\nComplementing the Model Framework and ISAGO is a Compendium of Use Cases (Compendium) that demonstrates how local and international organisations across different sectors and sizes implemented or aligned their AI governance practices with all sections of the Model Framework. The Compendium also illustrates how the featured organisations have effectively put in place accountable AI governance practices and benefitted from the use of AI in their line of business. We hope these real-world use cases will inspire other companies to do the same.\n\n#### Volume 1\n\nVolume 1 features use cases from Callsign, DBS Bank, HSBC, MSD, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Omada Health, UCARE.AI and Visa Asia Pacific. \n\n#### Volume 2\n\nVolume 2 contains use cases from the City of Darwin (Australia), Google, Microsoft, Taiger as well as special section on how AI Singapore implemented our Model Framework in its 100 Experiments projects with IBM, RenalTeam, Sompo Asia Holdings and VersaFleet.\n\n## A Guide to Job Redesign in the Age of AI (Guide)\n\nUnder the guidance of the Advisory Council of the Ethical Use of AI and Data, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the PDPC have collaborated with the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities (LKYCIC), Singapore University of Technology and Design to launch the Singapore\u2019s first guide that helps organisations and employees understand how existing job roles can be redesigned to harness the potential of AI, so that the value of their work is increased.\n\nLaunched on 4 December 2020, this Guide provides an industry-agnostic and practical approach to help companies manage AI's impact on employees, and for organisations that are adopting AI to prepare themselves for the digital future. \n\nThis Guide provides guidance on practical steps in four areas of job redesign:\n\nTransforming Jobs-colored\n\nTransforming Jobs\n\nAssess the impact of AI on tasks, including whether each task can be automated or augmented by AI or remain in human hands, and decide which jobs can be transformed within an appropriate time frame.\n\nCharting Pathways\n\nCharting Clear Pathways Between Jobs\n\nChart task pathways between jobs within an organisation and identify the tasks employees would need to learn to transition from one job to another.\u00a0\n\nClearing Barriers - colored\n\nClearing Barriers to Digital Transformation\n\nSuggest ways to address potential challenges and support employees when implementing AI.\u00a0\n\nEffective Comms - colored\n\nEnabling Effective Communication Between Employers and Employees\n\nBuild a shared understanding within the organisation on \u201cwhy\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d AI will augment human capabilities and empower employees in their career.\n\nThe Guide supports IMDA\u2019s efforts to build a trusted and progressive AI environment that benefits businesses, employees and consumers. For example, the Model Framework guides organisations to deploy AI responsibly and address consumer concerns. Likewise, the Guide encourages organisations to take a human-centric approach to manage the impact of AI adoption by investing in redesigning jobs and reskilling employees.\u00a0  \n\nAccess the Guide\u00a0and the primer.\n\n## Adoption and Feedback\n\nWe encourage organisations to use the Model Framework, ISAGO and Guide\u00a0for internal discussion and implementation. Trade associations and chambers, professional bodies, and interest groups are welcome to use this document for their discussions, and adapt it for their own use. The way in which businesses employ AI continues to evolve and so will this living document in the form of future editions.\n\nTo this end, we welcome organisations to share with us:\n\n  * Practical examples that would aid in illustrating section(s) of the Model Framework and Guide; and/or\n  * Experiences in using the Model Framework, ISAGO and Guide, e.g. how easy it is to implement the measures, how the framework can be better improved, or a helpful case of implementation that we may publish as a use case. Your use cases would continue to inspire more companies to implement AI responsibly.\n\nPlease email us at\u00a0corporate@pdpc.gov.sg.\n\n## Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data (Advisory Council)\n\nThe Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI & Data was first established in 2018 for the purpose of: \n\n(a) advising the Government on ethical, policy and governance issues arising from the use of data-driven technologies in the private sector; and   \n\n(b) supporting the Government in providing general guidance to businesses to minimise ethical, governance and sustainability risks, and to mitigate adverse impact on consumers from the use of data-driven technologies. \n\nThe members of the Advisory Council are appointed by the Minister for Communications and Information and supported by a Secretariat. \n\nThe Advisory Council members for the term 2022-2025 are:\n\nChairperson  \nMr V.K.

In 2019, Singapore published the first edition of the National AI Strategy (NAIS) and was the first to launch a Model AI Governance Framework.\n\nWith plans to invest S$1 billion into computing, talent and industry development over the next five years, Singapore demonstrates its commitment to the AI development space.\n\nFor that reason, it\u2019s important to understand how Singapore approaches AI governance and regulation and the impact it may have on your business.\n\n## Singapore\u2019s AI regulations \n\nSingapore does not have regulations specific to the governance of AI. Rather than issuing sweeping AI regulation that covers all industries, Singapore is taking a sectoral approach, with individual ministries, authorities and commissions publishing guidelines and regulations.\n\n### Financial \n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country\u2019s central bank and integrated financial regulator, was the first to develop AI governance regulation.\n\nIn 2019, MAS announced it was working with financial industry partners to create the Veritas framework, which provides financial institutions with a verifiable way to incorporate the fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency (FEAT) principles into their AI and data analytics-driven solutions.\n\n### Health \n\nIn October 2021, the Ministry of Health published the AI in Healthcare Guidelines to support patient safety and improve trust in the use of AI in health care. The guidelines provide recommendations to encourage the safe development and implementation of AI-Medical Devices, as well as any other AI use cases implemented in healthcare.\n\n### Info-communications and media \n\nAmong the most active in regulating AI governance have been the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Personal Data Protection Commission. The two have launched guidelines or initiatives annually since 2019.\n\nIn 2023, the IMDA launched AI Verify, an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit that validates the performance of AI systems against a set of internationally recognized principles through standardized tests. Since its introduction, AI Verify has joined the ranks of the growing body of work on AI governance.\n\nIn January 2024, the IMDA issued the Proposed Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI and launched the Generative AI Evaluation Sandbox with Enterprise Singapore, a government agency championing enterprise development, in early February.\n\n## Key aspects of Singapore\u2019s AI National Strategy \n\nThe release of ChatGPT in late 2023 altered the AI ecosystem dramatically. Singapore was swift to respond, with an update to its national AI strategy, NAIS 2.0.\n\nAt its foundation are two goals:\n\n  * The pursuit of excellence in AI, advancing the field and maximizing value creation.\n  * Empowering individuals, businesses, and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment and trust.\n\nThe NAIS 2.0 also sets out Singapore\u2019s long-term visions and goals with regard to AI, which includes working towards three systems through a series of \u201cenablers\u201d:\n\n  1. Activity Drivers (supported by industry, government and research)\n  2. People & Communities (enhanced by talent, capabilities and placemaking)\n  3. Infrastructure & Environment (strengthened by computing, data, a trusted environment and leadership in thought and action)\n\nThe strategy statement also outlines actions that Singapore will undertake across these systems and enablers, including:\n\n  * Strengthening Singapore's AI startup ecosystem \n  * Upskilling the workforce \n  * Unlocking government data for use cases that serve the public good \n  * Maintaining a pro-innovation regulatory environment for AI while ensuring appropriate guardrails \n  * Establishing Singapore as an ambitious and pragmatic international partner on AI innovation and governance \n  * Accelerate public sector adoption of AI \n  * Update national AI research and development plans \n  * Attract world-class AI creators to Singapore \n  * Boost the AI practitioner pool \n\n## Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI: 9 dimensions \n\nIn May 24, the IMDA has published Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI therefore seeks to set forth a systematic and balanced approach to address generative AI concerns while continuing to facilitate innovation. The framework proposes nine dimensions in totality, to foster a trusted ecosystem.\n\n  1. Accountability by assigning responsibility to stakeholders during AI development \n  2. Ensuring the trusted data sources for quality of data used in AI models \n  3. Trusted development and deployment through transparency and disclosure \n  4. Incident reporting for timely notification and remediation \n  5. Testing and assurance by implementing third-party testing based on common AI standards to build trust with end-users \n  6. Security by addressing the risks of new threats that emerge \n  7. Developing technologies to improve transparency for origin and creation of content \n  8. Safety and alignment research and development to accelerate investment in AI \n  9. Leveraging AI to benefit society by democratizing access, enhancing public sector adoption, upskilling workers, and developing sustainable AI systems \n\nThus, Singapore\u2019s regulations, National AI Strategy and Framework are examples of what governance and compliance leaders need to know and track \u2014 to learn more, download the most recent edition of our regulation and legislation roundup, with forecasts and insights for the months ahead.\n\nDiligent\n\n### Solutions Solutions\n\n  * Board Management\n  * Enterprise Risk Management\n  * Audit Management\n  * Market Intelligence\n\n### Resources Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Research & Reports\n  * Podcasts\n  * Guides\n  * Newsletter Signup\n\n### Company Company\n\n  * About Us\n  * Careers\n  * Support\n  * Partners\n\nsecurity \n\n#### Your Data Matters \n\nAt our core, transparency is key.

 * How Securiti Can Help \n\nIn 2019, Singapore became one of the first countries to publish its National AI Strategy. This was followed by the release of the updated edition of the Model AI Governance Framework in 2020. These foundational documents aimed to provide guidelines for the ethical and responsible deployment and development of AI technologies across industries. The recently released Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI (GenAI Framework) in Singapore has set a new benchmark for AI governance.\n\nThe Gen AI framework was released on 30 May 2024 by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and AI Verify Foundation. It incorporates the latest technological advancements, emergent principles, and concerns in Gen AI. Through a systematic and balanced approach, it is designed to promote responsible AI innovation and protect the public interest and ethical standards.\n\nThe framework encompasses nine key dimensions that must be evaluated comprehensively to build a trusted ecosystem. It calls for the collective efforts of critical stakeholders\u2014including policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and the public\u2014to collaborate in this endeavor. Through this approach, Singapore seeks to ensure that the development and deployment of generative AI technologies uphold core principles such as transparency, accountability, security, and fairness. Continue reading to explore these aspects further.\n\n## 9 Dimensions of Model AI Governance Framework for GenAI\n\nThe GenAI Framework outlines 9 key dimensions that should be considered holistically to foster a trusted ecosystem. These include:\n\n### 1. Accountability\n\nEnsuring accountability is essential for AI systems to function as it helps build a trusted AI ecosystem. All participants in the AI development process, including model developers, application deployers, and cloud service providers, must be responsible for end-users.\n\nGenerative AI involves multiple layers in the tech stack, similar to traditional software development. As a best practice, a comprehensive strategy calls for assigning responsibility throughout the development process (ex-ante) and includes guidelines on how to seek redress if problems surface later (ex-post).\n\n  * Ex Ante \u2014 Allocation Upfront: Responsibility should be assigned based on each stakeholder's level of control in the generative AI development process, ensuring that those with the ability to act can take necessary measures to protect end-users. Inspiration can be taken from the cloud industry's shared responsibility models and developers, who best understand such products, should lead this initiative to promote a safer AI ecosystem.\n  * Ex Post \u2014 Safety Nets: Shared responsibility models are crucial for establishing accountability and providing clarity on redress when issues arise but may not cover all scenarios, especially unforeseen risks. To address gaps, additional measures like indemnity and insurance should be considered. Some developers already underwrite risks like third-party copyright claims, acknowledging responsibility for their AI models.\n\n### 2. Data\n\nData has a direct impact on the quality of the model outputs, making it essential for model development. It is crucial to ensure reliable, high-quality data sources are used. It's also crucial to maintain fair treatment, manage the data pragmatically, and give corporate clarity while using sensitive data, such as private or copyrighted content.\n\nTo ensure that generative AI respects individual rights, policymakers should clearly explain how current personal data rules apply to generative AI. This includes outlining the conditions for consent, privacy rights, and any relevant exclusions and guiding AI ethical data usage practices.\n\nMoreover, Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) can help protect data confidentiality during model training. The use of copyright material in training datasets also raises questions about consent and fair use, especially when models generate content mimicking creators' styles. Thus, balancing copyright concerns with data accessibility remains essential for responsible AI development.\n\nAI developers should adopt data quality control mechanisms and follow best practices in data governance. This involves ensuring datasets are consistently annotated and cleaned. Internationally, expanding trusted datasets\u2014especially for benchmarking and cultural representation\u2014can enhance model reliability. Governments could also help curate datasets reflecting local contexts, improving data availability.\n\n### 3. Trusted Development and Deployment\n\nModel development and application deployment are key to AI-driven innovation. Developers and deployers must ensure transparency on safety and hygiene, embrace best practices in development and assessment, and provide 'food label'- type transparency and disclosures in areas such as data use, evaluation, results, and risks.\n\nModel developers and application deployers should implement safety best practices throughout the AI development lifecycle. After pre-training, methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and fine-tuning with input/output filters can reduce harmful outputs, while methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and few-shot learning improve accuracy by minimizing hallucinations. Moreover, conducting a risk assessment based on the use case context is crucial for ensuring safety.\n\nIt is also important to note that while generative AI is typically evaluated through benchmarking and red teaming, these methods often overlook back-end risks. A more standardized approach with baseline safety tests and domain-specific evaluations is needed. Thus, industry and policymakers must collaborate to enhance safety benchmarks and ensure robust evaluation across sectors.\n\n### 4. Incident Reporting\n\nNo software, including AI, is totally failsafe, even with sophisticated development procedures and protections. Incident reporting is critical for timely notification and remediation. Establishing mechanisms for event monitoring and reporting is vital since it helps the continual enhancement of AI systems. Moreover, reporting needs to be proportionate, it should combine thoroughness with practicality, ensuring that reports are informative enough without being unduly burdensome.\n\n#### Vulnerability Reporting \u2014 Incentive to Act Pre-Emptively\n\nSoftware product owners should implement vulnerability reporting as a proactive security strategy. They should employ white hats or independent researchers to detect vulnerabilities in the software. They typically encourage these efforts via curated bug bounty programs. Once a vulnerability is found, the product owner typically has 90 days to fix the software and disclose the issue, allowing both owners and users to improve security.\n\n#### Incident Reporting\n\nAfter events occur, organizations must have internal protocols to report the issue swiftly for timely notification and remediation. If AI is substantially engaged, the organization may need to inform both the public and government authorities, depending on the incident's impact. Thus, defining \u201csevere AI incidents\u201d or setting thresholds for mandatory reporting is important.\n\n### 5. Testing and Assurance\n\nThird-party testing and assurance are vital for developing a credible ecosystem, equivalent to processes in the finance and healthcare sectors (accreditation mechanism). While AI testing is still evolving, firms must embrace these practices to establish trust with end-users. Developing universal standards for AI testing is also vital to assure quality and consistency.\n\nFostering a third-party testing ecosystem requires focusing on two key aspects:\n\n  * How to Test: Establishing an effective and uniform testing technique while specifying the testing scope to enhance internal initiatives.\n  * Who to Test: Opting for independent organizations to examine to ensure fairness.\n\nTo enhance AI testing, greater emphasis should be placed on developing universal benchmarks and methods. This may be supported by providing standard tools to facilitate testing across multiple models or applications. For more advanced domains, AI testing might someday be standardized by organizations like ISO/IEC and IEEE, enabling more uniform and rigorous third-party testing. Over time, an \"accreditation mechanism\" could potentially be established to guarantee both autonomy and capability.\n\n### 6. Security\n\nGenerative AI introduces new threat vectors that go beyond standard software security risks. Although this is a developing domain, current information security frameworks must be updated, and new testing techniques must be established to address these risks.\n\n#### Adapt Security-by-Design\n\nOrganizations must adopt \u2018security-by-design\u2019 \u2013 a key concept that involves integrating security into every phase of the systems development life cycle (SDLC) to minimize vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface. Important SDLC stages include development, evaluation, operations, and maintenance. Additionally, new tools need to be developed to enhance security, including:\n\n  * Input Filters: Tools that filter input by detecting risky prompts, such as blocking malicious code. These tools should be programmed to address domain-specific risks.\n  * Digital Forensics Tools for Generative AI: Tools for examining digital data to reconstruct cybersecurity events must be developed. New forensics techniques must also be created to identify and remove potentially malicious codes concealed in generative AI models.\n\n### 7. Content Provenance\n\nAI-generated content may promote the spread of disinformation owing to its ease of generation. A notable example of this concern is deepfakes, which have heightened risks such as misinformation. Thus, transparency regarding the source and process of information development helps individuals make educated decisions. Governments are researching technology solutions like digital watermarking and cryptographic provenance, which, once finalized, should be utilized correctly to meet evolving risks.\n\nCollaboration with key stakeholders, such as publishers, is crucial to support digital watermarks and provenance details. Since most content is consumed via social media and media outlets, publishers play a key role in verifying content authenticity. Moreover, standardizing how AI edits are labeled would also help users distinguish between AI and non-AI content.\n\n### 8. Safety and Alignment Research & Development (R&D)\n\nCurrent model safety measures do not address all risks, requiring faster R&D investment to better align models with human objectives and values\u00a0 One research focus is on creating more aligned models using approaches like Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), which aims to enhance feedback and oversight. Another area involves evaluating models after training to identify risks, such as dangerous capabilities, and using mechanistic interpretability to trace the source of problematic behaviors.\n\nWhile most alignment research is conducted by AI companies, the establishment of AI safety R&D institutes in countries like the UK, US, Japan, and Singapore is a positive step. Additionally, global collaboration among AI safety research organizations is crucial to maximize resources and keep pace with the fast rise in model capabilities driven by commercial interests.\n\n### 9. AI for Public Good\n\nResponsible AI comprises more than simply risk mitigation; it's about enabling individuals and organizations to prosper in an AI-driven future. This involves four key areas for impact:\n\n  1. Democratising Access to Technology: Ensuring all individuals have trusted access to generative AI, supported by digital literacy initiatives.\n  2. Public Service Delivery: Enhancing public services through efficient AI integration, with coordinated resources and responsible data sharing.\n  3. Workforce Development: Upskilling the workforce to adapt to AI technologies, focusing on both technical and core competencies.\n  4. Sustainability: Addressing the environmental impact of AI by developing energy-efficient technologies and tracking carbon footprints.\n\nMoreover, collaboration among governments, industry, and educational institutions is essential for maximizing AI's positive effects.\n\n## How Securiti Can Help\n\nSecuriti is the pioneer of the Data Command Center, a centralized platform that enables the safe use of data and GenAI.

Led by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), iN2015 involves several organizations.\n\nAccording to IDA, iN2015 is the blueprint to navigate Singapore's \"transition into a global city, universally recognized as an enviable synthesis of technology, infrastructure, enterprise and manpower\".\n\nThe Singapore government hopes to use iN2015 to greatly expand Singapore's infocomm industry.\n\n- IDA Singapore - About Us - iN2015 Masterplan. Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.\n- IDA Singapore - About Us - The iN2015 Masterplan. Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.\n- Imagine iN2015. Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe vision of iN2015 is: Singapore: an Intelligent Nation, a Global City, powered By Infocomm.\n\nThe goals of the program are as follows:\n* To be the first in the world in harnessing infocomm to add value to the economy and society.\n* To realize a 2\u2013fold increase in the value-add of the infocomm industry to S$26 billion.\n* To realize a 3\u2013fold increase in infocomm export revenue to S$60 billion.\n* To create 80,000 additional jobs.\n* To achieve 90% home broadband usage.\n* To achieve 100% computer ownership in homes with school-going children.\n\n### An integrated government\n\nCitizens can expect more proactive, user-friendly, responsive and integrated Government services even on the move. They can provide feedback and exchange views with the Government on public policies and initiatives from anywhere, at any time. This will further enhance the Government's capacity from the synergy that comes with shared services and common application platforms.\n\nUsing infocomm as a catalyst, public agencies will work with the private sector to spearhead innovative infocomm projects that give businesses in Singapore a competitive edge. Citizens will benefit from convenient access to integrated, user-friendly e-services and information online, becoming active stakeholders in public policy formulation.\n\n### Learning\n\nInfocomm will empower individuals to learn at one's own pace, place, and time. Learning will take place in environments that provide the best context, be It at the zoo, museums, or outside the classroom.\n\nBeyond textbooks, students, and teachers will have access to a wealth of interactive digital learning resources. Outside the school, teachers can monitor the progress of learners through new assessment modes and form virtual communities to learn from and collaborate with others within and outside Singapore. Education will engage students, enrich lives and meet the diverse needs of each individual.\n\n### Healthcare\n\nInfocomm will link hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and laboratories with patients' homes, enabling healthcare professionals to access comprehensive patient information instantly.\n\nIt will develop the infrastructure that will transform biomedical research into healthcare delivery and empower individuals, giving them more control of their health through access to personal healthcare records and relevant healthcare information.\n\nAn integrated healthcare delivery system will give individuals the ability to better manage their health and access high quality clinical care. It will provide cost-effective healthcare, excellence in service and support strong clinical research.\n\n### Economic components\n\nInfocomm will theoretically make Singapore into a premier wealth management centre, with intelligent data management and analysis, as well as efficient back-office processes with the assurance of authentication, privacy, information systems and security.\n\nA corporate financial information exchange will provide automated reporting, corporate transparency and greater analytical coverage. Next-generation infrastructure will enable nationwide electronic and mobile payments, offering new transactional and value-added services and new e-payment solutions.\n\nGlobal financial institutions will find Singapore both a centre of innovative financial services and the ideal location to service regional customers, manage high-end financial processes, and develop and market innovative financial products and services.\n\nInfocomm will augment high value-added activities such as research and product development. It will help develop new manufacturing services business models, reduce time to markets and support one platform for national trade information and transactions.\n\nIt will provide a world-class logistics infrastructure and enable global, strategic supply chain activities as well as innovative supply chain management. Companies will build and manage adaptive supply chains out of Singapore and facilitate complex manufacturing capabilities made possible by the infocomm infrastructure. A national integrated platform will augment trade information exchange.\n\n## Strategies\n\nThe government plans to spearhead the transformation of key economic sectors, government and society through more sophisticated and innovative use of infocomm by iN2015. It is also establishing an ultra-high speed, pervasive, intelligent and trusted infocomm infrastructure through the Wireless@SG programme where Singaporeans can access the net in various cells throughout the island, the cells now numbering to 5000. The overall plan of iN2015 is to develop a globally competitive infocomm industry and due to Singapore's dependence on its only resource, its people, the iN2015 masterplan is to develop an infocomm-savvy workforce and globally competitive infocomm manpower.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nThe IDA hopes that the iN2015 will help create many opportunities in the infocomm industry of Singapore. In the iN2015 website, it is hoped that it will be \"transforming lives & businesses\", \"fueling competitive enterprise\", \"providing the infrastructure\" and \"developing human capital\".\n\n- IDA Singapore - About Us - The iN2015 Masterplan. 2008-02-22.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe master plan's next-generation wireless and wired infrastructure will be delivering more innovative and trusted services. Starting with Wireless@SG, the infrastructure will hopefully grow to be ultra-high speed, pervasive and intelligent.\n\n### Labour force\n\niN2015 aims to attract and develop an innovative, infocomm-savvy workforce and global infocomm talent for Singapore, to enhance economic competitiveness and the economic growth of Singapore.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n* iN2015 (https://web.archive.org/web/20121109064438/http://www.ida.gov.sg/Infocomm-Landscape/iN2015-Masterplan.aspx) \u2013 official website\n\n","snippet":"","pub_date":null,"crawl_date":null,"pub_timestamp":1691456841.0,"crawl_timestamp":null,"ref_id":"turn0search12"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"142450f6-7021-45c6-bc5b-e4c814b68c47","request_id":"90b3ff4928739c47-SEA","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"142450f6-7021-45c6-bc5b-e4c814b68c47","children":["0cec632b-7b3f-462c-8732-f904abb66894"]},"0cec632b-7b3f-462c-8732-f904abb66894":{"id":"0cec632b-7b3f-462c-8732-f904abb66894","message":{"id":"0cec632b-7b3f-462c-8732-f904abb66894","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.search","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.search"}},"create_time":1738434483.837419,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"sonic_webpage","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Nation","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","title":"Smart Nation","text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  [wordlim: 200] Published: 6 months ago; Smart Nation\nThe Smart Nation is an initiative by the Government of Singapore to harness infocomm technologies, networks and big data to create tech-enabled solutions.\n\n- National Digital Identity system to be cornerstone of Singapore's Smart Nation vision. Channel NewsAsia.\n- Vision of a smart nation is to make life better: PM Lee. The Straits Times. 25 Nov 2014.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Smart Nation was an initiative launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 24 November 2014. In financial year 2017, the government had set aside $2.4 billion to support the initiative, which involves the government purchasing services from technology startups rather than offering grants to support them. To support development, open data is made available at government portals such as Data.gov.sg.\n\nSome areas of focus include enhancing public transport networks, enabling successful aging and ensuring a secure but open data marketplace. The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) tracks and analyses data related to housing, amenities and public infrastructure. Former civil servant, Peter Ong, explained that this \u201cencompasses hardware like lamp-posts and public cameras, as well as software that enables sensor data exchange and data and video analytics\u201d. An interconnected network of 110,000 lampposts with wireless sensors will collate data that will be used for urban and operational planning, maintenance and incident response.\n\nThe Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) and Government Technology Agency (GovTech) under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) lead the development of a National Digital Identity framework for online transactions between citizens and businesses, building on the current SingPass system.\n\n- Singapore, Prime Minister's Office.

GovTech is also placed under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) as the implementing agency of SNDGO. Collectively, the SNDGO and GovTech form the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG).\n\nThe SNDGG is overseen by a Ministerial Committee chaired by Teo Chee Hean. The other members of the Ministerial Committee are Josephine Teo, Vivian Balakrishnan, Chan Chun Sing and Janil Puthucheary and will also coordinate GovTech's strategy with Info-communications Media Development Authority's (IMDA) industry development efforts.\n\n- New Smart Nation and Digital Government Office to be formed on May 1.

There were also concerns that the expectation of mass surveillance by the government could also result in \"self-surveillance, self-monitoring, self-censorship\", and a general aversion to \"improvise, innovate and take risks\".\n\nThe government responded by stating that the Public Sector (Governance) Act passed in January 2018 clarifies when data sharing is allowed across government agencies, as well as which agency is responsible for the request and sharing of data. Public servants' data access rights is given based on security clearance and authorisation. The Act also criminalises the sharing of personal data without authorisation and the using of data for self-benefit or for the re-identification of anonymised data without authorisation. The government also stated that it has no plans to use the surveillance methods for the purposes of social credit scoring or moral policing.\n\n- Aradhana Aravindan.

In essence, the strategy is designed to harness AI as a transformative, general\u2011purpose technology that can uplift lives, drive new growth sectors, and address complex challenges such as healthcare, transportation, education, and public service delivery\u2014all while ensuring responsible, ethical, and secure deployment.\n\nBelow are the key components of the strategy:\n\n### 1. Vision and Philosophy\n- **AI for the Public Good:**  \n  Singapore\u2019s strategy is anchored by the vision \u201cAI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World.\u201d This reflects the belief that AI must serve society by improving public services, enhancing the quality of life, and reducing inequality. The approach emphasizes that AI is not just an economic opportunity but an essential driver for a sustainable and inclusive future.  \n- **Human-Centricity:**  \n  The national AI strategy is explicitly human-centric. It prioritizes empowering citizens and businesses through enhanced digital literacy and upskilling, ensuring that AI complements human expertise rather than replacing it.  \n- **Necessity, Global Outlook, and Systems Approach:**  \n  Recognizing that AI is rapidly becoming indispensable for national competitiveness, the strategy shifts the mindset from seeing AI as an \u201copportunity\u201d to treating it as a \u201cmust-have\u201d capability. Furthermore, Singapore positions itself to operate globally by building international partnerships and integrating AI into a comprehensive system that spans all sectors.\n\n### 2. National AI Projects\n- **Targeted, High-Impact Initiatives:**  \n  Initially launched as a series of National AI Projects, the strategy focuses on concrete use cases in critical sectors such as healthcare (e.g. chronic disease management and advanced diagnostics), transportation and logistics (intelligent freight planning and border clearance operations), education (personalized learning), and municipal services (improving public infrastructure through AI\u2010powered chatbots and sensors). These projects serve as both pilots and demonstrators of AI\u2019s transformative potential.  \n- **Scalable Impact:**  \n  By carefully selecting projects that address real societal and economic challenges, Singapore aims to create scalable models that can be adapted and extended across industries.\n\n### 3. Ecosystem Enablers\nTo support widespread and sustainable AI adoption, the strategy emphasizes building robust ecosystem enablers:\n- **Triple Helix Partnerships:**  \n  Collaboration among government agencies, industry players, and research institutions is fundamental. This \u201ctriple helix\u201d model ensures that research breakthroughs translate into commercial applications and public services.\n- **Talent and Education:**  \n  There is a strong focus on nurturing an AI-ready workforce through conversion programs, apprenticeships, and upskilling initiatives. The goal is to dramatically increase the number of AI practitioners and attract global talent to Singapore.\n- **Data Architecture:**  \n  Reliable, secure, and accessible data is recognized as the bedrock of AI innovation. The strategy calls for building frameworks that allow cross-sector data sharing while safeguarding privacy and ensuring data integrity.\n- **Trusted Regulatory Environment:**  \n  Singapore is pioneering frameworks such as the Model AI Governance Framework and AI Verify to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly. These initiatives provide clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, fairness, and accountability, thereby building public trust.\n- **International Collaboration:**  \n  With a global outlook, Singapore actively seeks partnerships with international organizations and participates in global AI discourse. This positions the nation as a hub not only for technological innovation but also for shaping emerging AI regulations and standards.\n\n### 4. Governance and Ethical Frameworks\n- **Model AI Governance Frameworks:**  \n  Early on, Singapore set a benchmark with its Model AI Governance Framework, which was among the first comprehensive guides for responsible AI use. The recent updates (including NAIS 2.0) extend this work to address challenges specific to generative AI, emphasizing testing, risk mitigation, and robust incident reporting.\n- **Risk Management and Continuous Improvement:**  \n  The strategy includes mechanisms for third-party testing, regulatory sandboxes, and agile governance. This dynamic approach allows policies to evolve in step with rapid technological advancements, ensuring that ethical and security risks are continuously managed.\n\n### 5. A Systems Approach for the Future\n- **From Projects to Systems:**  \n  The updated National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0) marks a shift from isolated flagship projects to a comprehensive systems approach. This means integrating AI capabilities into the nation\u2019s infrastructure, ensuring interoperability across sectors, and establishing a virtuous cycle where deployment, evaluation, and scaling of AI solutions reinforce one another.\n- **Long-Term Commitment:**  \n  With plans to invest significantly in computing power, research and development, and talent (often with investments exceeding S$500 million), Singapore is setting up the foundation for enduring leadership in AI. This long-term perspective is designed to sustain AI-driven innovation even as the global landscape evolves.\n\n### Conclusion\nSingapore\u2019s national AI strategy is as much about ethical and societal transformation as it is about economic growth. By focusing on human-centricity, fostering robust partnerships, and embedding AI within a well-governed, scalable system, the strategy aims to position Singapore as a global leader in AI. This forward-thinking, integrated approach not only maximizes the technology\u2019s potential but also ensures that its benefits are distributed widely and responsibly.\n\n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":6089,"end_idx":6108,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"National AI Strategy - Smart Nation Singapore","url":"https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/nais/","attribution":"smartnation.gov.sg","pub_date":null,"snippet":"We intend to direct AI towards addressing the needs and challenges of our time, such as in areas of global importance like population health and climate change."}]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":6109,"end_idx":6128,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] AI for the Public Good For Singapore and the World - go.gov.sg","url":"https://file.go.gov.sg/nais2023.pdf","attribution":"file.go.gov.sg","pub_date":1701648000.0,"snippet":"Our second National AI Strategy, or NAIS 2.0, represents Singapore's commitment to realise the benefits of AI, and to create exciting new ..."}]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":6129,"end_idx":6148,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Singapore's AI strategy | by Shailendra Kumar","url":"https://medium.com/%40meisshaily/the-ultimate-guide-to-singapores-ai-strategy-27f8e333f887","attribution":"medium.com","pub_date":1730246400.0,"snippet":"Singapore's national AI strategy aims to leverage AI to create economic value, enhance citizen lives, and equip the workforce with the necessary skills for an ..."}]}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"5a63f87e-9ce2-4251-8468-8afc9fa4b354","request_id":"90b3ff4928739c47-SEA","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5a63f87e-9ce2-4251-8468-8afc9fa4b354","children":[]}}}
