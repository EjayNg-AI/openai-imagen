summary\\n\\n\\u201cSkills\\u201d (in the modern AI coding-agent sense) are **portable, modular packages** that extend an agent with **specialized instructions, workflows, and optionally runnable code and assets**, usually organized as a folder anchored by a required `SKILL.md` manifest. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn12view0\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn22view0\\ue201\\n\\nA central design idea is **progressive disclosure**: agents load only **lightweight metadata** (primarily `name` and `description`) for many skills up front, and load the full `SKILL.md` body and any referenced files **only when the skill becomes relevant**. This keeps context usage and latency manageable while still enabling \\u201cdeep\\u201d procedural guidance on demand. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn12view0\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn11view0\\ue202turn15view1\\ue202turn22view0\\ue201\\n\\nIn practice, you should view skills as the **\\u201cmiddle layer\\u201d between system prompts and tools**:\\n\\n- **System prompts** define always-on behavior and global constraints.\\n- **Tools** provide atomic, typed capabilities that can create side effects (API calls, file actions, shell).\\n- **Skills** package **repeatable procedures** (how-to + scripts + templates) that the agent can mount and apply when needed, and version independently. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn22view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue201\\n\\nA key implementation reality is that **skill routing is probabilistic**: many agents still fail to reliably \\u201cdecide\\u201d to load the right skill purely from metadata. As a result, good skill engineering includes (a) carefully scoped descriptions and negative triggers, (b) explicit invocation paths (slash commands, `$skill-name`), and (c) systematic evaluation (\\u201cevals\\u201d) to detect regressions in triggering and procedure execution. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view0\\ue202turn26view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn15view1\\ue201\\n\\nSecurity-wise, skills must be treated like software dependencies: scripts and tool instructions can cause harmful side effects if over-permissioned or malicious. Best practice is defense-in-depth: least-privilege tools, sandboxes, approvals, allowlists, logging/auditing, and supply-chain review for third-party skills. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn18view0\\ue202turn21view0\\ue202turn29view0\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn28view0\\ue202turn14view0\\ue201\\n\\n**Assumptions used in this report (because you did not specify a single agent framework):**  \\n\\u201cskills.md\\u201d is interpreted as the *entry documentation* developers start from (often a `skills.md` page in docs), while each individual skill is defined by `SKILL.md` per the open Agent Skills specification. Where tooling-specific behavior differs (e.g., Codex vs Copilot vs other runners), the report calls it out explicitly. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn15view0\\ue201\\n\\n## Definitions and conceptual model\\n\\n### What \\u201cskills\\u201d mean in agentic coding systems\\n\\nThe open Agent Skills format defines a **skill** as a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description`) plus a Markdown body of instructions; the directory may also include `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue201\\n\\nMultiple major agent surfaces describe skills similarly:\\n\\n- **\\ue200entity\\ue202[\\\"company\\\",\\\"OpenAI\\\",\\\"ai research company\\\"]\\ue201 Codex**: \\u201cA skill packages instructions, resources, and optional scripts so Codex can follow a workflow reliably,\\u201d and uses progressive disclosure (metadata first, full `SKILL.md` on activation). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn22view0\\ue201  \\n- **\\ue200entity\\ue202[\\\"company\\\",\\\"GitHub\\\",\\\"code hosting platform\\\"]\\ue201 Copilot / Visual Studio Code agent mode**: Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that load when relevant and follow the open standard. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn15view0\\ue202turn15view1\\ue201  \\n\\nThese definitions imply a critical distinction: skills are not \\u201cjust prompts.\\u201d They are **packaged operational knowledge**\\u2014procedural guidance, examples, and executable helpers\\u2014designed to be discovered, loaded, and applied on demand. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn12view0\\ue202turn22view0\\ue201\\n\\n### Skills vs tools vs agent prompting in the research literature\\n\\nIn academic and industry discussions of tool-using agents, the core loop is: the model **reasons**, chooses an **action/tool call**, observes the result, then continues. ReAct formalizes this \\u201cReasoning + Acting\\u201d alternation and shows improved factuality/robustness by letting the model call external sources during problem solving. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn2search1\\ue201\\n\\nToolformer shows that models can learn to decide *when* and *how* to call tools (APIs), improving performance on tasks where tools are superior (e.g., retrieval, arithmetic) without giving up general language capability. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn2search2\\ue201\\n\\nMRKL Systems describes a modular architecture combining LLMs with external modules for knowledge and reasoning, reinforcing the broader trend toward **compositional agent architectures** where specialized components handle specialized work. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn2search23\\ue201\\n\\nSkills fit into this evolution as a **packaging and \\u201cprocedural memory\\u201d layer**:\\n\\n- Tools define *capabilities* (what can be done).\\n- Skills define *procedures* (how to do it reliably in your environment, with your conventions). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn22view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue201\\n\\n### A rigorous definition you can operationalize\\n\\nA practical, implementation-oriented definition consistent with the spec and major agent docs is:\\n\\n> A **skill** is a *discoverable, versionable capability package* consisting of:  \\n> (1) **metadata** used for routing/selection,  \\n> (2) **instructions** describing a workflow (possibly branching), and  \\n> (3) optional **resources** (scripts, templates, references) used during execution\\u2014loaded via progressive disclosure. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn12view0\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn22view0\\ue201\\n\\nThis definition matters because it implies you should engineer skills with the same discipline you apply to software components: interfaces, tests, versioning, observability, and security review. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn18view0\\ue202turn25view0\\ue201\\n\\n## From skills.md to SKILL.md\\n\\n### The \\u201cskills.md\\u201d entrypoint in practice\\n\\nMany ecosystems expose skills through a documentation entrypoint (often literally a `skills.md` doc page). For example, Codex documentation provides developer-facing guidance on what skills are, how they are discovered, how to create them, where to store them, how to enable/disable them, and how to attach additional metadata (UI presentation and MCP dependencies). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201\\n\\nStarting from such documentation, a typical workflow is:\\n\\n1. Create a skill folder with `SKILL.md` containing `name` and `description`.\\n2. Put the folder in an agent-scanned skills directory.\\n3. Test **explicit invocation** (slash commands / `$skill-name`) and **implicit invocation** (routing via description).\\n4. Iterate on metadata and instructions until triggering and execution are reliable.\\n5. Add scripts/assets only where deterministic behavior is needed. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn15view1\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201\\n\\n### SKILL.md structure: required fields, optional fields, and constraints\\n\\nThe Agent Skills specification defines:\\n\\n- **Directory-level minimum**: `skill-name/SKILL.md`. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue201\\n- **SKILL.md format**: YAML frontmatter + Markdown body. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue201\\n- **Required frontmatter fields**: `name`, `description`. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue201\\n- **Optional frontmatter fields**: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` (experimental). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn11view0\\ue201\\n\\nThe spec also constrains `name` (length, casing, characters, and matching parent directory). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue201\\n\\nSome platforms add additional constraints and conventions (e.g., reserved words, restrictions on XML tags).
