Two common fixes:\n\n- \\(C_b(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) (bounded continuous functions) with \\(\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty\\) is a **Banach space** (complete).\n- \\(C_0(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) (continuous functions vanishing at infinity) with \\(\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty\\) is also a **Banach space**; moreover \\(C_c^\\infty\\) (or \\(C_c\\)) is dense in \\(C_0\\) and the completion of \\(C_c\\) under \\(\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty\\) is \\(C_0\\).\n\nDuals in this regime:\n- \\((C_0(\\mathbb{R}^n),\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)^*\\cong \\mathcal M(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\), the finite signed (regular Radon) measures, via \\(f\\mapsto\\int f\\,d\\mu\\) (Riesz\u2013Markov).

In practice, theoretical physics almost never works with \u201call continuous functions on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\)\u201d as a single primary space. Different tasks demand different function spaces/topologies. Here\u2019s a quick, use-in-physics map:\n\n# What physicists actually use\n\n### 1) \\(L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) (Hilbert space) \u2014 **primary in nonrelativistic QM**\n- **Why:** Square-integrable wavefunctions; inner product gives probabilities and the spectral theorem.\n- **Relation to \\(C(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\):** \\(C_c^\\infty\\subset C_0 \\subset L^2\\) and is **dense** in \\(L^2\\), but \\(C(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) with an \\(L^2\\) norm is **not complete**; its completion is \\(L^2\\).\n- **Dual/completeness:** \\(L^2\\) is complete; the dual is (anti-)isomorphic to \\(L^2\\) (Riesz).\n\n### 2) Schwartz space \\(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) and tempered distributions \\(\\mathcal{S}'\\) \u2014 **workhorse in QFT & scattering**\n- **Why:** You need Fourier transforms, momentum-space analysis, and distributions for Green\u2019s functions and fields; all are cleanest on \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (a complete nuclear Fr\u00e9chet space) and its strong dual \\(\\mathcal{S}'\\) (complete).\n- **Physics point:** Wightman fields are **operator-valued distributions** acting on test functions (usually \\(\\mathcal{S}\\)); correlation functions live naturally in \\(\\mathcal{S}'\\).\n\n### 3) \\(C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) and distributions \\(\\mathcal{D}'=(C_c^\\infty)'\\) \u2014 **PDE/field equations, curved spacetime QFT**\n- **Why:** Hyperbolic PDEs, retarded/advanced propagators, and local covariance on manifolds prefer compact support tests. \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is complete (LF-space), its strong dual \\(\\mathcal{D}'\\) is complete.\n\n### 4) \\(C_0(X)\\) with \\(\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty\\) \u2014 **C\\(^*\\)-algebraic formulations, classical limits, probability**\n- **Why:** For a locally compact configuration space \\(X\\), the commutative C\\(^*\\)-algebra \\(C_0(X)\\) models **classical observables**; by Riesz\u2013Markov, *states* are Radon probability measures. In algebraic/statistical mechanics and the classical\u2013quantum interface (Gelfand\u2013Naimark), \\(C_0(X)\\) is the right object.\n- **Completeness:** \\(C_0(X)\\) is Banach; its dual is the Banach space of finite regular Borel measures \\(\\mathcal{M}(X)\\).\n\n### 5) Sobolev spaces \\(H^s(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\), other \\(L^p\\)\u2019s \u2014 **spectral theory, QFT renormalization on lattices/continuum**\n- **Why:** Domain issues for unbounded operators (Hamiltonians), elliptic/hyperbolic estimates, energy methods. These are Banach/Hilbert and complete. \\(C^\\infty_c\\) is typically dense.\n\n### 6) \\(C_0([0,T])\\) with sup norm \u2014 **stochastic/Euclidean QFT (Wiener measure)**\n- **Why:** Brownian paths, Schwinger functions, Feynman\u2013Kac; the probability measure lives on a Banach space of continuous paths (vanishing at 0).\n\n# What\u2019s *not* typically used as the main stage\n\n- **All of \\(C(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) with compact-open topology:** mathematically nice (Fr\u00e9chet, complete), but seldom the \u201cnative\u201d phase space in physics calculations.\n- **\\(C_b(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\) with \\(\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty\\):** technically fine, but its dual involves measures on the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification \\(\\beta\\mathbb{R}^n\\), which has no clear physical meaning. Physicists prefer \\(C_0\\) so that the dual is honest measures on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\).\n\n# Dual/completeness summary (physics-relevant cases)\n- \\(L^2\\): complete; dual \\(\\cong L^2\\) (via Riesz).\n- \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): complete nuclear Fr\u00e9chet; strong dual \\(\\mathcal{S}'\\) complete.\n- \\(\\mathcal{D}\\): complete LF; strong dual \\(\\mathcal{D}'\\) complete.\n- \\(C_0(X)\\): Banach; dual \\(\\mathcal{M}(X)\\) Banach (complete).\n\n# Practical guidance\n- **QM on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\):** build on \\(L^2\\), with a **rigged Hilbert space** (Gelfand triple) \\(\\mathcal{S}\\subset L^2\\subset \\mathcal{S}'\\) to handle generalized eigenvectors (plane waves, Dirac deltas).\n- **PDE and scattering:** use \\(H^s\\) and \\(\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{S}'\\) for Fourier-space tools; \\(\\mathcal{D}/\\mathcal{D}'\\) for locality/causality and finite propagation speed.\n- **Axiomatic/algebraic QFT:** treat fields as operator-valued distributions on \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (or \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) on manifolds).

quantum mechanics\u201d (LQM) means imposing the **principle of locality**\u2014that measurements and operations performed in one spacetime region cannot instantaneously influence those in a spacelike-separated region\u2014at the level of quantum theory itself.  \nIt\u2019s the **bridge concept** between standard, single-system quantum mechanics and the fully field-theoretic or algebraic formulation of QFT.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201clocal\u201d means here\n### In ordinary (nonrelativistic) QM\nWe treat a system as one global object with a single Hilbert space \\( \\mathcal H \\) and global observables acting on it. Spatial separation is encoded only through tensor products (e.g., particle 1 \u2297 particle 2), but there is no intrinsic notion of *region of space* inside the formalism.\n\n### In local quantum mechanics\nWe assign to each *spatial region* \\(O\\subset \\mathbb R^3\\) (or spacetime region in a relativistic version) a **subalgebra of observables**\n\\[\n\\mathcal A(O)\\subset B(\\mathcal H)\n\\]\nsatisfying\n- **Isotony:** \\(O_1\\subset O_2 \\Rightarrow \\mathcal A(O_1)\\subset\\mathcal A(O_2)\\)  \n- **Locality / microcausality:** if \\(O_1\\) and \\(O_2\\) are spacelike separated, observables commute:  \n  \\([A,B]=0,\\ \\forall A\\in\\mathcal A(O_1),\\,B\\in\\mathcal A(O_2)\\)  \n- **Covariance:** Poincar\u00e9 (or Galilean) transformations map regions and algebras consistently.  \n- **Completeness:** the global algebra is generated by all local ones.\n\nThis is essentially the **Haag\u2013Kastler** structure but applied even to \u201cquantum-mechanical\u201d systems with finitely many degrees of freedom by embedding them into local nets.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why it matters\n### (a) **Conceptual consistency with relativity**\nStandard QM allows instantaneous collapse across arbitrary distances\u2014violating relativistic causality if taken literally. LQM reformulates measurement and interaction so that all physically meaningful operations are localized and commute at spacelike separation. No superluminal signaling survives.\n\n### (b) **Foundation for quantum field theory**\nQFT is *by construction* local: fields are operator-valued distributions, and their smeared versions over test functions \\(f(x)\\) supported in \\(O\\) generate \\(\\mathcal A(O)\\). LQM is the \u201cfinite-degree-of-freedom limit\u201d of this idea. Understanding it clarifies why fields must be distributions and why observables associated with disjoint regions commute.\n\n### (c) **Entanglement and causality structure**\nIn LQM one can rigorously separate *entanglement* (nonlocal correlations) from *nonlocal dynamics*. The algebras \\(\\mathcal A(O_1)\\) and \\(\\mathcal A(O_2)\\) can be entangled even though they commute; this is the origin of area-law entanglement entropy and the Unruh effect.\n\n### (d) **Quantum information and measurement theory**\nModern quantum information in relativistic or spatially extended settings uses LQM. Concepts like **local operations and classical communication (LOCC)**, quantum channel locality, and algebraic independence all rest on the same structure.\n\n### (e) **Bridge to algebraic QFT and quantum gravity**\nIn algebraic QFT the local net \\(O\\mapsto \\mathcal A(O)\\) *is* the theory.  \nIn quantum gravity, efforts to reconcile holography, locality, and diffeomorphism invariance (e.g. subregion duality in AdS/CFT) reinterpret LQM notions\u2014sometimes showing where strict locality must fail.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Direct and emerging real-world applications\n\n### (a) **Quantum information & quantum networks**\n- **Motivation:** In real devices, subsystems (nodes, labs, or qubits) are *spatially separated*. LQM provides the correct language to describe *operations localized in space\u2013time* that respect relativistic causality.  \n- **Use cases:**\n  - Secure quantum communication protocols (QKD, teleportation) analysed using *local operations and classical communication* (LOCC), an operational expression of LQM.\n  - Distributed quantum computing and *quantum networks*: Local algebraic models guarantee no-signalling across network nodes.\n  - Device-independent cryptography: Local commutation relations are the mathematical backbone of \u201cno-signalling\u201d constraints in Bell-type inequalities and self-testing protocols.\n\n### (b) **Quantum field sensors and relativistic quantum technologies**\n- Atomic clocks, quantum accelerometers, and satellite interferometers increasingly probe regimes where *spatial separation* and *time ordering* are non-trivial.  \n  LQM provides the correct covariant framework for these \u201crelativistic quantum technologies,\u201d ensuring that signal propagation and entanglement swapping obey microcausality.\n\n### (c) **Condensed-matter and many-body systems**\n- The algebraic, locality-based viewpoint gives rise to:\n  - **Lieb\u2013Robinson bounds:** finite propagation speed of correlations in lattice systems \u2014 a discrete analogue of microcausality.  \n    These bounds justify why local quantum simulators can mimic large systems efficiently.\n  - **Topological order and quantum error correction:** Local operator algebras encode \u201ccode subspaces\u201d (Haah codes, toric code, holographic codes).  \n    Modern topological quantum computing explicitly builds on the locality structure of LQM.\n\n### (d) **Quantum thermodynamics and statistical mechanics**\n- The algebraic (local) approach yields a rigorous definition of equilibrium states as **KMS states** on local algebras, forming the foundation of:\n  - Modern nonequilibrium statistical mechanics,\n  - Thermal field theory,\n  - Open-system modelling where only *local* environments interact with the system.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Influence on theoretical and foundational research\n\n### (a) **Quantum field theory (QFT) and particle physics**\n- Haag\u2013Kastler locality underlies algebraic QFT and its rigorous results:\n  - CPT and spin\u2013statistics theorems,\n  - Haag\u2019s theorem (non-existence of a global interaction picture),\n  - Modular localization and Bisognano\u2013Wichmann relations (linking Lorentz boosts and thermal behaviour of the vacuum).  \n- These tools feed directly into the **structure of the Standard Model** (via Wightman reconstruction and axiomatic approaches).\n\n### (b) **Quantum gravity and holography**\n- In AdS/CFT and related holographic models, **emergent locality** is a major research frontier.  \n  LQM provides the baseline to understand *how* locality fails or becomes approximate when gravity is dynamical.\n- Subregion duality, entanglement wedges, and quantum error-correcting codes (e.g., HaPPY networks) reinterpret local algebra inclusion theorems (\\(\\mathcal A(O_1)\\subset \\mathcal A(O_2)\\)) in holographic terms.\n\n### (c) **Cosmology and curved spacetime QFT**\n- Local quantum field theory (built from LQM principles) is the **only consistent framework** for quantized fields on curved backgrounds.  \n  It is used to define:\n  - Hawking radiation,\n  - Unruh effect,\n  - Particle creation in expanding universes,\n  - Hadamard states (local vacuum condition).  \n  These are foundational for astrophysical predictions tested by gravitational-wave and CMB observations.\n\n### (d) **Quantum foundations**\n- LQM gives a clean separation between *nonlocal correlations* (entanglement) and *nonlocal dynamics* (superluminal signalling).  \n  This distinction clarifies:\n  - Bell inequalities,\n  - Relativistic causality constraints,\n  - Objective collapse and hidden-variable models (e.g., GRW, relativistic extensions).  \n\n---\n\n## 3.
