Plants concentrate on either activity depending on lighting conidtions.\r\n\r\n- **Nutrient K Sensor (ppm):**\r\n  - **Substantial IQR (96.00):** Highlights considerable variability in potassium levels, which might influence plant health or require nutrient management adjustments.\r\n\r\n- **pH Sensor:**\r\n  - **Narrow IQR (0.50):** Despite outliers, most pH readings are tightly clustered around neutral pH, indicating stable conditions with occasional deviations. This should be good for crop growth. Plants need a stable pH to absorb nutrients effectively.\r\n\r\n- **Temperature Sensor (\u00b0C):**\r\n  - **Moderate IQR (2.13):** Reflects generally consistent temperature control with some variability, possibly due to external weather changes or internal system adjustments.\r\n\r\n- **Water Level Sensor (mm):**\r\n  - **Consistent Range:** With a relatively small IQR and no outliers, water levels appear to be well-maintained within expected parameters. This should also be good for crop health.\r\n\r\n### **Insights from Histograms and Kernel Density Estimation Plots**\r\n\r\n- Humidity Sensor has two modes: one around 67.5 and the other around 72.5. This could be linked to whether plants are carrying out transpiration, which is the process by which plants release water from their leaves into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n- CO\u2082 levels are evenly distributed in the 800-1200 ppm range, have a sharp decrease in frequency after 1200 ppm, and are evenly distributed in the 1200-1500 ppm range. The sharp frequency decrease which very neatly divides CO\u2082 levels into two distinct categories (high: 1200-1500ppm and low: 800-1200ppm) may indicate that when crops undergo photosynthesis, the CO\u2082 level is in the low category, but if crops stop photosynthesis, the CO\u2082 level is in the high category.\r\n\r\n- EC Sensor and pH sensor has an almost perfect bell-shaped distribution, possibly suggesting a Gaussian distribution.\r\n\r\n### **Observations from Counts of Plant Types and Plant Stages**\r\n\r\n- The counts of Plant Types and Plant Stages shows that the dataset is evenly balanced across different types of crops, and across different growth stages respectively. \r\n  - This balance implies that the dataset is representative of a diverse range of crops and growth stages, which is essential for building robust models that can generalize well to various plant species and growth phases.\r\n  - There is no need for extra measures to balance the dataset as the risk of bias due to imbalanced classes is minimal in this scenario.\r\n\r\n### **Observations from the box plots for Temperature Sensor by plant types and growth stages**\r\n\r\n- Temperature Sensor is identically distributed across all plant types in the Previous Cycle Plant Types\r\n  - This indicates that the type of plant grown previously in the same location is not associated with temperature.\r\n  - This is expected, as the previous plant type should not have a direct impact on the current temperature which is determined by current environmental conditions, not previous plant type.\r\n\r\n- Plants in the vegetative state seem to be correlated with lower temperatures compared to other phases of growth.\r\n  - This suggests that the vegetative state may require lower temperatures for optimal growth compared to the seedling and maturity stages.\r\n  - It could also mean that for plants in the vegetative state, the act of sprinkling water on them to ensure proper hydration may lead to a cooling effect.\r\n\r\n- Leafy greens in the Plant Type category are associated with lower temperatures compared to other plant types.\r\n  - This indicates that leafy greens may require cooler temperatures for optimal growth compared to other plant types.\r\n  - Hence leafy greens in the vegetative state may grow well in cooler temperatures.\r\n\r\n### **Observations for Box Plots with respect to Numerical Features for different Plant Type and Plant Stage categories**\r\n\r\n- The seedlings appear to be associated with \r\n  - higher humidity\r\n  - lower light intensity, carbon dioxide levels, nitrogen levels, phosphorous levels, and potassium levels\r\n  - **Possible Reasons**: Seedlings are young plants that require high humidity to prevent water loss and low light intensity to prevent damage to their delicate leaves. They also require lower levels of nutrients and carbon dioxide as they are still establishing their root systems.\r\n\r\n- Leafy greens appear to be associated with\r\n  - lower light intensity, lower carbon dioxide levels, lower nitrogen levels, lower phosphorous levels\r\n  - **Possible Reasons**: Leafy greens may require lower light intensity to prevent wilting and lower nutrient levels to prevent nutrient burn.\r\n\r\n### **Observations of the Scatter Plots of Temperature Sensor versus each numerical feature by Plant Type and by Plant Stage**\r\n\r\n- Each type of crop and each growth phase seems to be associated with a highly specific range for the Temperature variable and for most numerical features. Some examples are given below:\r\n\r\n- **Temperature versus Light Intensity**\r\n  - Fruiting vegetables occupy two rectangular grids. The first grid is a temperature range of 24 to 26 degrees by a light intensity of 400 to 600 lux. The second grid is a temperature range of 22 to 28 degrees by a light intensity of 600 to 800 lux. \r\n  - Very similar rectangular grids or union of disjoint rectangular grids are occupied by other crop types.\r\n  - Seedlings occupy three disjoint rectangular grids. The first grid is a temperature range of 22 to 24 degrees by a light intensity of 100 to 200 lux. The second grid is a temperature range of 22 to 26 degrees by a light intensity of 200 to 300 lux. The third grid is a temperature range of 24 to 26 degrees by a light intensity of 400 to 600 lux.\r\n  - Very similar rectangular grids or union of disjoint rectangular grids are occupied by crops in other growth stages.\r\n\r\n- **Temperature versus other numerical features**\r\n  - Similar rectangular grids of Temperature by Humidity, Temperature by Carbon Dioxide, Temperature by Nutrient N, Temperature by Nutrient P, Temperature by Nutrient K, are also observed for various types of crops in Plant Type.\r\n  - Similar rectangular grids of Temperature by Humidity, Temperature by Carbon Dioxide, Temperature by Nutrient N, Temperature by Nutrient P, Temperature by Nutrient K, are also observed for various growth stages in Plant Stage.\r\n\r\n- **Possible Explanation**: The rectangular grids or union of disjoint rectangular grids suggest that the relationship between Temperature and other numerical features is highly specific to the type of crop being grown and the growth stage of the crop. This indicates that different crops and growth stages have unique requirements for temperature and other environmental factors.\r\n\r\n#### **Analysis of Linear Regression on Temperature Sensor**\r\n\r\nThe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis enables us to analyse  how various environmental and nutrient factors influence the Temperature Sensor (\u00b0C) within a controlled crop-growing setup. With an R-squared of **0.308**, the model explains approximately **30.8%** of the variability in temperature, indicating a moderate fit. Notably, all independent variables, except for the **Previous Cycle Plant Type** categories, are statistically significant predictors of temperature.\r\n\r\n1. **Positive Influences on Temperature:**\r\n   - **Humidity Sensor (%) (Coefficient: 0.1040):** A 1% increase in humidity correlates with a **0.104\u00b0C** rise in temperature. Elevated humidity can reduce heat loss through evaporation, thereby increasing ambient temperature.\r\n   - **Light Intensity Sensor (lux) (Coefficient: 0.0032):** Each additional lux of light intensity raises temperature by **0.0032\u00b0C**. Enhanced lighting not only supports photosynthesis but also contributes to thermal gain.\r\n   - **CO\u2082 Sensor (ppm) (Coefficient: 0.0017):** A 1 ppm increase in CO\u2082 levels is associated with a **0.0017\u00b0C** temperature rise. CO\u2082 enrichment, while beneficial for plant growth, slightly elevates the environmental temperature.\r\n   - **O\u2082 Sensor (ppm) (Coefficient: 0.0484):** Higher oxygen levels increase temperature by **0.0484\u00b0C** per ppm, possibly due to increased metabolic activities.\r\n   - **Nutrient P Sensor (ppm) (Coefficient: 0.0200):** Each ppm increase in phosphorus elevates temperature by **0.0200\u00b0C**, potentially linked to enhanced plant metabolic processes.\r\n   - **pH Sensor (Coefficient: 0.2501):** A unit increase in pH results in a **0.2501\u00b0C** temperature rise, suggesting that soil or nutrient solution alkalinity impacts thermal conditions.\r\n\r\n2. **Negative Influences on Temperature:**\r\n   - **EC Sensor (dS/m) (Coefficient: -0.1446):** Higher electrical conductivity, indicating increased nutrient concentration, reduces temperature by **0.1446\u00b0C** per dS/m. Enhanced nutrient uptake efficiency may lower metabolic heat production.\r\n   - **Nutrient N Sensor (ppm) (Coefficient: -0.0021):** Each ppm increase in nitrogen slightly decreases temperature by **0.0021\u00b0C**, possibly due to improved plant health and reduced stress.\r\n   - **Nutrient K Sensor (ppm) (Coefficient: -0.0081):** Potassium levels inversely affect temperature, with each ppm increase lowering it by **0.0081\u00b0C**. Potassium aids in stomatal regulation, enhancing transpiration and cooling.\r\n   - **Water Level Sensor (mm) (Coefficient: -0.0111):** Increased water levels decrease temperature by **0.0111\u00b0C** per millimeter, as water facilitates evaporative cooling through transpiration.\r\n\r\n3. **Non-Significant Variables:**\r\n   - **Previous Cycle Plant Types:** The categories for herbs, leafy greens, and vine crops do not significantly impact temperature, suggesting that prior plant types have minimal residual effect on current environmental temperature.\r\n\r\n##### **Implications for Controlled Crop Growing**\r\n\r\n1. **Environmental Optimization:**\r\n   - **Balancing Humidity and Light:** Since both humidity and light intensity positively influence temperature, precise control mechanisms are essential to prevent overheating. Implementing shading systems or adjustable lighting can help maintain optimal thermal conditions.\r\n   \r\n2. **Nutrient Management:**\r\n   - **Optimizing Nutrient Levels:** The negative impact of EC, nitrogen, and potassium on temperature highlights the importance of balanced nutrient dosing. Proper nutrient management not only supports plant health but also aids in temperature regulation through physiological processes like transpiration.\r\n   \r\n3. **Watering Strategies:**\r\n   - **Enhancing Cooling Through Water Management:** Maintaining adequate water levels is crucial for cooling via transpiration. Automated irrigation systems responsive to sensor data can ensure consistent hydration, thereby stabilizing temperature fluctuations.\r\n   \r\n4. **CO\u2082 and O\u2082 Control:**\r\n   - **Regulating Gas Levels:** While CO\u2082 enrichment boosts growth, its positive correlation with temperature necessitates careful monitoring to balance growth benefits with thermal management. Similarly, maintaining appropriate oxygen levels supports plant respiration without significantly increasing temperature.\r\n   \r\n5. **pH Regulation:**\r\n   - **Managing Soil/Nutrient Solution pH:** Given the strong positive relationship between pH and temperature, maintaining optimal pH levels is vital. Adjusting pH can influence nutrient availability and microbial activity, indirectly affecting thermal conditions.\r\n\r\n6. **Addressing Multicollinearity:**\r\n   - **Model Refinement:** The high condition number (**46,900**) suggests potential multicollinearity among predictors. Future analyses should consider variable selection or dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance model reliability and interpretability."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8ed53be02cf791c3-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f71ae4c6-8d63-4956-8b69-e205f5c60cc3","children":["e310611a-c8ee-497c-bd9a-29c0068ad81d"]},"e310611a-c8ee-497c-bd9a-29c0068ad81d":{"id":"e310611a-c8ee-497c-bd9a-29c0068ad81d","message":{"id":"e310611a-c8ee-497c-bd9a-29c0068ad81d","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1733414271.956951,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Investigating implications**\n\nI\u2019m working through sensor readings and plant types/stages, identifying crucial EDA insights.

These outliers may result from sensor calibration issues or represent genuine extreme environmental conditions.\n   - **Distribution Patterns:** EC and pH sensors follow near-Gaussian distributions, while the Humidity sensor displays a bimodal distribution, and CO\u2082 levels are distinctly categorized into high and low ranges. Understanding these distributions is essential for selecting appropriate preprocessing techniques, such as normalization or transformation.\n\n2. **Feature Variability and Relationships:**\n   - **High Variability Features:** Light Intensity and CO\u2082 sensors show substantial variability, indicating fluctuating environmental conditions.
