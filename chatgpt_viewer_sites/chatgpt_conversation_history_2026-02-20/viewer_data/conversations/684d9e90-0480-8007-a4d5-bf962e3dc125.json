Identify candidate limit points\n\nFor any fixed \\(y_{0}\\in[-1,1]\\) we can choose a sequence \\(\\{x_{n}\\}_{n\\ge 1}\\) with \\(x_{n}\\to 0\\) and  \n\\[\n\\sin\\!\\bigl(1/x_{n}\\bigr)=y_{0}\\quad\\text{for every }n.\n\\]\n\nIndeed, pick any selection of angles \\(\\theta_{n}\\) satisfying \\(\\sin\\theta_{n}=y_{0}\\) (for example, \\(\\theta_{n} = \\arcsin y_{0}+2\\pi n\\)), and set \\(x_{n}=1/\\theta_{n}\\).  Then\n\\[\n\\bigl(x_{n},\\sin(1/x_{n})\\bigr)=\\bigl(1/\\theta_{n},y_{0}\\bigr)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;(0,y_{0})\n\\quad(n\\to\\infty),\n\\]\nso every point \\((0,y_{0})\\) with \\(y_{0}\\in[-1,1]\\) is a limit point of \\(S\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2.  Show there are no other new limit points\n\n* **Away from \\(x=0\\).**  \n  The map \\(x\\mapsto(x,\\sin(1/x))\\) is continuous at each \\(x\\neq 0\\).  Hence in any open rectangle that stays a positive distance from the \\(y\\)-axis, the image of a compact subinterval is a compact subset of \\(\\mathbb R^{2}\\).  There are therefore no limit points of \\(S\\) in the region \\(\\{\\,|x|\\ge\\varepsilon\\,\\}\\) other than the points of \\(S\\) itself.\n\n* **On the line \\(x=0\\).**  \n  We already found all possible limits there: the vertical segment \\(\\{0\\}\\times[-1,1]\\).  No point \\((0,y)\\) with \\(|y|>1\\) can be approached, because \\(\\sin\\) never attains values outside \\([-1,1]\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3.  Write the closure\n\nCombining these observations, the topological closure \\(\\overline{S}\\) in \\(\\mathbb R^{2}\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\overline{S}\\;=\\;\n\\Bigl\\{(x,\\sin(1/x)) : x\\neq 0\\Bigr\\}\\;\\cup\\;\n\\Bigl\\{(0,y):y\\in[-1,1]\\Bigr\\}\n\\;} .\n\\]\n\nGraphically, it is the usual oscillating graph of \\(\\sin(1/x)\\) together with the entire vertical segment at \\(x=0\\) from \\((-1)\\) to \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Why this matters (brief reflection)\n\nThis classic example illustrates how wildly oscillatory behavior near a point can force the closure of a set to acquire extra \u201chidden\u201d pieces (here, a one-dimensional continuum) even though the defining mapping is perfectly tame away from the problematic point.  It is a staple counter-example when studying limits, sequential characterizations of closure, and local compactness in real analysis and topology."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"3de87134-515f-43ae-9378-a8d767912842","request_id":"94fb16a32af5eba1-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3de87134-515f-43ae-9378-a8d767912842","children":[]}}}
