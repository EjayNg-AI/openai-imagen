The deviation is a *diagnostic* of covalent contribution; it grows with cation charge density and anion polarisability.  \n3.

For precise solid-state thermochemistry, include **polarisation, covalency and many-body effects** either by empirical corrections (Kapustinskii + \u03b4_pol) or by first-principles methods.\n\nWith these refinements, theory and experiment for MgCl\u2082 \u2014 and for other \u201cborderline\u201d ionic compounds \u2014 line up within a few kJ mol\u207b\u00b9."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"b0aa469d-5c72-422f-b815-bd6b4d8c828f","request_id":"954927884c8af918-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"b0aa469d-5c72-422f-b815-bd6b4d8c828f","children":[]}}}
