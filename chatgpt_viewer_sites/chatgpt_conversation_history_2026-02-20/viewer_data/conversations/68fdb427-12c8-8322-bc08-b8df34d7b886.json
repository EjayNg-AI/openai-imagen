It is the **Kelleyfication (k\u2011ification) of the compact\u2013open topology**:\n\n\\[\nC_0(X,Y)\\;=\\;\\text{(set of continuous }X\\!\\to\\! Y\\text{) with the compact\u2013open topology},\\qquad\nC(X,Y)\\;:=\\;k\\,C_0(X,Y).\n\\]\n\nThis is the standard definition used to make CGWH cartesian closed. Strickland states it explicitly and proves the exponential law with this choice. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n### How to phrase it correctly\n\n- The **k\u2011ification** \\(k(-)\\) is the **left adjoint** to the inclusion \\( \\mathrm{CG} \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{Top}\\). Equivalently, for a given topology \\(\\tau\\) on a set, \\(k(\\tau)\\) is the **finest compactly generated topology that is coarser than \\(\\tau\\)**. Applied to \\(C_0(X,Y)\\), this says:  \n  > *\\(C(X,Y)\\) is obtained by coarsening the compact\u2013open topology to the finest compactly generated one.*  \n  (So it\u2019s a coarsening of compact\u2013open, but the finest such coarsening.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n- With this topology one has:\n  * If \\(X\\) is CG and \\(Y\\) is CGWH, then **\\(C(X,Y)\\) is CGWH**. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201\n  * The **exponential law** holds naturally:\n    \\[\n      \\mathrm{CGWH}(Z\\times X,\\,Y)\\;\\cong\\;\\mathrm{CGWH}\\bigl(Z,\\,C(X,Y)\\bigr),\n    \\]\n    so CGWH is cartesian closed. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Why \u201ccoarsest\u201d or \u201cfinest\u201d (unqualified) is misleading\n\n- Saying \u201c**coarsest** topology making \\(C(X,Y)\\) a CGWH space\u201d is wrong in general: there is no canonical least CGWH topology on a given set, and in any case the k\u2011ified compact\u2013open is **not** minimal among all CGWH topologies.\n\n- Saying \u201c**finest** topology\u201d is also wrong: the compact\u2013open topology itself is finer, but may fail to be compactly generated. What is true (and precise) is the **order statement relative to compact\u2013open** above: *\\(k(C_0(X,Y))\\) is the finest compactly generated topology **coarser than** the compact\u2013open topology.*\n\n---\n\n### Suggested wording\n\n> *In CGWH, the mapping space \\(C(X,Y)\\) is the Kelleyfication of the compact\u2013open topology on the set of continuous maps \\(X\\to Y\\). Equivalently, it is the finest compactly generated topology coarser than the compact\u2013open topology; with this choice \\(C(X,Y)\\) is CGWH and CGWH is cartesian closed.*\n\nThis avoids the \u201ccoarsest vs finest\u201d trap and says exactly what is used in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn3view1\ue202turn0search8\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":457,"end_idx":474,"safe_urls":["https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ncatlab.org](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"","url":"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"ncatlab.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201","start_idx":998,"end_idx":1017,"safe_urls":["https://academicweb.nd.edu/~mbehren1/18.906spring10/lec02.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Academic Web Service](https://academicweb.nd.edu/~mbehren1/18.906spring10/lec02.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"LECTURE 2: COMPACTLY GENERATED SPACES ...","url":"https://academicweb.nd.edu/~mbehren1/18.906spring10/lec02.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1265669896,"snippet":"If X is weak Hausdorff, then X is compactly generated if and only if it has the topology of the union of its compact subspaces.
