The basic setup: why entanglement *looks* like a comms channel\n\nTake a maximally entangled pair, say the singlet state  \n\\[\n\\lvert\\Psi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big(\\lvert 0\\rangle_A\\lvert 1\\rangle_B - \\lvert 1\\rangle_A\\lvert 0\\rangle_B\\big).\n\\]\n\nAlice has system \\(A\\), Bob has system \\(B\\), far apart.\n\n- If Alice measures in the \\(\\{\\lvert 0\\rangle,\\lvert 1\\rangle\\}\\) basis and gets \\(0\\), Bob will *if he measures in the same basis* certainly get \\(1\\).  \n- If she gets \\(1\\), he certainly gets \\(0\\).\n\nSo it\u2019s tempting to think: *\u201cGreat, Alice just chooses what to measure and thereby sends a bit to Bob instantaneously.\u201d* But that intuition fails for a precise reason.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The no-signalling theorem in one line\n\nThe **no-signalling theorem** says: *Bob\u2019s local statistics cannot depend on what Alice does to her system, as long as they are space-like separated.*\n\nFormally, look at Bob\u2019s **reduced density matrix** \\(\\rho_B\\), obtained by tracing out Alice\u2019s system:\n\\[\n\\rho_B = \\text{Tr}_A\\big(\\lvert\\Psi^-\\rangle\\langle\\Psi^-\\rvert\\big)\n       = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\lvert 0\\rangle\\langle 0\\rvert + \\lvert 1\\rangle\\langle 1\\rvert\\big)\n       = \\frac{I}{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow let Alice do *anything allowed by quantum mechanics* on her side:\n\n- Measure in any basis,\n- Apply any unitary,\n- Perform any local operation\u2013plus\u2013classical-ancilla,\n- Even choose her measurement based on a random or deterministic algorithm.\n\nAs long as she doesn\u2019t send Bob a classical message about her outcome, **Bob\u2019s local state is still \\(\\rho_B = I/2\\)**. \n\nThat means:\n\n- Bob always sees a fair coin: 0 or 1 with probability \\(1/2\\).\n- The distribution of his outcomes is **independent of Alice\u2019s choices**.\n- Therefore, he has no way to infer whether Alice did \u201coperation X\u201d or \u201coperation Y\u201d at a distance.\n\nSo there are correlations that *exist in the joint distribution* of their data, but **they only become visible when Alice and Bob later compare notes using an ordinary (light-speed-limited) classical channel**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. \u201cBut collapse is instantaneous, isn\u2019t that information?\u201d\n\nTwo key clarifications:\n\n1. **\u201cWavefunction collapse\u201d is not a signal.**  \n   The update from an entangled state to a post-measurement state is partly an update of *our description* (or \u201cknowledge,\u201d depending on interpretation). Locally, nothing observable at Bob changes until he conditions on Alice\u2019s result.\n\n2. **No local observable can detect \u201cremote collapse.\u201d**  \n   If Bob only has access to his subsystem, any measurement he makes is governed by \\(\\rho_B = I/2\\). There is *no experiment* he can run to tell whether Alice has measured her qubit, changed her measurement basis, or done nothing at all.\n\nSo while some interpretations talk about \u201cinstantaneous collapse,\u201d **that collapse is not a usable signal**. It doesn\u2019t encode a freely choosable message that Bob can decode without classical communication.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What about quantum teleportation, superdense coding, etc.?\n\nThese often get invoked as \u201centanglement-based communication,\u201d but both are explicitly **limited by classical signalling**.\n\n### Quantum teleportation\nQuantum teleportation takes:\n\n- A pre-shared entangled pair,\n- An unknown quantum state \\(\\lvert\\phi\\rangle\\) at Alice,\n- Alice\u2019s joint measurement result (2 classical bits),\n- Bob\u2019s corresponding unitary correction.\n\nCrucial point: **Bob needs those 2 classical bits**. Without them, his local state is maximally mixed; he can\u2019t reconstruct \\(\\lvert\\phi\\rangle\\). The classical bits travel at or below light speed, so teleportation doesn\u2019t beat relativity.\n\n### Superdense coding\nSuperdense coding lets Alice send **2 classical bits** by transmitting **1 qubit** when she and Bob share entanglement:\n\n- They pre-share an entangled pair.\n- Alice encodes two bits via one of four local unitaries on her half.\n- She then *physically sends that qubit* to Bob.\n- Bob performs a joint measurement and recovers the 2 bits.\n\nAgain, **the qubit itself has to travel**. No \u201cremote\u201d signalling via entanglement alone.\n\n---\n\n## 5. \u201cSimilar methods\u201d: can we hack around this?\n\nIf by \u201csimilar methods\u201d you mean things like:\n\n- **Delayed-choice experiments**,  \n- **Entanglement swapping**,  \n- **Weak measurements with post-selection**,  \n- **Bell-test style nonlocal correlations**,  \n\nall of these respect the same no-signalling constraints. They give weird, non-classical correlations, but **no controllable superluminal communication**.\n\nThe deeper reason is structural: standard quantum mechanics is **linear** and **unitary**, and combined with special relativity\u2019s causal structure, that enforces no-signalling. \n\nIn fact:\n\n- There are theorems (e.g. Gisin-type results) showing that if you modify quantum mechanics to be **non-linear** in certain ways, then entanglement *would* allow faster-than-light signalling.  \n- The absence of observed FTL signalling is one of the reasons such non-linear theories are strongly constrained or considered non-viable.\n\nSo within the usual framework (Hilbert spaces, linear Schr\u00f6dinger evolution, standard measurement postulates), **entanglement cannot be turned into an FTL comms channel**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. So what *can* entanglement do information-theoretically?\n\nEven though it cannot send signals on its own, entanglement is extremely powerful as a *resource*:\n\n- It enables **quantum key distribution (QKD)** security proofs (e.g. Ekert-type protocols).\n- It allows **teleportation** and **superdense coding**.\n- It lets you beat classical limits in communication complexity tasks (e.g. reducing the number of bits needed if you share entanglement).\n- It underpins **quantum error correction** and **fault-tolerant quantum computation**.\n\nBut all of these respect the light-cone: whenever actual \u201cwho-chose-what\u201d information has to be transmitted, there is always a classical or physical channel bounded by \\(c\\).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bottom line\n\n- **Entanglement gives nonlocal correlations**, not nonlocal control.  \n- **No experiment on your local subsystem can reveal what a distant party did with their half**, unless you later exchange classical information.  \n- Thus, **no information (in the usual sense of a freely chosen message) can be transmitted solely via entanglement or any similar non-signalling quantum correlation.**\n\nIf you want, we can formalize the no-signalling theorem at the density-matrix / completely positive map level and go through a clean proof that *any* local operation on Alice\u2019s side leaves Bob\u2019s reduced state unchanged."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"85b87638-d6b2-4ba8-b3aa-517398bc6fcb","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"0497786b-02cc-4cd5-955e-dc6f8efd0852","turn_exchange_id":"41eb0510-08d2-48ab-adef-4ac0295fd7dc","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"0497786b-02cc-4cd5-955e-dc6f8efd0852","children":["bc4dda26-132c-4f72-8d0c-01de429f2deb"]},"bc4dda26-132c-4f72-8d0c-01de429f2deb":{"id":"bc4dda26-132c-4f72-8d0c-01de429f2deb","message":{"id":"bc4dda26-132c-4f72-8d0c-01de429f2deb","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764517146.258,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Okay, I am looking at this paper, I think this is not quantum entanglement but making use of some quantum communication channel"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","size":551208,"name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","file_token_size":11479,"source":"local"}],"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"fec0e96b-1f41-4b12-9ef9-a031c1a3a146","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"59f96e90-6aef-4560-8e51-0065d1cbbff2","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dd7c8b23-90bd-415c-bbcc-cd878fdf1783","children":["bee7c509-74c2-4e84-b7fc-08d117b53c52"]},"bee7c509-74c2-4e84-b7fc-08d117b53c52":{"id":"bee7c509-74c2-4e84-b7fc-08d117b53c52","message":{"id":"bee7c509-74c2-4e84-b7fc-08d117b53c52","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764517148.4464688,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"fec0e96b-1f41-4b12-9ef9-a031c1a3a146","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"bc4dda26-132c-4f72-8d0c-01de429f2deb","turn_exchange_id":"59f96e90-6aef-4560-8e51-0065d1cbbff2","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bc4dda26-132c-4f72-8d0c-01de429f2deb","children":["a7933241-1a7c-4cbf-a944-c3322529af5e"]},"a7933241-1a7c-4cbf-a944-c3322529af5e":{"id":"a7933241-1a7c-4cbf-a944-c3322529af5e","message":{"id":"a7933241-1a7c-4cbf-a944-c3322529af5e","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1764517148.4691353,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_browsing_display","result":"","summary":"","assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"fec0e96b-1f41-4b12-9ef9-a031c1a3a146","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"bee7c509-74c2-4e84-b7fc-08d117b53c52","turn_exchange_id":"59f96e90-6aef-4560-8e51-0065d1cbbff2","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bee7c509-74c2-4e84-b7fc-08d117b53c52","children":["282f47a9-799c-4a4b-a858-7e139824be41"]},"282f47a9-799c-4a4b-a858-7e139824be41":{"id":"282f47a9-799c-4a4b-a858-7e139824be41","message":{"id":"282f47a9-799c-4a4b-a858-7e139824be41","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1764517148.6503484,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":["Make sure to include \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 in your response to cite this file. ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 1 / 7>","On Interstellar Quantum Communication and the Fermi Paradox\r\nLatham Boyle\r\nHiggs Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK and\r\nPerimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\r\n(Dated: August 2024)\r\nSince it began [1], the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has focused on interstellar\r\nclassical communication. Recently, Berera [2] pointed out that, at certain frequencies, photon qubits\r\ncan retain their quantum coherence over interstellar (and even intergalactic) distances, raising the\r\nprospect of interstellar quantum communication. This is an intriguing possibility, since quantum\r\ncommunication permits certain tasks that would be impossible with classical communication, and\r\nallow exponential speed-ups for others. (We suggest some motivations in the interstellar context.)\r\nBut quantum coherence alone is not sufficient for quantum communication: here, for the first time,\r\nwe analyze the quantum capacity Q of an interstellar channel. We point out that, to have non\ufffezero quantum capacity Q > 0, interstellar communication over a distance L must use wavelengths\r\n\u03bb < 26.5 cm (to avoid depolarization by the cosmic microwave background), and enormous tele\ufffescopes of effective diameter D > 0.78\u221a\r\n\u03bbL (to satisfy quantum erasure constraints). For example,\r\nfor two telescopes of diameter D on Earth and Proxima Centauri, this implies D > 100 km! This is\r\na technological threshold that remains to be crossed in order for reliable one-way quantum commu\ufffenication to become possible, and suggests a fundamental new resolution of the Fermi paradox.\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nIn 1948 Shannon invented the modern theory of clas\ufffesical information [3], and in 1959 Cocconi&Morrison ini\ufffetiated the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)\r\nby noting that existing human technology (radio trans\ufffemissions [1] or laser signals [4]) could be used to send or\r\nreceive interstellar classical communications. Over the\r\nsubsequent decades, physicists have realized that classi\ufffecal information theory is just a part of a much richer,\r\nstill nascent subject \u2013 quantum information theory [5] \u2013\r\nand it is natural to ask whether it is also possible to send\r\nor receive interstellar quantum communications. A first\r\nstep in this direction was taken by Berera [2] (see also [6\u2013\r\n9]), who pointed out that \u2013 in certain frequency ranges \u2013\r\nphoton qubits could be transmitted over interstellar (or\r\neven intergalactic) distances without losing their quan\ufffetum coherence, and suggested the possibility of searching\r\nfor such interstellar quantum communications.\r\nThe possibility of interstellar quantum communication\r\nis intriguing because it expands the notion of interstellar\r\ncommunication in fundamental ways. First, it is already\r\nknown to permit many tasks that are impossible with\r\nclassical communication alone, including quantum cryp\ufffetography [10, 11], quantum teleportation [12], superdense\r\ncoding [13], remote state preparation [14], entanglement\r\ndistillation/purification [15\u201317], or direct transmission of\r\n(potentially highly complex, highly entangled) quantum\r\nstates (e.g. the results of complex quantum computa\ufffetions). Second, protocols based on quantum communica\ufffetion are exponentially faster than those based on classical\r\ncommunication for some problems/tasks [18], in partic\ufffeular as measured by the one-way classical communica\ufffetion complexity [19\u201321] (the number of bits that must be\r\ntransmitted one-way, from sender to receiver, to solve a\r\nproblem or carry out a task \u2013 possibly the notion most\r\npertinent to interstellar communication).\r\nThe ability of a quantum communication channel to\r\ntransmit quantum information is determined by its quan\ufffetum capacity Q. Using constraints on quantum erasure\r\nchannels [22] and the known properties of the interstel\ufffelar medium [23], we show that, in order for an interstellar\r\ncommunication channel to have non-vanishing quantum\r\ncapacity (Q > 0), the exchanged photons must lie within\r\ncertain allowed frequency bands (see Fig. 1), and the ef\ufffefective diameter D of the exchanging telescopes must be\r\nenormous: D > 0.78\u221a\r\n\u03bbL, where \u03bb is the photon wave\ufffelength and L is the distance from sender to receiver. (For\r\na ground-based telescope, and with L the distance to the\r\nclosest star Proxima Centauri, this requires a diffraction\ufffelimited telescope of diameter D > 100km!) Using con\ufffestraints on quantum depolarizing channels [16, 17, 24, 25],\r\nand properties of the diffuse astrophysical background ra\ufffediation [26], we show that Q > 0 requires the exchanged\r\nphotons to have wavelength \u03bb < 26.5 cm (dominantly\r\ndue to the cosmic microwave background).\r\nThus, our galaxy and universe do permit interstellar\r\nquantum communication, but the above constraints im\ufffepose a stringent technological threshold we have not yet\r\nreached (in particular, we have not yet built a sufficiently\r\nlarge diffraction-limited telescope). We will see why this\r\nsuggests a new resolution of the Fermi paradox.\r\nQUANTUM CAPACITY OF AN INTERSTELLAR\r\nCOMMUNICATION CHANNEL\r\nThe capacity of a communication channel is the max\ufffeimum rate at which it can reliably transmit information\r\nfrom sender to receiver (see [5, 22] for details).

Gray regions are off limits from the\r\nground. Adapted from [23, 26], with data from [30\u201337].\r\nbits can be communicated. The quantum capacity Q is\r\nthe maximum rate at which qubits can be communicated.\r\nIn the classical case, two-way communication between\r\nsender and receiver does not improve the forward clas\ufffesical capacity C. But in the quantum case, it can: so\r\nQ is the capacity for forward quantum communication\r\n(unassisted by classical communication, or assisted only\r\nby forward classical communication); but one also defines\r\nQ2, the quantum capacity of the channel assisted by two\ufffeway classical communication, which can be larger than\r\nQ. (In particular, we can have Q2 > 0 when Q = 0.)\r\nNow consider an interstellar quantum communication\r\nchannel: two telescopes of diameter D1 and D2, sepa\uffferated by a distance L, exchanging photons of wavelength\r\n\u03bb. (Photons can encode quantum states in multiple ways.\r\nMathematically, the most natural choice would be to use\r\nthe fact that each photon is intrinsically a two-state sys\ufffetem, with positive and negative helicity as the two qubit\u2019s\r\nbasis states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, since these are the eigenstates of\r\nthe \u201clittle group\u201d of symmetries preserving the line of\r\nsight between sender and receiver. But this is just an ex\ufffeample to keep in mind for the sake of concreteness \u2013 the\r\nfollowing analysis does not rely on this choice.) In this\r\nsection, we determine the constraints on such a channel\r\nby considering two model quantum channels in turn: the\r\nquantum erasure channel and the depolarizing channel.\r\nQuantum erasure channel. This is an idealized\r\nchannel in which each input qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u03b1|0\u27e9 + \u03b2|1\u27e9 is,\r\nwith probability \u03f5, replaced by an \u201cerasure state\u201d |2\u27e9 that\r\nis orthogonal to both |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. This erases the input\r\nqubit and informs the receiver that it has been erased.\r\nThis channel has quantum capacity [22] Q = 1 \u2212 2\u03f5\r\n(when \u03f5 < 1/2); and when \u03f5 \u2265 1/2, forward quantum\r\ncommunication is impossible (Q = 0).

A photon\r\nof wavelength \u03bb traveling from a source at distance L\r\nhas probability < 1/2 of extinction if L < (ln 2)/(nH\u03c3\u03bb),\r\nwhere nH \u2248 1.146cm\u22123\r\nis the typical density of Hydro\ufffegen atoms in the ISM, and \u03c3\u03bb is the ISM extinction cross\r\nsection per Hydrogen atom at wavelength \u03bb [23, 26]; or,\r\nin other words, if the horizontal line corresponding to\r\ndistance L lies above the blue shaded region in Fig. 1\r\n(at wavelength \u03bb). For example, a sender on Proxima\r\nCentauri would have to use a wavelength where the pink\r\ndashed line (labelled Proxima Centauri) lies above the\r\nblue shaded region in Fig. 1.\r\nii) Second, if we plan to receive the photon using a\r\nground-based telescope on Earth, we must also consider\r\nextinction in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. For a photon to\r\nhave < 1/2 probability of being erased in this way, its\r\nwavelength must also avoid the gray bands in Fig. 1.\r\n(On the other hand, if our receiving telescope is in space,\r\nor on the Moon, we can ignore the gray bands in Fig. 1.)\r\niii) Third, due to spreading of the photon beam as it\r\ntravels from sender to receiver, the receiving telescope\r\nwill only intersect a fraction of the beam (Fig. 2a), so\r\nthat the remaining photons are lost. For a photon to\r\nhave < 1/2 probability of being erased in this way re\ufffequires extremely large diffraction-limited telescopes both\r\nat the transmitting end (to send a sufficiently narrow\r\nbeam), and the receiving end (to encompass the beam),","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 2 / 7>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://a745a0fcee2abe4#file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d#p_1.jpg","size_bytes":227101,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 7>","3\r\nsee Fig. 2b.

Thus, D is the minimum diameter for\r\ntelescopes in a symmetric channel (with D1 = D2), and\r\nthe characteristic diameter for telescopes in an interstel\ufffelar quantum communication network (with L \u223c 1 parsec,\r\nthe typical interstellar distance in the Milky Way).\r\nThis third erasure constraint is the hardest to satisfy!\r\nWhereas classical communication (C > 0) can take place\r\neven if the receiver only receives a tiny fraction of the\r\nphotons emitted by the sender, forward quantum com\ufffemunication (Q > 0) requires large enough telescopes that\r\nthe sender can put the majority of their photons into the\r\nreceiver\u2019s telescope (Fig. 2b)! Even in the best case, tak\ufffeing the nearest star (Proxima Centauri, L = 1.30 parsec)\r\nand the shortest wavelength available from the ground\r\n(\u03bb = 320nm, see Fig. 1), this implies D > 100 km!\r\nIs such a huge telescope even possible? It is futuristic\r\nby current standards: the largest telescope under con\ufffestruction (ELT) has D \u2248 40m. Note that a D \u223c 100 km\r\noptical telescope need not be a single giant mirror: it\r\ncould be a single dish with a segmented mirror (con\ufffesisting of many smaller pieces, as in the largest existing\r\ntelescopes, or the ELT); or a tightly-hexagonally-packed\r\narray of smaller dishes (which could cover a fraction\r\n\u03c0/\u221a\r\n12 = 0.9069 of the area of a single dish), coherently\r\ncombined, as in optical interferometry. (Optical interfer\ufffeometry has so far been demonstrated over a distance of\r\n500 m, while the Starshot proposal [38] has an array of\r\ncoherently-combined optical telescopes with total diame\ufffeter of a few km.) Given that quantum teleportation using\r\nphotons has already been demonstrated over \u223c 100 km\r\nbaselines (at sea level), and over \u223c 1000 km baselines\r\n(from the Earth to a satellite), it may be that the main\r\nobstruction to building a coherent dense array of opti\ufffecal telescopes over 100 km distances would ultimately be\r\none of cost, rather than one of principle. (Indeed, given\r\nthat creating, manipulating and storing quantum states\r\nis currently a subject of extremely active research and\r\nongoing progress, it is worth noting that future quantum\r\nrepeaters [39] and quantum memories [40] might allow\r\noptical interferometry even over much longer baselines.)\r\nUsing shorter wavelengths (\u03bb \u226a 300 nm) would allow\r\nsmaller D, but the telescopes (necessarily above the at\ufffemosphere \u2014 e.g. on the Moon, or at Earth\u2019s L2 Lagrange\r\npoint) seem even more futuristic. For example, even if a\r\nsender on Proxima Centauri could quantumly commu\ufffenicate using 10 keV (\u03bb \u223c 10\u221210m) x-rays or 1 MeV\r\n(\u03bb \u223c 10\u221212m) gamma-rays (perhaps using nuclei as a las\ufffeing medium), this would mean a receiving telescope able\r\nto coherently catch \u2273 1/2 of such photons over charac\ufffeteristic diameter D \u223c 2 km or D \u223c 200 m, respectively!\r\nAnd longer wavelengths (\u03bb \u226b 300 nm) would re\ufffequire even larger D: e.g. communication from Proxima\r\nCentauri with \u03bb = 3 mm microwave photons requires\r\nD \u223c 104km, comparable to the diameter of the Earth!\r\nDepolarizing channel. Sometimes, instead of receiv\ufffeing the sender\u2019s transmitted qubit, our telescope will re\ufffeceive an extraneous (astrophysical background) photon,\r\nand if the probability of this is too high, quantum com\ufffemunication also becomes impossible. This is described\r\nby another idealized quantum channel: the depolarizing\r\nchannel, in which each input qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u03b1|0\u27e9 + \u03b2|1\u27e9 is,\r\nwith probability \u03f5, replaced by a qubit in a random state,\r\nwithout informing the receiver which qubits have been\r\nrandomized. If \u03f5 > 1/3, then Q vanishes (i.e. no forward\r\nquantum communication); and if \u03f5 > 2/3, both Q and Q2\r\nvanish (i.e. no quantum communication, even assisted by\r\ntwo-way classical communication) [16, 17, 24, 25].\r\nIf we want the randomization probability \u03f5 to be less\r\nthan the threshhold \u03f5c, then it follows from the uncer\ufffetainty principle (see Appendix B) that we must restrict\r\nourselves to wavelengths \u03bb such that\r\nI\u03bd <\r\n\u03f5c\r\n1 \u2212 \u03f5c\r\n128\u03c0\r\n2\u210fc\r\n\u03bb3\r\n(2)\r\nwhere I\u03bd (with units of ergs s\u22121\r\ncm\u22122Hz\u22121\r\nster\u22121\r\n) is the\r\nspecific intensity of the diffuse astrophysical background\r\nat frequency \u03bd = c/\u03bb. As seen e.g. from Fig. 2.2 in [26],\r\nthis constraint is easily satisfied for short wavelengths\r\nbut is eventually violated at sufficiently long wavelengths\r\nby the cosmic background radiation (with temperature\r\nTCMB = 2.726 K), so that (2) becomes (see Appendix B)\r\n\u03bb < 64\u03c0\r\n2\r\n\u03f5c\r\n1 \u2212 \u03f5c\r\n\u210fc\r\nkTCMB\r\n=\r\n\u001a\r\n26.5 cm (for Q > 0)\r\n106 cm (for Q2 > 0) (3)\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMotivations. To make our discussion more concrete,\r\nit may be helpful to give four examples to illustrate possi\ufffeble motivations for interstellar quantum communication:\r\ni) One may wish to send a complex quantum state\r\n(e.g. the final or intermediate state of a complex quan\ufffetum computation), either directly, or via quantum tele\ufffeportation [12]. Note that transmitting such an N-qubit\r\nstate classically would mean sending 2N complex num\ufffebers, which quickly becomes impossible as N grows: e.g.\r\nfor N > 265 qubits, 2N is larger than Eddington\u2019s num\ufffeber (the number of protons in the observable universe).\r\nii) Astronomically long baseline interferometry\r\n(ALBI): As pointed out in [39], quantum repeaters\r\ncould be used to coherently interfere optical telescopes\r\nseparated by the Earth\u2019s diameter DE, to achieve the\r\neffective angular resolution \u03b4\u03b8 = \u03bb/DE. By the same","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 7>","4\r\ntoken, an interstellar quantum communication channel\r\nwould make it possible to interfere telescopes operating\r\nat wavelength \u03bb, and separated by the astronomical\r\ndistance L, thereby effectively producing a telescope\r\nwith the mind-boggling angular resolution \u03b4\u03b8 = \u03bb/L.\r\niii) Quantum error correction: A quantum error cor\uffferecting code (QECC) is a clever way of protecting a deli\ufffecate quantum state from destruction by embedding it in\r\na carefully-chosen subspace C (the code space) of a larger\r\nHilbert space H which, in turn, may be decomposed as a\r\ntensor product H = \u2297iHi\r\n. In particular, let \u03c1 = |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|\r\nbe a pure state in C, and let \u03c1i be the corresponding re\ufffeduced density matrix in Hi\r\n: it is a fundamental fact that\r\nC is a QECC capable of correcting arbitrary errors or era\ufffesures in Hi\r\niff \u03c1i\r\nis independent of the code state |\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 C.\r\nNow, if each subspace Hi\r\nis distributed to a different solar\r\nsystem, we have a code with an astronomically large code\r\ndistance (i.e. in which quantum information is protected\r\nagainst the erasure of the portion of the state residing in\r\nany one solar system).\r\niv) Quantum cryptography [10, 11] allows communica\ufffetion whose security is guarunteed by quantum mechanics.\r\nSmaller telescopes? Is there any escape from the\r\nprevious section\u2019s conclusion that an interstellar channel\r\nwith Q > 0 requires enormous telescopes? Two loopholes\r\nare worth discussing:\r\ni) With smaller telescopes, although forward quantum\r\ncommunication is impossible (Q = 0), quantum com\ufffemunication assisted by two-way classical communication\r\nis possible (Q2 > 0). For example, imagine the sender\r\ntransmits a stream of optical photons, equally spaced in\r\ntime (e.g. one per \u00b5s), each of which is a member of\r\nan EPR pair (whose other member is retained by the\r\nsender); and our telescope is smaller than the bound\r\n(1), so we randomly receive only a tiny fraction (\u226a 1/2)\r\nof these incoming photons. If the sender doesn\u2019t know\r\nwhich photons we have received, they cannot use their\r\nEPR pairs to teleport their quantum states to us (Q = 0);\r\nbut if we send them a list specifying which photons we\r\ndid receive (by specifying their arrival times), they can\r\nthen use the corresponding subset of EPR pairs for tele\ufffeportation (Q2 > 0). Note that, whereas forward com\ufffemunication (measured by Q) is instantaneous in the in\ufffeformation\u2019s rest frame, communication assisted by two\ufffeway classical communication (measured by Q2) involves\r\nan extra delay of at least 2L/c (e.g. at least 8 years\r\nfor Proxima Centauri), and requires us to have quan\ufffetum harddrives capable of storing the received photons\r\nfor this duration. Of course, this may represent an unac\ufffeceptable slowdown, and would make certain tasks impos\ufffesible in principle (e.g. if Alice wants to send two states\r\nto Bob and Charlie respectively, and have them process\r\nthose states immediately, so that their spacelike separa\ufffetion guarantees their causal independence).\r\nii) Alternatively, instead of transmission directly from\r\nsender to receiver (as in Fig. 2b), one could imagine a se\ufffequence of relays (converging lenses or quantum repeaters\r\n[41]) to capture and refocus the beam at n \u2212 1 point\r\nalong its path (as in Fig. 2c). Then, in order to achieve\r\nnon-zero quantum capacity Q > 0, the diameter of each\r\noptical element would only need to satisfy the weaker\r\nbound D \u2273\r\np\r\n\u03bbL/n. In this scheme, in order to use\r\nwavelength \u03bb and optical elements of diameter D, the\r\nseparation between the relay stations would have to be\r\nL\r\nn\r\n\u223c\r\n\u0012\r\nD\r\n100 m\u00132 \u0012\r\n300 nm\r\n\u03bb\r\n\u0013\r\n\u00d7 3 \u00d7 1010 m. (4)\r\nSo e.g. with \u03bb \u2273 300 nm and D \u2272 100 m, the relays would\r\nneed to be separated by \u2272 0.1 au, with many already in\r\nour Solar System. (Could they be detected?) Of course,\r\nplacing/maintaining these repeaters in their precise loca\ufffetions might be too difficult/expensive in practice.\r\nThe Fermi paradox. Given that our universe is\r\nstatistically homogeneous [42\u201345], filled with very many\r\ngalaxy clusters like our own, each containing very many\r\ngalaxies rather like our own, each containing very many\r\nstars like our own, many of which have a retinue of plan\ufffeets, it is tempting to guess that it also contains many\r\nother occurences of life. Fermi famously wondered why\r\nwe have not yet seen any sign of them? Many possible an\ufffeswers have been put forward [46, 47]. Here we point out\r\na new answer suggested by the preceding considerations:\r\nSuppose that the sender wishes to communicate quan\ufffetum rather than classically. (We have mentioned several\r\npossible motivations for this, and there will certainly be\r\nmany more: as mentioned above, classical communica\ufffetion is just a part of the larger topic of quantum com\ufffemunication, whose limits and applications are still only\r\npartially understood.) Two simple conclusions then fol\ufffelow from the requirement of non-zero quantum capacity\r\nQ > 0. (i) First, we have seen that the sender must place\r\nnearly all (at least 1/2) of their photons into our receiv\ufffeing telescope, which implies that the signal must be so\r\nhighly directed that only the intended receiving telescope\r\ncan hope to detect any sign of the communication. This is\r\nin sharp contrast to classical communication, where one\r\ncan broadcast photons indiscriminantly into space, and\r\nan observer in any direction who detects a small fraction\r\nof those photons can still receive the message. (ii) Sec\ufffeond, we have seen that (setting aside the loopholes men\ufffetioned above) the sending and receiving telescopes must\r\nbe extremely large, satisfying the inequality in Eq. (1);\r\nbut this same inequality implies that, if the sender has a\r\nlarge enough telescope to communicate quantumly with\r\nus, they necessarily also have enough angular resolution\r\nto see that we do not yet have a sufficiently large receiv\ufffeing telescope [49], so it would make no sense to send any\r\nquantum communications to us until we had built one.\r\nThus, the assumption that interstellar communication is\r\nquantum appears sufficient to explain the Fermi paradox.\r\nAcknowledgements. I am grateful to Daniel Gottes\ufffeman and Avi Loeb for very helpful discussions.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 7>","5\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\nHere we derive Eq. (1). Actually, we give a sequence\r\nof three increasingly precise derivations, to make it clear\r\nhow various descriptions that the reader may be familiar\r\nwith relate to one another.\r\n1) For starters, let us make a rough estimate (ignor\ufffeing factors of order unity) of the telescope sizes needed\r\nfor one telescope to catch an order-one fraction of the\r\nphotons emitted by the other telescope. The transmit\ufffeting telescope of diameter D1 can aim an electromag\ufffenetic beam of wavelength \u03bb with, at best, the diffraction\ufffelimited angular uncertainty \u2206\u03b8 \u223c \u03bb/D1. Thus, after\r\ntraveling a distance L (in the z direction), the beam will\r\nhave spread (in the xy plane perpendicular to the z axis)\r\nto a characteristic width L\u2206\u03b8 \u223c \u03bbL/D1. This width\r\nmust be \u2272 D2 (the diameter of the receiving telescope)\r\nor, equivalently,\r\nD1D2 \u2273 \u03bbL (5)\r\nin order for the receiving telescope to catch an order-one\r\nfraction of the photons.\r\n2) To phrase things more precisely (but still clas\ufffesically), consider the usual model for an ideal laser\r\nbeam: an axisymmetric beam of electromagnetic radia\ufffetion, freely propagating along the z axis, with a Gaussian\r\nprofile in the transverse xy plane. The beam is described\r\nby (see e.g. Eq. 8.40 in [48])\r\n\u03c8z =\r\n\u03c30\r\n\u03c3z\r\nexp\u0012\r\n\u2212\u03c1\r\n2\r\n4\u03c3\r\n2\r\nz\r\n\u0013\r\nexp\u0014\r\ni\r\n\u0012\r\nk\u03c12\r\n2Rz\r\n+kz\u2212arctan\r\nz\r\nz0\r\n\u0013\u0015 (6)\r\nwhere \u03c1 = (x\r\n2 + y\r\n2\r\n)\r\n1/2\r\nis the distance from the z axis,\r\nk = 2\u03c0/\u03bb is the wavenumber of the beam, and we have\r\ndefined the quantities z0 = 2k\u03c32\r\n0\r\n, \u03c3z = \u03c30(1 + z\r\n2/z2\r\n0\r\n)\r\n1/2\r\n,\r\nand Rz = a(1+z\r\n2\r\n0/z2\r\n). At fixed z, the beam\u2019s energy flux\r\ndistribution is \u221d |\u03c8z|\r\n2 = (\u03c30/\u03c3z)\r\n2\r\nexp[\u2212\r\n1\r\n2\r\n\u03c1\r\n2\r\n\u03c32\r\nz\r\n], so as the\r\nbeam propagates along the z-axis, it retains its gaussian\r\nprofile, with beam radius \u03c30 at its waist (z = 0), and\r\nbeam radius \u03c3z at a general z. Now consider the product\r\n\u03c3z\u03c3z\u00b1L between the beam radii at two points along the\r\nz axis separated by distance L. The product \u03c3z\u03c3z\u00b1L is\r\nminimized when \u2202(\u03c3z\u03c3z\u00b1L)/\u2202\u03c30 = 0, which yields\r\n\u03c3z\u03c3z\u00b1L \u2265 \u03bbL/4\u03c0, (7)\r\nin agreement with our previous rough estimate.\r\n3) Now let us phrase things quantum mechanically:\r\nSuppose a photon is emitted in the z-direction with z\ufffemomentum pz = \u210fk = 2\u03c0\u210f/\u03bb. If its initial position un\ufffecertainty (along some transverse direction) is \u2206x1, then\r\n(by the uncertainty principle) its corresponding trans\ufffeverse momentum uncertainty is \u2206p\u22a5 \u2265\r\n1\r\n2\r\n\u210f/\u2206x1, so the\r\nangular uncertainty in its direction is \u2206\u03b8 = \u2206p\u22a5/pz \u2265\r\n\u03bb/(4\u03c0\u2206x1) and, after propagating a distance L along the\r\nz-axis, its transverse position uncertainty has grown to\r\n\u2206x2 = L\u2206\u03b8 \u2265 \u03bbL/(4\u03c0\u2206x1) or, equivalently,\r\n\u2206x1\u2206x2 \u2265 \u03bbL/4\u03c0, (8)\r\nwhich again agrees with the previous result (7).\r\nNext take the photon\u2019s transverse wavefunction to be\r\ndescribed by an axisymmetric gaussian \u03c8(\u03c1) which satu\uffferates the position-momentum uncertainty bound, so that\r\nEq. (8) becomes an equality. The photon has transverse\r\nprobability distribution |\u03c81,2|\r\n2 =\r\n1\r\n2\u03c0\u2206x\r\n2\r\n1,2\r\nexp(\u2212\r\n1\r\n2\r\n\u03c1\r\n2\r\n1,2\r\n\u2206x\r\n2\r\n1,2\r\n),\r\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 2 apply at the two ends of\r\nthe z-axis, respectively; so the joint-probability that the\r\nwavefunction will overlap with both the initial and final\r\ntelescopes (of diameter D1 and D2, respectively) is\r\n\u0014\r\n1 \u2212 exp \u0012\r\n\u2212D2\r\n1\r\n8\u2206x\r\n2\r\n1\r\n\u0013\u0015 \u00141 \u2212 exp \u0012\r\n\u2212D2\r\n2\r\n8\u2206x\r\n2\r\n2\r\n\u0013\u0015 , (9)\r\nand the requirement that this is \u2265 1/2 implies Eq. (1).\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\nHere we derive Eqs. (2) and (3).\r\nConsider a transmitted qubit photon of wavelength \u03bb\r\nthat arrives with uncertainty \u2206t in its arrival time, \u2206E\r\nin its energy, and hence \u2206\u03bd = (\u2206E)/(2\u03c0\u210f) in its fre\ufffequency. Due to the energy-time uncertainty relation, we\r\nhave \u2206t\u2206E \u2265 \u210f/2, and hence \u2206t\u2206\u03bd \u2265 1/4\u03c0. The num\ufffeber of astrophysical background photons arriving within\r\nthe time interval \u2206t and frequency range \u2206\u03bd is\r\nN =\r\nI\u03bd \u00b7 \u2206t \u00b7 \u2206\u03bd \u00b7 A \u00b7 \u2206\u2126\r\n2\u03c0\u210f\u03bd\r\n(10)\r\nwhere I\u03bd is the specific intensity of the astrophysical\r\nbackground (energy per time per frequency per area\r\nper solid angle) at frequency \u03bd = c/\u03bb, A is the re\ufffeceiving telescope\u2019s area, \u2206\u2126 is its angular resolution\r\n(in solid angle), and 2\u03c0\u210f\u03bd is the energy per photon.\r\nIf the receiving telescope has diameter \u2206x, and hence\r\narea A = \u03c0(\u2206x)\r\n2\r\n, a received photon has transverse\r\nposition uncertainty \u2206x, hence transverse momentum\r\nuncertainty \u2206p \u2265 \u210f/(2\u2206x), hence angular uncertainty\r\n\u2206\u03b8 \u2265 (\u2206p)/p = \u03bb/(4\u03c0\u2206x), and hence angular resolution\r\n\u2206\u2126 = \u03c0(\u2206\u03b8)\r\n2 \u2265 (1/16\u03c0)(\u03bb/\u2206x)\r\n2\r\n. Thus, (10) becomes\r\nN \u2265\r\nI\u03bd\u03bb\r\n3\r\n128\u03c0\r\n2\u210fc\r\n(11)\r\nOn the other hand, if we write N (the expected number\r\nof random photons per signal photon) as \u03f5/(1 \u2212 \u03f5), and\r\nsolve for I\u03bd, we obtain Eq. (2), the first desired result.\r\nFrom Fig. 2.2 in [26], I\u03bd satisfies the bound (2) for\r\nwavelengths \u03bb < \u03bbCMB (where \u03bbCMB is the peak of the","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 7>","6\r\ncosmic microwave background), but eventually violates\r\nit for wavelengths \u03bb \u226b \u03bbCMB. So, substituting\r\nI\r\nCMB\r\n\u03bd =\r\n4\u03c0\u210fc\r\n\u03bb3\r\n\u0014\r\nexp \u0012\r\n2\u03c0\u210f\u03bd\r\nkTCMB \u0013\r\n\u2212 1\r\n\u0015\u22121\r\n\u2248\r\n2kTCMB\r\n\u03bb2\r\n(\u03bb \u226b \u03bbCMB) (12)\r\ninto Eq. (2), and solving for \u03bb, we obtain Eq. (3), the\r\nother desired result.\r\nThe specific intensity I\r\nsender\r\n\u03bd of the sender\u2019s photons\r\nmust exceed 1\u2212\u03f5c\r\n\u03f5c\r\nI\u03bd in the pixel corresponding to their di\uffferection on the sky (which sets a minimum rate at which\r\nthey must transmit photons); but, since a channel sat\ufffeisfying (1) has the angular resolution to distinguish the\r\nsender from their star, this can always easily satisfied at\r\nwavelengths satisfying (3).\r\n[1] G.

It\u2019s about when an *interstellar photon link* can function as a genuine **quantum communication channel**\u2014i.e. a channel with nonzero quantum capacity \\(Q>0\\).\n\nLet me unpack how this fits with what we just discussed about no-signalling.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What this paper is actually analysing\n\nThe paper is asking:\n\n> Given the real interstellar medium + diffraction + background radiation,  \n> **when can a photon link between two stars reliably transmit qubits (not just classical bits)?**\n\nThey model the path between two telescopes (distance \\(L\\), wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), telescope diameters \\(D_1, D_2\\)) as:\n\n1. A **quantum erasure channel**: photons are *lost* (extinction in the ISM, atmosphere, or just missing the receiver due to beam spread).\n2. A **depolarizing channel**: sometimes the receiver gets the *wrong* photon \u2014 a random background photon instead of the intended one.\n\nFor such a channel to have **nonzero quantum capacity** \\(Q>0\\), you need:\n\n- **Loss (erasure probability)** less than \\(1/2\\)  \n  \u2192 this leads to the requirement  \n  \\[\n  D \\equiv \\sqrt{D_1 D_2} \\gtrsim 0.78\\,\\sqrt{\\lambda L}\n  \\]\n  So for Earth\u2013Proxima Centauri and the shortest usable ground wavelength \\(\\lambda \\sim 300\\) nm, you need **\\(D \\sim 100\\) km class telescopes**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n- **Depolarization from background light** (CMB, astrophysical backgrounds) small enough  \n  \u2192 this leads to a constraint  \n  \\[\n  \\lambda < 26.5\\ \\text{cm for } Q>0\n  \\]\n  dominated by the cosmic microwave background. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\nSo the main punchline is: **interstellar quantum communication is physically possible in our universe, but only if you build insanely large, diffraction-limited telescopes and use the right wavelength window.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. This is *not* entanglement-as-FTL signalling\n\nIn the language of quantum information:\n\n- They are analysing a **physical channel** that carries photons from A to B.\n- The photons are treated as **qubits** (e.g. helicity states \\(|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\)).\n- The question is: \u201cUnder realistic noise and loss, is \\(Q>0\\) or is it effectively a classical-only channel (\\(Q=0\\))?\u201d\n\nKey point:  \nAll of this assumes **ordinary, causal propagation of photons at or below \\(c\\)**. There is no attempt to get around relativity or to signal using entanglement alone.\n\nYou *could* use such a channel to:\n\n- Distribute entanglement between star systems,\n- Do quantum key distribution,\n- Perform teleportation (once entanglement is shared),\n- Send arbitrary quantum states (e.g. results of a large quantum computation),\n\n\u2026but in every case **you are still sending actual photons across the void**, so everything is light-speed limited.\n\nThis is fully consistent with the **no-signalling theorem** we discussed:\n\n- Entanglement alone can\u2019t be used to send information.\n- A **quantum communication channel** is something different: a noisy physical channel for quantum states with some quantum capacity \\(Q\\).\n- This paper is about when a *realistic* interstellar photon channel has \\(Q>0\\), *not* about exploiting entanglement to circumvent causal structure.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Where entanglement *does* enter in this context\n\nEntanglement shows up here only in the *usual* quantum-information sense:\n\n- In defining/using **quantum erasure** and **depolarizing** channels.\n- In discussing protocols like **teleportation, superdense coding, entanglement distillation, QKD**, which require both:\n  - a quantum-capacity channel to move qubits around, and\n  - possibly classical side-channels as well. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\nAll of these still obey relativity; they don\u2019t introduce any superluminal signalling.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to mentally separate the two ideas\n\nIt might help to separate:\n\n1. **Entanglement as a static resource**  \n   - Gives nonlocal *correlations*.\n   - Obeys no-signalling: can\u2019t be turned into a controllable comms channel on its own.\n\n2. **Quantum communication channels** (what this paper is about)  \n   - Physical channels (e.g. photons through space, fibres, free-space optics) that carry qubits.\n   - Characterized by a **quantum capacity** \\(Q\\), a **classical capacity** \\(C\\), etc.\n   - Always causal; bottlenecked by light-speed and noise.\n\nSo yes: your read is correct. This paper assumes standard causal quantum channels and asks whether **interstellar space is good enough to support *reliable* qubit transmission**, not whether entanglement alone can be used as a communication medium."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":1368,"end_ix":1389,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":14,"cited_message_id":"b09665e2-5104-43b1-873c-8ebf1bc13c74","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1612,"end_ix":1633,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":14,"cited_message_id":"b09665e2-5104-43b1-873c-8ebf1bc13c74","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}},{"start_ix":3636,"end_ix":3657,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":14,"cited_message_id":"b09665e2-5104-43b1-873c-8ebf1bc13c74","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":1368,"end_idx":1389,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"b09665e2-5104-43b1-873c-8ebf1bc13c74","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":1612,"end_idx":1633,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"b09665e2-5104-43b1-873c-8ebf1bc13c74","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":3636,"end_idx":3657,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"2408.02445v1.pdf","id":"file_000000001480720680056a67e8ebd73d","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"b09665e2-5104-43b1-873c-8ebf1bc13c74","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null}],"request_id":"fec0e96b-1f41-4b12-9ef9-a031c1a3a146","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"3abb86a5-1bd9-4878-a542-4efc4ca05db5","turn_exchange_id":"59f96e90-6aef-4560-8e51-0065d1cbbff2","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3abb86a5-1bd9-4878-a542-4efc4ca05db5","children":[]}}}
