**pungent smell**.\n- **Alkaline gas**: turns **damp** red litmus paper **blue**.\n  - Dampness (water) is needed because ammonia dissolves and forms **hydroxide ions (OH\u207b)**, which cause the colour change.\n\n### 3) Manufacture of ammonia: Haber process\n**Raw materials**\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): obtained by **fractional distillation of liquid air**.\n- Hydrogen (H\u2082): obtained from\n  - **Steam reforming** of natural gas:  \n    CH\u2084(g) + 2H\u2082O(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g) + 4H\u2082(g)\n  - **Cracking** of petroleum fractions, e.g.:  \n    C\u2082H\u2086(g) \u2192 C\u2082H\u2084(g) + H\u2082(g)\n\n**Reaction**\n- N\u2082(g) + 3H\u2082(g) \u21cc 2NH\u2083(g)  \n- **Enthalpy change (\u0394H)** is negative (\u2248 \u221292 kJ mol\u207b\u00b9): the reaction is **exothermic** (releases heat).\n- Feed ratio: **1 volume N\u2082 : 3 volumes H\u2082**.\n\n**Industrial conditions**\n- Temperature: **450 \u00b0C**\n- Pressure: **250 atmospheres (atm)**\n- Catalyst: **finely divided iron**\n\n**Process steps (key idea: separation + recycling)**\n- Compress N\u2082 and H\u2082 (high pressure), pass over iron catalyst in a converter.\n- Only about **10\u201315%** converts to NH\u2083 per pass.\n- Cool the mixture so **ammonia liquefies** (it condenses before N\u2082 and H\u2082 under the chosen cooling conditions).\n- Remove liquid NH\u2083; **unreacted N\u2082 and H\u2082 are recycled** back into the converter.\n\n### 4) Reversible reactions and dynamic equilibrium\n- A **reversible reaction** can proceed in **both directions**; shown by **\u21cc**.\n- **Forward reaction**: reactants \u2192 products. **Reverse (backward) reaction**: products \u2192 reactants.\n- **Dynamic equilibrium**: rate of forward reaction = rate of reverse reaction.\n  - Concentrations of reactants/products stay **constant** (not necessarily equal).\n- Equilibrium position can be changed by altering **concentration, temperature, or pressure**.\n\n### 5) Optimising yield in the Haber process (Le Chatelier\u2019s principle)\n**Temperature**\n- Lower temperature \u2192 **higher yield** of NH\u2083 (favours the exothermic direction).\n- But lower temperature also \u2192 **slower reaction rate** (industry compromises at ~450 \u00b0C).\n\n**Pressure**\n- Higher pressure \u2192 **higher yield** of NH\u2083.\n- Reason: 4 moles of gas (N\u2082 + 3H\u2082) \u2192 2 moles of gas (2NH\u2083); equilibrium shifts to the side with **fewer gas molecules**.\n- Very high pressures are **costly** (stronger equipment needed), so industry uses a compromise (~250 atm).\n\n**Catalyst**\n- Catalyst increases the **rate** of both forward and reverse reactions **equally**.\n- It helps equilibrium be reached **faster**, but causes **no change in equilibrium yield**.\n\n### 6) Uses of ammonia\n- Manufacture of **fertilisers**.\n- Manufacture of **explosives** (linked to ammonium nitrate).\n\n### 7) Nitrogenous fertilisers: ammonium nitrate vs urea\n- **Ammonium nitrate**: very soluble \u2192 easily absorbed by plants, but also **easily washed out (leaches)** from soil.\n- **Urea**: higher percentage nitrogen, less soluble \u2192 acts more slowly, **less easily washed away**.\n\n### 8) Displacement (preparation) of ammonia from ammonium salts\n- General reaction: **ammonium salt + alkali \u2192 ammonia + water + salt**\n- Ionic idea: NH\u2084\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 NH\u2083 + H\u2082O\n- Example: (NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084 + 2NaOH \u2192 2NH\u2083 + 2H\u2082O + Na\u2082SO\u2084\n- Key point: ammonia is **basic** and **does not react with alkalis** to form salts (it forms salts with **acids**, not bases).\n\n### 9) Liming soil and fertiliser loss (important concept)\n- **Calcium oxide (CaO)** and **calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)\u2082)** are used to neutralise acidic soil (\u201climing\u201d).\n- But they can react with **ammonium fertilisers** to produce **NH\u2083 gas**, which escapes \u2192 **loss of nitrogen** from the fertiliser.\n- To reduce this loss: apply fertiliser **only after some time** following liming (not simultaneously); **calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083)** can be used as an alternative to reduce soil acidity.\n\n### 10) Quick stoichiometry tip (common exam style)\n- With excess alkali, the moles of NH\u2083 produced depend on the **number of nitrogen atoms** in the ammonium compound.\n  - Example: 1 mol (NH\u2084)\u2083PO\u2084 contains 3 mol of nitrogen \u2192 can produce **3 mol NH\u2083** on complete displacement."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":33,"end_ix":54,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"ammonia-notes.pdf","id":"file_00000000c768720694405985ca9be548","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":8,"cited_message_id":"1176bc5e-9e94-4add-9525-cf80571d290d","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null,"set_id":null,"spl_version":null,"run_id":null,"title":null,"effective_time":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":33,"end_idx":54,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"ammonia-notes.pdf","id":"file_00000000c768720694405985ca9be548","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"drug_file_reference":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"1176bc5e-9e94-4add-9525-cf80571d290d","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null}],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"0342d54d-87ff-4d15-a364-e7e2664b58fc","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"82bbda8b-dd99-4c3e-bef5-7629658a60e2","turn_exchange_id":"82d4cb14-7a56-4464-a715-3fd93dbb6f84","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"82bbda8b-dd99-4c3e-bef5-7629658a60e2","children":["b291f5d1-50af-428e-b6f7-9111f4cb4510"]},"b291f5d1-50af-428e-b6f7-9111f4cb4510":{"id":"b291f5d1-50af-428e-b6f7-9111f4cb4510","message":{"id":"b291f5d1-50af-428e-b6f7-9111f4cb4510","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771123017.439,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Avoid using term Le Chatelier\u2019s principle.

Haber reaction + conditions \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L4\ue201\n- Equation: **N\u2082 + 3H\u2082 \u21cc 2NH\u2083**  \n- **\u0394H = \u221292 kJ mol\u207b\u00b9** (exothermic). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L5\ue201  \n- Feed ratio: **1 volume N\u2082 : 3 volumes H\u2082**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L3\ue201  \n- Conditions: **450 \u00b0C**, **250 atm**, **finely divided iron catalyst**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L4\ue201  \n\n### 3.3 Process features (separation + recycling) \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L4\ue201\n- Gases are compressed (industrial setup shown ~200\u2013300 atm range) and passed over iron catalyst. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L4-L4\ue201  \n- Only about **10\u201315%** converts to NH\u2083 per pass. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L4-L4\ue201  \n- Cool mixture \u2192 **NH\u2083 liquefies/condenses**, then removed. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L4\ue201  \n- **Unreacted N\u2082 and H\u2082 are recycled** back into the reactor. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L4\ue201  \n\n## 4) Reversible reactions & dynamic equilibrium \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L4\ue201\n- **Reversible reaction:** can occur in both directions; shown by **\u21cc**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L3\ue201  \n- **Forward reaction:** left \u2192 right; **reverse/backward:** right \u2192 left. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L3\ue201  \n- **Dynamic equilibrium:** forward rate = backward rate; concentrations remain **constant** (not necessarily equal). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L4-L4\ue201  \n- Equilibrium mixture can be changed by **concentration, temperature, pressure**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L4-L4\ue201  \n\n## 5) Effect of conditions on NH\u2083 yield + rate (without naming any \u201cprinciple\u201d) \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L6\ue201\n- **Lower temperature \u2192 higher NH\u2083 yield**, but reaction becomes **very slow**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L5\ue201  \n- **Higher pressure \u2192 higher NH\u2083 yield**; high pressure is **costly**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L5\ue201  \n- Reason pressure helps: **4 moles gas \u2192 2 moles gas** (N\u2082 + 3H\u2082 \u2192 2NH\u2083). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L5\ue201  \n- **Catalyst (iron):** speeds up forward + backward reactions; **no change in yield**; equilibrium reached faster. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n\n## 6) Uses of ammonia \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201\n- Manufacture of **explosives**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n- Manufacture of **fertilisers**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n\n## 7) Nitrogenous fertilisers: ammonium nitrate vs urea \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201\n- **Ammonium nitrate:** nitrates are **soluble** \u2192 easily absorbed; also **washed out** of soil easily. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n- **Urea:** **higher % nitrogen**, **less soluble** \u2192 acts more slowly; **not washed away** as easily. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n\n## 8) Displacement (preparation) of ammonia from ammonium salts \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L7\ue201\n- General: **ammonium salt + alkali \u2192 ammonia + water + salt**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n- Example: **(NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084 + 2NaOH \u2192 2NH\u2083 + 2H\u2082O + Na\u2082SO\u2084**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n- Key point: ammonia is **basic** and **does not react with alkalis to form salts**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L7-L7\ue201  \n\n## 9) Liming soil + fertiliser nitrogen loss \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L7\ue201\n- **Liming**: using calcium oxide (CaO) / calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)\u2082) to neutralise acidic soil. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n- CaO / Ca(OH)\u2082 can react with nitrogenous fertilisers to form **NH\u2083 gas** that escapes \u2192 **loss of nitrogen**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L7-L7\ue201  \n- Avoiding loss: add fertilisers **only after some time** following liming; **CaCO\u2083** can be used as an alternative to reduce acidity. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L6\ue201  \n\n## 10) Quick stoichiometry idea (excess alkali) \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L7-L7\ue201\n- **Moles of NH\u2083 produced are linked to moles of nitrogen present** in the ammonium compound. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L7-L7\ue201  \n- Example: **1.0 mol (NH\u2084)\u2083PO\u2084 \u2192 3.0 mol NH\u2083** (contains 3 mol of nitrogen).
