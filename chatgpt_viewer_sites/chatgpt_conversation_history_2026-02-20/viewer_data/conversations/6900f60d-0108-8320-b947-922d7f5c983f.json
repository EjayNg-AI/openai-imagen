Initially founded as a non-profit in 2015 with the mission to safely advance artificial general intelligence (AGI), OpenAI received approval from Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings to restructure its business. Despite this change, the original non-profit, now named the OpenAI Foundation, remains in technical control of the for-profit entity.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, OpenAI signed a new deal with Microsoft, granting the tech giant a 27% stake in the for-profit OpenAI, valuing the company at $500 billion. Microsoft\u2019s rights to OpenAI\u2019s confidential research remain in place until either AGI is verified by an independent panel or until 2030. The foundation plans to allocate $25 billion toward public benefits such as healthcare and AI-related cybersecurity.\n\nThis transformation follows internal and external debates over governance, including a lawsuit and a takeover bid from co-founder Elon Musk. Critics, like Public Citizen\u2019s Robert Weissman, question the foundation\u2019s true independence, suggesting the structure serves corporate interests more than public ones.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":11},"pub_date":1761664205.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"calmatters.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/01/openai-investigation-california/","title":"California is investigating OpenAI\u2019s conversion to a for-profit company","snippet":"Attorney General Rob Bonta has asked OpenAI about its reported conversion to a for-profit company as part of an ongoing investigation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":12},"pub_date":1738083483.397742,"attribution":"calmatters.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/","title":"Exclusive: OpenAI to remove non-profit control and give Sam Altman equity","snippet":"The move could also have implications for how the company manages AI risks in a new governance structure.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1727542683.39922,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-new-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-10-28/","title":"Microsoft, OpenAI reach new deal valuing OpenAI at $500 billion","snippet":"Microsoft and OpenAI have reached a landmark agreement valuing OpenAI at $500 billion. This deal allows OpenAI to restructure as a public benefit corporation, providing it with more operational freedom and the ability to raise capital more easily. Previously, a 2019 agreement with Microsoft limited OpenAI\u2019s funding options in exchange for access to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing resources. Under the new terms, Microsoft retains a 27% stake worth about $135 billion after investing $13.8 billion, securing a near 10-fold return. The agreement also includes a massive $250 billion cloud computing contract with Microsoft Azure, though Microsoft forfeits its previous right of first refusal and gains no rights to OpenAI's hardware products.\n\nControl of OpenAI Group PBC will rest with the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation. Despite their restructured relationship, the two companies remain closely tied until at least 2032, with Microsoft holding rights to OpenAI\u2019s products and models even if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is achieved. The agreement also introduces an independent panel to validate any AGI claims. The restructure aims to improve clarity around OpenAI's funding and operations while addressing scrutiny over data use and transparency. ChatGPT\u2019s worldwide popularity, exceeding 700 million weekly users in September, has driven OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth and increased operational demands.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1761661401.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/807875/openai-microsoft-for-profit-agi","title":"OpenAI completed its for-profit restructuring \u2014 and struck a ...","snippet":"3 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI's controversial for-profit restructuring is finally complete, along with a new deal with Microsoft that covers its upcoming plans for ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1761658735.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pitchbook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/openai-cancel-for-profit-transition-softbank","title":"With Softbank\u2019s billions on the line, OpenAI scuttles full for-profit transition","snippet":"The SoftBank-led record $40 billion funding round was contingent on a shift in corporate structure.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1748451483.390866,"attribution":"pitchbook.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"blogs.microsoft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/","title":"The next chapter of the Microsoft\u2013OpenAI partnership","snippet":"Since 2019, Microsoft and OpenAI have shared a vision to advance artificial intelligence responsibly and make its benefits broadly...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1761656283.32306,"attribution":"blogs.microsoft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/30/nonprofit-group-joins-elon-musks-effort-to-block-openais-for-profit-transition/","title":"Nonprofit group joins Elon Musk\u2019s effort to block OpenAI\u2019s for-profit transition","snippet":"Encode, a nonprofit AI safety org, has requested permission to file an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk's injunction to halt OpenAI's...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1738083483.397742,"attribution":"techcrunch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"qz.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://qz.com/openai-restructures-microsoft-profit-company-sam-altman","title":"ChatGPT maker OpenAI restructures as a for-profit company","snippet":"OpenAI has finished a major restructuring that lets it operate as a for-profit business while its nonprofit foundation remains in control.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1761667503.331266,"attribution":"qz.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thehansindia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-criticizes-openais-shift-from-non-profit-roots-1013776","title":"Elon Musk Criticizes OpenAI\u2019s Shift from Non-Profit Roots","snippet":"Elon Musk accuses OpenAI of abandoning its non-profit mission, alleging misuse for financial gain and criticizing intimidation tactics.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1760461083.400924,"attribution":"www.thehansindia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.itpro.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.itpro.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-for-profit-corporate-structure","title":"OpenAI is shifting to a for-profit corporate structure \u2013 here\u2019s why that matters","snippet":"OpenAI will change its for-profit unit into a public benefit corporation (PBC), using proceeds from that division to fund the non-profit arm.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1738083483.397742,"attribution":"www.itpro.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/technology/article/openai-valued-at-500bn-in-microsoft-deal-pvr8gtb5h","title":"OpenAI valued at $500bn in Microsoft deal","snippet":"OpenAI has finalized a restructuring deal with Microsoft, valuing the AI company at $500 billion.

The reorganization also includes an updated partnership agreement with Microsoft, granting the tech giant a 27% stake in the new for-profit entity and adjusting the terms of their collaboration, especially regarding rights around artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nUnder the new structure, AGI designation must be verified by an independent panel, maintaining Microsoft\u2019s access to OpenAI's research methods until at least 2030 or until AGI is declared. Microsoft also retains some commercial rights to OpenAI technologies through 2032. OpenAI plans to invest $25 billion through its nonprofit foundation in areas like health and AI cybersecurity. The governance changes include guarantees that the nonprofit will retain control, such as board appointment rights and a Safety and Security Committee with oversight power. The restructuring follows leadership turmoil in 2023 and ongoing scrutiny, including legal challenges from Elon Musk.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1761661256.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-microsoft-c661df3242766d6b0ddbab401ad1fd84","title":"OpenAI reorganizes its structure to raise money and profit","snippet":"3 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI said it has reorganized its ownership structure and converted its business into a public benefit corporation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1761661256.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"news.delaware.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/","title":"AG Jennings completes review of OpenAI recapitalization","snippet":"3 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI initially proposed a restructuring that would remove the current nonprofit entity from overseeing the for-profit activities of OpenAI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1761661120.0,"attribution":"news.delaware.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"e24.no","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://e24.no/i/jQ8Jwz","title":"Microsoft hopper 4 prosent etter OpenAI-avtale","snippet":"Den 28. oktober 2025 rapporteres det om flere betydelige bevegelser i teknologisektoren.

Corporate structure change to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)  \n- OpenAI announced that its for-profit subsidiary (previously a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d model) will transition into a PBC. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news1\ue202turn0news20\ue202turn0news17\ue201  \n- That means it moves toward a more typical capital structure (i.e., shares, investors) while being legally required to consider mission alongside profit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news1\ue202turn0news17\ue201  \n- Importantly: the original nonprofit (now reported as the \u201cFoundation\u201d or \u201cnonprofit arm\u201d) continues to exercise control over the PBC. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news11\ue202turn0news17\ue202turn0news31\ue201  \n\n### 2. Deal with \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\", \"Microsoft Corporation\", 0]\ue201  \n- A new agreement was sealed: Microsoft will own ~27% of the newly structured PBC entity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news28\ue202turn0news11\ue201  \n- The valuation of OpenAI under this deal is estimated at around **US\\$500 billion**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news30\ue202turn0news28\ue202turn0news11\ue201  \n- Part of the deal: Microsoft retains rights to OpenAI\u2019s output (including future AGI-related products) until at least circa 2030 or 2032. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news11\ue202turn0news28\ue201  \n\n### 3. Regulatory/State oversight and approval  \n- The Delaware Attorney General\u2019s office issued a \u201cStatement of No Objection\u201d to the recapitalization. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n- California\u2019s Attorney General likewise has been investigating or engaging with the restructuring. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Why this matters (and some critical angles)  \n### Mission vs profit tension  \n- Originally OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit explicitly to ensure AGI \u201cbenefits all of humanity\u201d. The shift to a for-profit/PBC model reintroduces stronger profit incentives, which may shift risk tolerances, prioritisation, and governance dynamics.  \n- The requirement of a PBC is positive in that legally mission must still be considered, but mission enforcement in practice (especially given investor pressures) remains uncertain.\n\n### Governance and control  \n- While the nonprofit retains control *on paper*, critics (including \ue200entity\ue202[\"people\",\"Elon Musk\",0]\ue201) argue this control may be more nominal than real, given the magnitude of commercial incentives and investor stakes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news18\ue201  \n- The deal with Microsoft embeds long-term commercial commitments (rights to research, models, etc) which raises questions: does mission drive more of the structure, or does the corporate/investor agenda dominate?\n\n### Capital and funding dynamics  \n- The restructuring allows OpenAI to raise large amounts of capital more freely (since PBC / for-profit shares allow more investor participation) which may accelerate development and scale.  \n- But on the flip side: large commercial commitments and scale bring pressure for returns, perhaps increasing incentives to deploy faster, monetise aggressively, or take more risk.\n\n### Implications for AGI and alignment  \n- The inclusion of \u201cindependent panel to verify AGI claims\u201d is a noteworthy safeguard. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news28\ue202turn0news31\ue201  \n- However, the shift toward a for-profit model may impact how aggressively safety/mission constraints are enforced vs speed-to-market or return-on-investment pressures.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Unanswered questions / things to watch  \n- How much actual operational autonomy will the nonprofit arm retain? \u201cControl\u201d is defined, but how will day-to-day decisions be driven?  \n- What governance mechanisms exist (or will be added) to prevent mission drift under heavy investor pressure?  \n- Will the profit orientation lead to compromised safety standards, or faster deployment of riskier models?  \n- Given the scale of the Microsoft stake and future commercial deals, will OpenAI\u2019s incentives align more with Microsoft/distribution than with broader public benefit?  \n- How stable is the valuation ($500 billion) and what happens if commercial performance fails to meet investor expectations?  \n- How will regulatory oversight evolve globally (especially given the AG investigations) given this hybrid structure?  \n- What is the real \u201cprofit\u201d model? Even with large valuations, scaling compute and infrastructure for AGI remains extremely costly and capital intensive.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf For your vantage as a mathematics/AI researcher  \nGiven your background and interests (AI, ML, advanced workflows), here are some strategic considerations:\n\n- **Research funding and structure**: This restructuring may mean more funding, more commercial application opportunities \u2014 but also more proprietary constraints. If you are looking for collaborations or research partnerships, this shift may open doors but also change the nature of openness and publication norms.  \n- **Safety/interpretability work**: As OpenAI becomes more commercial, the need for rigorous safety/science work increases \u2014 potentially more demand for mathematically grounded research (alignment, mechanistic interpretability).  \n- **Governance models**: You may want to monitor and perhaps contribute to discussions around how mission-oriented research is maintained under for-profit PBC structures. This might slot perfectly with your category theory or mathematical logic mindset (e.g., modelling governance as a category, constraints as morphisms, etc!).  \n- **Open vs closed models**: The shift may moderate openness of research/data. If you value open science, you may want to track how OpenAI\u2019s changed structure affects release policies and access.  \n- **Scenario planning**: Because this restructuring changes the risk profile (more capital, more push for returns, more commercialisation), you might want to integrate into your macro-AI frameworks how governance structure affects safety/outcome risks, not just technical progress.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can **pull together a timeline** of this restructuring (with key dates, filings, valuation changes) and a **governance/mission-risk map** that fits your analyst mindset. Would you like me to do that?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Latest on OpenAI for\u2011profit
