The United Monarchy Question**\r\n\r\nFocus on these essential points:\r\n- Present the biblical narrative of three kings (Saul, David, Solomon)\r\n- Explain the archaeological debate: was there really a unified kingdom or were David and Solomon just local chieftains?\r\n- Key evidence to discuss:\r\n  - Tel Dan inscription mentioning \"House of David\"\r\n  - Lack of monumental architecture clearly dated to Solomon\r\n  - The current scholarly debate between \"maximalists\" (who accept the biblical account) and \"minimalists\" (who see it as later fiction)\r\n\r\n**B. The Kingdom Divides**\r\n\r\nCover these specific factors:\r\n- Solomon's taxation and forced labor (according to biblical text)\r\n- The succession crisis after Solomon's death\r\n- Rehoboam's harsh response to northern complaints\r\n- The role of the prophet Ahijah\r\n- Make clear this is the biblical version - we have no external confirmation\r\n\r\n**C. The Two Kingdoms Period**\r\n\r\nPresent basic parallel histories:\r\n\r\n**Northern Kingdom (Israel):**\r\n- Capital: Samaria (after Omri)\r\n- Major kings: Jeroboam I, Omri, Ahab, Jehu\r\n- Religious centers: Dan and Bethel\r\n- End: Assyrian conquest in 722 BCE\r\n\r\n**Southern Kingdom (Judah):**\r\n- Capital: Jerusalem\r\n- Continuous Davidic dynasty\r\n- Temple in Jerusalem\r\n- Survived until 586 BCE\r\n\r\n### Evidence to Present\r\n\r\n**1. Archaeological Evidence (be clear about what exists and what doesn't):**\r\n- Monumental buildings at Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer (dating disputed)\r\n- Clear 9th-century remains from Omri/Ahab in Samaria\r\n- Limited 10th-century remains from Jerusalem\r\n\r\n**2.

These texts, however, were compiled centuries after the events they describe (with final editing during the exilic/post-exilic period, 6th\u20135th century BCE)\u301031\u2020L397-L405\u3011. Biblical writers interwove historical annals with legends and theological commentary, aiming to explain Israel and Judah\u2019s fate as the result of fidelity or disobedience to God\u301031\u2020L397-L405\u3011. Thus, the biblical account serves theological purposes and is not a neutral contemporaneous record. By contrast, archaeological remains and contemporary inscriptions from neighboring cultures provide independent evidence that can confirm, supplement, or challenge the biblical narrative. In what follows, each period \u2013 the United Monarchy, the Division of the Kingdom, and the Two Kingdoms period \u2013 is discussed with the biblical account presented first, followed by archaeological and external evidence. Points of agreement and debate are highlighted, without attempting to resolve the scholarly controversies. The evidence demonstrates that by the 9th century BCE there were indeed two distinct Hebrew kingdoms, while the nature and even existence of a grand **Solomonic** united kingdom in the 10th century remain contested. It should also be noted that the northern Kingdom of **Israel** was larger and wealthier than the southern Kingdom of **Judah**, though in the context of the ancient Near East, both were relatively small states\u301049\u2020L499-L507\u3011. \n\n## United Monarchy (c. 1000\u2013922\u202fBCE) \n\n### Biblical Narrative of Saul, David, and Solomon \nAccording to the Bible, Israel transitioned from a loose tribal confederation under judges to a unified monarchy around 1000\u202fBCE. **Saul** (from the tribe of Benjamin) was anointed by the prophet Samuel as the first king to rally Israel against Philistine threats. Saul\u2019s reign (traditionally 1047\u20131007\u202fBCE) is depicted as tumultuous; he achieved some military successes but fell out of divine favor due to disobedience. After Saul\u2019s death in battle, **David** of Judah became king. David (reigned c. 1000\u2013961\u202fBCE) first ruled over Judah from Hebron and then, according to the biblical account, united all twelve tribes under his rule\u301022\u2020L253-L261\u3011\u301022\u2020L269-L277\u3011. He captured the Canaanite fortress of **Jerusalem**, making it his capital, and brought the Ark of the Covenant there to establish it as the political and religious center. David\u2019s reign is portrayed as a golden age of expansion \u2013 he is said to have defeated surrounding enemies (Philistines, Moabites, Arameans, etc.), creating a sizable kingdom stretching from the Negev to the Euphrates. Despite personal and family dramas (such as the Bathsheba incident and the rebellion of his son Absalom), David is remembered as the founder of an enduring **Davidic dynasty**. \n\nDavid\u2019s son **Solomon** (reigned c. 961\u2013922\u202fBCE) inherited a powerful kingdom and is famed for his wisdom, wealth, and monumental building projects. The Bible credits Solomon with building the **First Temple** in Jerusalem, a grand royal palace, and fortifying key cities: \u201cSolomon built **Hazor**, **Megiddo**, and **Gezer**\u201d (1\u202fKings 9:15) among others\u301013\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Solomon\u2019s reign is described as an era of prosperity and international renown: he formed alliances (notably with Phoenicia and Egypt), developed trade (importing gold, copper, and other luxury goods), and undertook massive construction using forced labor and heavy taxation. However, the Bible also notes Solomon\u2019s shortcomings. In his later years he reputedly took many foreign wives and accommodated their deities, building high places for gods like Ashtoreth, Chemosh, and Milcom, thus \u201cdoing what was not right in the sight of Yahweh\u201d (1\u202fKings 11:4-8)\u301024\u2020L679-L687\u3011\u301024\u2020L681-L689\u3011. Internally, resentment grew in the northern tribes over Solomon\u2019s **corv\u00e9e** (forced labor gangs) and fiscal burdens. The seeds of future division were sown during Solomon\u2019s otherwise splendid rule. By biblical chronology, the United Monarchy lasted about a century under three kings \u2013 Saul, David, Solomon \u2013 and ended with Solomon\u2019s death (conventionally dated 922\u202fBCE)\u301024\u2020L669-L677\u3011\u301022\u2020L253-L261\u3011.\n\n### Archaeological Evidence and Scholarly Debate \nWhether a **\u201cunited monarchy\u201d** as grand as the Bible describes actually existed in the 10th century BCE is a matter of intense debate\u301022\u2020L261-L270\u3011\u301022\u2020L272-L281\u3011. On one hand, the Bible\u2019s narrative of David and Solomon\u2019s extensive kingdom lacks clear contemporary corroboration. No royal inscriptions from David or Solomon\u2019s time have been found, and indeed \u201cthere are no *written* records from the time of the united monarchy (indeed very little written material altogether) and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon\u201d outside the Bible\u301022\u2020L338-L340\u3011. Archaeologically, Jerusalem \u2013 purported capital of a vast empire \u2013 has yielded only **sparse 10th-century remains**, suggesting it was a rather small city at that time. Excavations in the City of David area have found some structures (like the Stepped Stone Structure and Large Stone Structure) that a few archaeologists attribute to 10th-century construction, possibly a fortress or palace, but the evidence is fragmentary and debated. Overall, the grandeur of Solomon\u2019s Jerusalem (with a majestic Temple and palace complex) remains **archaeologically elusive**, as noted by a recent summary: \u201cNo archaeological evidence has been found that even remotely supports the grandeur described in the biblical accounts of David and Solomon\u201d\u30108\u2020L1-L4\u3011. This gap between text and artifacts has fueled a divide between **maximalists** and **minimalists** in biblical archaeology. \n\n**Maximalist** scholars maintain that David and Solomon were real kings and that the Bible\u2019s account, while perhaps exaggerated, preserves a core of historical truth. They point to clues like large fortified gates and public buildings at sites that the Bible associates with Solomon. Notably, 6-chambered city gates and casemate walls have been excavated at **Hazor, Megiddo,** and **Gezer** \u2013 all sites listed in 1\u202fKings 9:15 as fortified by Solomon. Earlier archaeologists (Yigael Yadin, William F. Albright, Y. Yadin, and others) dated these structures to the 10th century BCE, seeing them as physical evidence of Solomon\u2019s centralized state and building program\u301012\u2020L40-L49\u3011\u301012\u2020L61-L69\u3011. Recent excavations at Gezer, for example, uncovered a massive gate, casemate wall, and administrative building that the excavators date to **Solomon\u2019s reign (mid-10th century)**. They report that \u201cduring Solomon\u2019s reign, Gezer underwent a radical change \u2013 it became a well-fortified city with a massive six-chambered gate and an adjoining administrative complex\u2026confirm[ing] that during the tenth century, Gezer was a fortified city most likely administered by a royal authority\u201d\u301013\u2020L87-L94\u3011\u301013\u2020L98-L107\u3011. **Radiocarbon dating** and stratigraphic analysis at Gezer have been interpreted to support a 10th-century date for this complex, lending credence to the biblical depiction of Solomon\u2019s building activities\u301013\u2020L87-L94\u3011\u301013\u2020L131-L139\u3011. The **Tel Gezer gate** (see image) is nearly identical in plan to those at Hazor and Megiddo, suggesting a common architectural program, possibly under Solomon\u2019s direction\u301013\u2020L102-L110\u3011.\n\n\u301033\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Monumental six-chambered city gate at Gezer, traditionally attributed to Solomon\u2019s building program (1\u202fKings 9:15). Recent excavations show that in the mid-10th century BCE Gezer had massive fortifications and an adjacent administrative building\u301013\u2020L50-L58\u3011\u301013\u2020L87-L94\u3011. (Courtesy of Tel Gezer Excavation Project)*\n\n**Minimalist** or revisionist scholars, however, argue that the 10th-century \u201cempire\u201d of David and Solomon is largely a later literary construct. They note that if one \u201caccepts the Low Chronology\u201d (a redating of strata by ~75\u2013100 years later), many of the monumental structures once ascribed to Solomon *actually belong to the 9th century BCE*, a time of Omride expansion\u301022\u2020L303-L312\u3011\u301022\u2020L313-L321\u3011. This *Low Chronology*, championed by Prof. Israel Finkelstein, contends that the very gates and palaces at Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer were built in the **early 9th century** (perhaps under the northern Kingdom of Israel\u2019s Omride dynasty), not in Solomon\u2019s 10th century\u301012\u2020L22-L30\u3011\u301012\u2020L51-L59\u3011. Finkelstein famously wrote that \u201caccepting the Low Chronology means **stripping the United Monarchy of monumental buildings**, including ashlar masonry and proto-Ionic capitals\u201d \u2013 essentially removing any archaeological proof of Solomon\u2019s grandeur\u301022\u2020L307-L315\u3011. In his view, Judah in the 10th century was a modest tribal kingdom at best, and the Biblical depiction of a magnificent empire is a later ideological **\u201canachronistic exaggeration\u201d**\u301022\u2020L285-L293\u3011 crafted during the 7th or 6th century BCE. Some extreme minimalist positions even doubted the very existence of King David as a historical figure\u30106\u2020L118-L127\u3011\u30106\u2020L139-L147\u3011.\n\nCrucial evidence emerged in the 1990s that shifted this debate. In 1993 at Tel Dan (northern Israel), archaeologists discovered a fragmentary **Aramaic inscription** dated to the mid-9th century BCE. This **Tel Dan Stele** (attributed to Hazael, king of Damascus) recounts the Aramean king\u2019s victory over his southern neighbors and famously boasts of killing the \u201cking of Israel\u201d and the \u201cking of the **House of David**.\u201d\u301035\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301035\u2020L92-L100\u3011 This was a groundbreaking find: *\u201cThe Tel Dan inscription unmistakably indicates the existence of a dynasty in the ninth century B.C.E. that traced its origin to David.\u201d*\u30106\u2020L218-L226\u3011 In other words, by ~840\u202fBCE an Aramean enemy recognized a **\u201cHouse of David\u201d** ruling Judah \u2013 compelling evidence that David was not a later fictional invention, but the remembered founder of a Judean royal line\u301035\u2020L92-L100\u3011\u301035\u2020L102-L110\u3011. The Tel Dan Stele, the **earliest extra-biblical reference to David**, thus confirms *David as a historical figure* (though it says nothing about the size of his realm)\u301035\u2020L92-L100\u3011\u301035\u2020L102-L110\u3011. Likewise, another inscription \u2013 the **Mesha Stele** from Moab (c. 840\u202fBCE) \u2013 describes how Moab rebelled against Israelite domination. In that text, King Mesha of Moab celebrates freeing his land from Israel\u2019s control, mentions Israel\u2019s King **Omri** by name, and likely refers to the kingdom of Judah as the \u201cHouse of David\u201d in a damaged line\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L63-L71\u3011. Recent high-resolution imaging of the Mesha Stele\u2019s line 31 supports reading *\u201cBT[D]WD\u201d* (\u201cHouse of David\u201d), implying Moab knew of Judah\u2019s Davidic dynasty as well\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L89-L97\u3011. These inscriptions \u2013 from enemy nations \u2013 provide **non-biblical confirmation** that by the 9th century the **Davidic dynasty in Judah** was recognized, even if the 10th-century glory of Solomon\u2019s united kingdom remains unproven.\n\nIn summary, there is **strong evidence that David and Solomon were historical rulers of Judah**, but archaeology suggests their 10th-century kingdom was likely much smaller in scale than the Bible\u2019s account of a united monarchy over all Israel. The biblical narrative of a wealthy, expansive empire centered in Jerusalem finds little support in the material record (leading many scholars to deem it **\u201cexaggerated\u201d or anachronistic\u301022\u2020L285-L293\u3011**). By contrast, the **9th-century** evidence (Tel Dan Stele, Mesha Stele, later Assyrian records) **clearly attests to two successor kingdoms**, Israel and Judah, descended from the monarchies of David and Solomon. This sets the stage for the kingdom\u2019s rupture and the distinct histories of north and south.\n\n## Division of the Kingdom (c. 922\u202fBCE) \n\nThe united kingdom is said to have split apart upon Solomon\u2019s death (ca. 922 BCE) due to longstanding tribal tensions and a succession dispute. The Bible gives a detailed **account of the schism** in 1\u202fKings 11\u201312 (with a parallel in 2\u202fChronicles 10). According to that account, one of Solomon\u2019s former officials, **Jeroboam son of Nebat** of the tribe of Ephraim, led the resistance. Earlier, the prophet **Ahijah of Shiloh** had symbolically foretold this split: Ahijah met Jeroboam on a road, tore a new cloak into twelve pieces, and told Jeroboam to take ten \u2013 a sign that God would give him rule over ten tribes of Israel, leaving only two tribes (Judah and Benjamin) under Solomon\u2019s son as punishment for Solomon\u2019s idolatry\u301024\u2020L673-L681\u3011\u301024\u2020L679-L687\u3011. Hearing of this prophecy, Solomon had sought to kill Jeroboam, who fled to Egypt for asylum under Pharaoh Sheshonk I (biblical \u201cShishak\u201d)\u301024\u2020L681-L687\u3011. \n\nWhen **King Solomon died in 922** BCE, his son **Rehoboam** inherited the throne in Jerusalem\u301024\u2020L673-L681\u3011. Rehoboam traveled to **Shechem** in the north to be formally acclaimed by the northern tribes\u301024\u2020L689-L697\u3011. The northern Israelites, with Jeroboam now returned from exile as their spokesman, seized this moment to air grievances. They petitioned Rehoboam to **lighten the harsh labor and taxation** load that Solomon had imposed: \u201cYour father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you\u201d (1\u202fKings 12:4). Rehoboam infamously rejected their plea. Ignoring the counsel of elder advisors to show moderation, he heeded his younger courtiers who urged a display of toughness\u301024\u2020L689-L697\u3011\u301024\u2020L698-L707\u3011. After three days Rehoboam answered the people arrogantly, saying **\u201cMy father made your yoke heavy, **but I will add to your yoke**; my father chastised you with whips, **but I will chastise you with scorpions**\u201d**\u301024\u2020L699-L707\u3011. This tyrannical response provoked an immediate rebellion. The northern tribes raised the ancient cry of secession: **\u201cTo your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, O David!\u201d** (1\u202fKings 12:16)\u301024\u2020L699-L707\u3011. In effect, the ten northern tribes repudiated the Davidic king and declared independence. They proclaimed **Jeroboam** as their king, thus forming a separate kingdom of **Israel** in the north. Only the tribes of **Judah** (and Benjamin, with Levi scattered) remained loyal to Rehoboam, forming the southern kingdom of **Judah**\u301024\u2020L699-L707\u3011.\n\nRehoboam, still king in Judah, initially mustered an army to force the north back under his rule. However, the prophet **Shemaiah** delivered a word from God prohibiting civil war: \u201cYou shall not go up or fight against your brethren the people of Israel\u201d (1\u202fKings 12:24). Rehoboam relented, and the division solidified without further bloodshed at that time\u301024\u2020L703-L711\u3011\u301024\u2020L705-L714\u3011. The united monarchy had lasted only about a century; henceforth there would be two Hebrew kingdoms, as the biblical chronicler notes, *\u201cIsrael in the north from 922\u2013721\u202fBCE and Judah in the south until 586\u202fBCE.\u201d*\u301024\u2020L703-L711\u3011\u301024\u2020L709-L717\u3011 This **schism of 922 BCE** is attributed by the biblical writers to Solomon\u2019s apostasy and God\u2019s judgment, though proximate causes included **Solomon\u2019s oppressive policies** and Rehoboam\u2019s rash arrogance. Solomon\u2019s **forced labor and heavy taxation** had alienated the north, and once the unifying figure of Solomon was gone, the delicate balance snapped. It is significant that external sources do not mention this specific event \u2013 our information comes solely from the biblical text, written centuries later. From an archaeological perspective, there is **no direct evidence** of the meeting at Shechem or the revolt itself, and the division is essentially a **biblical tradition**. Nevertheless, the subsequent existence of two distinct kingdoms (Israel and Judah) in the 9th\u20138th centuries BCE is well attested by extrabiblical sources, implying that a political break did occur around this time (even if the precise biblical details cannot be externally verified). \n\n## Two Kingdoms Period (922\u2013722\u202fBCE) \n\nAfter the division, the **Kingdom of Israel** (north) and the **Kingdom of Judah** (south) co-existed as separate states for about 200 years, from ~922 BCE until Israel\u2019s destruction in 722\u202fBCE. Their histories ran in parallel, occasionally interacting as allies or enemies. Below, we outline each kingdom\u2019s characteristics and history, followed by the archaeological and external evidence pertaining to them. By the 9th century, evidence from inscriptions and excavations strongly corroborates the reality of these two kingdoms, even as the biblical texts describing them (primarily 1\u20132\u202fKings and 2\u202fChronicles) were compiled later with theological agendas. \n\n### Kingdom of Israel (Northern Kingdom) \n\n**Biblical Overview:** The northern kingdom, called **Israel** or sometimes \u201cEphraim\u201d or \u201cSamaria,\u201d comprised ten tribes located in the more fertile and populous regions of central and northern Palestine. It was **larger, more populous, and economically richer** than Judah, with control over major trade routes and agriculturally productive areas (the Jezreel Valley, Galilee, Gilead, etc.). Initially Jeroboam I made his capital at **Shechem**, an ancient tribal center, and later at **Tirzah**. In the mid-9th century, King **Omri** built a new capital city, **Samaria**, which remained Israel\u2019s political center thereafter\u301027\u2020L715-L723\u3011\u301019\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Politically, Israel\u2019s history was unstable: it saw frequent **dynastic changes and coups**. Jeroboam I ruled ~22 years (c. 922\u2013901\u202fBCE)\u301027\u2020L713-L720\u3011, but his son was assassinated, and a rapid succession of kings followed (Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri) as recorded in 1\u202fKings 15\u201316\u301027\u2020L744-L753\u3011\u301027\u2020L753-L760\u3011. Eventually **Omri** (ruled c. 884\u2013873) seized power and founded a relatively strong dynasty. The **Omrides** \u2013 Omri and his son **Ahab** (c. 873\u2013852) \u2013 brought stability and prosperity. Omri is noted for **establishing Samaria** and likely subduing Moab (as the Mesha Stele confirms Omri\u2019s domination of Moab\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L79-L87\u3011). King **Ahab**, Omri\u2019s son, is portrayed in the Bible as economically flourishing but religiously wayward (due to his Phoenician queen Jezebel and promotion of Baal worship). During Ahab\u2019s time, the northern kingdom\u2019s power is evident: Ahab fielded a sizable chariot army (the Bible mentions 2,000 chariots) and engaged in international conflicts\u301017\u2020L138-L146\u3011. Indeed, **Assyrian records** (the Kurkh Monolith of Shalmaneser III) list \u201cAhab the Israelite\u201d as a participant in the Battle of Qarqar (853\u202fBCE), contributing a large chariot force to a coalition that fought the Assyrians\u301017\u2020L138-L146\u3011. This is the **earliest known Assyrian reference to Israel** and it portrays Israel as a significant military player by mid-9th century. \n\nAfter Ahab\u2019s death, Israel was embroiled in war with Damascus and internal strife. In 841\u202fBCE, a coup led by **Jehu** (an army commander turned king, encouraged by the prophet Elisha) overthrew Ahab\u2019s son and massacred the Omride royal family (as well as Judah\u2019s king Ahaziah who happened to be present). Jehu then became king and founded his own dynasty. In the Bible, Jehu is noted for his brutal purge of Baal worship (2\u202fKings 9\u201310), but politically he paid tribute to Assyria. The Assyrian **Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III** famously depicts **Jehu son of Omri** bowing before the Assyrian king and offering tribute in 841\u202fBCE\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301017\u2020L107-L115\u3011. (The inscription\u2019s designation of Jehu as \u201cson of Omri\u201d reflects Assyrian usage: they referred to Israel as *Bit-Humri* = \u201cHouse of Omri,\u201d treating Omri as the founder of the state, so any Israelite king was labeled a \u2018son\u2019 or successor of Omri\u301017\u2020L137-L145\u3011.) This Black Obelisk panel provides a vivid contemporary image of an Israelite king and confirms Israel\u2019s subjugation to Assyria in the 9th century\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301017\u2020L138-L146\u3011.\n\nFollowing Jehu, the northern kingdom experienced alternating periods of prosperity and decline. In the 8th century, especially under **Jeroboam II** (c. 786\u2013746\u202fBCE), Israel enjoyed renewed wealth and expansion (as reflected in biblical accounts and Amos\u2019 prophecy of social excess). However, rising Assyrian aggression soon threatened the region. Multiple Israelite kings (Menahem, Pekah, Hoshea) are mentioned in Assyrian records, often as vassals or rebels. The Bible and Assyrian sources together recount how Israel\u2019s last decades were marked by heavy **Assyrian intervention**: Tiglath-Pileser III campaigned in the region, annexing parts of Israel\u2019s territory and receiving tribute from King Menahem of Samaria in the 730s BCE. Ultimately, Israel\u2019s independence ended with the **Assyrian conquest of Samaria**. The Assyrian king Shalmaneser\u00a0V besieged Samaria, and it fell in 722\u202fBCE; his successor **Sargon\u00a0II** claimed credit for finishing the conquest, stating in his annals: *\u201cI besieged and conquered Samaria, led away as booty 27,290 inhabitants\u2026 and formed [the land] into an Assyrian province.\u201d* Israel\u2019s king Hoshea was deposed, and the ten northern tribes were deported and dispersed throughout the Assyrian Empire (the origin of the legend of the \u201cLost Ten Tribes\u201d)\u301049\u2020L523-L531\u3011\u301049\u2020L525-L534\u3011. The northern kingdom of Israel was no more, its territory becoming the Assyrian province of Samerina. \n\n**Religion and Culture:** From the outset, Israel had a **religious schism** with Judah. King Jeroboam I, to solidify his rule and prevent his people from pilgrimaging to the Temple in Jerusalem, established **alternative sanctuaries**. He placed **golden calves** (bull idol statues) at **Bethel** (on Israel\u2019s southern border) and **Dan** (in the far north) and declared these to be Israel\u2019s gods who brought them from Egypt (1\u202fKings 12:28-30). The Bible condemns this as the \u201csin of Jeroboam,\u201d viewing it as idolatry, though it\u2019s possible Jeroboam intended these bull images as pedestals for Yahweh (similar to cherubim in the Jerusalem Temple) rather than as foreign gods\u301027\u2020L715-L723\u3011\u301027\u2020L725-L734\u3011. He also established a non-Levitical priesthood and shifted the festival calendar, moves resented by the Judean-oriented biblical historians\u301027\u2020L731-L740\u3011\u301027\u2020L735-L742\u3011. The northern kingdom was thus characterized by **pluralistic worship**, with Yahweh worship taking place at local shrines and high places, alongside cults of Baal and Asherah (especially during Ahab and Jezebel\u2019s time). Culturally and economically, Israel was more cosmopolitan \u2013 interacting with Phoenicia, Aram-Damascus, and other neighbors \u2013 which the prophets warn led to syncretism and social injustice.\n\n**Key Features of the Kingdom of Israel:**  \n- **Capital:** Initially Shechem, then Tirzah; **Samaria** was built by Omri as the new capital (c. 880s\u202fBCE) and remained the royal city\u301027\u2020L715-L723\u3011\u301019\u2020L55-L63\u3011.  \n- **Dynasties and Kings:** Frequent turnover. Notable kings include **Jeroboam I** (founder, 10 tribes revolt leader)\u301024\u2020L699-L707\u3011\u301027\u2020L713-L720\u3011, **Omri** (established strong dynasty and new capital)\u301019\u2020L55-L63\u3011, **Ahab** (Omri\u2019s son, peak of northern power, mentioned in Assyrian records)\u301017\u2020L138-L146\u3011, and **Jehu** (usurper who paid Assyrian tribute, depicted on the Black Obelisk)\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011. Later kings like **Jeroboam II** brought prosperity, but the last kings (Pekah, Hoshea) saw the kingdom fall to Assyria.  \n- **Religious Centers:** **Bethel** and **Dan** served as royal sanctuaries with golden calf idols instituted by Jeroboam I to rival Jerusalem\u301027\u2020L715-L723\u3011. Other cities (Samaria, Jezreel, Dan, etc.) had temples or high places; Samaria had a notable Baal temple in Ahab\u2019s time (per 1\u202fKings 16:32). Prophets like Elijah and Hosea were active in denouncing Israel\u2019s syncretism.  \n- **Foreign Relations:** Often in conflict with or subjugated by **Aram-Damascus** (many wars between Israel and Damascus are recorded). From mid-9th century onward, came under pressure from **Assyria** \u2013 paying tribute or rebelling. **Assyrian inscriptions** refer to Israel as \u201cHouse of Omri\u201d (*Bit-Humri*) and document interactions with its kings (Ahab at Qarqar; Jehu\u2019s tribute; Tiglath-Pileser III\u2019s campaigns)\u301017\u2020L138-L146\u3011\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011.  \n- **Demise:** Conquered by Assyria in **722\u202fBCE** after a three-year siege of Samaria. The elite and many inhabitants were deported (scattered in Mesopotamia), leading to the notion of the \u201cTen Lost Tribes.\u201d The land was re-populated partly by foreign peoples, giving rise to the mixed Samaritan people later\u301049\u2020L523-L531\u3011\u301049\u2020L525-L534\u3011.\n\n**Archaeology and Inscriptions (Israel):** The archaeological record in the northern kingdom is **rich** and aligns with a state-level society by the 9th century. At **Samaria**, excavations have uncovered Omri\u2019s royal **palace** complex. Constructed of fine ashlar masonry on a hilltop, this palace fits the **\u201cbit-hilani\u201d** style (a North Syrian\u2013influenced design) and is likely the \u201civory house\u201d that Ahab adorned with ivory inlays\u301019\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301019\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Indeed, numerous carved **ivory plaques** and fragments (the *Samaria Ivories*) were found in the ruins of Samaria\u2019s palace area, testifying to its opulence in the 9th\u20138th centuries B.C.E. \u2013 exactly as the Bible\u2019s aside about Ahab\u2019s \u201chouse of ivory\u201d suggests (1\u202fKings 22:39)\u301019\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301019\u2020L59-L67\u3011. These ivories, along with luxury Samarian pottery and elaborate architecture, indicate Israel\u2019s wealth and cosmopolitan taste during the Omride period. Other major sites in Israel show substantial Iron Age II remains: **Megiddo**, **Hazor**, and **Dan** each have large buildings and fortifications from the 9th\u20138th centuries. At Dan (Tel Dan), archaeologists found a cultic high place that may correspond to Jeroboam\u2019s sanctuary (complete with an altar platform and metal bull figurine fragments), underscoring the biblical note that Dan was a cult center\u30106\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u30106\u2020L169-L178\u3011. The cities of the northern kingdom often show **destruction layers** corresponding to known conflicts (e.g., Hazor shows a destruction in late 9th century, possibly by Hazael of Damascus, who is known from the Tel Dan Stele to have defeated Israel and Judah about that time\u301035\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301035\u2020L69-L74\u3011). \n\nImportantly, numerous **contemporary inscriptions** reference Israel and its kings. As mentioned, the **Mesha Stele** (Moabite Stone, c. 840\u202fBCE) in Moabite language celebrates King Mesha\u2019s revolt *\u201cagainst Omri king of Israel\u201d* and succeeding dynasty. It says Omri had subjugated Moab, and that Mesha defeated Omri\u2019s son, liberating Moab\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L79-L87\u3011. This stele not only confirms Omri and (by implication) Ahab, but also likely contains the phrase \u201cHouse of David\u201d in reference to the \u201cking of Judah\u201d who joined Israel in war against Mesha (cf. 2\u202fKings 3)\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L63-L71\u3011. The **Tel Dan Stele** (mid-9th cent.) provides further evidence: it explicitly mentions a **\u201cking of Israel\u201d** (likely Joram, Ahab\u2019s son) and a **\u201cking of the House of David\u201d** (likely Ahaziah of Judah), claiming both were slain by the Aramean king\u301035\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301035\u2020L69-L77\u3011. This stele demonstrates that by ~840\u202fBCE the neighboring Arameans recognized Israel and Judah as separate kingdoms, and it underscores the prominence of the Omride dynasty (since Israel is not named \u201cIsrael\u201d in the text but referred to by its dynasty, \u201cHouse of Omri\u201d). From Assyria, the **Kurkh Monolith** of Shalmaneser\u00a0III (c. 853\u00a0BCE) lists **Ahab of Israel** among a coalition of Syrian and Canaanite kings\u301017\u2020L138-L146\u3011. Slightly later, the **Black Obelisk** (c. 825\u00a0BCE) depicts **Jehu** of Israel kneeling to Shalmaneser and delivering tribute, with the cuneiform caption: *\u201cThe tribute of Jehu (Ia-\u00fa-a), son of Omri (\u1e2au-um-ri)\u2026 silver, gold, a golden bowl, golden vases\u2026 I received from him.\u201d*\u301017\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301017\u2020L107-L115\u3011 This is a direct Assyrian record of Israel\u2019s king and confirms the biblical picture of Jehu\u2019s era when Israel became a vassal to Assyria (2\u00a0Kings 10:31-32 hints at territorial losses to Aram, and the tribute to Assyria fits the pattern of decline)\u301016\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301016\u2020L69-L77\u3011. In the late 8th century, Assyrian royal annals and stelae mention **Menahem of Samaria** paying tribute to Tiglath-Pileser\u00a0III around 738\u00a0BCE, and **Hoshea**\u2019s rebellion prompting the final siege of Samaria by Shalmaneser\u00a0V (as recorded in Assyrian chronicles and the Bible, 2\u00a0Kings 17:3-6). Thus, by combining archaeological findings with these inscriptions, scholars have a robust outline of Israel\u2019s history independent of the Bible, *at least from the 9th century onward*. All this evidence strongly corroborates the existence of a northern Kingdom of Israel that was sizeable and active on the international scene until its destruction. \n\n### Kingdom of Judah (Southern Kingdom) \n\n**Biblical Overview:** The southern kingdom, known as **Judah**, comprised the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (with many **Levites** also aligning with Judah, according to 2\u00a0Chron 11:13-14). It was centered in the highlands of Judea, with its capital at **Jerusalem**. According to the Bible, Judah\u2019s monarchy continued the **Davidic dynasty** unbroken \u2013 every king of Judah was a descendant of David, from Rehoboam (Solomon\u2019s son) onward\u301024\u2020L699-L707\u3011\u301027\u2020L709-L717\u3011. This continuity gave Judah a certain political stability and a strong dynastic legitimacy in the eyes of its people (and later biblical authors). However, Judah was **smaller and less wealthy** than Israel. Its territory was mostly the hill country and Negev, less fertile than Israel\u2019s northern valleys. Its population was lower, and it had fewer major trade routes (Judah was somewhat isolated except for the route through the Hill Country and the Shephelah to the coast). Throughout the divided era, Judah often had to play a careful game of survival among stronger neighbors. \n\nRehoboam\u2019s early reign was troubled \u2013 besides the secession of the north, he faced invasions from Egypt. In *Rehoboam\u2019s fifth year*, Pharaoh **Shishak (Sheshonk\u00a0I)** of Egypt invaded (1\u00a0Kings 14:25-26), looting treasures from Jerusalem. This is corroborated by Egyptian records (see Evidence below). Rehoboam and his successors (such as Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat) ruled over a **much reduced realm** compared to Solomon\u2019s empire, essentially the tribe of Judah\u2019s territory, with Benjamin and the capital city. Despite its smaller size, Judah maintained the prestige of Jerusalem as the site of **Solomon\u2019s Temple**, the central sanctuary of Yahweh. The Temple and its priesthood became a unifying focal point for Judah\u2019s identity. The **Davidic covenant** (2\u00a0Samuel 7) \u2013 the theological idea that David\u2019s line would eternally rule \u2013 also undergirded Judah\u2019s political ideology. \n\nJudah\u2019s biblical history in this period is characterized by *relative* stability in dynasty but frequent ups and downs in **religious fidelity** (as judged by the biblical authors). A few kings are praised for doing \u201cright in the eyes of Yahweh\u201d (e.g., Asa, Jehoshaphat, later Joash, Hezekiah), purging idols and high places; others are criticized for tolerating pagan practices. There were some conflicts between Judah and Israel \u2013 for example, King Abijah of Judah fought Jeroboam I; later, wars occurred or alliances were forged (Jehoshaphat of Judah allied with Ahab of Israel against Syria). Generally, Judah was the **weaker** of the two: by the 9th century, the Omride kings of Israel occasionally exerted influence over Judah (through marriage alliances \u2013 e.g., King Jehoram of Judah married Ahab\u2019s daughter Athaliah \u2013 and possibly vassalage). After Jehu\u2019s coup in Israel (841\u00a0BCE), the collateral damage was that King **Ahaziah of Judah** (a grandson of Ahab) was also killed\u301017\u2020L69-L77\u3011. Queen **Athaliah** then seized power in Jerusalem (a rare case of a ruling queen), until the Davidic heir Joash was restored. This episode shows the interconnectedness of the two kingdoms\u2019 royal houses in the 9th century. \n\nDuring the 8th century, Judah managed to survive while Israel fell. Notably, **King Ahaz** of Judah (c. 732\u00a0BCE) chose to become an Assyrian vassal when Israel and Damascus tried to force him into an anti-Assyrian coalition (the Syro-Ephraimite War). Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser\u00a0III, as recorded in both Bible (2\u00a0Kings 16:7-8) and an Assyrian summary inscription that lists tribute from **\u201cJehoahaz of Judah\u201d** (Jehoahaz being Ahaz\u2019s full name)\u301016\u2020L98-L107\u3011. This submission spared Judah the fate of Israel, at least for a time. Under King **Hezekiah** (c. 715\u2013686\u00a0BCE), Judah attempted to reassert independence during the collapse of Assyria\u2019s first onslaught \u2013 Hezekiah is famous for religious reforms and fortifying Jerusalem (digging the Siloam water tunnel, etc.). However, Hezekiah\u2019s revolt led to **Sennacherib\u2019s invasion** of Judah in 701\u00a0BCE: Assyrian records (Sennacherib\u2019s Prism) describe the devastation of the countryside and the siege of Jerusalem, stating *\u201cI shut up Hezekiah the Judahite within Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage\u201d*. Jerusalem narrowly escaped capture (the Bible attributes this to divine intervention \u2013 2\u00a0Kings 19 \u2013 and indeed Sennacherib\u2019s annals do not claim the city fell). This is slightly beyond the 722\u00a0BCE cutoff, but it highlights that **Judah outlived Israel** by about 135 years. Ultimately, Judah too met its end at the hands of a Mesopotamian empire: **Babylon** conquered Jerusalem in 586\u00a0BCE, exiling the Judahites. \n\nDuring the divided monarchy period (922\u2013722\u00a0BCE), **Judah\u2019s profile** was that of a **smaller, more isolated kingdom** that often acted defensively. It cultivated a distinct identity centered on the Davidic kingship and the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem. Many of the biblical texts (especially *Chronicles*) reflect the concerns of Judah, often downplaying the northern kingdom. By ancient Near Eastern standards, Judah was a **minor state** \u2013 \u201ctiny\u2026no bigger than Connecticut\u201d as one historian quipped, hemmed in by great powers\u301049\u2020L499-L507\u3011. Its survival when Israel fell can be attributed to a combination of geography (Jerusalem\u2019s strong position), statesmanship (e.g., paying Assyria when needed), and perhaps luck. \n\n**Key Features of the Kingdom of Judah:**  \n- **Capital:** **Jerusalem**, the city of David. It housed the **Solomonic Temple** (First Temple) on Mount Zion, which was the spiritual and political heart of Judah. Jerusalem remained the uninterrupted capital until its destruction in 586\u00a0BCE.  \n- **Dynasty:** **Davidic line** throughout. Kings from Rehoboam onward were direct descendants of David, giving Judah a stable dynastic legitimacy. Notable kings in this era include **Asa** and **Jehoshaphat** (9th century reformers who prospered), **Uzziah** (Azariah, 8th century, who enjoyed a long reign of expansion), **Ahaz** (who submitted to Assyria), and **Hezekiah** (who rebelled against Assyria and saw Jerusalem delivered). A unique event was the usurpation by **Queen Athaliah** (not of Davidic blood) c. 841\u2013835\u00a0BCE, but the Davidic line was restored with Joash.  \n- **Religious Center:** The **Temple in Jerusalem**, containing the Ark of the Covenant, was the exclusive center of official worship for Judah. The Judahite kings (ideally) were custodians of this Temple and the purity of Yahweh worship. While high places existed and some idolatry occurred (which some kings tried to suppress), the **Jerusalem Temple cult** remained central. This gave Judah a more centralized religion compared to Israel\u2019s dispersed cult. The priesthood and prophets in Judah (like Isaiah in the 8th century) often supported the Davidic dynasty as chosen by Yahweh.  \n- **Economy and Society:** Predominantly rural and pastoral, with Jerusalem as the only major urban center of note (and even it was modest in size compared to northern cities). Judah\u2019s economy was smaller; however, being situated on the **route linking to Edom and Arabia**, it benefitted from some caravan trade (especially in Frankincense trade via the Negev). Still, Israel\u2019s control of international trade routes gave the north an economic edge.  \n- **Foreign Relations:** Generally overshadowed by stronger neighbors. Judah\u2019s main threats were the kingdom of **Israel** to its north (sometimes hostile, sometimes allied by marriage) and **Egypt** to the south (Egypt invaded during Rehoboam\u2019s reign\u301028\u2020L63-L71\u3011). **Assyria** became the dominant power in the region in the 8th century: Judah became an Assyrian vassal (from Ahaz\u2019s time) and was spared destruction unlike Israel. Assyrian texts begin to mention Judah directly in the late 8th century \u2013 for example, Sargon\u00a0II\u2019s records refer to **\u201cthe land of Judah\u201d** and King **Hezekiah** is prominently mentioned in Sennacherib\u2019s annals (701\u00a0BCE). Earlier, an Assyrian inscription might refer to **\u201cAzriau of Yaudi\u201d** (possibly Uzziah of Judah) around 740\u00a0BCE, but this is debated. What is clear is that by c.\u00a0730s BCE, Judah under **Ahaz** is recorded in Assyrian documents as paying tribute\u301016\u2020L98-L107\u3011.  \n- **Survival:** **Outlived Israel** as an independent kingdom until **586\u00a0BCE**. After Israel\u2019s fall in 722, Judah stood alone as the bearer of the Israelites\u2019 traditions. However, it existed under the shadow of Assyrian then Egyptian hegemony, until the Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar II besieged and destroyed Jerusalem, ending the Davidic kingdom. This later period (722\u2013586) is beyond our current scope, but it\u2019s important to note that Judah\u2019s status as a vassal and its ultimate fall in 586 were consistent with the pattern that \u201ctiny states never survived long\u201d amid the great empires\u301049\u2020L499-L507\u3011\u301049\u2020L507-L515\u3011.\n\n**Archaeology and Inscriptions (Judah):** Archaeological evidence for early monarchic **Judah (10th\u20139th centuries)** is relatively meager, especially when compared to the north. Excavations in Jerusalem have long been hampered by continuous habitation and political sensitivity. What has been found from the 10th century in Jerusalem \u2013 such as portions of fortifications and a large stepped stone support structure \u2013 suggests **Jerusalem was a small fortified town** in David and Solomon\u2019s time, not a grand metropolis. One archaeologist observed that in the highlands around 1000\u00a0BCE, people \u201cdo not think, look or act like the people the biblical writers have put there. They are literary creations.\u201d\u30106\u2020L131-L139\u3011 While that statement may be extreme, it underscores the lack of clear physical evidence for a lavish 10th-century capital. As discussed, if the monumental gates at Gezer/Hazor/Megiddo are re-dated to the 9th century, Judah\u2019s archaeological footprint in the 10th becomes modest\u301022\u2020L311-L319\u3011\u301022\u2020L317-L324\u3011. Excavations at the *City of David* (the oldest part of Jerusalem) did uncover a large structure that some identify as **King David\u2019s palace**, but its date and identification are disputed in scholarly circles (some favor a 10th-century date, others argue it\u2019s later). **Khirbet Qeiyafa**, a fortified site in Judah\u2019s western foothills dated to around 1020\u2013980\u00a0BCE, has been cited by some (e.g., Y. Garfinkel) as evidence of an early Judahite state in David\u2019s time. It yielded a Hebrew inscription and urban planning, hinting that Judah may have had fortified cities early on, though critics caution it could have been a local Canaanite site. \n\nBy the 9th\u20138th centuries, more evidence for Judah emerges. Several **fortified cities** in Judah from this period have been excavated: e.g., **Lachish**, **Arad**, **Beersheba**, and others show significant building in the 9th\u20138th centuries, likely under the likes of Uzziah and Jotham. At **Lachish**, levels V\u2013IV (8th century) reveal a massive city gate and administrative center, later destroyed by Assyrians (level\u00a0III). **Arad** had a series of small fortresses and even a temple to Yahweh functioning in the 9th\u20138th centuries (showing local worship outside Jerusalem). **Beersheba** was rebuilt as a planned city in the late 9th or 8th century (with the famous Beersheba altar, later dismantled, possibly during Hezekiah\u2019s reforms). These all point to a developing state infrastructure in Judah in the century after Israel\u2019s rise. Jerusalem itself in the 8th century expanded (the population grew with refugees after 722\u00a0BCE, possibly doubling the city\u2019s size). King Hezekiah\u2019s public works are archaeologically attested: the **Siloam Tunnel** (a water tunnel inscription dated c.\u00a0701\u00a0BCE was found, though the inscription itself is now in a museum), and the **Broad Wall** fortification in Jerusalem. \n\nWhen it comes to **written records**, Judah is first attested indirectly by others. The **Tel Dan Stele** (c. 840s\u00a0BCE) is the earliest known mention of the kingdom of Judah, albeit not by the name \u201cJudah\u201d but by its dynastic name: *\u201cHouse of David.\u201d* In Hazael\u2019s victory stele, as noted, he claims to have killed a king of the House of David (i.e. a Judean king)\u301035\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301035\u2020L69-L77\u3011. This indicates that by the mid-9th century, Judah (the Davidic kingdom) was a recognized entity \u2013 one important enough to figure in international warfare. The **Mesha Stele** likewise may refer to the \u201cHouse of David\u201d when mentioning a southern neighbor of Israel\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L63-L71\u3011. These are crucial because they anchor Judah\u2019s existence historically. The **Assyrian records** then begin to mention Judah by name in the late 8th century. A summary inscription of **Tiglath-Pileser\u00a0III** from 729\u00a0BCE lists tributaries, including *\u201cJehoahaz (Ahaz) of Judah\u201d* giving tribute of gold, silver, tin, iron, and linens\u301016\u2020L98-L107\u3011. This confirms King Ahaz\u2019s vassalage as described in 2\u00a0Kings 16. In 701\u00a0BCE, King **Hezekiah of Judah** is central in Assyrian accounts of Sennacherib\u2019s campaign (though this falls just outside the period up to 722\u00a0BCE, it underscores Judah\u2019s continued existence and the veracity of biblical events such as the siege of Lachish and Jerusalem). The famous **Sennacherib\u2019s Prism** (Taylor Prism) devotes considerable attention to Judah: it enumerates the cities of Judah captured and notes the siege of Jerusalem with Hezekiah trapped inside\u301016\u2020L112-L120\u3011\u301016\u2020L118-L122\u3011. Earlier 8th-century prophets\u2019 texts (Isaiah, Micah, etc.) and later compiled chronicles also provide internal evidence of Judah\u2019s state and society, but those are part of the biblical corpus rather than independent sources.\n\nOne should note that **Egyptian records** of this period are sparse, but one significant correlation is Pharaoh **Sheshonk\u00a0I\u2019s campaign** (ca. 925\u00a0BCE), which the Bible mentions (as Shishak\u2019s invasion under Rehoboam). At the Temple of Amun in **Karnak**, Sheshonk left a victory relief (the Bubastite Portal) listing about 150 place names he conquered in Canaan\u301028\u2020L63-L71\u3011\u301028\u2020L67-L75\u3011. Many of these names correspond to sites in Israel and Judah. While **Jerusalem** is notably *absent* from the legible list, likely because Sheshonk did not sack it (perhaps Rehoboam bought him off with tribute, as 2\u00a0Chronicles 12:9 implies and some scholars suggest\u301028\u2020L91-L99\u3011\u301028\u2020L99-L105\u3011), the list *does* include multiple cities in the hill country, Negev, and north. For example, **Gezer, Taanach, Megiddo, Beth-Shan, Gibeon, Aijalon** (interpreted by some as \u201cthe heights of David\u201d? \u2013 though that particular reading is debated\u30103\u2020L25-L33\u3011) are named. An Egyptian victory stele fragment was also found at **Megiddo**, confirming Sheshonk reached deep into Israel\u2019s territory\u301028\u2020L116-L124\u3011. This Egyptian record corroborates that around the time of the kingdom\u2019s division, both Judah and Israel were penetrated by Egypt. In short, Judah was indeed a functioning kingdom by the late 10th/early 9th century, even if it was much more **provincial** than the ambitious empire portrayed under Solomon. By the 9th\u20138th centuries, **Judah and Israel are both incontrovertibly present in the historical and archaeological record** \u2013 *\u201cthe earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel dates to about 890\u00a0BCE and that to the Kingdom of Judah dates to about 750\u00a0BCE\u201d*, as Finkelstein and Silberman note\u301022\u2020L319-L327\u3011. With finds like Tel Dan and Mesha stele, one could even push Judah\u2019s attestation back to the mid-9th century.\n\n**Extrabiblical Summary:** By the mid-9th century, a constellation of evidence \u2013 the Tel Dan Stele, Mesha Stele, and Assyrian references \u2013 **confirms the existence of two Hebrew kingdoms**. The Tel Dan Stele (c. 840\u00a0BCE) explicitly mentions both an Israelite and a Judahite king, indicating Aram-Damascus fought both\u301035\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301035\u2020L69-L77\u3011. The Mesha Stele (c. 840\u00a0BCE) shows Moab under Israel\u2019s domination and possibly interacting with Judah\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011\u301047\u2020L79-L87\u3011. From 853\u00a0BCE onward, **Assyrian records** routinely refer to the **Kingdom of Israel** (Bit-Humri) and later mention **Judah** (Yaudi). This **convergence of biblical and external data in the 9th\u20138th centuries** leaves little doubt that by that time Israel and Judah were real, distinct nations. \n\nMeanwhile, the **nature of the 10th-century United Monarchy** remains an open question in scholarship. The lack of early monumental evidence in Jerusalem and the disputed dating of key sites have led many to conclude that if a \u201cunited\u201d kingdom existed, it was probably **small-scale**, with Judah as a modest chiefdom and Israel either not yet developed or only loosely associated until the 9th century\u301022\u2020L272-L281\u3011\u301022\u2020L279-L287\u3011. The biblical narrative of a glorious empire under Solomon is likely **retrojected** from later times, perhaps reflecting the grandeur of the Omride kings or King Josiah\u2019s ambitions, rather than literal 10th-century reality\u301022\u2020L313-L321\u3011\u301022\u2020L319-L327\u3011. Nonetheless, the **\u201cHouse of David\u201d** did rule in Jerusalem, and eventually the tradition of a united Israel under David and Solomon became a cornerstone of Jewish history and theology.\n\n## Conclusion \nDuring the era of the divided monarchy (c. 922\u2013722\u00a0BCE), the two Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah developed along diverging paths but also shared a common heritage. The **biblical account** provides a detailed narrative of their kings and prophetic voices, often emphasizing theological lessons (faithfulness to Yahweh bringing prosperity, apostasy bringing disaster). The **archaeological and inscriptional record** paints these kingdoms as relatively **minor players** on the world stage \u2013 by *\u201cwithin a century of Solomon\u2019s death, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were left as tiny little states\u2026 on the larger map of the Middle East\u201d*, surrounded by much greater empires\u301049\u2020L499-L507\u3011. Indeed, both would eventually fall to those empires (Israel to Assyria, Judah to Babylon). Yet, both kingdoms are strongly attested by 9th-century evidence, underscoring that the **divided monarchy was a historical reality**. Israel in the north emerges as a populous, wealthy kingdom \u2013 with grand cities like Samaria and Megiddo, and rulers who dealt with Assyrian kings as recorded on obelisks and stelae. Judah in the south, though smaller and poorer, maintained the Davidic royal lineage and the spiritual capital of Jerusalem, leaving a legacy disproportionate to its size through the survival of biblical texts composed by its heirs. \n\nCrucially, archaeology and external texts **agree and disagree** with the Bible in various points: They **agree** that by the 9th\u20138th centuries, Israel and Judah were established kingdoms, that Omri and Ahab were powerful northern kings, that the \u201cHouse of David\u201d ruled Jerusalem, and that foreign conquests (Sheshonk\u2019s campaign, Assyria\u2019s invasions) occurred as the Bible describes\u301028\u2020L63-L71\u3011\u301028\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u301016\u2020L98-L107\u3011. They **disagree** or cast doubt on the earlier united monarchy\u2019s extent \u2013 no clear evidence has surfaced for Solomon\u2019s supposed splendour (e.g. no remains of Solomon\u2019s Temple or his palaces have been archaeologically identified, and the monumental gates attributed to him are disputed in date)\u301022\u2020L307-L315\u3011\u301022\u2020L317-L324\u3011. The maximalist-minimalist debate thus continues, though recent discoveries (e.g., at Gezer, Khirbet Qeiyafa) have given some support to a nascent 10th-century state in Judah\u301013\u2020L87-L94\u3011\u301013\u2020L131-L139\u3011. In any case, by the time of the divided monarchy, **both kingdoms were fully real** \u2013 and by the **mid-9th century, contemporary inscriptions by neighboring peoples reference the kings of Israel and Judah (House of David) by name\u301035\u2020L65-L73\u3011\u301035\u2020L92-L100\u3011**, providing historical anchors for the biblical narrative.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to contextualize Israel and Judah among their regional peers. Though cherished in biblical memory as God\u2019s chosen kingdoms, historically they were **secondary states** next to giants like Egypt, Assyria, and later Babylon. Their territories were small (on the order of     a few thousand square miles), and their resources limited. They often survived by clever diplomacy or by accepting vassal status. As one summary puts it, these kingdoms were *\u201ctiny little states\u2026 being small was a liability\u201d* in the geopolitics of the ancient Near East\u301049\u2020L499-L507\u3011\u301049\u2020L507-L515\u3011. Israel\u2019s greater size gave it an early advantage \u2013 it was more affluent and wielded more military might in the 9th century \u2013 but this also made it a prime target for Assyrian expansion, leading to its destruction. Judah, geographically more remote and perhaps viewed as less worth the trouble, endured longer, essentially by staying inconspicuous and occasionally aligning with the dominant power. In sum, the period of the united and divided kingdoms is one of **rising and falling fortunes**: an initial (if elusive) united monarchy, a dramatic breakup due to internal pressures, two rival sibling kingdoms each with periods of triumph and tragedy, and finally the fall of the northern kingdom \u2013 with the **southern kingdom left to carry the torch of Israelite identity** until its own fall in 586\u00a0BCE. \n\nThroughout this report, we have seen how the **biblical narratives, archaeological findings, and external records** can be read together to reconstruct this era. There is both convergence (for the later period) and divergence (for the early period) in these sources. Rather than resolve the scholarly debates, we have highlighted them: for example, the existence of the *Tel Dan Stele* and *Mesha Stele* confirms key elements (the Davidic dynasty, Omri\u2019s fame)\u30106\u2020L218-L226\u3011\u301047\u2020L56-L64\u3011, while the ongoing discussions over the dating of **Solomonic** architecture exemplify the challenges of aligning text and artifact\u301012\u2020L22-L30\u3011\u301012\u2020L51-L59\u3011. This approach allows us to appreciate the **complexity of ancient Israel\u2019s history** \u2013 a history that is at once illuminated by faith traditions and by the spadework of archaeology. Each source of evidence adds a layer of understanding: the Bible provides the narrative and theological interpretation; archaeology provides material culture and landscape context; inscriptions from Tel Dan, Moab, Assyria, and Egypt provide *independent timelines and names*. Together, they reveal an Israelite kingdom that likely began more humbly than described, but by the 9th century blossomed into two identifiable nation-states whose interactions and eventual fates were entwined with the superpowers of the day. Thus, the era of the united and divided kingdoms stands as a formative chapter in the history of ancient Israel, one that set the stage for much of Israel and Judah\u2019s subsequent religious and cultural development in the centuries that followed. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Biblical narrative adapted from 1\u20132\u00a0Samuel, 1\u00a0Kings, 2\u00a0Kings, 1\u20132\u00a0Chronicles.  \n- J.
