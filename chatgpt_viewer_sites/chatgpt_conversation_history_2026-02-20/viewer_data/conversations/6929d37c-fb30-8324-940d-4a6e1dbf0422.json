A near-monodiet of polished rice + little else = extremely low thiamine intake.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search32\ue201  \n\nClinically, sailors developed:\n\n- Peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness, \u201cwobbly knees\u201d)\n- Cardiovascular symptoms (edema, heart failure) \u2013 \u201cwet\u201d beriberi\n- In severe cases, paralysis and death\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search30\ue201  \n\nVitamin C deficiency (*scurvy*) was a **different** classic naval disease (especially in British sailors before citrus was introduced), but in this Japanese case the key issue was thiamine. Their problem was **not** primarily vitamin C.\n\n### How it was solved\n\nNavy physician **Takaki Kanehiro** noticed:  \n\n- Beriberi was common in **enlisted men** on rice-heavy rations, but rare in **officers** and in Western navies whose diets were more mixed.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search31\ue201  \n\nSo he ran a large-scale \u201ctrial\u201d:\n\n- One long training voyage (9 months, ~376 men) on largely white-rice diet:  \n  \u2192 169 cases of beriberi, 25 deaths.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search30\ue201  \n- A later voyage on the same route but with **rice + barley + meat + vegetables + milk/bread**:  \n  \u2192 only 16\u201314 cases and essentially no deaths.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search30\ue201  \n\nThis convinced the **Navy** the disease was dietary; they changed rations (famously including \u201cnavy curry\u201d and barley), and beriberi was almost eradicated from the fleet within a few years.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n\nThe **Army**, however, clung to an infectious-disease theory for decades, kept the polished-rice diet, and during the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905) tens of thousands of soldiers developed beriberi and ~27,000 died \u2013 more from beriberi than from battle.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search33\ue202turn0search34\ue201  \n\n---\n\nSo: you\u2019re remembering it correctly in spirit \u2013 a near-exclusive **white rice diet in the Japanese services leading to mass thiamine deficiency (beriberi)**. The vitamin in question was **B\u2081**, not C. If you\u2019re thinking about this as an analogy to modern ultra-refined diets or AI-era \u201csingle-input\u201d dependencies, there\u2019s a lot of interesting parallel structure to unpack."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":506,"end_idx":538,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaki_Kanehiro","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaki_Kanehiro?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7058449/","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7058449/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaki_Kanehiro?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Takaki Kanehiro","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaki_Kanehiro?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Short History of Epidemiology for Noninfectious Diseases in ...","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7058449/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by K Aoki \u00b7 2006 \u00b7 Cited by 9 \u2014 Thus, a popularization of the polished rice diet contributed to a nationwide spread of beriberi.
