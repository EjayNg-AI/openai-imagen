Will that slimming \r\ncentre help customers lose up to 16 pounds in just 4 weeks as promised?\r\nClaims abound in advertising and merchandise, as well as elsewhere e.g. social sciences. The \r\nmost objective way to test whether a claim is valid is to take a (random) sample and measure it.\r\nTo be specific: In H1 Maths, we measure its sample mean ( x ) and calculate how much it \r\ndeviates from an assumed population mean ( \uf06d0 , which could be based on known facts or some \r\nunverified claim). This deviation is expressed in terms of a relative score or probability, which \r\nwe compare with a predetermined standard to reach a conclusion about whether the claim is \r\nvalid. This whole procedure is known as hypothesis testing.\r\nA statistical hypothesis is a statement, which may or may not be true, concerning one or more \r\npopulation parameters (e.g. mean, variance, proportion). \r\nHypothesis testing is the procedure used to test the validity of this statement based on evidence \r\nfrom random samples drawn from the population.\r\nLet us look at some concrete examples:\r\nCoke cans are \r\n330ml.\r\nDumbbells are \r\nat least 10kg \r\neach.\r\nWe will help you \r\nlose up to 16 lbs.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 2 / 576>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://1b2f6d793efb94f#file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10#p_1.jpg","size_bytes":67885,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 576>","2021 SAJC JC1 H1 Maths\r\nChapter 6 : Hypothesis Testing 3\r\nExample 1a\r\nA fizzy drink brand claims that the mean volume of its canned drinks (the volume is normally \r\ndistributed with standard deviation 10ml) is 330ml.

The rejection of the null hypothesis will generally imply that the alternative hypothesis is \r\naccepted. In this case, we conclude that the null hypothesis is false.\r\n2. Failure to reject the null hypothesis is not the same as accepting the null hypothesis. It \r\nonly means there is insufficient statistical evidence to reject H0 in favour of H1 (i.e. H0\r\nmay or may not be true). In other words, we cannot conclude that we accept H0.\r\n6.2.2 Test Statistic\r\nThe sample statistic used to test the hypothesesis called the test statistic. In the H1 Maths syllabus, \r\nwe take the sample mean X and standardise it to obtain the standard normal distribution Z.

Recall that if we use \r\na large sample size n, then X approximately follows a normal distribution by Central Limit \r\nTheorem (CLT), so a bell curve appears!\r\nIf we now assume our null hypothesis is true, then we get something familiar:\r\nUnder H0 , \r\n2\r\nX ~N ,\r\nn\r\n\uf073\r\n\uf06d\r\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\r\nand so ~ N(0,1) /\r\nX Z\r\nn\r\n\uf06d\r\n\uf073\r\n\uf02d \uf03d .\r\nNote:\r\n1.

(If we take another carton of 24 cans and \r\nmeasured their volume, the new sample mean might be close to 330ml.) A \r\nhypothesis test assesses the likelihood that scenario will occur, without \r\nhaving to literally take another sample! Thus, we can make a decision backed \r\nby statistical theory.\r\nIn theory, if we repeatedly measure different cartons, we can plot a distribution \r\nof the sample means, called the sampling distribution of means. You might \r\nrecall this theoretical distribution follows a normal distribution for large \r\nsamples.\r\n6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test\r\nThis is the outline of the steps in hypothesis testing:\r\n1.

For \r\nexample, a school may want to gather information about the studying habits of the students. A \r\nmanufacturer of batteries may want to find out the length of lifespan of his product. \r\nFor such purposes, we need information to draw valid conclusions about a group of individuals \r\nor objects. This group of individuals or objects is called a population. \r\nA population is defined as the entire collection of objects which a statistician is interested to \r\nstudy on. The size of a population can be finite or infinite. In most situations, it is impossible \r\nor impractical to examine every individual or object of the whole population for various reasons, \r\nsuch as:\r\n(a) The population is large or infinite.\r\nE.g. the number of people who earned less than US$600 a month.\r\n(b) The collection of information may destroy the sample. \r\n E.g. when testing batteries, fireworks, electric fuses etc.\r\n(c) It may be impossible to gain access to every member of the population. \r\n E.g. measuring the lengths of ants of a particular species.\r\nTherefore it is more practical to conduct a careful study of a sample. A sample is a portion or \r\nsubset of objects drawn from the population.\r\nFor example,\r\nThis process of obtaining samples of the population is called sampling and each object of the \r\npopulation is called a sampling unit. i.e. Sampling units are the individual members of the \r\ntarget population whose characteristics are to be measured. In the above example, a sampling \r\nunit is a student from SAJC. \r\nA sampling frame is a complete list of all the members of the population. i.e. the list of all the \r\nobjectsfrom which the sample is to be chosen. Examples are school registers, membership lists, \r\nPopulation: All students in SAJC Sample: a class of 20 students ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 43 / 576>","SAJC 2021 JC1 H1 Mathematics \r\nSampling Page 3 of 36\r\nthe electoral register etc. A problem, of course, is that the list may not be up to date. In some \r\ncases, a list may not even exist.\r\nUsually, the objective of taking samples is to obtain estimates of population parameters, such \r\nas the population mean \uf06d or the population variance 2 \uf073 . For example, a population parameter \r\ncan be the height of a student in SAJC.\r\nSample estimates of population parameters are ca led statistics. A sample statistic is said to be \r\nuseful if it can be used to estimate an unknown parameter of the population.\r\nFor example in the above example, to estimate the average height of students from SAJC, we \r\ncan take a sample and compute the mean; this sample mean is a statistic that estimates the \r\npopulation mean (population parameter).\r\nThe accuracy of our estimates will depend on the method of taking the sample and the sample \r\nsize. \r\nThis process of drawing valid conclusions about the population based on the results found from \r\nthe sample is known as statistical inference (specific \uf0ae general).\r\nWhat makes a good sample?\r\nTo draw valid conclusions about the population, a sample must be free of selection bias and \r\nrepresentative.\r\nA sample is said to be unbiased if every individual in the population has an equal chance of \r\nbeing selected.\r\nEg: If we are interested in the distribution of the shoe sizes of male students in SAJC, then we \r\nshould not stand at the finish line of a cross-country race and survey the first 50 boys who cross \r\nthe line. The sample will be biased towards good runners. \r\nA sample is said to be maximally representative if the characteristics of the sample represent \r\n(as accurately as possible) the entire population.\r\nEg: If we are interested in the characteristics of army officers, we should make sure each \r\ndifferent type of officer is represented in order for the sample to be maximally representative.\r\n5.1.1 Simple Random Samples\r\nRandom Samples\r\nA sample is said to be a random sample (or a randomly chosen sample) if the method of \r\nselecting the sample is such that every member of the population has an equal probability of \r\nbeing selected and each selection is independent of each other. When carrying out a random \r\nsample, you must ensure that all possible samples are equally likely to be chosen.\r\nThe simplest type of random sample is a simple random sample of size n which is drawn from \r\na population of size N in such a manner that every possible sample of size n is equally likely to \r\nbe selected. By this method, all members of the population have an equal chance of being \r\nselected. Random sampling methods ensure that bias does not exist.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 44 / 576>","SAJC 2021 JC1 H1 Mathematics \r\nSampling Page 4 of 36\r\nExercise 1\r\n1.

In \r\nthis section, you will learn how to use samples to accurately predict what the population will \r\nbe like (e.g. population mean) and come up with a way of saying how reliable your predictions \r\nare.\r\nSuppose a population has an unknown parameter (such as the mean or variance), then an \r\nestimate of the unknown parameter can be made from information supplied by a random \r\nsample.\r\n5.4.1 Some Definitions \r\n1. An estimator is a sample statistic used to estimate the value of an unknown population \r\nparameter and it is denoted by capital letters e.g. X\r\nRecall: A sample statistic is a quantity describing a characteristic of a random sample.\r\nExamples include the mean and variance of a sample, denoted by X and 2 Sx\r\nrespectively\r\n2.

A statistic is said to be an unbiased estimator of a given parameter when the mean of \r\nthe sampling distribution of that statistic can be shown to be equal to the \r\nparameter being estimated. For example, the mean of a sample is an unbiased \r\nestimate of the mean of the population from which the sample was drawn, i.e. \r\nE\uf028 X \uf029 \uf03d \uf06d .

Therefore we say that the sample mean, X is the unbiased \r\nestimator of the population mean, \uf06d. In other words,\r\nHowever, the sample variance is NOT an unbiased estimator of population variance.\r\nLet X1, X2, \u2026\u2026, Xn be a random sample of size n from a population with unknown variance \r\n\uf0732 and let the sample variance be denoted by 2\r\nx s .\r\nSample variance, \r\n2 2\r\n2 2 ( )\r\n( ) x\r\nxx x\r\ns x\r\nn n\r\n\uf02d \uf03d \uf03d\uf02d \uf0e5 \uf0e5\r\nThen an \r\n Unbiased estimate for population variance, \uf0732 is 2\r\ns = \r\n2\r\n1 x s\r\nn\r\nn\r\n\uf02d\r\nNote: Use the above formula when the sample variance, 2\r\nx s is given.\r\nUnbiased estimate for population variance is\r\ns2 = \r\n1 2 ( ) 1\r\nx x\r\nn \uf02d \uf02d \uf0e5 = \r\n2\r\n2 1 ( ) [ () ]\r\n1\r\nx\r\nx\r\nn n \uf02d \uf02d\r\n\uf0e5 \uf0e5 (given in MF26)\r\nNote:\r\n1.

than the rest. This is \r\nlogical since there are fewer very short or very tall boys, and even fewer very very short or \r\nvery very tall boys.\r\nThe outline of the histogram generally shapes like a bell-shaped curve.\r\n \r\nSample size = 400\r\nHeight Frequency Relative Frequency\r\n1.650 \uf02d 1.675 112 112/400 = 0.28\r\n1.675 \uf02d 1.700 128 128/400 = 0.32\r\n1.700 \uf02d 1.725 116 116/400 = 0.29\r\nIn fact, such a \u2018pattern\u2019 of distribution can be observed for many other physical phenomena as \r\nwell, such as weight of watermelons in a particular market, I.Q. scores of a population, time \r\ntaken by students to run 100m, examination results of students in SAJC, household income of \r\nSingaporeans etc. Since it is so common, we shall name the distribution a normal distribution \r\n(and the bell-shape curve a normal curve) and study it with some depth. \r\nThe normal variable is an example of a continuous random variable. \r\nNote:\r\nFrequency Relative Frequency Total number in the sample \uf03d\r\nheight\r\nRelative frequency","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 79 / 576>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://bf3768386a1951b#file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10#p_78.jpg","size_bytes":52342,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 80 / 576>","SAJC 2021 JC 1 H1 Mathematics \r\nNormal Distribution Page 3 of 35\r\n4.2 Continuous Random Variable\r\nRecall from Chapter 3, a continuous random variable (CRV) is a random variable that takes \r\nvalues in an interval. This differentiates from discrete random variable which can only takes a \r\nfinite or countable infinite set of exact values. In theory, CRVs can be measured to any desired \r\ndegree of accuracy. \r\nExamples of CRVs are:\r\n\uf0a7 The height of a randomly chosen 18-year-old student.\r\n\uf0a7 The actual mass of a packet of 1 kg rice.\r\n\uf0a7 The lifetime of a new battery.\r\n\uf0a7 The temperature of a student in SAJC on a particular day\r\n\uf0a7 The waiting time of bus number \u201c142\u201d at the bus-stop outside SAJC on a Monday \r\nmorning.\r\n4.3 Normal Distribution Curve\r\nNormal distribution curve of 17 years old students in SAJC\r\n4.3.1 Properties of the Normal Distribution Curve\r\n1.

The shape of any Normal curve is determined completely by its mean \uf06d and standard \r\ndeviation \uf073 .

In the A Level syllabus, we \r\nwill investigate the linear regression analysis and linear correlation analysis of two variables. \r\nIn linear correlation analysis, we measure the strength or closeness of the linear relationship \r\nbetween the two variables. \r\nIn linear regression analysis, we prepare an estimating (or regression) linear equation to \r\nestimate the values of one variable from given values of another. \r\nIn other words, correlation analysis reveals the extent to which two variables are related\r\nwhilst regression analysis tells us how they are related.\r\nEXAMPLE\r\nWe are interested in the relationship between the number of hours studying and the marks \r\nobtained.

Each observation thus comprises a pair \r\nof values taken by the two variables. It is customary to express the bivariate data as ordered \r\npairs (x, y).\r\nAn example of bivariate data is the data given in the table above, which shows a set of 6 pairs \r\nof values for the two variables, x and y.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 161 / 576>","SAJC 2022 JC 2 H1 Mathematics\r\n \r\nCorrelation and Linear Regression Page 4 of 59\r\n7.1.2 Independent vs Dependent Variables\r\nIn the physical sciences, we often set up investigations or experiments in which we try to find \r\na relationship between two variables.\r\nFor such experiments, it is fairly common for the researcher to assign arbitrary values to one \r\nvariable so that corresponding values of the other variable can be measured. For this reason, \r\nthe variable that the researcher has control over is known as the independent variable (or \r\ncontrolled variable), while the other variable under investigation (whose values we want to \r\npredict) is called the dependent variable.\r\nOn the other hand, there are situations (called observational studies) where the values of the \r\nindependent variable cannot be pre-selected. An example of this is the study on the effect of \r\ntime taken to prepare for a test (independent variable) on result of the test (dependent \r\nvariable).\r\nAn independent variable (or input/controlled/predetermined variable) is usually the one \r\nwhose value can be set or controlled. It is usually denoted by x. \r\nA dependent variable (or output/response variable) is usually the one whose value we want \r\nto predict. It is usually denoted by y.\r\nHowever, it is sometimes not possible to decide what the independent and dependent \r\nvariables are, given a set of data. For example, History and Geography scores of a student.\r\nExample 1 Identifying independent and dependent variables\r\nIn each of the cases below, identify the independent and dependent variables.\r\n(a) The drying time of a particular type of hobby paint depends on various factors \r\nincluding ambient temperature.

A scatter diagram is useful in showing the general patterns and relationship (which may \r\nbe linear or non-linear) between two variables. It is also useful for identifying outliers in \r\nthe data set.\r\nTo interpret scatter diagrams, we can comment on three things: type of relationship, \r\nstrength of relationship, and direction of correlation.\r\n2. The (Linear) Product-moment correlation coefficient, r, indicates the strength of linear \r\ncorrelation between 2 variables.\r\n\uf0d8 If 0 < r < 1, there is a positive linear correlation, i.e. as x increases, y also increases.\r\n\uf0d8 If \uf02d1< r < 0, there is a negative linear correlation, i.e. as x increases, y decreases.\r\n\uf0d8 If r = 1, there is a perfect positive linear correlation.\r\n\uf0d8 If r = \uf02d1, there is a perfect negative linear correlation.\r\n\uf0d8 If r \uf0bb 1, there is a strong positive linear correlation.\r\n\uf0d8 If r \uf0bb \uf02d1, there is a strong negative linear correlation.\r\n\uf0d8 r = 0 indicates no linear correlation. But you can plot a scatter diagram to see \r\nwhether there is a non-linear relationship.\r\n\uf0b7 r does NOT provide information about causal relationship (or cause and effect) \r\nbetween variables. For example, if r \uf0bb 1, we cannot say that an increase in x causes y\r\nto increase.\r\n\uf0b7 r is NOT affected by a linear transformation of x or y and it has no units.\r\n\uf0b7 The value of r should be considered in conjunction with a scatter diagram.\r\n3. Use of Least Squares Regression Lines\r\n\uf0b7 Interpolation, i.e. estimating one value when given the other within the range of the \r\ngiven x and y values.\r\n\uf0b7 Extrapolation, i.e. estimating one value when given the other outside the range of \r\nthe given x and y values.\r\nNote: For extrapolation, the estimated value of x or y may not be reliable as the given \r\nvalue of y or x is outside the range of the given y or x values.\r\n4.

The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5f3bab81-6f2f-4be2-a345-05f3847721c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"58a26da3-4e3d-4204-993e-5fbb0bab6e74","turn_exchange_id":"40dfab1c-1320-4ba0-a631-361529d6ece7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"58a26da3-4e3d-4204-993e-5fbb0bab6e74","children":["cad7d547-9e6f-46f8-84d7-c1e4fd5d7bbc"]},"cad7d547-9e6f-46f8-84d7-c1e4fd5d7bbc":{"id":"cad7d547-9e6f-46f8-84d7-c1e4fd5d7bbc","message":{"id":"cad7d547-9e6f-46f8-84d7-c1e4fd5d7bbc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768703892.945569,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Identifying topics and page numbers for PDF","content":"The user is asking for the topics and corresponding page numbers from a 576-page PDF.

Are this type of dumbbells at least 10 kg? Will that slimming \r\n[L34] centre help customers lose up to 16 pounds in just 4 weeks as promised?\r\n[L35] Claims abound in advertising and merchandise, as well as elsewhere e.g. social sciences. The \r\n[L36] most objective way to test whether a claim is valid is to take a (random) sample and measure it.\r\n[L37] To be specific: In H1 Maths, we measure its sample mean ( x ) and calculate how much it \r\n[L38] deviates from an assumed population mean ( \uf06d0 , which could be based on known facts or some \r\n[L39] unverified claim). This deviation is expressed in terms of a relative score or probability, which \r\n[L40] we compare with a predetermined standard to reach a conclusion about whether the claim is \r\n[L41] valid. This whole procedure is known as hypothesis testing.\r\n[L42] A statistical hypothesis is a statement, which may or may not be true, concerning one or more \r\n[L43] population parameters (e.g. mean, variance, proportion). \r\n[L44] Hypothesis testing is the procedure used to test the validity of this statement based on evidence \r\n[L45] from random samples drawn from the population.\r\n[L46] Let us look at some concrete examples:\r\n[L47] Coke cans are \r\n[L48] 330ml.\r\n[L49] Dumbbells are \r\n[L50] at least 10kg \r\n[L51] each.\r\n[L52] We will help you \r\n[L53] lose up to 16 lbs.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 2 / 576><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 576>2021 SAJC JC1 H1 Maths\r\n[L54] Chapter 6 : Hypothesis Testing 3\r\n[L55] Example 1a\r\n[L56] A fizzy drink brand claims that the mean volume of its canned drinks (the volume is normally \r\n[L57] distributed with standard deviation 10ml) is 330ml.

\r\n[L49] what would you observe?\r\n[L50] You will realized that majority of the students have about the same height with a few students \r\n[L51] who are taller than the average height and another few who are shorter than the rest. This is \r\n[L52] logical since there are fewer very short or very tall boys, and even fewer very very short or \r\n[L53] very very tall boys.\r\n[L54] The outline of the histogram generally shapes like a bell-shaped curve.\r\n[L55]  \r\n[L56] Sample size = 400\r\n[L57] Height Frequency Relative Frequency\r\n[L58] 1.650 \uf02d 1.675 112 112/400 = 0.28\r\n[L59] 1.675 \uf02d 1.700 128 128/400 = 0.32\r\n[L60] 1.700 \uf02d 1.725 116 116/400 = 0.29\r\n[L61] In fact, such a \u2018pattern\u2019 of distribution can be observed for many other physical phenomena as \r\n[L62] well, such as weight of watermelons in a particular market, I.Q. scores of a population, time \r\n[L63] taken by students to run 100m, examination results of students in SAJC, household income of \r\n[L64] Singaporeans etc.\n# \u30103\u2020H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\u2020file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"1:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] New Additional Mathematics, Ho Soo Thong (Msc, Dip Ed), Khor Nyak Hiong (Bsc, \r\n[L2] Dip Ed) \r\n[L3] 2.

Differentiation is \r\n[L31] also used in analysis of finance and economics. One important application of differentiation is \r\n[L32] in the area of optimisation, which means finding the condition for a maximum (or minimum) \r\n[L33] to occur. This is important in business e.g cost reduction, profit increase and engineering e.g \r\n[L34] maximum strength, minimum cost.\r\n[L35] Example : Solar Two sustainable energy project in California\r\n[L36] A power tower produces electricity from sunlight by focusing thousands of sun-tracking \r\n[L37] mirrors, called heliostats, on a single receiver sitting on top of a tower. The receiver captures \r\n[L38] the thermal energy of the sun and stores it in tanks of molten salt (to the right of the tower) at \r\n[L39] temperatures greater than 500 degrees centigrade. \r\n[L40] When electricity is needed, the energy in the molten salt is used to create steam, which drives \r\n[L41] a conventional electricity-generating turbine (to the left of the tower).\r\n[L42] Differentiation is used to maximise the efficiency of the process.\r\n[L43] Source: http://www.intmath.com/Calculus/Calculus-intro.php\r\n[L44] 6.1 Some Notation and Terminology\r\n[L45] y\r\n[L46] 2 y\r\n[L47] 1 y\r\n[L48] 1 x 2 x\r\n[L49] x\r\n[L50] 2 2 Qx y (, )\r\n[L51] 1 1 Px y ( , )\r\n[L52] 0<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 352 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC 2 H1 Mathematics\r\n[L53] Page 3 of 39\r\n[L54] 6.1.1 Gradient of a straight line\r\n[L55] The gradient of a straight line from point 1 1 Px y (, ) to 2 2 Qx y (, ) is defined as 2 1\r\n[L56] 2 1\r\n[L57] y y\r\n[L58] x x\r\n[L59] \uf02d\r\n[L60] \uf02d .\r\n[L61] i.e. The gradient of a straight line is the ratio of the change in y-coordinate to that of the \r\n[L62] x-coordinate between two points on the line.\r\n[L63] Note:\r\n[L64] 1.\n# \u30103\u2020H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\u2020file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Answer:\r\n[L2] 1) 2 10\r\n[L3] 3\r\n[L4] 2 units 2) 3 6\r\n[L5] 4\r\n[L6] 2 units\r\n[L7] 4) (i)\r\n[L8] P \uf0e8\r\n[L9] \uf0e7\r\n[L10] \uf0e6\r\n[L11] \uf0f8\r\n[L12] \uf0f7\r\n[L13] \uf0f6 \uf02d 6\r\n[L14] 3 \uf02c\r\n[L15] 8\r\n[L16] 3 ,\r\n[L17] Q \uf0e8\r\n[L18] \uf0e7\r\n[L19] \uf0e6\r\n[L20] \uf0f8\r\n[L21] \uf0f7 6 \uf0f6\r\n[L22] 3 \uf02c\r\n[L23] 8\r\n[L24] 3\r\n[L25] 4)(ii) 16\r\n[L26] 9 6\r\n[L27] units\r\n[L28] 4)(iii) 7.21\r\n[L29] units\r\n[L30] 4(iv) $92.50\r\n[L31] Answers\r\n[L32] (ii) t \uf03d 5.84 the year is 2015\r\n[L33] (v) 41 1 8 e\r\n[L34] 2 2\r\n[L35] \uf02d \uf02d , The area found is the total \r\n[L36] cost incurred over the 4 years, which is \r\n[L37] $20500.<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 310 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC2 H1 Mathematics Chapter 8: Applications of Integration \r\n[L38] Page 20 of 20\r\n[L39] Summary\r\n[L40] The definite integral of a function f \uf028 x\uf029 with lower limits x = a and upper limit x = b is \r\n[L41] defined by f ( ) d F( ) F( ) F( ) \uf05b \uf05d b b\r\n[L42] a a xx x b a \uf03d \uf03d\uf02d \uf0f2 where F( ) f ( ) d\r\n[L43] x x\r\n[L44] dx \uf03d .\r\n[L45] 1.

The answer is yes. The process of getting y from d\r\n[L34] d\r\n[L35] y\r\n[L36] x\r\n[L37] is \r\n[L38] called Integration, also sometimes known as anti-differentiation.\r\n[L39] Example 1\r\n[L40] Given the gradient function d 2\r\n[L41] d\r\n[L42] y x\r\n[L43] x\r\n[L44] \uf03d , find the general equation of y.\r\n[L45] Solution:\r\n[L46] We know that if we differentiate 2\r\n[L47] x , we will get 2x . Hence 2\r\n[L48] y x \uf03d .\r\n[L49] But this is not the complete picture, because if you differentiate 2\r\n[L50] x \uf02b1, you will also get \r\n[L51] the same answer, 2x . The same is true for 2\r\n[L52] y x \uf03d \uf02b 2 .\r\n[L53] In fact if you differentiate 2\r\n[L54] x plus any constant, you get the same answer.\r\n[L55] Therefore d 2 2 \r\n[L56] d\r\n[L57] y x yx C\r\n[L58] x\r\n[L59] \uf03d \uf0de \uf03d\uf02b , where C is an arbitrary constant.\r\n[L60] This reversal of differentiation, known as integration, is represented as follows:\r\n[L61] 2 2 d xx x C \uf03d \uf02b \uf0f2\r\n[L62] C is the \"Constant of Integration\". It is there because of functions whose derivative are 2x is \r\n[L63] not unique.

The answer is yes. The process of getting y from d\r\n[L34] d\r\n[L35] y\r\n[L36] x\r\n[L37] is \r\n[L38] called Integration, also sometimes known as anti-differentiation.\r\n[L39] Example 1\r\n[L40] Given the gradient function d 2\r\n[L41] d\r\n[L42] y x\r\n[L43] x\r\n[L44] \uf03d , find the general equation of y.\r\n[L45] Solution:\r\n[L46] We know that if we differentiate 2\r\n[L47] x , we will get 2x . Hence 2\r\n[L48] y x \uf03d .\r\n[L49] But this is not the complete picture, because if you differentiate 2\r\n[L50] x \uf02b1, you will also get \r\n[L51] the same answer, 2x . The same is true for 2\r\n[L52] y x \uf03d \uf02b 2 .\r\n[L53] In fact if you differentiate 2\r\n[L54] x plus any constant, you get the same answer.\r\n[L55] Therefore d 2 2 \r\n[L56] d\r\n[L57] y x yx C\r\n[L58] x\r\n[L59] \uf03d \uf0de \uf03d\uf02b , where C is an arbitrary constant.\r\n[L60] This reversal of differentiation, known as integration, is represented as follows:\r\n[L61] 2 2 d xx x C \uf03d \uf02b \uf0f2\r\n[L62] C is the \"Constant of Integration\". It is there because of functions whose derivative are 2x is \r\n[L63] not unique. For example, d 2 ( 4) 2 d\r\n[L64] x x\r\n[L65] x \uf02d \uf03d ; \r\n[L66] d 2 ( 20) 2 d\r\n[L67] x x\r\n[L68] x\r\n[L69] \uf02b \uf03d , etc\u2026\r\n[L70] 7.2 Definition\r\n[L71] Integration is the reverse process of Differentiation. \r\n[L72] If \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 d F f\r\n[L73] d\r\n[L74] x x\r\n[L75] x \uf03d , then \r\n[L76] f ( ) d F xx xC \uf03d \uf02b \uf028 \uf029 \uf0f2 .\r\n[L77] where dF\uf028 \uf029 f( ) d\r\n[L78] x\r\n[L79] x\r\n[L80] x \uf03d and C is an arbitrary constant.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":4,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_pulls","slurm_github","slurm_github_commits","slurm_github_issues","recording_knowledge","files_uploaded_in_conversation"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5f3bab81-6f2f-4be2-a345-05f3847721c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"706ab1a7-184f-44e1-b510-f3ddacaea1be","turn_exchange_id":"40dfab1c-1320-4ba0-a631-361529d6ece7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"706ab1a7-184f-44e1-b510-f3ddacaea1be","children":["e728d2e8-3b46-425c-b719-200aa2f347d8"]},"e728d2e8-3b46-425c-b719-200aa2f347d8":{"id":"e728d2e8-3b46-425c-b719-200aa2f347d8","message":{"id":"e728d2e8-3b46-425c-b719-200aa2f347d8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768704002.062499,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for missing math chapters","content":"The search results showed useful findings: Chapter 5 on Differentiation at page 410, Chapter 1 at 237, Chapter 2 at 438, Chapter 7 at 333, and Chapter 8 at 291.

The process of getting y from d\r\n[L34] d\r\n[L35] y\r\n[L36] x\r\n[L37] is \r\n[L38] called Integration, also sometimes known as anti-differentiation.\r\n[L39] Example 1\r\n[L40] Given the gradient function d 2\r\n[L41] d\r\n[L42] y x\r\n[L43] x\r\n[L44] \uf03d , find the general equation of y.\r\n[L45] Solution:\r\n[L46] We know that if we differentiate 2\r\n[L47] x , we will get 2x . Hence 2\r\n[L48] y x \uf03d .\r\n[L49] But this is not the complete picture, because if you differentiate 2\r\n[L50] x \uf02b1, you will also get \r\n[L51] the same answer, 2x . The same is true for 2\r\n[L52] y x \uf03d \uf02b 2 .\r\n[L53] In fact if you differentiate 2\r\n[L54] x plus any constant, you get the same answer.\r\n[L55] Therefore d 2 2 \r\n[L56] d\r\n[L57] y x yx C\r\n[L58] x\r\n[L59] \uf03d \uf0de \uf03d\uf02b , where C is an arbitrary constant.\r\n[L60] This reversal of differentiation, known as integration, is represented as follows:\r\n[L61] 2 2 d xx x C \uf03d \uf02b \uf0f2\r\n[L62] C is the \"Constant of Integration\". It is there because of functions whose derivative are 2x is \r\n[L63] not unique. For example, d 2 ( 4) 2 d\r\n[L64] x x\r\n[L65] x \uf02d \uf03d ; \r\n[L66] d 2 ( 20) 2 d\r\n[L67] x x\r\n[L68] x\r\n[L69] \uf02b \uf03d , etc\u2026\r\n[L70] 7.2 Definition\r\n[L71] Integration is the reverse process of Differentiation. \r\n[L72] If \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 d F f\r\n[L73] d\r\n[L74] x x\r\n[L75] x \uf03d , then \r\n[L76] f ( ) d F xx xC \uf03d \uf02b \uf028 \uf029 \uf0f2 .\r\n[L77] where dF\uf028 \uf029 f( ) d\r\n[L78] x\r\n[L79] x\r\n[L80] x \uf03d and C is an arbitrary constant.\n# \u30104\u2020H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\u2020file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn6file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"6:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] (iv) Let be the mean population mass.\r\n[L2] H : 10 against H : 10 0 1 \uf06d \uf06d \uf03d \uf0b9 at 5 % significance level.\r\n[L3] Under H0,\r\n[L4] 2 0.81 ~ (10, ) 9\r\n[L5] X N\r\n[L6] \uf02d\r\n[L7] .\r\n[L8] \uf028 \uf029 2 ~ 0,1 X Z N\r\n[L9] s\r\n[L10] n\r\n[L11] \uf02d \uf06d \uf03d\r\n[L12] Using a 2-tailed z-test,\r\n[L13]  x \uf03d 9.6 gives zcalc= - 1.33 and p-value = 0.182 > 0.05\r\n[L14] We do not reject H0 and conclude that at 5% significance level that the \r\n[L15] mean mass of sugar is not 10g.\r\n[L16] 100\r\n[L17] \uf061 \uf0b3\r\n[L18] \uf0b3\r\n[L19] \uf061 \uf03d \uf061 \uf061 \uf0ce \uf0a3\uf03c : 4.02 100}\r\n[L20] \uf06d<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 237 / 576>SAJC 2021 H1 Mathematics Chapter 1: Equations\r\n[L21] Page 1 of 54\r\n[L22] (Pure Mathematics) Chapter 1: Equations\r\n[L23] Objectives\r\n[L24] At the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\r\n[L25] (a) solve quadratic equations using factorisation, completing the square, formula, sketching \r\n[L26] of graph and a GC;\r\n[L27] (b) understand and use the conditions for a quadratic equation to have (i) two real and \r\n[L28] distinct roots, (ii) two real and equal roots, (iii) no real roots;\r\n[L29] (c) understand and use the conditions for a quadratic equation to be always positive (or \r\n[L30] always negative);\r\n[L31] (d) formulate a quadratic equation from a problem situation and interpret the solution in the \r\n[L32] context of the problem;\r\n[L33] (e) solve a pair of simultaneous equations, one linear and one quadratic, by substitution;\r\n[L34] (f) formulate a system of linear equations from a problem situation;\r\n[L35] (g) find the solution of a system of linear equations using a Graphing Calculator.\r\n[L36] Content\r\n[L37] 1.1 Quadratic Functions\r\n[L38] 1.1.1 Solving Quadratic Equations \r\n[L39] 1.1.2 Nature of Roots of a Quadratic Equation\r\n[L40] 1.1.3 Conditions for Quadratic Expression to be always positive (or always negative)\r\n[L41] 1.1.4 Intersection Problems Leading to Quadratic Equations\r\n[L42] 1.2 Simultaneous Linear and Quadratic Equations in Two Unknowns \r\n[L43] 1.2.1 Solving Simultaneous Linear and Quadratic Equations in Two Unknowns\r\n[L44] 1.2.2 Application questions\r\n[L45] 1.3 Systems of linear equation (SOLE)\r\n[L46]  1.3.1 Using Graphing Calculator to solve SOLE\r\n[L47] 1.3.2 Modelling a System of Linear Equations to Solve Practical Problems\r\n[L48] References\r\n[L49] 1.

Differentiation is \r\n[L31] also used in analysis of finance and economics. One important application of differentiation is \r\n[L32] in the area of optimisation, which means finding the condition for a maximum (or minimum) \r\n[L33] to occur. This is important in business e.g cost reduction, profit increase and engineering e.g \r\n[L34] maximum strength, minimum cost.\r\n[L35] Example : Solar Two sustainable energy project in California\r\n[L36] A power tower produces electricity from sunlight by focusing thousands of sun-tracking \r\n[L37] mirrors, called heliostats, on a single receiver sitting on top of a tower. The receiver captures \r\n[L38] the thermal energy of the sun and stores it in tanks of molten salt (to the right of the tower) at \r\n[L39] temperatures greater than 500 degrees centigrade. \r\n[L40] When electricity is needed, the energy in the molten salt is used to create steam, which drives \r\n[L41] a conventional electricity-generating turbine (to the left of the tower).\r\n[L42] Differentiation is used to maximise the efficiency of the process.\r\n[L43] Source: http://www.intmath.com/Calculus/Calculus-intro.php\r\n[L44] 6.1 Some Notation and Terminology\r\n[L45] y\r\n[L46] 2 y\r\n[L47] 1 y\r\n[L48] 1 x 2 x\r\n[L49] x\r\n[L50] 2 2 Qx y (, )\r\n[L51] 1 1 Px y ( , )\r\n[L52] 0<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 352 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC 2 H1 Mathematics\r\n[L53] Page 3 of 39\r\n[L54] 6.1.1 Gradient of a straight line\r\n[L55] The gradient of a straight line from point 1 1 Px y (, ) to 2 2 Qx y (, ) is defined as 2 1\r\n[L56] 2 1\r\n[L57] y y\r\n[L58] x x\r\n[L59] \uf02d\r\n[L60] \uf02d .\r\n[L61] i.e. The gradient of a straight line is the ratio of the change in y-coordinate to that of the \r\n[L62] x-coordinate between two points on the line.\r\n[L63] Note:\r\n[L64] 1.\n# \u30103\u2020H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\u2020file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn7file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"7:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] where 9, 8 (shown) (3 2 )\r\n[L2] x x\r\n[L3] x\r\n[L4] x x\r\n[L5] x\r\n[L6] x x\r\n[L7] x x\r\n[L8] x\r\n[L9] x x\r\n[L10] x a b\r\n[L11] x x\r\n[L12] \uf02d\r\n[L13] \uf03d \uf02d\r\n[L14] \uf02d \uf03d \uf02d\r\n[L15] \uf02d \uf03d \uf02d\r\n[L16] \uf02d \uf03d \uf03d \uf03d\uf02d \uf02d<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 349 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC2 H1 Mathematics Chapter 7: Integration Techniques\r\n[L17] Page 17 of 17\r\n[L18] In the table below, \u2018k\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are constants, and C is an arbitrary constant. \r\n[L19] Common \r\n[L20] functions\r\n[L21] Function Integral \r\n[L22] (a) Constant k xd \uf0f2 \uf03d \uf02b kx C\r\n[L23] (b) Variable x xd \uf0f2 2\r\n[L24] 2\r\n[L25] x\r\n[L26] \uf03d \uf02bC\r\n[L27] (c) Square 2\r\n[L28] x xd \uf0f2 3\r\n[L29] 3\r\n[L30] x\r\n[L31] \uf03d \uf02bC\r\n[L32] (d) Power \r\n[L33] where \r\n[L34] n \uf0b9 \uf02d1\r\n[L35] dn x x \uf0f2 1\r\n[L36] , 1 1\r\n[L37] n x C n\r\n[L38] n\r\n[L39] \uf02b\r\n[L40] \uf03d \uf02b \uf0b9\uf02d\r\n[L41] \uf02b\r\n[L42] (e) \uf028 \uf029 dn\r\n[L43] ax b x \uf02b \uf0f2 \uf028 \uf029\r\n[L44] \uf028 \uf029\r\n[L45] 1\r\n[L46] , 1 1\r\n[L47] n\r\n[L48] ax b\r\n[L49] C n\r\n[L50] a n\r\n[L51] \uf02b\r\n[L52] \uf02b\r\n[L53] \uf03d \uf02b \uf0b9\uf02d\r\n[L54] \uf02b\r\n[L55] (f) Power \r\n[L56] where \r\n[L57] n \uf03d \uf02d1\r\n[L58] 1 1\r\n[L59] xx x d d\r\n[L60] x\r\n[L61] \uf02d \uf03d \uf0f2 \uf0f2 \uf03d \uf02b ln x C\r\n[L62] (g) 1 1 ( )d d ax b x x\r\n[L63] ax b\r\n[L64] \uf02d \uf02b \uf03d\r\n[L65] \uf02b \uf0f2 \uf0f2 ln ax b\r\n[L66] C\r\n[L67] a\r\n[L68] \uf02b\r\n[L69] \uf03d \uf02b\r\n[L70] (h) Exponential d\r\n[L71] x e x \uf0f2 x \uf03d \uf02b e C\r\n[L72] (i) d ax b e x\r\n[L73] \uf02b\r\n[L74] \uf0f2 1 ax b e C\r\n[L75] a\r\n[L76] \uf02b \uf03d \uf02b<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 350 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC 2 H1 Mathematics\r\n[L77] Page 1 of 39\r\n[L78] Chapter 6 (Pure Mathematics) Applications of Differentiation\r\n[L79] Objectives\r\n[L80] At the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\r\n[L81] (a) interpret f\u2032(x) > 0, f\u2032(x) = 0 and f\u2032(x) < 0 graphically;\r\n[L82] (b) Determine the maximum and minimum points (local maxima and minima) and stationary points \r\n[L83] of inflexion analytically, in simple cases, using the first derivative test;

A good representation \r\n[L61] might make possible the learning of a concept that was not learnable using other representations. \r\n[L62] For example, in the case of the earthquake domain (earthquake data such as its location, epicenter,\r\n[L63] intensity, depth, type, etc.), we need important information such as the distance between the \r\n[L64] earthquakes\u2019 epicentres and the difference in time between the earthquakes. Thisinformation could \r\n[L65] make possible the learning of an important concept. This is known as a graph-based concept \r\n[L66] learning system.

Are this type of dumbbells at least 10 kg? Will that slimming \r\n[L34] centre help customers lose up to 16 pounds in just 4 weeks as promised?\r\n[L35] Claims abound in advertising and merchandise, as well as elsewhere e.g. social sciences. The \r\n[L36] most objective way to test whether a claim is valid is to take a (random) sample and measure it.\r\n[L37] To be specific: In H1 Maths, we measure its sample mean ( x ) and calculate how much it \r\n[L38] deviates from an assumed population mean ( \uf06d0 , which could be based on known facts or some \r\n[L39] unverified claim). This deviation is expressed in terms of a relative score or probability, which \r\n[L40] we compare with a predetermined standard to reach a conclusion about whether the claim is \r\n[L41] valid. This whole procedure is known as hypothesis testing.\r\n[L42] A statistical hypothesis is a statement, which may or may not be true, concerning one or more \r\n[L43] population parameters (e.g. mean, variance, proportion). \r\n[L44] Hypothesis testing is the procedure used to test the validity of this statement based on evidence \r\n[L45] from random samples drawn from the population.\r\n[L46] Let us look at some concrete examples:\r\n[L47] Coke cans are \r\n[L48] 330ml.\r\n[L49] Dumbbells are \r\n[L50] at least 10kg \r\n[L51] each.\r\n[L52] We will help you \r\n[L53] lose up to 16 lbs.<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 2 / 576><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 576>2021 SAJC JC1 H1 Maths\r\n[L54] Chapter 6 : Hypothesis Testing 3\r\n[L55] Example 1a\r\n[L56] A fizzy drink brand claims that the mean volume of its canned drinks (the volume is normally \r\n[L57] distributed with standard deviation 10ml) is 330ml.

Press [Stats],\n   5  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 5 6.2 Terms & definitions 6.2.1 Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis Are we testing for (a) any change/difference from the (assumed) population mean 0\uf06d, or (b)/(c) a definite increase/decrease in the (assumed) population mean? Null hypothesis (denoted by 0H) 0H is a statement that says that a population parameter takes a specific value. Alternative hypothesis (denoted by 1H) 1H is a statement that says that the population parameter takes a value different, in some way, from the value given in 0H. Test 00H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf03d (Assumption: population mean is 0\uf06d) vs. (a) 10H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf0b9 (b) 10H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf03e (c) 10H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf03c Note: 1. The rejection of the null hypothesis will generally imply that the alternative hypothesis is accepted. In this case, we conclude that the null hypothesis is false. 2. Failure to reject the null hypothesis is not the same as accepting the null hypothesis. It only means there is insufficient statistical evidence to reject 0H in favour of 1H (i.e. 0H may or may not be true). In other words, we cannot conclude that we accept H0. 6.2.2 Test Statistic The sample statistic used to test the hypotheses is called the test statistic. In the H1 Maths syllabus, we take the sample mean X and standardise it to obtain the standard normal distribution Z. In this way, any particular value x will have a corresponding standard score (also known as z-score), which is a measure of its number of standard deviations above or below \uf06d. Recall that if we use a large sample size n, then X approximately follows a normal distribution by Central Limit Theorem (CLT), so a bell curve appears! If we now assume our null hypothesis is true, then we get something familiar: Under 0H, 2~N ,Xn\uf073\uf06d\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 and so ~N ( 0 , 1 )/XZn\uf06d\uf073\uf02d\uf03d. Note: 1. If the population X is already normal, then Central Limit Theorem is not required. 2. If 2\uf073 is unknown, we use the unbiased estimate s2 2( i n G C )xS instead. = sample variance1nn\uf0b4\uf02d In a two-tailed test, 1H looks for any change in the population mean (can be increase or decrease). In a one-tailed test, 1H looks for a definite increase (or decrease) in the population mean.\n   6  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 6 6.2.3 Comparing z-score and critical value; or p-value and level of significance The extent the test statistic differs from \uf06d is measured by its z-score and p-value: z-score = the no. of standard deviations the test statistic is above/below \uf06d p-value = the probability of the test statistic being that no. of standard deviations above/below \uf06d The larger the absolute z-score, the greater the\n   7  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 7 6.2.4 Formal definitions of p-value and level of significance There are two formal definitions of the p-value of a test: (1) The smallest level of significance at which H0 can be rejected. (2) The probability that the sample mean is at least as extreme as observed, assuming H0 is true. The level of significance of a test (denoted by 1c) is the probability of rejecting H0 when H0 is true. Note: 1. The level of significance 100\uf061 is the conditional probability 00P(reject H | H is true). 2. The lower the level of significance (i.e. the smaller the value of \uf061), the smaller the probability of making this error of rejecting 0H when 0H is true. 1c and p-value are tools that help us quantify and control this error. 3. This margin of error is typically set at 5% as that is an industrial and research standard. That is why many of our examples specify a 5% level of significance. 4. No hypothesis test can yield 100% accuracy. We could end up with a test statistic in the Critical Region 5% of the time when 0H is true, simply due to random sampling error. The luck of the draw matters.\n   8  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 8 In Example 1a, why do we need to do a hypothesis test when 325ml is clearly less than 330ml? The reason is simple: We only looked at a sample, not the entire population. Perhaps the population mean is indeed 330ml and the lower value of 325ml was due to sampling error. (If we take another carton of 24 cans and measured their volume, the new sample mean might be close to 330ml.) A hypothesis test assesses the likelihood that scenario will occur, without having to literally take another sample! Thus, we can make a decision backed by statistical theory. In theory, if we repeatedly measure different cartons, we can plot a distribution of the sample means, called the sampling distribution of means. You might recall this theoretical distribution follows a normal distribution for large samples. 6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test This is the outline of the steps in hypothesis testing: 1. Define the appropriate random variables and population distribution. 2. State the probability distribution from which the observations were taken. 3. State the null hypothesis 0H and alternative hypothesis 1H. 4. State the type of test and level of significance 1c. 5. Identify the test statistic and its distribution. 6. Either Compute the z-score and compare it with the critical value(s) or Compute the p-value and compare it with 1c. 7. Draw conclusions \u2013 reject or do not reject 0H. With the availability of computational tools such as GC, it is more convenient to use the p-value method. However, the critical value method is useful in situations where there are unknowns to be found. The critical value method requires standardising the test statistic to the standard normal variable Z (for H1 Maths). We shall illustrate the use of both the critical value and p-value methods in a few scenarios.

A good representation might make possible the learning of a concept that was not learnable using other representations. For example, in the case of the earthquake domain (earthquake data such as its location, epicenter, intensity, depth, type, etc.), we need important information such as the distance between the earthquakes\u2019 epicentres and the difference in time between the earthquakes.

Introduction There are many real life applications that use logarithm, from finding the time to reach an investment goal to modeling many natural processes, particularly in living systems. We perceive loudness of sound as the logarithm of the actual sound intensity, and dB (decibels) is a logarithmic scale. We also perceive brightness of light as the logarithm of the actual light energy, and star magnitudes are measured on a logarithmic scale. Most interesting of all could be the measurement of earthquake intensity on the Richter scale. The Richter magnitudes are based on a logarithmic scale (base 10). What this means is that for each whole number you go up on the Richter scale, the amplitude of the ground motion recorded by a seismograph goes up ten times. Using this scale, a magnitude 5 earthquake would result in ten times the level of ground shaking as a magnitude 4 earthquake. Magnitude of an earthquake is logIMS\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf03d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 where I is the intensity of the earthquake (measured by the amplitude of a seismograph reading taken 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake) and S is the intensity of a ''standard earthquake'' (whose amplitude is 1 micron =10-4 cm).\n 538  Check your Understanding (Graphing)\n 575  Chapter 4: Example 12(ii) \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf0291234E2RRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf03d0 \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf0291234Var 2RRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf03d 139600 \uf028\uf02912342~( 0 , 1 3 9 6 0 0 )RRRR WN\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf028\uf0291234P( 2 850)RRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf0b3 \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf02912341234=P( 2 850)P( 2 850)RRRR WRRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf0b3\uf02b\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02d \uf0a3 \uf02d = 0.0229\n"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"aggregate_result":{"final_expression_output":"Found 61 unique headings\n   1  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 1 Chapter 6 (Statistics) : Hypothesis Testing tatistic Pre-requisite Knowledge \uf0b7 Sampling Distribution of Means; \uf0b7 Point Estimates Content 6.1 Introduction to Hypothesis Testing 6.2 Terms and definitions 6.2.1 Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis 6.2.2 Test Statistic 6.2.3 Comparing z-score and critical value; or p-value and level of significance 6.2.4 Formal definitions of p-value and level of significance 6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test (Examples) 6.3.1 Sample size large/small, Population normal, 2\uf073 known 6.3.2 Sample size large, Population non-normal, 2\uf073 known 6.3.3 Sample size large, Population non-normal, 2\uf073 unknown 6.4 Further Examples 6.5 Summary and Checklist Objectives:\n   2  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 2 6.1 Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n   3  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 3 Example 1a A fizzy drink brand claims that the mean volume of its canned drinks (the volume is normally distributed with standard deviation 10ml) is 330ml.

Press [Stats],\n   5  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 5 6.2 Terms & definitions 6.2.1 Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis Are we testing for (a) any change/difference from the (assumed) population mean 0\uf06d, or (b)/(c) a definite increase/decrease in the (assumed) population mean? Null hypothesis (denoted by 0H) 0H is a statement that says that a population parameter takes a specific value. Alternative hypothesis (denoted by 1H) 1H is a statement that says that the population parameter takes a value different, in some way, from the value given in 0H. Test 00H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf03d (Assumption: population mean is 0\uf06d) vs. (a) 10H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf0b9 (b) 10H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf03e (c) 10H:\uf06d\uf06d\uf03c Note: 1. The rejection of the null hypothesis will generally imply that the alternative hypothesis is accepted. In this case, we conclude that the null hypothesis is false. 2. Failure to reject the null hypothesis is not the same as accepting the null hypothesis. It only means there is insufficient statistical evidence to reject 0H in favour of 1H (i.e. 0H may or may not be true). In other words, we cannot conclude that we accept H0. 6.2.2 Test Statistic The sample statistic used to test the hypotheses is called the test statistic. In the H1 Maths syllabus, we take the sample mean X and standardise it to obtain the standard normal distribution Z. In this way, any particular value x will have a corresponding standard score (also known as z-score), which is a measure of its number of standard deviations above or below \uf06d. Recall that if we use a large sample size n, then X approximately follows a normal distribution by Central Limit Theorem (CLT), so a bell curve appears! If we now assume our null hypothesis is true, then we get something familiar: Under 0H, 2~N ,Xn\uf073\uf06d\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 and so ~N ( 0 , 1 )/XZn\uf06d\uf073\uf02d\uf03d. Note: 1. If the population X is already normal, then Central Limit Theorem is not required. 2. If 2\uf073 is unknown, we use the unbiased estimate s2 2( i n G C )xS instead. = sample variance1nn\uf0b4\uf02d In a two-tailed test, 1H looks for any change in the population mean (can be increase or decrease). In a one-tailed test, 1H looks for a definite increase (or decrease) in the population mean.\n   6  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 6 6.2.3 Comparing z-score and critical value; or p-value and level of significance The extent the test statistic differs from \uf06d is measured by its z-score and p-value: z-score = the no. of standard deviations the test statistic is above/below \uf06d p-value = the probability of the test statistic being that no. of standard deviations above/below \uf06d The larger the absolute z-score, the greater the\n   7  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 7 6.2.4 Formal definitions of p-value and level of significance There are two formal definitions of the p-value of a test: (1) The smallest level of significance at which H0 can be rejected. (2) The probability that the sample mean is at least as extreme as observed, assuming H0 is true. The level of significance of a test (denoted by 1c) is the probability of rejecting H0 when H0 is true. Note: 1. The level of significance 100\uf061 is the conditional probability 00P(reject H | H is true). 2. The lower the level of significance (i.e. the smaller the value of \uf061), the smaller the probability of making this error of rejecting 0H when 0H is true. 1c and p-value are tools that help us quantify and control this error. 3. This margin of error is typically set at 5% as that is an industrial and research standard. That is why many of our examples specify a 5% level of significance. 4. No hypothesis test can yield 100% accuracy. We could end up with a test statistic in the Critical Region 5% of the time when 0H is true, simply due to random sampling error. The luck of the draw matters.\n   8  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 8 In Example 1a, why do we need to do a hypothesis test when 325ml is clearly less than 330ml? The reason is simple: We only looked at a sample, not the entire population. Perhaps the population mean is indeed 330ml and the lower value of 325ml was due to sampling error. (If we take another carton of 24 cans and measured their volume, the new sample mean might be close to 330ml.) A hypothesis test assesses the likelihood that scenario will occur, without having to literally take another sample! Thus, we can make a decision backed by statistical theory. In theory, if we repeatedly measure different cartons, we can plot a distribution of the sample means, called the sampling distribution of means. You might recall this theoretical distribution follows a normal distribution for large samples. 6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test This is the outline of the steps in hypothesis testing: 1. Define the appropriate random variables and population distribution. 2. State the probability distribution from which the observations were taken. 3. State the null hypothesis 0H and alternative hypothesis 1H. 4. State the type of test and level of significance 1c. 5. Identify the test statistic and its distribution. 6. Either Compute the z-score and compare it with the critical value(s) or Compute the p-value and compare it with 1c. 7. Draw conclusions \u2013 reject or do not reject 0H. With the availability of computational tools such as GC, it is more convenient to use the p-value method. However, the critical value method is useful in situations where there are unknowns to be found. The critical value method requires standardising the test statistic to the standard normal variable Z (for H1 Maths). We shall illustrate the use of both the critical value and p-value methods in a few scenarios.

A good representation might make possible the learning of a concept that was not learnable using other representations. For example, in the case of the earthquake domain (earthquake data such as its location, epicenter, intensity, depth, type, etc.), we need important information such as the distance between the earthquakes\u2019 epicentres and the difference in time between the earthquakes.

What this means is that for each whole number you go up on the Richter scale, the amplitude of the ground motion recorded by a seismograph goes up ten times. Using this scale, a magnitude 5 earthquake would result in ten times the level of ground shaking as a magnitude 4 earthquake. Magnitude of an earthquake is logIMS\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf03d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 where I is the intensity of the earthquake (measured by the amplitude of a seismograph reading taken 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake) and S is the intensity of a ''standard earthquake'' (whose amplitude is 1 micron =10-4 cm).\n 538  Check your Understanding (Graphing)\n 575  Chapter 4: Example 12(ii) \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf0291234E2RRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf03d0 \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf0291234Var 2RRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf03d 139600 \uf028\uf02912342~( 0 , 1 3 9 6 0 0 )RRRR WN\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf028\uf0291234P( 2 850)RRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf0b3 \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf02912341234=P( 2 850)P( 2 850)RRRR WRRRR W\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02d \uf0b3\uf02b\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02d \uf0a3 \uf02d = 0.0229\n","status":"success","messages":[]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Extracting chapter and section titles from PDF","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5f3bab81-6f2f-4be2-a345-05f3847721c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"2afe91b5-a384-4fc6-9af3-293221332dcd","turn_exchange_id":"40dfab1c-1320-4ba0-a631-361529d6ece7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2afe91b5-a384-4fc6-9af3-293221332dcd","children":["8193c542-446c-4833-bbda-e812ebca64a1"]},"8193c542-446c-4833-bbda-e812ebca64a1":{"id":"8193c542-446c-4833-bbda-e812ebca64a1","message":{"id":"8193c542-446c-4833-bbda-e812ebca64a1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768704259.353118,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Handling script output and duplicates","content":"The script output is showing many headings, like \"Chapter 3 (Pure Mathematics): Exponential and Logarithmic Functions\" starting at page 524, as well as \"Check your Understanding\" sections.

Null hypothesis (denoted by 0H) 0H is a statement that says that a population parameter takes a specific value. Alternative hypothesis (denoted by 1H) 1H is a statement that says that the population parameter takes a value different, in some way, from the value given in 0H.

The rejection of the null hypothesis will generally imply that the alternative hypothesis is accepted. In this case, we conclude that the null hypothesis is false. 2. Failure to reject the null hypothesis is not the same as accepting the null hypothesis. It only means there is insufficient statistical evidence to reject 0H in favour of 1H (i.e. 0H may or may not be true). In other words, we cannot conclude that we accept H0. 6.2.2 Test Statistic The sample statistic used to test the hypotheses is called the test statistic. In the H1 Maths syllabus, we take the sample mean X and standardise it to obtain the standard normal distribution Z. In this way, any particular value x will have a corresponding standard score (also known as z-score), which is a measure of its number of standard deviations above or below \uf06d. Recall that if we use a large sample size n, then X approximately follows a normal distribution by Central Limit Theorem (CLT), so a bell curve appears! If we now assume our null hypothesis is true, then we get something familiar: Under 0H, 2~N ,Xn\uf073\uf06d\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 and so ~N ( 0 , 1 )/XZn\uf06d\uf073\uf02d\uf03d. Note: 1. If the population X is already normal, then Central Limit Theorem is not required. 2. If 2\uf073 is unknown, we use the unbiased estimate s2 2( i n G C )xS instead. = sample variance1nn\uf0b4\uf02d In a two-tailed test, 1H looks for any change in the population mean (can be increase or decrease). In a one-tailed test, 1H looks for a definite increase (or decrease) in the population mean.\n   6  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 6 6.2.3 Comparing z-score and critical value; or p-value and level of significance The extent the test statistic differs from \uf06d is measured by its z-score and p-value: z-score = the no. of standard deviations the test statistic is above/below \uf06d p-value = the probability of the test statistic being that no. of standard deviations above/below \uf06d The larger the absolute z-score, the greater the\n   7  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 7 6.2.4 Formal definitions of p-value and level of significance There are two formal definitions of the p-value of a test: (1) The smallest level of significance at which H0 can be rejected. (2) The probability that the sample mean is at least as extreme as observed, assuming H0 is true. The level of significance of a test (denoted by 1c) is the probability of rejecting H0 when H0 is true. Note: 1. The level of significance 100\uf061 is the conditional probability 00P(reject H | H is true). 2. The lower the level of significance (i.e. the smaller the value of \uf061), the smaller the probability of making this error of rejecting 0H when 0H is true. 1c and p-value are tools that help us quantify and control this error. 3. This margin of error is typically set at 5% as that is an industrial and research standard. That is why many of our examples specify a 5% level of significance. 4. No hypothesis test can yield 100% accuracy. We could end up with a test statistic in the Critical Region 5% of the time when 0H is true, simply due to random sampling error. The luck of the draw matters.\n   8  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 8 In Example 1a, why do we need to do a hypothesis test when 325ml is clearly less than 330ml? The reason is simple: We only looked at a sample, not the entire population. Perhaps the population mean is indeed 330ml and the lower value of 325ml was due to sampling error. (If we take another carton of 24 cans and measured their volume, the new sample mean might be close to 330ml.) A hypothesis test assesses the likelihood that scenario will occur, without having to literally take another sample! Thus, we can make a decision backed by statistical theory. In theory, if we repeatedly measure different cartons, we can plot a distribution of the sample means, called the sampling distribution of means. You might recall this theoretical distribution follows a normal distribution for large samples. 6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test This is the outline of the steps in hypothesis testing: 1. Define the appropriate random variables and population distribution. 2. State the probability distribution from which the observations were taken. 3. State the null hypothesis 0H and alternative hypothesis 1H. 4. State the type of test and level of significance 1c. 5. Identify the test statistic and its distribution. 6. Either Compute the z-score and compare it with the critical value(s) or Compute the p-value and compare it with 1c. 7. Draw conclusions \u2013 reject or do not reject 0H. With the availability of computational tools such as GC, it is more convenient to use the p-value method. However, the critical value method is useful in situations where there are unknowns to be found. The critical value method requires standardising the test statistic to the standard normal variable Z (for H1 Maths). We shall illustrate the use of both the critical value and p-value methods in a few scenarios.

A good representation might make possible the learning of a concept that was not learnable using other representations. For example, in the case of the earthquake domain (earthquake data such as its location, epicenter, intensity, depth, type, etc.), we need important information such as the distance between the earthquakes\u2019 epicentres and the difference in time between the earthquakes. This information could make possible the learning of an important concept. This is known as a graph-based concept learning system.

Introduction There are many real life applications that use logarithm, from finding the time to reach an investment goal to modeling many natural processes, particularly in living systems. We perceive loudness of sound as the logarithm of the actual sound intensity, and dB (decibels) is a logarithmic scale. We also perceive brightness of light as the logarithm of the actual light energy, and star magnitudes are measured on a logarithmic scale. Most interesting of all could be the measurement of earthquake intensity on the Richter scale. The Richter magnitudes are based on a logarithmic scale (base 10). What this means is that for each whole number you go up on the Richter scale, the amplitude of the ground motion recorded by a seismograph goes up ten times. Using this scale, a magnitude 5 earthquake would result in ten times the level of ground shaking as a magnitude 4 earthquake. Magnitude of an earthquake is logIMS\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf03d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 where I is the intensity of the earthquake (measured by the amplitude of a seismograph reading taken 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake) and S is the intensity of a ''standard earthquake'' (whose amplitude is 1 micron =10-4 cm).\n"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"aggregate_result":{"final_expression_output":"Detected 53 unique chapter-like headings\n   1  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 1 Chapter 6 (Statistics): Hypothesis Testing tatistic Pre-requisite Knowledge \uf0b7 Sampling Distribution of Means; \uf0b7 Point Estimates Content 6.1 Introduction to Hypothesis Testing 6.2 Terms and definitions 6.2.1 Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis 6.2.2 Test Statistic 6.2.3 Comparing z-score and critical value; or p-value and level of significance 6.2.4 Formal definitions of p-value and level of significance 6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test (Examples) 6.3.1 Sample size large/small, Population normal, 2\uf073 known 6.3.2 Sample size large, Population non-normal, 2\uf073 known 6.3.3 Sample size large, Population non-normal, 2\uf073 unknown 6.4 Further Examples 6.5 Summary and Checklist Objectives: \n   2  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 2 6.1 Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n   3  Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing 3 Example 1a A fizzy drink brand claims that the mean volume of its canned drinks (the volume is normally distributed with standard deviation 10ml) is 330ml.

(If we take another carton of 24 cans and measured their volume, the new sample mean might be close to 330ml.) A hypothesis test assesses the likelihood that scenario will occur, without having to literally take another sample! Thus, we can make a decision backed by statistical theory. In theory, if we repeatedly measure different cartons, we can plot a distribution of the sample means, called the sampling distribution of means. You might recall this theoretical distribution follows a normal distribution for large samples. 6.3 Carrying out a Hypothesis Test This is the outline of the steps in hypothesis testing: 1. Define the appropriate random variables and population distribution. 2. State the probability distribution from which the observations were taken. 3. State the null hypothesis 0H and alternative hypothesis 1H. 4. State the type of test and level of significance 1c. 5. Identify the test statistic and its distribution. 6. Either Compute the z-score and compare it with the critical value(s) or Compute the p-value and compare it with 1c. 7. Draw conclusions \u2013 reject or do not reject 0H. With the availability of computational tools such as GC, it is more convenient to use the p-value method. However, the critical value method is useful in situations where there are unknowns to be found. The critical value method requires standardising the test statistic to the standard normal variable Z (for H1 Maths). We shall illustrate the use of both the critical value and p-value methods in a few scenarios.

A good representation might make possible the learning of a concept that was not learnable using other representations. For example, in the case of the earthquake domain (earthquake data such as its location, epicenter, intensity, depth, type, etc.), we need important information such as the distance between the earthquakes\u2019 epicentres and the difference in time between the earthquakes. This information could make possible the learning of an important concept. This is known as a graph-based concept learning system.

Introduction There are many real life applications that use logarithm, from finding the time to reach an investment goal to modeling many natural processes, particularly in living systems. We perceive loudness of sound as the logarithm of the actual sound intensity, and dB (decibels) is a logarithmic scale. We also perceive brightness of light as the logarithm of the actual light energy, and star magnitudes are measured on a logarithmic scale. Most interesting of all could be the measurement of earthquake intensity on the Richter scale. The Richter magnitudes are based on a logarithmic scale (base 10). What this means is that for each whole number you go up on the Richter scale, the amplitude of the ground motion recorded by a seismograph goes up ten times. Using this scale, a magnitude 5 earthquake would result in ten times the level of ground shaking as a magnitude 4 earthquake. Magnitude of an earthquake is logIMS\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf03d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 where I is the intensity of the earthquake (measured by the amplitude of a seismograph reading taken 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake) and S is the intensity of a ''standard earthquake'' (whose amplitude is 1 micron =10-4 cm).\n","status":"success","messages":[]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Extracting chapter headings from PDF","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5f3bab81-6f2f-4be2-a345-05f3847721c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"aa715616-a13e-4bc8-9448-3b48bd91108b","turn_exchange_id":"40dfab1c-1320-4ba0-a631-361529d6ece7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aa715616-a13e-4bc8-9448-3b48bd91108b","children":["07cf733c-7998-4d74-8739-beffc8ed008b"]},"07cf733c-7998-4d74-8739-beffc8ed008b":{"id":"07cf733c-7998-4d74-8739-beffc8ed008b","message":{"id":"07cf733c-7998-4d74-8739-beffc8ed008b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768704411.894851,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Fixing code with proper indentation","content":"It seems the script still ran even with the ellipsis (\"\u2026\") inserted.

In the A Level syllabus, we \r\n[L27] will investigate the linear regression analysis and linear correlation analysis of two variables. \r\n[L28] In linear correlation analysis, we measure the strength or closeness of the linear relationship \r\n[L29] between the two variables. \r\n[L30] In linear regression analysis, we prepare an estimating (or regression) linear equation to \r\n[L31] estimate the values of one variable from given values of another. \r\n[L32] In other words, correlation analysis reveals the extent to which two variables are related\r\n[L33] whilst regression analysis tells us how they are related.\r\n[L34] EXAMPLE\r\n[L35] We are interested in the relationship between the number of hours studying and the marks \r\n[L36] obtained. The table below shows the amount of time (x hours) that 6 average students spent \r\n[L37] studying for a test and the marks that they obtained (y out of 100 marks). \r\n[L38] x 1 2.5 3 4 4.2 5\r\n[L39] y 20 46 48 60 61 65\r\n[L40] Correlation and regression analyses will help us to answer the following questions:\r\n[L41] \uf0b7 Is there a relationship between the amount of time spent on revision and marks \r\n[L42] obtained? \u2013 Correlation\r\n[L43] \uf0b7 Is the relationship a linear one? \u2013 Linear Correlation\r\n[L44] \uf0b7 If there is a linear relationship, can we reasonably predict the value of one of the \r\n[L45] variables from the knowledge of the other? \u2013 By finding the regression line\r\n[L46] \uf0b7 If another student studies for 2 hours, can you predict how many marks he will obtain? \r\n[L47] What about if he studies for 7 hours? \u2013 By using the regression line\r\n[L48] \uf0b7 How certain are you of your prediction? \u2013 Interpolation, Extrapolation\r\n[L49] 7.1.1 Bivariate Data\r\n[L50] Bivariate data refers to data connecting two variables. Each observation thus comprises a pair \r\n[L51] of values taken by the two variables. It is customary to express the bivariate data as ordered \r\n[L52] pairs (x, y).\n# \u30101\u2020H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\u2020file_0000000091047206872d637bdd8a8a10\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: H1 Mathematics A Level Notes-edited.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn10file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"10:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] P\r\n[L2] t\r\n[L3] O\r\n[L4] \uf0280,60.7\uf029\r\n[L5] P\r\n[L6] t O<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 524 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC 2 H1 Mathematics\r\n[L7] Exponential and Logarithmic Functions Page 1 of 14\r\n[L8] Chapter 3 (Pure Mathematics): Exponential and Logarithmic Functions\r\n[L9] Objectives\r\n[L10] At the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\r\n[L11] (a) understand the characteristics of the indices;\r\n[L12] (b) understand the characteristics of the exponential and logarithmic functions, ex and ln x\r\n[L13] (c) understand that ex y \uf03d and x y \uf03d ln are equivalent statements;\r\n[L14] (d) understand the nature of exponential growth and decay;\r\n[L15] (e) solve simple exponential and logarithmic equations;\r\n[L16] Content\r\n[L17] 1.1 Indices\r\n[L18] 1.1.1 Laws of Indices\r\n[L19] 1.1.2 Exponential Equations \r\n[L20] 1.2 A Particular Exponential Functions\r\n[L21] 1.3 Logarithmic functions\r\n[L22] 1.3.1 Definition of a Logarithm \r\n[L23] 1.3.2 Laws of Logarithm\r\n[L24] 1.4 Solving Miscellaneous Equations\r\n[L25] References\r\n[L26] New Syllabus Additional Mathematics (8th Edition), Shinglee Publishers Pte Ltd.\r\n[L27] Introduction\r\n[L28] There are many real life applications that use logarithm, from finding the time to reach an \r\n[L29] investment goal to modeling many natural processes, particularly in living systems. We \r\n[L30] perceive loudness of sound as the logarithm of the actual sound intensity, and dB (decibels) is\r\n[L31] a logarithmic scale. We also perceive brightness of light as the logarithm of the actual light \r\n[L32] energy, and star magnitudes are measured on a logarithmic scale.\r\n[L33] Most interesting of all could be the measurement of earthquake intensity on the Richter scale.\r\n[L34] The Richter magnitudes are based on a logarithmic scale (base 10). What this means is that for \r\n[L35] each whole number you go up on the Richter scale, the amplitude of the ground motion recorded \r\n[L36] by a seismograph goes up ten times. Using this scale, a magnitude 5 earthquake would result in \r\n[L37] ten times the level of ground shaking as a magnitude 4 earthquake.\r\n[L38] Magnitude of an earthquake is log I M\r\n[L39] S\r\n[L40] \uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf03d \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\r\n[L41] where I is the intensity of the earthquake (measured by the amplitude of a seismograph reading \r\n[L42] taken 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake) and S is the intensity of a ''standard \r\n[L43] earthquake'' (whose amplitude is 1 micron =10-4 cm).<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 525 / 576>SAJC 2022 JC 2 H1 Mathematics\r\n[L44] Exponential and Logarithmic Functions Page 2 of 14\r\n[L45] 1.1 Indices\r\n[L46] Background: Let us consider this example:\r\n[L47] 2 3 33 \uf03d \uf0b4\r\n[L48] where the base is 3 and the index is 2.
