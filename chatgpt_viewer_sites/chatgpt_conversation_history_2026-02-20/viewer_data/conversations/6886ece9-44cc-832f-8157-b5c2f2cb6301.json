Plain text avoids formatting surprises; PDFs upload cleanly. |\n| **Chunk sensibly.** | Break very long files at natural boundaries (chapter, section, timestamp). Aim for 2\u202f000\u20135\u202f000 words per chunk; that\u2019s well inside the per\u2011upload limit and makes later referencing easier. |\n| **Name files descriptively.** | \u201cShapiro\u2011PostLabor\u2011Lecture03.txt\u201d beats \u201cnotes3.txt\u201d. Good metadata lets you ask: \u201cCompare Lecture\u202f03 to Lecture\u202f07 on automation tax.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## 2\u202f\u202fLoad the material into ChatGPT  \n1. **Drag\u2011and\u2011drop or \u201cAttach file\u201d** straight into the chat.  \n2. Immediately ask for a **\u201cstructural map\u201d** of each file (outline of sections plus 1\u2011sentence takeaway).  \n3. Verify the outline; if something looks off, clarify before moving on.\n\n> **Why this order?** It forces me to ingest the file correctly and gives you a quick accuracy check before we dive deeper.\n\n---\n\n## 3\u202f\u202fBuild a living knowledge base inside the conversation  \nAfter each upload:\n\n1. **High\u2011level summary request**  \n   > \u201cGive me a 300\u2011word executive summary plus three novel research questions.\u201d\n\n2. **Concept glossary**  \n   > \u201cList every technical term in this chunk, define it in \u226425 words, and cite the passage.\u201d\n\n3. **Cross\u2011link prompt** (once you have \u2265\u202f2 files loaded)  \n   > \u201cWhere does Lecture\u202f02\u2019s \u2018automation dividend\u2019 argument contradict Lecture\u202f05\u2019s \u2018labor\u2011share floor\u2019 claim? Quote both sides.\u201d\n\nBecause the conversation keeps prior responses, you can refer back to numbered answers (\u201csee \u00a73.2 above\u201d) without re\u2011uploading.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u202f\u202fDeep exploratory dialogues  \nUse **iterative, branching prompts**:\n\n* **Drill\u2011down**  \n  > \u201cExpand on point\u202f2.b, derive its implied wage\u2011elasticity model, and compare it to Piketty\u2019s r\u202f>\u202fg thesis.\u201d\n\n* **Scenario analysis**  \n  > \u201cAssume AI productivity doubles every 3\u202fyears and median wages stagnate. Simulate Shapiro\u2019s policy bundle through 2040 and discuss fiscal sustainability.\u201d\n\n* **Counter\u2011arguments**  \n  > \u201cPlay devil\u2019s advocate: what empirical evidence would falsify Shapiro\u2019s automation\u2011tax proposal?\u201d\n\nBecause each follow\u2011up re\u2011uses the already\u2011ingested text, you avoid hitting context limits until you\u2019re many iterations deep.\n\n---\n\n## 5\u202f\u202fMaintain orientation with a live canvas (optional)  \nIf you anticipate a multi\u2011session project, let me create a **side\u2011panel \u2018canvas\u2019** that accumulates:\n\n* running glossary  \n* open questions  \n* agreed\u2011upon insights / TODOs\n\nYou can ask any time:  \n> \u201cAdd the three policy gaps we just found to the canvas under \u2018Unresolved Issues\u2019.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 6\u202f\u202fWhen the material grows beyond ChatGPT\u2019s native context  \n| Need | Lightweight fix | Heavier\u2014but future\u2011proof\u2014option |\n|------|-----------------|----------------------------------|\n| **>\u202f100\u202fk words total** | Keep using chunked uploads in new threads (one theme per thread). | Build a local or cloud RAG stack (LangChain/LLamaIndex, embeddings in FAISS/Pinecone) and point a custom GPT at it. |\n| **Graphical data or equations** | Paste LaTeX or image snippets; ask me to re\u2011typeset or re\u2011explain. | Store figures as separate image files and reference them in the RAG index. |\n| **Citation fidelity** | Request inline quotes + location markers. | Use citation\u2011aware RAG (e.g., LangChain\u2019s `Document` objects with metadata). |\n\n---\n\n## 7\u202f\u202fPrompt templates you can re\u2011use  \n\n1. **Compare two ideas**  \n   ```\n   Compare [Concept\u202fA] in File\u202fX (lines\u202fp\u2013q) with [Concept\u202fB] in File\u202fY (lines\u202fr\u2013s).\n   Highlight agreement, divergence, and empirical stakes in \u2264400\u202fwords.\n   ```\n\n2. **Map argument structure**  \n   ```\n   Build a premise\u2013conclusion outline of Lecture\u202f04.\n   For each premise, label it (empirical / normative / speculative) and assign confidence 1\u20115.\n   ```\n\n3. **Generate research agenda**  \n   ```\n   From everything uploaded so far, list 5 unanswered macro\u2011economic questions\n   that a PhD thesis could pursue. For each, suggest a feasible data set.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 8\u202f\u202fCaveats & best practices  \n* **Privacy:** Anything you upload is retained under OpenAI\u2019s usage policy; remove sensitive data.  \n* **Context window:** A single answer can synthesize ~50\u202fk tokens today, but back\u2011and\u2011forth plus embeddings eats into that limit. Chunking mitigates.  \n* **Version control:** If you later revise a file, re\u2011upload the whole file; partial edits confuse references.  \n* **Objectivity checks:** Periodically ask me to \u201cadopt a skeptical stance\u201d so we don\u2019t bias ourselves toward Shapiro\u2019s conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Quick\u2011start TL;DR\n1. Convert to clean\u202f.txt/PDF.  \n2. Upload one file, ask for outline + key points.  \n3. Iterate with focused prompts (glossary \u279c compare \u279c critique \u279c scenario).  \n4. Repeat for next file, then start cross\u2011file questions.  \n5. Optional: let me maintain a side canvas for persistent notes.\n\nFollow this recipe and you\u2019ll be able to interrogate the entire corpus, pivot quickly between overview and detail, and generate rigorous, citation\u2011backed insights\u2014all within a single ChatGPT session."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"966142978df7a8ee-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"987845b9-43a9-464e-ae9a-400d4fa23261","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"987845b9-43a9-464e-ae9a-400d4fa23261","children":[]}}}
