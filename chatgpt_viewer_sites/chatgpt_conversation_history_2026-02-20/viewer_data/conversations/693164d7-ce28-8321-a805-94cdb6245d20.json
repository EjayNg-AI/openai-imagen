Fed Chair Powell Think 'Irrational Exuberance' Is Back on Wall Street?","snippet":"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently commented that \"equity prices are fairly highly valued,\" prompting comparisons to past financial bubbles, particularly the Dotcom Bubble of the late 1990s. Though Powell emphasized that current conditions do not indicate elevated financial stability risks, some investors saw his comments as a veiled warning reminiscent of former Chairman Alan Greenspan\u2019s infamous \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d statement in 1996. Analysts like Ed Yardeni suggest Powell may be subtly signaling concerns about a potential asset bubble tied to the ongoing AI investment surge, now entering its fourth year.\n\nThe current AI-driven market boom has echoes of previous speculative frenzies, with tech stocks showing high valuations even as real returns remain uncertain. However, experts like Christopher Gannatti argue that unlike past bubbles, today's tech leaders have strong revenue bases, proven profitability, and substantial free cash flow. While the sector's average forward price-to-earnings ratio is elevated (around 30), it is still well below the Dotcom era's highs (around 55). Additionally, AI could boost corporate efficiency and profitability, with Morgan Stanley projecting an annual net economic benefit of $920 billion. Thus, while fears of a bubble persist, structural factors may justify the current valuations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1758746530.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.rstreet.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/alan-greenspans-irrational-exuberance-then-and-now/","title":"Alan Greenspan's 'irrational exuberance,' then and now","snippet":"16 Aug 2017 \u2014 The then-Federal Reserve chairman implied that the stock market was suffering from \u201cirrational exuberance.\u201d","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.rstreet.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.britannica.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.britannica.com/money/dot-com-bubble","title":"Dot-com Bubble & Bust | Definition, History, & Facts","snippet":"24 Nov 2025 \u2014 dot-com boom and bust Internet bubble.

Much like the dotcom bubble, AI valuations are being driven by speculative sentiment rather than clear financial fundamentals. The CAPE ratio\u2014a historical valuation metric\u2014is now back at dotcom-era levels, while AI-related stocks (primarily the \"Magnificent 7\") dominate market indices, raising serious concentration and correlation risks. Deals between major AI firms, such as Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI and similar cross-holdings with AMD, are seen as financially circular and risky, potentially misallocating capital. Unlike the 1990s, today\u2019s macroeconomic conditions\u2014marked by inflation, deglobalization, and fiscal instability\u2014are less conducive to supporting such a speculative surge. Despite Nvidia\u2019s massive revenues, skepticism remains about the financial sustainability of the broader AI sector, especially when profitability for key players like OpenAI remains out of reach.

He pointed out that between 1982 and 1999, similar excitement around tech fueled massive market gains, culminating in a devastating crash where the Nasdaq dropped nearly 80% and the S&P 500 by around 45%.\n\nUsing companies like Palantir as an example\u2014with its projected 45% revenue jump to over $4.1 billion this year and a stock rise of 27-fold since early 2023\u2014Hanke emphasized that the market\u2019s future depends heavily on whether these AI firms can deliver on their lofty forecasts.

Jain is critical of what he sees as excessive investment in nascent AI technologies with unproven profitability, particularly large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, where less than 3% of users pay and operational costs are high due to computational demands.\n\nHe highlights worrying financial practices, such as circular investments where companies like Nvidia fund startups that, in turn, purchase from them, inflating profits unsustainably. Jain argues that free cash flows are overstated due to aggressive accounting tactics around stock-based compensation and capital expenditure amortization. He also warns about the fragile state of cloud computing, with falling GPU rental prices and increased competition from smaller, specialized providers undermining the profitability of major players like Google, AWS, and Oracle.\n\nJain concludes by casting doubt on AI's long-term societal utility, noting limited adoption for mission-critical purposes and likening it more to a tool than a transformational force, despite hype comparing it to fire or electricity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1760337000.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_693164e005e483278414e387265b6b1d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for early tech bubble terminology and references","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"45bd8d70-5bb8-4f11-aabf-e3bc057bbffe","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"49a216d4-5963-4ad2-b040-5fe4f48456a1","turn_exchange_id":"46c65157-f3ca-4823-b3f4-faaab13ecc95","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"49a216d4-5963-4ad2-b040-5fe4f48456a1","children":["cf5a347e-7077-4cdc-b749-cc5b66770ee3"]},"cf5a347e-7077-4cdc-b749-cc5b66770ee3":{"id":"cf5a347e-7077-4cdc-b749-cc5b66770ee3","message":{"id":"cf5a347e-7077-4cdc-b749-cc5b66770ee3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764844775.506844,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring early signs of tech bubble in the 90s","content":"The user is asking if people were already referring to a tech bubble between 1995-1997.

Key indicators such as rising corporate debt and complex financing deals may echo past events, but profitability remains strong, corporate leverage is contained, household savings are stable, and credit spreads and equity volatility remain low.\n\nThe strategists advise investors to manage risk thoughtfully, suggesting strategies like buying call options to capture gains without excessive downside exposure.

Jain is critical of what he sees as excessive investment in nascent AI technologies with unproven profitability, particularly large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, where less than 3% of users pay and operational costs are high due to computational demands.\n\nHe highlights worrying financial practices, such as circular investments where companies like Nvidia fund startups that, in turn, purchase from them, inflating profits unsustainably. Jain argues that free cash flows are overstated due to aggressive accounting tactics around stock-based compensation and capital expenditure amortization. He also warns about the fragile state of cloud computing, with falling GPU rental prices and increased competition from smaller, specialized providers undermining the profitability of major players like Google, AWS, and Oracle.\n\nJain concludes by casting doubt on AI's long-term societal utility, noting limited adoption for mission-critical purposes and likening it more to a tool than a transformational force, despite hype comparing it to fire or electricity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1760337000.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/ai-investment-boom-may-lead-bust-not-likely-systemic-crisis-imf-chief-economist-2025-10-14/","title":"AI investment boom may lead to bust, but not likely systemic crisis, IMF chief economist says","snippet":"IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas stated that while the current AI investment boom in the U.S. might result in a dot-com-style bust, it is unlikely to trigger a systemic financial crisis. He noted similarities to the 1990s internet bubble, particularly in inflated stock valuations and consumption-driven inflation. However, the AI boom is primarily funded by cash-rich companies rather than debt, reducing systemic financial risks. Investment in AI, including infrastructure like chips and data centers, has risen only modestly\u20140.4% of U.S. GDP since 2022, compared to 1.2% during the dot-com era. While an AI market correction could affect investor sentiment and asset repricing, it poses limited threats to broader financial stability since it lacks major ties to leverage channels.\n\nGourinchas also highlighted how AI-driven consumption may be contributing to sustained inflation without corresponding gains in productivity. The IMF reduced its inflation forecast, now expecting U.S. inflation to drop to only 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, with impacts from President Trump\u2019s tariffs and reduced immigration playing roles. Tariffs have been absorbed mainly by U.S. importers, not foreign exporters, maintaining upward pressure on prices.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1760448412.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_693164e005e483278414e387265b6b1d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for early references to tech bubble terminology","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"45bd8d70-5bb8-4f11-aabf-e3bc057bbffe","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"b6c6e024-6378-4a16-853e-678689c9579c","turn_exchange_id":"46c65157-f3ca-4823-b3f4-faaab13ecc95","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b6c6e024-6378-4a16-853e-678689c9579c","children":["c8c5afe9-15e2-4909-a825-12bdd986d3dc"]},"c8c5afe9-15e2-4909-a825-12bdd986d3dc":{"id":"c8c5afe9-15e2-4909-a825-12bdd986d3dc","message":{"id":"c8c5afe9-15e2-4909-a825-12bdd986d3dc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764844803.514982,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Answering the user's question about the tech bubble","content":"In 1995-97, some professionals and commentators did call it a bubble, but the term was not widely used until later.

What people were actually saying in 1995\u20131997\n\n**1995\u20131996: Euphoria with scattered skeptics**\n\n- The **Netscape IPO in August 1995** is often described *in hindsight* as the \u201cBig Bang of the Internet stock bubble.\u201d Contemporary commentators already noted how extreme the demand was and worried about speculation, but the fully-formed \u201cdot-com bubble\u201d narrative came later. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn2search15\ue201  \n- From 1995 to 2000 the Nasdaq rose roughly five-fold, with a huge part of that move starting in the mid-90s. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **December 5, 1996:** Federal Reserve Chair **Alan Greenspan** gave his famous \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d speech, explicitly raising the question of whether asset prices (including tech) had been driven to unsustainable levels by speculation. Markets dipped briefly, then kept running. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn2search21\ue201  \n\nSo by late 1996, the most important monetary policymaker in the world had publicly hinted at a *bubble-like* situation, even if he didn\u2019t say \u201ctech bubble\u201d by name.\n\n**1997: Still mostly \u201cnew economy\u201d, not \u201cwe\u2019re in a bubble\u201d**\n\n- Academic work looking back from the 2000s argues that, from a fundamentals-only perspective, **even buying the Nasdaq in December 1997 didn\u2019t obviously look insane** ex post, because many leading tech firms (Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, etc.) went on to grow into those valuations. One NBER paper by DeLong and others even says *\u201ceven a year later is probably too early to date the advent of the bubble.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n- That lines up with anecdotal recollections: there *were* value-oriented managers already convinced they were in a **\u201ctechnology stock bubble\u201d** in the late 1990s, and some deliberately rotated out of big-cap growth into more defensive assets. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue201 But this was a contrarian stance, not consensus.\n\nIn other words, **there were already people calling it a bubble**, but if you were reading mainstream commentary in 1995\u20131997 you\u2019d have seen more \u201cnew paradigm / information age / productivity miracle\u201d talk than \u201cthis will blow up\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 2. When did the *phrase* \u201ctech / Internet / dot-com bubble\u201d really become common?\n\n- The label **\u201cdot-com bubble\u201d** is largely retrospective. Histories and data work now frame the period 1995\u20132000 as a \u201cdot-com boom and bust\u201d or \u201ctechnology stock bubble\u201d, but those terms only became standard after the crash. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn2search23\ue201  \n- By **1999**, you start to see mainstream pieces literally titled things like *\u201cInternet stock bubble: When will it pop?\u201d* and Wall Street Journal articles talking quite explicitly about an \u201cInternet-stock bubble\u201d about to burst. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn2search9\ue201  \n\nSo the sequence is roughly:\n\n1. **1995\u201396:** explosive tech/Internet gains; some skepticism, but the dominant story is \u201cinternet revolution\u201d; no standard \u201cdot-com bubble\u201d phrase yet.  \n2. **Dec 1996 onwards:** \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d becomes code for \u201cwe might be in a bubble,\u201d but markets keep rallying.  \n3. **1998\u201399:** bubble language becomes much more explicit and widespread in the financial press.  \n4. **Post-2000:** \u201cdot-com bubble / tech bubble\u201d becomes the standard label in hindsight.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Direct answer to your question\n\n- **Were there people in 1995\u20131997 already calling it a tech/Internet bubble?**  \n  Yes. Some fund managers, economists, and columnists were already warning that tech/Internet valuations looked like a bubble and used \u201cbubble\u201d language, especially after 1996.\n\n- **Was that the dominant narrative?**  \n  No. The dominant narrative in 1995\u20131997 was still **\u201cnew economy / productivity revolution / internet future\u201d**, with a minority of skeptics talking about bubbles and speculative excess.\n\n- **Was the term \u201cdot-com bubble\u201d itself common then?**  \n  Not really. That phrase (and \u201ctech bubble\u201d as a fixed label) only became ubiquitous **around 1999\u20132000 and especially after the crash**, when everyone needed a name for what had just blown up.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to compare to today\u2019s AI cycle: 1995\u20131997 is roughly the phase where **smart skeptics are already muttering \u201cthis is a bubble\u201d, the central bank is hinting at overvaluation, but the consensus is still \u201ckeep riding it.\u201d**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn2search15\ue201","start_idx":540,"end_idx":573,"safe_urls":["https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-09/three-days-that-changed-modern-life","https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-09/three-days-that-changed-modern-life?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12011/w12011.pdf","https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12011/w12011.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12011/w12011.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"A Short Note on the Size of the Dot-Com Bubble","url":"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12011/w12011.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1138810222.0,"snippet":"by JB DeLong \u00b7 2006 \u00b7 Cited by 99 \u2014 Netscape IPO \u201cthe Big Bang of the Internet stock bubble.\u201d CNN Insight's Bruce.
