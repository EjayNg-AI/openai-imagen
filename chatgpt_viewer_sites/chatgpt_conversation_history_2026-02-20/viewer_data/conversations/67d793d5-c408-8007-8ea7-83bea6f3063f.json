Executive Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis report analyzes the commercial property rental market in the Kovan area of Singapore to identify units suitable for operating a tuition center, based on specific criteria provided. The analysis focuses on properties with a size between 250 to 350 square feet and a rental price under $5000 Singapore dollars, preferably located close to the Kovan MRT station or within reasonable walking distance. The study encompasses major online property platforms in Singapore to provide a comprehensive overview of available options. Key findings indicate the presence of several potentially suitable properties, particularly within The Promenade @ Pelikat and Kovan City. However, establishing a tuition center involves adhering to specific regulatory requirements in Singapore, which are also discussed in this report to provide a holistic understanding for the user's decision-making process. This report serves as a preliminary assessment to guide the user's next steps in securing an appropriate location for their tuition center.\r\n\r\n**II. Overview of Major Singapore Property Platforms:**\r\n\r\nA thorough search for commercial rental properties necessitates exploring various online platforms that serve the Singaporean market. Each platform has its unique reach and focus, contributing to a comprehensive market understanding.\r\n\r\nPropertyGuru stands as a leading online property portal in Singapore since its inception in 2007 1. Its establishment coincided with a period when property searches primarily relied on classified advertisements, highlighting its role in the evolution of property hunting in Singapore. Recognized as a top platform for both resale and rental properties, PropertyGuru attracts significant user traffic, evidenced by its 3.76 million visits in January 2025 1. This substantial user base suggests a wide array of property listings, making it a crucial resource for individuals seeking commercial spaces for rent in areas like Kovan 3. While its extensive database includes various property types, users need to employ filters to specifically target commercial rentals in their desired location.\r\n\r\nSRX Property, with its origins in StreetSine Technology, was initially renowned for its property valuation and analysis tools before expanding into property listings 1. Now under the ownership of SPH, SRX Property continues to be a relevant platform in the Singaporean property landscape, attracting 343.43K visits in January 2025 1. Its background in valuation could offer users additional data-driven insights alongside listings, potentially aiding in the assessment of a property's rental value. Similar to PropertyGuru, SRX Property also features commercial properties for rent in the Kovan area, encompassing various types like shops and offices 6.\r\n\r\nEdgeProp Singapore emerged as a spin-off from The Edge magazine, which is primarily known for its analysis of financial markets 1. The platform further strengthened its analytical capabilities through the acquisition of SquareFoot, a property analysis company. This background suggests that EdgeProp might offer a more investment-oriented perspective on property listings, potentially including market trends and in-depth analysis. While its website traffic of 245.98K visits in January 2025 is lower compared to PropertyGuru and SRX Property, it still represents a significant segment of property seekers 2. EdgeProp also lists commercial properties for rent near the Kovan MRT station 14, although the readily available information in the provided snippets is less detailed regarding properties that precisely meet the user's criteria.\r\n\r\n99.co entered the Singaporean property market as a promising competitor to established platforms like PropertyGuru, backed by significant funding 1. Although it has since expanded its focus to include the Indonesian market, 99.co maintains a strong presence in Singapore, evidenced by its 555.45K website visits in January 2025 2. The platform is known for its user-friendly interface and offers a range of commercial property listings for rent in the Kovan area, including retail and office spaces 19. A particularly useful feature is its ability to filter properties based on their proximity to MRT stations, which is directly relevant to the user's preference.\r\n\r\nCommercialGuru is a specialized online portal dedicated solely to commercial properties in Singapore and is operated by the same group that owns PropertyGuru 2. This focused approach makes it a highly relevant platform for individuals seeking commercial rentals, as it likely contains a higher concentration of suitable listings compared to general property portals. The platform attracts a dedicated audience interested in commercial real estate, with 226.87K visits recorded in January 2025 2. CommercialGuru provides detailed listings for commercial properties for rent near the NE13 Kovan MRT station, including shops, shophouses, and offices, with comprehensive information on size, rental price, and distance from the MRT 24.\r\n\r\nMOGUL.sg is a more recent entrant to the property search market in Singapore, distinguishing itself through the use of artificial intelligence via its MAIA agent 29. MAIA aggregates property listings from major platforms like PropertyGuru and 99.co, offering a broad overview of the market from a single interface. While specific details about Kovan listings on MOGUL.sg are not prominent in the provided snippets, its function as an aggregator across over 100,000 listings makes it a platform worth considering to potentially uncover options missed on individual sites.\r\n\r\nPropNex, a prominent real estate agency in Singapore, also operates its own property portal 30. This portal serves as another valuable resource for finding property listings, including commercial rentals. While the snippets do not specifically mention Kovan listings on the PropNex portal, it is advisable to conduct a direct search on their platform to explore any potential exclusive or agency-managed properties in the area.\r\n\r\n**III. Analysis of Commercial Property Listings in Kovan:**\r\n\r\nThe search across these major property platforms reveals a number of commercial properties available for rent in the vicinity of Kovan MRT station. These properties primarily consist of shop/shophouse units, retail spaces within commercial complexes, and office units. Some industrial spaces in nearby areas are also listed, but their suitability for a tuition center would depend on zoning regulations and the possibility of obtaining a \"change of use\" permit.\r\n\r\nCommercialGuru consistently presents a significant number of commercial properties for rent in close proximity to NE13 Kovan MRT 24. Listings often include specific addresses in developments like The Promenade @ Pelikat and Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, providing key details such as floor area, rental cost, and the walking distance to the MRT station.\r\n\r\nPropertyGuru also lists commercial properties, particularly shops and shophouses, in the Kovan area 3. However, users should be aware that broader searches on this platform might also yield residential properties, necessitating the application of filters to refine the results to commercial rentals.\r\n\r\n99.co features retail and office spaces located near the Kovan MRT station 20. Specific buildings like The Promenade @ Pelikat and Kovan City are mentioned as having available units that align with the user's size and price preferences. The platform's filter for proximity to MRT is a particularly useful tool for this search.\r\n\r\nSRX Property displays various commercial properties for rent in the Kovan area, including both shops and offices 7. Locations such as Space @ Kovan and The Promenade @ Pelikat are noted as having listings.\r\n\r\nEdgeProp, while indicating the presence of commercial properties for rent near Kovan MRT 14, provides less detailed information in the snippets about properties that meet the specific size and price requirements. One listing for Stars of Kovan was found, but its rental cost exceeded the user's stated budget.\r\n\r\n**IV. Detailed Evaluation of Properties Meeting User Criteria:**\r\n\r\nSeveral properties identified across these platforms appear to meet the user's criteria for size (250-350 sq ft) and rental price (under $5000 SGD) near Kovan MRT.\r\n\r\n**The Promenade @ Pelikat:** This development shows a strong presence of suitable units. Multiple shop/shophouse and retail spaces are listed within the desired size and price range, typically within a 9-10 minute walk from Kovan MRT 6. Examples include units at 183 Jalan Pelikat and 189 Jalan Pelikat with sizes around 205-258 sq ft and rental prices ranging from $1400 to $3200 per month. The prevalence of listings in this location across various platforms makes it a prime area of interest.\r\n\r\n**Kovan City (Hougang Street 21):** Office units in Kovan City also appear to fit the user's requirements. Several listings indicate sizes around 300 sq ft with rental prices ranging from $1680 to $2000 per month 3. A significant advantage of Kovan City is its closer proximity to the MRT station, with some units being only a 3-5 minute walk away.\r\n\r\n**Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre:** Retail units are listed here within the budget, but their sizes tend to be smaller, generally between 150-170 sq ft 7. The walking distance to Kovan MRT is approximately 12 minutes. While affordable, the smaller size might not be ideal for a tuition center requiring more space.\r\n\r\n**Space @ Kovan:** Information from the snippets suggests some retail/shop units, but specific details on units within the 250-350 sq ft range and under $5000 are limited 8. One unit of 204 sq ft was listed at $3200 per month. The walking distance to Kovan MRT is around 10-15 minutes. Further investigation on property platforms with specific filters is recommended for this location.\r\n\r\n**Other Notable Listings:** A shop/shophouse unit at 208 Hougang Street 21, with a size of 484 sq ft and a rental price of $5000 per month, is slightly outside the preferred size but boasts a very short 5-minute walk to the MRT 25. This could be a viable option if flexibility on size exists. Conversely, an office space at 1015 Upper Serangoon Road, while within budget at $3600 per month and a 7-minute walk to the MRT, is significantly larger at 1300 sq ft 24.\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes the identified properties that appear to meet the user's core requirements:\r\n\r\n| Location | Address | Size (sq ft) | Rental Price (SGD/mo) | Distance to Kovan MRT | Property Type | Platform |\r\n| :---- | :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 205 | 1400 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 189 Jalan Pelikat | 205 | 1500 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 256 | 1600 | \\~10 mins | Mall Shop | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 258 | 1500 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 258 | 1600 | \\~10 mins | Other Retail | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 189 Jalan Pelikat | 256 | 1600 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 291 | 3000 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | PropertyGuru |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 236 | 1688 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | PropertyGuru |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 258 | 1600 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | PropertyGuru |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | 183 Jalan Pelikat | 205 | 1400 | \\~10 mins | Shop/Shophouse | PropertyGuru |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | Jln Pelikat | 161 | 1200 | \\~9 mins | Retail | 99.co, SRX |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | Jln Pelikat | 206 | 1500 | \\~9 mins | Retail | 99.co, SRX |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | Jln Pelikat | 206 | 1500 | \\~9 mins | Retail | 99.co |\r\n| The Promenade @ Pelikat | Jln Pelikat | 183 | 1000 | \\~9 mins | Retail | 99.co |\r\n| Kovan City | Hougang Street 21 | 300 | 1680 | \\~13 mins | Office | CommercialGuru |\r\n| Kovan City | Hougang Street 21 | 300 | 2000 | \\~3 mins | Office | SRX, 99.co |\r\n| Kovan City | Hougang Street 21 | 300 | 1800 | \\~3 mins | Office | SRX, 99.co |\r\n| 208 Hougang Street 21 | 208 Hougang Street 21 | 484 | 5000 | \\~5 mins | Shop/Shophouse | CommercialGuru, PG |\r\n\r\n**\u2013**  \r\n**\u2014**\r\n\r\n# Kovan Area Tuition Center Rental Options\r\n\r\nBelow are several commercial rental listings in the Kovan area that meet your criteria (\u2248250\u2013350 sq ft, under S$5k/month, near MRT).
