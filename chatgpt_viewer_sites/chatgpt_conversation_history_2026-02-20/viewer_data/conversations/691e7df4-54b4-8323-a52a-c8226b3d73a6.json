Modern Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have picked up the underlying structure rather than surface patterns.\n\nYour idea attempts to resurrect the asymmetry by leveraging **temporal illusions** and **cross-image illusions**\u2014i.e., phenomena that humans \u201cfeel\u201d perceptually, but only under certain dynamical conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s analyse what would happen.\n\n---\n\n# 2. **Motion-dependent illusions as CAPTCHAs**\n\n### 2.1 The illusion you\u2019re proposing\nThese are illusions where:\n\n- A still image is not illusory.\n- But when the image is moved (slid or rotated), *transient misperception* arises\u2014e.g., shimmering, motion-binding breakdown, illusory contours, anomalous speed, peripheral motion, etc.\n\nExamples include:\n- Peripheral drift illusion  \n- Flash-lag effect  \n- Motion silencing (Treue\u2013Chang illusion)  \n- Reverse-phi motion  \n- Enigma illusion  \n\n### 2.2 Why humans perceive them\nSuch illusions arise from:\n- Latency differences across retinal pathways  \n- Temporal filtering and motion detectors (Magnocellular vs Parvocellular)  \n- Predictive coding and smoothing  \n- Local neural adaptation  \n\nThese effects are due to **hardware quirks** of the visual system.\n\n### 2.3 Can AI perceive these illusions?\n**Not biologically. But yes, functionally.**\n\nA modern vision model could simply:\n- Analyse the static image,\n- Recognize the signature of a known illusion type,\n- Predict \u201cwhat illusion a human would see.\u201d\n\nThis bypasses the need to experience the illusion.\n\nThis is exactly how LLMs handle many sensory tasks today:  \nThey do *not* \u201chear\u201d or \u201csee\u201d like humans; they **infer** what a human would experience.\n\n**Thus the CAPTCHA collapses** because AI doesn\u2019t need to *perceive*\u2014it only needs to **model human perception**.\n\n### 2.4 You might argue:\n\u201cWhat if the illusions are newly generated each time, not from known categories?\u201d\n\nEven then, a model can compute whether the image\u2019s spatiotemporal patterns would activate known human biases:\n\n- A model can simulate motion detectors (derivative filters in space and time).\n- It can estimate likely perceptual misfires based on massive data.\n\nYou can already see this starting: models like GPT-5.x-Vision can describe illusions humans see\u2014even those they have no biological access to.\n\n=> **AI will detect the illusion by predicting human perceptual failure.**  \nThis is *easier* than actually having a perceptual system.\n\n---\n\n# 3. **Cross-image illusions as CAPTCHAs**\n\nThese are illusions where:\n- Image A alone: no illusion.\n- Image B alone: no illusion.\n- Viewed together or in sequence: *emergent subjective effect* appears.\n\nExamples:\n- The Checker-Shadow illusion when context is added  \n- Color assimilation across images  \n- Contrast illusions requiring side-by-side comparison  \n- Troxler fading when juxtaposition changes attention  \n- Binocular rivalry\u2013like effects induced by alternating frames  \n\nA model can:\n- Compare pixel distributions,\n- Compute color constancy, luminance gradients, spatial context,\n- And predict \u201chumans will perceive lighter/darker/shifted here.\u201d\n\nThus again the model doesn't need to \u201csee the illusion\u201d \u2014 it only needs to **predict human perceptual bias**.\n\n---\n\n# 4. **Why illusions no longer work as CAPTCHAs**\n\n### 4.1 AI is now *superhuman* at predicting human perception\nBecause:\n- It has seen billions of annotated images,\n- It is trained on text describing illusions,\n- It can interpolate across perceptual principles.\n\nLMMs are effectively running a *large-scale meta-model of human perception*.\n\n### 4.2 AI can brute-force the latent structure\nEven if you invent a brand-new illusion:\n\n- It has a fixed mathematical structure (spatiotemporal statistics).\n- AI can compute those statistics and model what a human visual system would do.\n\nThis is trivial compared to the already-solved problems of:\n- 3D reconstruction,\n- physics inference,\n- occlusion reasoning,\n- complex scene understanding.\n\n### 4.3 AI never needs to have a human-like visual cortex\nHumans perceive illusions due to *hardware constraints*.  \nAI can bypass this entirely by **learning the mapping from input \u2192 human perceptual error**.\n\nThis is exactly why AI can already:\n- Predict which songs people will find catchy,\n- Predict which memes will go viral,\n- Predict what optical illusions humans will see (including ones they've never seen before).\n\nA CAPTCHA based on illusions would simply become:\n> \"Guess what a human would guess.\"\n\nAI is already trained to excel at this.\n\n---\n\n# 5. **Could illusions be engineered to defeat AI?**\n\nOnly if they exploit **human perceptual failure patterns that are unpredictable and irreducible from pixel statistics**.\n\nBut almost all illusions known so far:\n- Have well-defined mechanistic explanations,\n- Are derivable from low-level spatial/temporal filters,\n- And are predictable by models of visual neuroscience.\n\nIf you invented illusions that depend on:\n- High-resolution retinal microsaccade patterns,\n- Individual variation in V1 receptive fields,\n- Idiosyncratic proprioceptive coupling with the vestibular system,\n- Or illusions requiring true embodied motion,\n\n\u2026AI might struggle.\n\nBut such illusions would:\n- Affect different humans differently (unreliable CAPTCHA),\n- Be impossible to standardize,\n- Cause accessibility issues,\n- Possibly be adversarially spoofed anyway.\n\nCAPTCHA designers avoid things that vary between users.\n\n---\n\n# 6. **The deeper problem: Any CAPTCHA that uses human behaviour can be learned**\n\nLLMs do not need to solve the task.  \nThey need to solve the *meta-task*:  \n**\u201cWhat would a human say?\u201d**\n\nThis is precisely the domain in which they are strongest.\n\nThis is why text CAPTCHAs, logic puzzles, distorted image CAPTCHAs, and segmentation tasks have all collapsed.\n\nMotion illusions appear difficult only because **humans rely on brute hardware quirks**, but AI relies on **training-based meta-reasoning**, which is more general and more powerful in this context.\n\n---\n\n# 7. **Conclusion: Your idea is clever, but AI would still pass it**\n\n**AI can detect motion-based or cross-image-based illusions by predicting human perceptual behaviour.**\n\nThis makes your CAPTCHA non-robust.\n\nCAPTCHAs going forward likely need:\n- *Proof of computational cost* (e.g., client-side puzzles),\n- *Proof of liveness* (biometrics, random gesture challenges),\n- *Proof of embodiment* (sensor fusion, hardware-based attestations),\n- *Proof of identity* (cryptographic),\n- Or *economic cost* (proof-of-work schemes).\n\nPurely perceptual tests won\u2019t survive frontier-level AI.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n\n- **Design illusions that AI truly struggles with**,  \n- **Design a next-gen CAPTCHA resistant to LMMs**,  \n- **Analyse whether CAPTCHAs themselves are obsolete**,  \n- Or **specify what new asymmetries between humans and AI must be leveraged going forward**.\n\nJust let me know which direction you prefer."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"f401418b-04e9-42f7-9b63-db1e86f26dd4","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"1eeb8938-600f-4c50-97cf-785757c65a64","turn_exchange_id":"8a127d3e-e72f-48dc-ab68-09c380a089af","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"1eeb8938-600f-4c50-97cf-785757c65a64","children":["b60c59dd-9155-4e32-bd86-d0f3c3b0e189"]},"b60c59dd-9155-4e32-bd86-d0f3c3b0e189":{"id":"b60c59dd-9155-4e32-bd86-d0f3c3b0e189","message":{"id":"b60c59dd-9155-4e32-bd86-d0f3c3b0e189","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763606900.8,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I

Let me sharpen why that\u2019s structurally true, and then talk about what *non-treadmill* alternatives might look like.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the CAPTCHA paradigm is inherently an arms race\n\nCAPTCHA stands for \u201cCompletely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\u201d\n\nThe underlying assumption is:\n\n> There exists some cognitive/perceptual task that humans can do easily but artificial intelligence (AI, artificial intelligence) systems cannot.\n\nOnce that task is formalized and deployed at scale:\n\n1. **It becomes training data.**  \n   - Every widely deployed CAPTCHA is, by definition, a labeled dataset:\n     - Input: distorted image / audio / puzzle.  \n     - Label: ground-truth answer (because users solve it).\n   - Models can be fine-tuned specifically to solve *those* distributions of puzzles.\n\n2. **It becomes an optimization target.**  \n   - CAPTCHA accuracy becomes a benchmark.  \n   - Model builders (or bot operators) optimize directly for that benchmark.  \n   - This is Goodhart\u2019s Law again: once a perceptual task becomes the gatekeeper, it becomes the target.\n\n3. **As models approach human-level on generic vision and language, the \u201cgap\u201d disappears.**  \n   - When your general-purpose vision\u2013language model can describe photographs, read tiny text, and reason about scenes, \u201cfind all buses in this image\u201d is not special.  \n   - Any *static*, finite family of puzzles becomes just another pattern family in the model\u2019s function space.\n\nSo, yes: if the strategy is \u201ckeep inventing new cognitive party tricks,\u201d we are locked into a race where:\n\n- Research labs + bot-developers get better at solving them.\n- Websites respond with more annoying, more complex CAPTCHAs.\n- Humans get increasing friction with decreasing marginal security.\n\nThat is not a stable equilibrium. It is just delayed failure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. In the limit, CAPTCHAs are mathematically doomed\n\nIf you think long-term and assume:\n\n- AI systems can approximate human-level performance on virtually any well-defined input\u2013output mapping that:\n  - Fits into their training regime,\n  - Is \u201csimple\u201d relative to their capacity,\n\nthen any **purely informational** challenge (image, audio, text puzzle) will eventually be solvable to near-human accuracy by a model that has:\n\n- Enough data,\n- Enough parameters,\n- Enough fine-tuning pressure on that task.\n\nSo in the limit, you cannot rely on:\n\n- \u201cPerceptual weirdness\u201d (illusions),\n- \u201cCompositional puzzles,\u201d\n- \u201cTricky logic riddles,\u201d\n\nbecause all of those live in the same universe: \u201cmap bitstring in \u2192 bitstring out.\u201d A sufficiently powerful model that\u2019s been optimized on those distributions will pass.\n\nThe only way out is to tie the test to something AI *cannot cheaply fake*, which means going beyond pure information.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What a non-race-condition world would look like\n\nYou essentially need to move from:\n\n> \u201cCan you solve this puzzle?\u201d  \n\nto:\n\n> \u201cCan you demonstrate a *non-replicable resource* that we care about?\u201d\n\nRoughly four categories:\n\n### 3.1 Cryptographic identity, not cognition\n\nInstead of: \u201cProve you are human *by thinking*,\u201d  \nuse: \u201cProve you are *you* via cryptographic credentials.\u201d\n\nExamples of this direction (conceptually):\n\n- Strong device-bound keys (passkeys, WebAuthn-style).\n- Identity providers issuing non-transferable tokens.\n- Per-user, per-device private keys stored in secure hardware.\n\nThis changes the game from \u201cbeat the puzzle\u201d to:\n\n- \u201cDo you control this key bound to some identity / account / device?\u201d\n\nAI systems can\u2019t magically mint a new hardware-backed credential on every request.\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n\n- Centralization risk (few big identity providers).\n- Privacy risk (linking actions across sites).\n- Exclusion (people without devices / documents).\n\nBut structurally, this is *not* an arms race in the same sense. It is infrastructure, not puzzles.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 Proof-of-personhood / \u201cSybil resistance\u201d\n\nA Sybil attack is when one entity pretends to be many identities.\n\nInstead of CAPTCHA, you aim for:\n\n- One real human \u2194 one \u201cpersonhood token\u201d (non-transferable).\n- Each human can create accounts / actions, but cannot multiply themselves at will.\n\nDesigns here range from:\n\n- Biometric-based systems (face, iris, etc.).  \n- Social-graph-based systems (web-of-trust: identities vouch for each other).\n- Event-based systems (you physically show up somewhere once).\n\nAgain, AI can\u2019t fabricate *actual bodies* or *social histories* (at least not at trivial cost). So the asymmetry is no longer \u201cwho can solve puzzles,\u201d but \u201cwho has a unique physical and social presence.\u201d\n\n**Downside:** privacy, surveillance, and the politics of \u201cwho counts as a person.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3.3 Economic friction instead of cognitive friction\n\nWe can replace puzzles with **cost functions**:\n\n- Rate limiting,\n- Micro-payments,\n- Proof-of-work (you must burn some computation),\n- Proof-of-stake (you must lock some value).\n\nCore idea:\n\n> Humans usually perform a small number of actions. Bots try to perform massive numbers.\n\nSo we can say:\n\n- Each request costs some resource.\n- Honest individual users pay negligible total cost.\n- A botnet trying to generate millions of actions pays a lot.\n\nThis does not guarantee \u201cno bots,\u201d but it makes **mass automated abuse uneconomical**.\n\nHere the asymmetry is economic, not cognitive.\n\n---\n\n### 3.4 OS- / browser- / hardware-level attestation\n\nInstead of per-website puzzles, you move the problem **down the stack**:\n\n- The browser / operating system (OS, operating system) enforces:\n  - Which processes can automate traffic,\n  - When scripted control is allowed,\n  - How many actions per second per device.\n\nYou get something like:\n\n- \u201cThis request is coming from an interactive user session on a trusted device, not from an automated farm.\u201d\n\nThis could include:\n\n- Secure enclaves signing \u201cthis click came from an actual human input device.\u201d\n- Aggregated behavioural signals (with privacy-preserving aggregation).\n\nAgain, break the race by changing *who* has to solve the problem. Browsers and OS vendors have more leverage than individual websites.\n\n---\n\n## 4. So what does that mean for your intuition?\n\nYour intuition is correct:\n\n- **Designing \u201cever-cleverer\u201d CAPTCHAs is a treadmill.**\n- The more AI advances, the worse the treadmill becomes.\n- Optical illusions, dynamic perception, multi-image tricks \u2013 they all become just more training data.\n\n**The right pivot is conceptual**:\n\n- Stop thinking in terms of *cognitive tests* that distinguish \u201chuman vs machine.\u201d\n- Start thinking in terms of **identity, cost, and attestation**:\n  - Identity: Who are you, and is this identity unique?\n  - Cost: How expensive is it to act at scale?\n  - Attestation: Who vouches that this is a real user session?\n\nOnce you reframe it that way, \u201cCAPTCHA\u201d as we know it is probably an obsolete design pattern in a frontier-AI world.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to keep pushing this, we could:\n\n- Sketch a **post-CAPTCHA protocol** for websites that combines cryptographic identity + cost + privacy.  \n- Analyse the **game theory**: how bots, platforms, and users would each respond.  \n- Or design a **minimal-friction scheme** that balances \u201cno arms race\u201d with \u201cno giant surveillance panopticon.\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","request_id":"2358b2c0-ec46-4c33-a556-0095e9297c29","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"afbe6549-876d-4f2b-9e26-6061565f27f2","turn_exchange_id":"1fbfb286-7d43-44f6-a8d1-a2feabdb6684","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"afbe6549-876d-4f2b-9e26-6061565f27f2","children":[]}}}
