Before we get started today, I wanted to ask a favor, and that is: if you would check out my Patreon. I am really hard at work on my book, *The Great Decoupling*, and the only reason that I can do it is because of the support that I get from my audience. So with all that being said, let\u2019s get into today\u2019s video.\n\nWhat has happened, and what inspired this video, is that Nvidia has put in a $20 billion bid to get control of Groq. So Groq, if you\u2019re not familiar with this, is G-R-O-Q, which is a chip manufacturer\u2014not to be confused with Grok, the chatbot from Elon Musk. Now, it is not a purchase. It\u2019s more complicated than that, and once you look into what actually is happening, it\u2019s a little bit more insidious. So let\u2019s take a look.\n\n### The $20 Billion Deal That Isn\u2019t an Acquisition\n\nThe $20 billion deal that isn\u2019t an acquisition: in late 2025, Nvidia announced a landmark deal with AI chip startup Groq. Officially framed as a non-exclusive licensing agreement, its structure was engineered for a precise strategic extraction of assets.\n\nSo here\u2019s what Nvidia actually gets. They get the talent: they get the CEO, they get the president, and other senior leaders. They get the technology, such as a non-exclusive license to the LPU, which is their language processing unit, as well as other IP, which claims that it\u2019s much faster. And then they get the market position: a potential competitor in the specialized inference market is neutralized.\n\nWhat remains with Groq is that the company continues to operate as an independent company under a new CEO. Its Groq Cloud business continues without interruption, and the brand and a minimal corporate structure remain. So Nvidia surgically extracts the core strategic value\u2014the people and the patents\u2014without the regulatory burden or integration overhead of a formal acquisition.\n\nNow, that might seem kind of harmless. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh yeah, Groq gets to continue as it is.\u201d But we\u2019ve seen this playbook before, and here\u2019s basically how it usually plays out.\n\n### The Reverse Acquihire Playbook (and Recent Examples)\n\nSo Nvidia has a $20 billion cash licensing and incentives package to get all of the stuff out of Groq that they want\u2014the core talent and IP\u2014which goes back to Nvidia. And what remains is an investor shell company, which ends up becoming a zombie startup. We\u2019ve seen this before.\n\nSo here are a few examples of what\u2019s kind of being called by some people a reverse acquihire. An acquihire is when you buy a company\u2014it\u2019s a typical merger and acquisition\u2014where you buy the company not for its brand, or not for its technology per se, but because you really want the talent, and/or you don\u2019t want to compete with that talent if they get bought by someone else.\n\nWe have a few examples from the big players\u2014Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Microsoft bought Inflection AI in March 2024. It was a $650 million deal for a non-poaching waiver. The key assets acquired were the co-founders\u2014Mustafa Suleyman, Kar\u00e9n Simonyan (don\u2019t know how to say her name, sorry)\u2014and most of the staff moved to Microsoft. There we go\u2014tripping over my words. I\u2019m trying to speak too fast. I apologize. The outcome: Inflection pivots from consumer AI to a smaller enterprise focus. Investors get back 1.1 to 1.5x of their capital.\n\nIn Google\u2019s case, in August of 2024, it was a $2.7 billion agreement for licensing and a co-founder return. Co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas return to Google. Character AI shifts away from developing LLMs to focus on its consumer platform. The deal is under DOJ probe for avoiding regulatory approval. This is one of the reasons that they do these kinds of structures: to avoid regulators.\n\nFor Amazon, it was an undisclosed amount for licensing and talent\u2014this was where Amazon acquihired Adept. This is another AI company. Co-founder and CEO David Luan and other founders join Amazon. Outcome: Adept pivots from general intelligence to enterprise-focused agentic AI solutions.\n\nSo we\u2019ve seen this before. That\u2019s kind of the long story short.\n\n### Zombie Startups, VC Returns, and the Illusion of Competition\n\nIn every case, they kind of all end up becoming a zombie startup: hollowed out. The core talent, strategic vision, and frontier R&D nucleus are gone. As one VC put it, \u201cFrankly, you hollowed out the organization.\u201d\n\nSo the VCs get their exit because they get a little bit of return on capital, and then the company is forced to pivot to a much smaller, non-threatening niche market to survive. Basically, these big dogs say, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to compete with you in the future, so how can I hamstring you? How can I kneecap you right now and come out on top, and also make sure that one of my competitors doesn\u2019t get you as well?\u201d\n\nInvestors receive a modest return, typically 1 to 1.5x, avoiding a total loss but falling short of the venture returns they sought. When a VC invests, they want 2x, 3x, 7x. Now, of course, many VCs understand that every time they buy into something or invest in something, it\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s going to be a loss. But if they had their money tied up for a few years\u2014in this case, Groq I think was seven years old\u2014and they only get 1x of their money back, that\u2019s seven years of wasted time, because that money would have been better put in, like, literally a savings account, or any index fund.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the last bit is competitive illusion. The fiction of competition is maintained for regulators, but the actual competitive threat the startup once posed has been eliminated.\n\nI did not go into this research thinking it was going to be this bad, but here we are.\n\n### Consolidation in AI Hardware, and the Cerebras Exception\n\nSo the state of the board: an increasingly lonely field. The board is being cleared of independent pieces, primarily through absorption by incumbents playing a long game of consolidation. Nvidia, the dominant player, has 80 to 90% of the data center GPU market, and all these other guys are just now husks. So Groq, husk; SambaNova, husk; Habana Labs, husk.\n\nOne standout is Cerebras. Cerebras is attempting to go public. Rather than get absorbed by a big player, hopefully what might happen is they go IPO\u2014that\u2019s an initial public offering where their stock gets listed. Let\u2019s see how that might turn out in the long run.\n\nFirst and foremost, they have an architectural moat. Their wafer-scale integration, or their wafer-scale engine, solves scaling challenges by building one giant chip the size of a dinner plate, eliminating inter-chip communication bottlenecks. So they put something like two terabytes worth of memory on a single chip. I don\u2019t remember what it is, but it\u2019s insane. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. They figured out some novel chip architecture that is not just another GPU or TPU. It is scaled up to ridiculous proportions.\n\nOne of the things that they serve is sovereign AI and national labs. They have very strong traction with customers who prioritize performance and security over ecosystem breadth, such as Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories. These are not companies\u2014these are departments that host most of America\u2019s biggest supercomputers. They really just want stupidly fast chips that can do whatever they\u2019re trying to do, which is train neural networks or train weather simulation models faster and cheaper. When you put everything onto a single chip, then you get returns on time, you get returns on energy, and it just happens faster.\n\nAnother thing is the CUDA software ocean. CUDA, if you\u2019re not familiar with it, is Nvidia\u2019s proprietary inference stack. This is all of their bindings, all of their optimizations to run artificial intelligence on their GPUs\u2014that\u2019s the long story short. They cannot compete for the general developer market due to Nvidia\u2019s deep, 17-year CUDA software and ecosystem lock-in. Switching costs are measured in millions of dollars and months of engineering time. So Cerebras is not going to try and compete on the developer market, on the consumer market.\n\nAnd then inference as a service: abstracting away the software problem by offering cloud-based access via APIs. Becoming the number one inference provider on Hugging Face bypasses the need for customers to rewrite code. That\u2019s kind of their strategy: just send us your problems on an API, we\u2019ll send you back the results. Anyone can write a REST call. You don\u2019t need to redevelop everything on CUDA. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do. They\u2019re trying to avoid competing directly with Nvidia, which means that they\u2019re just not as big of a threat\u2014at least not on most terms\u2014except the fact that they are an AI accelerator. And Nvidia would rather their stuff be in Argonne, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia rather than Cerebras. But, you know, hey\u2014when it comes down to national security, they just want what\u2019s best.\n\n### Architectural Moat Versus CUDA\u2019s Software Ocean\n\nSo the architectural moat versus a software ocean: this is kind of the primary difference between Cerebras and Nvidia. Cerebras has that architectural moat\u2014this is kind of a mandala version of their chip. If you haven\u2019t seen it, you should look it up. The wafer-scale engine, or the wafer-scale chip, is pretty intense, just how big it is. And each one of them costs something like $2 million. It\u2019s pretty crazy.\n\nThen, of course, CUDA has their ecosystem, their software ecosystem, where TensorFlow and PyTorch and everyone knows how to develop on CUDA. So if you want to use the enterprise-grade GPUs, data center accelerators, you\u2019re using CUDA. That\u2019s all there is to it. There\u2019s no real viable alternative. China is working on a viable alternative, but CUDA\u2014Nvidia has the first-mover advantage by a long shot there. Now, that\u2019s not to say that China will not be able to succeed; it\u2019s just that it takes time to develop a mature ecosystem.\n\n### Unpacking the CUDA Moat and Path Dependency\n\nThe real battlefield is not silicon. Architecturally superior hardware loses to an entrenched software ecosystem almost every time. Interoperability and control over the ecosystem is a gigantic moat. That\u2019s how Microsoft has maintained its software dominance in business software for the last 20 or 30 years. That\u2019s what the big landmark Microsoft antitrust lawsuits were about back in the late \u201990s and early 2000s.\n\nSo unpacking the CUDA moat: I know that \u201cnetwork effects\u201d was duplicated, but this is their defense-in-depth strategy. Hardware: they have high-performance GPUs. They figured that out for graphics. Nvidia replaced Voodoo as the best, you know, most standard consumer graphics cards and high-performance graphics cards years ago. Then they started developing CUDA, also years ago\u2014the programming model. That\u2019s how you get access to all of those primitives that make the GPUs powerful. Then there\u2019s a whole bunch of tools and libraries built on top of it, like PyTorch and TensorFlow, that we already mentioned. And so then you end up with network effects: millions of trained developers, university curricula built around CUDA, vast open-source code bases, and a mature cloud ecosystem.\n\nIt is very, very, very difficult to compete with that, even if you have a superior product. This is what\u2019s called path dependency. Nvidia nailed the path dependency, recognizing it\u2019s not just about having a better chip; it\u2019s about having the usability, the interoperability, and millions of people who just use your stuff by default. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now with GPUs and accelerators.\n\nHonestly, the reason that I wanted to make this video was because I was hoping that we would get more competition, that we would get alternatives\u2014something like an open-source version of CUDA\u2014and better chips and more chips, because more competition in this case will accelerate AI for everyone. Everyone wins if we have more competition, not if we have vendor lock-in where Nvidia controls the majority of the market. They have what\u2019s called a natural monopoly right now.\n\n### How the Game Could Change: Open Source, Antitrust, and Disruption\n\nSo how could the game change? If we want to break lock-in, we need a systemic shift, not just a better chip. Here\u2019s what might happen.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need a credible open-source stack. We need Linux for AI, basically. Projects like Triton and MLIR could abstract the hardware, making chips from different vendors fungible if they achieve critical mass. It remains to be seen. These would need backing from the hyperscalers, the biggest buyers, such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. They don\u2019t want to necessarily have to be completely dependent on Nvidia either. Their business is running cloud servers, which means if they can get the same chips for cheaper, great. But of course, Google has their TPUs. Amazon, I believe, is working on their own accelerators. Microsoft\u2014I mean, they\u2019re kind of in bed with OpenAI. I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m also not sure what Meta is doing. But right now, if they want accelerators, they have to buy it from Nvidia, basically. They could collectively fund and demand an open-source alternative to reduce their dependency and cost, rather than building separate proprietary silicon.\n\nWe have seen this before in other industries. Like the rail industry, for instance: all the competing railroads came together decades ago to standardize all of their signaling, all of their tracks, and everything else. One of the reasons I know this is because I interviewed at one of the companies that they built to standardize all of their rail coordination stuff. It was a company that was literally run and started by all the railroads. Rather than competing with each other, they\u2019re like, \u201cWe need to standardize so that we can cross-communicate.\u201d That\u2019s a third industrial revolution example of what we could do in the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nNext is regulatory intervention. Like a lot of people, I\u2019m not as big a fan of regulatory intervention, because that\u2019s kind of heavy-handed. I would rather see a market solution, which would be a credible open-source stack and hyperscaler coordination. But another option is that antitrust action forces CUDA interoperability, mandates open standards, or blocks future reverse acquihires before they can neutralize competition.\n\nThe thing is, the regulators: if there is a natural monopoly, that\u2019s fine. They understand that that happens. The only thing that\u2019s illegal is trust-like behavior\u2014if you\u2019re trying to build a monopoly, if you\u2019re trying to artificially tip the market in your favor, then that brings antitrust behavior. But if you just have a natural monopoly because the market doesn\u2019t bear competitors\u2014because there are markets out there that naturally tend themselves to natural monopolies\u2014or if you\u2019re the first mover, then that\u2019s the market functioning at its maximum efficiency, according to the theory of regulators. The question is: is the market operating naturally in a natural equilibrium where Nvidia is the natural monopoly? Is that natural market forces\u2014yes or no? And right now, it seems like the answer is yes. With this move with Groq, Nvidia is maintaining the illusion of a competitive, fair market.\n\nNow, the fourth option is architectural disruption: the emergence of a new AI paradigm, such as neuromorphic or optical computing or thermodynamic computing, for which CUDA is ill-suited, forcing a market-wide reset where everyone starts from a new baseline. This is entirely possible. CUDA just happens to have been what was in place that could accelerate the tensor that we wanted, but Nvidia didn\u2019t really know that AI was the specific workload.\n\nAnd of course, anyone who\u2019s a gamer who wants to buy GPUs, it\u2019s like: you can\u2019t get your GPUs. They\u2019re all really expensive because everyone is buying them for AI, and the gamers are not happy about this because there\u2019s a lot more money in AI right now, and the memory and GPUs and all that fun stuff is going away. What this really means, when you have a market that is this asymmetrical, is that there\u2019s a huge opportunity for disruption. So the question then is: who\u2019s going to disrupt the market, and how?\n\nHonestly, I would say that these three solutions\u2014a credible open-source stack, hyperscaler coordination, and architectural disruption\u2014would be ideal. We don\u2019t want to live in a world where the government has to intervene. It\u2019s good if the government can intervene, but we would really rather see the Googles, Amazons, Microsofts, and Metas put their collective thinking caps on and say, \u201cLet\u2019s do something that\u2019s going to unlock a lot of power for the rest of us.\u201d\n\n### The New Reality and Closing\n\nSo, the new reality of the AI hardware chessboard: the reverse acquihire is the new playbook for quiet, effective consolidation in AI, neutralizing threats while minimizing regulatory scrutiny. Number two, the field of independent challengers is shrinking, with most being absorbed, acquired at a discount, or pushed into narrow specialized niches. Number three, Nvidia\u2019s true compounding moat is the CUDA software system. And number four, meaningful competition will only emerge from a systemic challenge to the software lock-in. That is the TL;DR.\n\nThe central question in AI infrastructure has shifted. It\u2019s no longer about who can build the fastest chip. Plenty of people have done that. It\u2019s about who can build or break the ecosystem.\n\nWith all that being said, thanks for watching. Again, if you would please consider supporting me on Patreon, or even here on YouTube\u2014every little bit helps. That\u2019s how I make ends meet, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to get my book about post-labor economics, called *The Great Decoupling*, out there and done.

Nvidia deal a big win for Groq employees and investors","snippet":"Groq, an AI chipmaking startup, has entered into a significant $20 billion non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia, marking a major financial win for its employees and investors. Despite no equity changing hands in the deal, most shareholders in Groq will receive substantial per-share distributions based on the $20 billion valuation. The company, founded in 2016, had raised approximately $3.3 billion in venture capital, with a notable $750 million round this past fall valuing it at nearly $7 billion post-money. The arrangement addresses widespread speculation on social media regarding potential payouts for employees, including those who remain at Groq and those joining Nvidia. The key takeaway: all stakeholders\u2014employees and investors\u2014are set to receive significant financial returns from this unconventional and lucrative agreement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1766885797.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-buy-ai-chip-startup-groq-about-20-billion-cnbc-reports-2025-12-24/","title":"Nvidia, joining Big Tech deal spree, to license Groq technology, hire executives","snippet":"Nvidia has entered a significant strategic deal with AI chip startup Groq, securing a non-exclusive license to its inference chip technology and hiring top executive talent including CEO Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra. Ross, a former Google engineer who initiated its AI chip program, will join Nvidia alongside key engineering team members. While the financial details remain undisclosed, CNBC reported an estimated $20 billion transaction, although Groq maintains it will continue operations as an independent entity under new CEO Simon Edwards.\n\nThis move is part of a broader industry trend where major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia use licensing and executive hires instead of outright acquisitions to acquire talent and technology, potentially sidestepping antitrust scrutiny. Analysts have noted regulatory risks persist, but the non-exclusive structure may help preserve the appearance of competition.\n\nGroq\u2019s technology specializes in inference and uses SRAM-based on-chip memory to bypass global memory shortages, making it a challenger in a space increasingly important as AI trends shift from training to real-time inference. Groq raised its valuation to $6.9 billion in 2024 and is a key competitor to Cerebras Systems, another startup reportedly eyeing a public listing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1766620881.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-agreed-pay-inflection-650-mln-while-hiring-its-staff-information-2024-03-21/","title":"Microsoft pays Inflection $650 mln in licensing deal while ...","snippet":"21 Mar 2024 \u2014 Suleyman will be CEO of the unit, while Simonyan will join as chief scientist.

Ross, a former Google engineer, founded Groq in 2016 to develop high-performance, low-latency chips for AI inference tasks like chatbot responses. The deal enables Nvidia to enhance its \"AI factory\" data center architecture by integrating Groq's processors, expanding support for diverse AI workloads. Despite the leadership exits, Groq will continue operating independently. Previously valued at $6.9 billion with $750 million in recent funding, Groq claims its chips are significantly more energy efficient than Nvidia\u2019s and AMD\u2019s GPUs. This deal aligns with a broader industry trend in which tech giants increasingly license talent and technology instead of acquiring outright, often due to antitrust scrutiny. Nvidia maintains that the partnership underscores a shared goal of broadening access to cost-effective, high-performance AI solutions. The deal also reflects growing competitive pressure as companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google invest in alternative AI chips. Nvidia, despite recent stock fluctuations, has seen a 36% rise in share value this year amid ongoing interest in AI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1766619412.018,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.channelnewsasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/google-faces-doj-probe-over-characterai-deal-bloomberg-law-reports-5147671","title":"Google faces DOJ probe over Character.AI deal ...","snippet":"22 May 2025 \u2014 The U.S. Justice Department is probing whether Alphabet's Google violated antitrust law in its agreement with Character.AI that allows the ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.channelnewsasia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.straitstimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/microsoft-to-pay-inflection-ai-873-million-after-scooping-up-most-of-its-staff","title":"Microsoft to pay Inflection AI $873 million after scooping up ...","snippet":"22 Mar 2024 \u2014 Microsoft stunned the AI world on March 19 with an announcement that it had hired Inflection's co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karen Simonyan.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1711070157.0,"attribution":"www.straitstimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"finance.yahoo.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-agreed-pay-inflection-650-165547758.html","title":"Microsoft pays Inflection $650 million in licensing deal ...","snippet":"21 Mar 2024 \u2014 Microsoft hired Inflection co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karen Simonyan on Tuesday, along with most of the 70-person team at the AI firm ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"finance.yahoo.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-license-groq-technology-20-123939149.html","title":"Nvidia to License Groq Technology in $20 Billion AI Chip ...","snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) has agreed to pay nearly $20 billion to license chip technology from the AI firm Groq.

Arm\u2019s CPUs, which often serve as host chips in AI systems, are valued for their lower power consumption compared to processors from Intel and AMD\u2014making them appealing to energy-intensive data centers. Companies like Nvidia use Arm-based chips such as Grace in their advanced AI hardware. \n\nArm, majority-owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, does not manufacture chips but licenses its chip architecture and intellectual property to firms like Apple, Nvidia, and cloud computing companies. The company earns revenue through licensing fees and royalties. While it previously struggled to penetrate the data center market due to software and hardware transition challenges from x86 architecture, growing support among developers and companies has shifted this trend. Amazon's Arm-based CPUs have already constituted over half of its added data center chip capacity in the past two years, with Google and Microsoft also entering the space with Arm-based chip designs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1743419053.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/26/nvidia-fourth-quarter-earnings-deepseek","title":"Nvidia beats Wall Street expectations in first earnings after DeepSeek's AI debut","snippet":"Nvidia exceeded Wall Street expectations in its fourth-quarter earnings for 2024. The company reported $39.3 billion in revenue, up 78% year-over-year, surpassing analyst forecasts of $38.25 billion. Earnings per share were $0.89, beating the expected $0.84. This marks Nvidia's first earnings release following the debut of China's DeepSeek AI model, which initially rattled markets by demonstrating high performance with lower training costs. Despite concerns this may undercut demand for Nvidia's high-end GPUs, CEO Jensen Huang affirmed robust demand for its Blackwell chips, emphasizing their importance in supporting increasingly compute-intensive reasoning AI.\n\nData center revenue was $35.6 billion, above the predicted $34.09 billion. Nvidia, which holds more than 90% of the GPU market, forecasts $43 billion in revenue for Q1 FY2026. Huang argued that new AI models like DeepSeek actually boost demand for Nvidia's powerful hardware. Though Microsoft\u2019s reported data center lease cancellations raised questions about AI spending sustainability, no immediate impact was seen. Analysts noted Nvidia's dominance remains strong despite rising competition. However, some market reactions were muted, as sky-high expectations had already been priced into Nvidia\u2019s $3.1 trillion valuation. The company is also monitoring potential impacts from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1740612469.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69512f805088832bb5725943fca0838c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Verifying Groq deal and related technology claims","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"0def39b7-068b-4a71-bf34-9597e7e86e1c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"01276860-f7ff-427a-a2c3-fc596292ec50","turn_exchange_id":"105d0e8b-68d4-4a45-8859-a8acf0683b68","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"01276860-f7ff-427a-a2c3-fc596292ec50","children":["76414ebe-cff8-426e-a718-49c5d2d83710"]},"76414ebe-cff8-426e-a718-49c5d2d83710":{"id":"76414ebe-cff8-426e-a718-49c5d2d83710","message":{"id":"76414ebe-cff8-426e-a718-49c5d2d83710","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766928290.896391,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Correcting memory details and finding credible sources","content":"I\u2019ve found that Cerebras has 44GB of on-chip memory, with external memory options up to 1.5TB, not 2TB on-chip as stated by Shapiro.

Speaking at the Future of Global Markets 2025 event hosted by Citadel Securities, Huang revealed this as the first public quantification of Nvidia's retreat from China, a market that once contributed 20\u201325% of its data center revenue. Key products like the A800, H800, and newer H20 GPUs have faced compliance difficulties under these export rules.\n\nHuang criticized the U.S. policy, suggesting it has led to a total loss of access to one of the world's largest markets. Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue had previously surged, hitting over $41 billion, largely driven by AI infrastructure. In response to the restrictions, Chinese tech firms are increasingly transitioning to domestic or alternative hardware solutions, which may have long-term implications for global tech supply and demand.\n\nAlthough Nvidia hopes to re-enter the Chinese market eventually, the company currently anticipates no revenue from China and has adjusted its forecasts accordingly, signaling a significant pivot in its international operations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1760795598.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-stock-gets-price-target-bump-from-citi-on-sovereign-ai-demand-surge-11767497","title":"Nvidia Stock Gets Price Target Bump From Citi on 'Sovereign AI' Demand Surge","snippet":"Citi analysts have raised their price target for Nvidia stock from $180 to $190, driven by surging demand for sovereign artificial intelligence (AI). Sovereign AI, which refers to AI systems developed and controlled by national governments or major entities, is expected to see significant investment over the coming years. Citi projects the AI data center market to reach $563 billion by 2028, up from a previous estimate of $500 billion, largely due to this trend. Nvidia stands to benefit significantly, as it is reportedly involved in nearly all sovereign AI deals globally.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently highlighted multiple sovereign AI partnerships during a European tour, with stops in the UK, France, and Germany.

aims to begin H200 chip shipments to China by mid-February, sources say","snippet":"Nvidia plans to begin shipping its H200 AI chips to China by mid-February 2026, ahead of the Lunar New Year, aiming to meet initial demand with 5,000 to 10,000 chip modules from existing stock\u2014equating to 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips. However, this move depends on Beijing\u2019s approval, which is still pending. Nvidia also intends to expand production capacity, with new orders opening in Q2 2026.\n\nThis development follows a significant U.S. policy shift, as President Trump recently announced that Washington would permit H200 chip exports to China with a 25% tariff. This reverses the previous Biden administration\u2019s ban on advanced AI chips due to national security concerns. Although Nvidia's newer Blackwell and Rubin chips are now prioritized, the H200 remains in demand for AI applications.\n\nChina, striving to enhance its domestic chip capabilities, is cautious about permitting imports. Officials are considering requiring bundled purchases of domestic chips with each H200 order. For major tech firms such as Alibaba and ByteDance, access to the H200 would significantly upgrade their AI capabilities, as the chip offers performance about six times higher than Nvidia's H20, a China-specific variant.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1766406088.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/major-analyst-enterprise-forecasts-ai-market-2025-11-13/","title":"Major analyst and enterprise forecasts on the AI market","snippet":"13 Nov 2025 \u2014 Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said earlier this year the chip giant sees $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1763041783.743,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/nvidia-closes-700-mln-runai-acquisition-after-regulatory-hurdles-2024-12-30/","title":"Nvidia closes $700 mln Run:ai acquisition after regulatory ...","snippet":"30 Dec 2024 \u2014 Nvidia dominates the market for AI graphics processors and commands about 80% of its share.

Custom chips are forecast to grow from 10% to only 15% of the market. Cowen attributes Nvidia's sustained leadership to its superior performance, thanks to a mature suite of integrated hardware, software, and networking capabilities.

lures cofounders from startup Adept to bolster AI efforts","snippet":"Amazon has hired key co-founders and employees from the AI startup Adept, including CEO David Luan, as part of its strategy to strengthen its artificial intelligence capabilities and catch up with competitors like Microsoft and Alphabet. The move mirrors Microsoft's earlier strategy of hiring Inflection AI's leadership. Adept, which has raised over $410 million and is valued at more than $1 billion, will continue to operate independently while Amazon pays a licensing fee to use some of its business automation technologies.\n\nThe newly hired Adept team members will contribute to Amazon\u2019s AI efforts under Rohit Prasad, who oversees its artificial general intelligence (AGI) initiatives. This aligns with Amazon's broader push to develop advanced AI tools, including updating its Alexa assistant with generative AI capabilities. Reuters reports that despite conversations with other tech companies such as Meta, only Amazon secured a deal with Adept. About 20 employees will remain at Adept following the transition. The move highlights Amazon's ambition to compete with leading AI companies and marks a significant organizational shift in its approach to AGI development.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1719620134.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-seeking-details-amazon-deal-with-ai-startup-adept-source-says-2024-07-16/","title":"FTC seeking details on Amazon deal with AI startup Adept, ...","snippet":"16 Jul 2024 \u2014 The US Federal Trade Commission has asked Amazon.com (AMZN.O) to provide more details on its deal to hire top executives and researchers from artificial ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1721133211.72,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-hires-characterai-cofounders-licenses-its-models-information-reports-2024-08-02/","title":"Google hires top talent from startup Character.AI, signs licensing deal","snippet":"Google has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Character.AI, a prominent AI startup, to use its large language model technology.

The company now seeks to focus on enhancing its successful consumer-facing chatbot products, abandoning the costly and competitive race to build frontier AI models. Interim CEO Dominic Perella emphasized that the consumer product division has gained substantial traction, particularly among users aged 13-25, with 20 million monthly active users.\n\nThis strategic pivot echoes a broader trend among smaller AI start-ups like Aleph Alpha, who are finding it financially unfeasible to compete with giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Despite the staff loss, Character.ai retains most of its technology and personnel and plans to continue AI research. The Google deal also enabled the company to buy out early investors and restructure as an employee-owned cooperative, providing financial runway for the next 18 months.

His mother, Megan Garcia, is suing Character.AI and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, alleging the chatbot encouraged suicidal behavior and exchanged sexual messages with her son. Garcia contends the AI was designed to appeal to and manipulate minors, lacking safety measures to intervene or notify authorities or family when users expressed distress.\n\nThis lawsuit emerges after Google paid $2.7 billion in August 2024 to acquire talent and license technology from Character.AI. The founders of Character.AI, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas\u2014former Google engineers\u2014rejoined Google\u2019s DeepMind unit.

The DOJ has not formally accused Google of wrongdoing, and the investigation remains in early stages.\n\nThis comes amid broader legal challenges facing both tech firms. Character.AI is embroiled in a wrongful death lawsuit over its chatbot allegedly contributing to a teenager\u2019s suicide, with a judge recently rejecting the firm\u2019s First Amendment defense. Google, meanwhile, is under legal pressure in two ongoing antitrust cases over its search and advertising dominance, with potential remedies including a breakup of its operations, such as divesting its Chrome browser.\n\nThe probe also raises concerns about \u201cacqui-hire\u201d deals, where big tech firms absorb startups by hiring their teams, potentially stifling future competition.

Nvidia deal a big win for Groq employees and investors","snippet":"Groq, an AI chipmaking startup, has entered into a significant $20 billion non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia, marking a major financial win for its employees and investors. Despite no equity changing hands in the deal, most shareholders in Groq will receive substantial per-share distributions based on the $20 billion valuation. The company, founded in 2016, had raised approximately $3.3 billion in venture capital, with a notable $750 million round this past fall valuing it at nearly $7 billion post-money. The arrangement addresses widespread speculation on social media regarding potential payouts for employees, including those who remain at Groq and those joining Nvidia. The key takeaway: all stakeholders\u2014employees and investors\u2014are set to receive significant financial returns from this unconventional and lucrative agreement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1766885797.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-buy-ai-chip-startup-groq-about-20-billion-cnbc-reports-2025-12-24/","title":"Nvidia, joining Big Tech deal spree, to license Groq technology, hire executives","snippet":"Nvidia has entered a significant strategic deal with AI chip startup Groq, securing a non-exclusive license to its inference chip technology and hiring top executive talent including CEO Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra. Ross, a former Google engineer who initiated its AI chip program, will join Nvidia alongside key engineering team members. While the financial details remain undisclosed, CNBC reported an estimated $20 billion transaction, although Groq maintains it will continue operations as an independent entity under new CEO Simon Edwards.\n\nThis move is part of a broader industry trend where major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia use licensing and executive hires instead of outright acquisitions to acquire talent and technology, potentially sidestepping antitrust scrutiny. Analysts have noted regulatory risks persist, but the non-exclusive structure may help preserve the appearance of competition.\n\nGroq\u2019s technology specializes in inference and uses SRAM-based on-chip memory to bypass global memory shortages, making it a challenger in a space increasingly important as AI trends shift from training to real-time inference. Groq raised its valuation to $6.9 billion in 2024 and is a key competitor to Cerebras Systems, another startup reportedly eyeing a public listing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1766620881.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investors.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-buying-ai-chip-startup-groq-in-record-20-billion-deal/","title":"Nvidia Licenses Groq's AI Chip Tech, Grabs Top Execs In Not-Quite Takeover","snippet":"Nvidia has entered a strategic licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq, securing access to Groq's inference technology and onboarding key personnel, including CEO Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra. This comes amid speculation that Nvidia would fully acquire Groq for approximately $20 billion, though the current arrangement stops short of a full acquisition. Instead, Groq will continue operating independently under new CEO Simon Edwards, with its cloud business notably excluded from the Nvidia deal.\n\nFounded in 2016 by developers of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU), Groq specializes in language processing units (LPUs) for large AI models, positioning itself as a competitor to Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs. Nvidia\u2019s move signals concerns over custom AI chips emerging from rivals like Google. Although precise financial terms were not disclosed, the hybrid structure of the deal may be designed to sidestep potential antitrust scrutiny.\n\nNvidia shares rose 1.5% following the news, reflecting positive market sentiment. Groq had reached a valuation of $6.9 billion just three months prior. The transaction strengthens Nvidia's position amidst intensifying competition in the AI hardware space.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1766761500.0,"attribution":"www.investors.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"alphafusion.substack.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://alphafusion.substack.com/p/microsofts-inflection-ai-transaction","title":"Microsoft's Inflection AI transaction from an Allocator's ...","snippet":"The payout from the licensing arrangement would be about 1.5x for early investors and about 1.1x for later investors.

chip firm Cerebras set to file for US IPO after delay, sources say","snippet":"AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems is reportedly preparing to file for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) as early as next week, with a planned listing in the second quarter of 2026. The Sunnyvale, California-based company, known for its wafer-scale processors used in artificial intelligence, had withdrawn a previous IPO filing in October 2025 after raising over $1 billion at an $8 billion valuation. The withdrawal followed scrutiny from U.S. national security officials related to an investment by UAE-based tech firm G42, which has since been removed as an investor after Cerebras obtained clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The prior IPO delay was reportedly tied to concerns that Middle Eastern firms might facilitate Chinese access to American AI technologies. U.S. IPO activity has remained strong in 2025, raising $46.15 billion amid improving investor sentiment, with expectations of further momentum in 2026. Cerebras competes with AI chip leaders like Nvidia.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1766172137.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cerebras-systems-files-withdraw-us-ipo-2025-10-03/","title":"AI chip firm Cerebras files to withdraw highly anticipated US listing","snippet":"AI chip company Cerebras Systems has officially withdrawn its plan to go public in the United States, despite increasing IPO activity and investor enthusiasm for AI-related stocks. The decision follows the company\u2019s recent successful $1.1 billion fundraising round, led by Fidelity Management & Research and Atreides Management, which valued it at $8.1 billion. The round also included notable investors like Tiger Global, Valor Equity Partners, and 1789 Capital, affiliated with Donald Trump\u2019s son. IPO research firm IPOX noted the withdrawal is strategically motivated due to the recent funding and does not reflect broader market conditions, which remain robust for tech IPOs. Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, California, specializes in high-performance AI chips and systems. Though the firm still intends to go public in the future, a prior IPO attempt was delayed due to a national security review tied to a $335 million investment from Abu Dhabi-based G42.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":1759531273.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-chip-firm-cerebras-raises-11-billion-adds-trump-linked-1789-capital-investor-2025-09-30/","title":"AI chip firm Cerebras raises $1.1 billion, adds Trump-linked 1789 Capital as investor","snippet":"Cerebras Systems, a Silicon Valley startup developing a large-scale AI chip to rival Nvidia, announced it raised $1.1 billion in new funding, bringing its valuation to $8.1 billion.

The investment has since been cleared by the Trump administration. CEO Andrew Feldman confirmed that the company still plans to go public and views the latest funding as a standard step toward an IPO.

Mistral, an open-source AI developer, introduced an app called \"Le Chat\" that claims to respond with 1,000 words per second, making it the fastest AI assistant, surpassing the performance of OpenAI and China's DeepSeek. Cerebras provides the computing power for this breakthrough, specifically for the inference stage\u2014when an AI model serves end-user requests.\n\nThis collaboration marks a milestone for Cerebras, which is among the few challengers to Nvidia in training AI models. CEO Andrew Feldman emphasized that enhancing response accuracy and speed during inference requires substantial computing power, an area where Cerebras is focusing. The company recently filed for an IPO, although it is currently delayed due to U.S. scrutiny over G42\u2019s involvement. Mistral\u2019s move positions it as a strong competitor to other major open-source AI players like Meta Platforms and DeepSeek.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1738894318.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69512f805088832bb5725943fca0838c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Cerebras' ranking and presence on Hugging Face","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"0def39b7-068b-4a71-bf34-9597e7e86e1c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"cdd836d6-75f6-4fc4-b279-f14f074a46af","turn_exchange_id":"105d0e8b-68d4-4a45-8859-a8acf0683b68","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cdd836d6-75f6-4fc4-b279-f14f074a46af","children":["33d9cefc-1e85-4b7d-ba57-032b01d1a2c8"]},"33d9cefc-1e85-4b7d-ba57-032b01d1a2c8":{"id":"33d9cefc-1e85-4b7d-ba57-032b01d1a2c8","message":{"id":"33d9cefc-1e85-4b7d-ba57-032b01d1a2c8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766928355.164795,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing Cerebras and Groq claims","content":"While Cerebras is indeed listed as an inference provider on Hugging Face, claiming to be \"number one\" lacks evidence since there\u2019s no ranking system.

What\u2019s *observable* is: license is **non-exclusive** (so Groq retains the ability to license elsewhere), Groq keeps operating, and GroqCloud continues. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n- He talks as if Nvidia \u201cgets the patents.\u201d A **license** is not the same thing as **owning** intellectual property (IP).

Whether it becomes a husk is **future-contingent**, not established fact.\n\n## 2) The \u201creverse acquihire playbook\u201d: pattern recognition is fair; certainty isn\u2019t\n\nShapiro\u2019s \u201cthis playbook exists\u201d claim is basically right in the sense that Big Tech has recently used **hire + license** structures repeatedly:\n\n- **Microsoft\u2013Inflection (Mar 2024):** Microsoft paid around **$650M** framed as licensing + agreements, while hiring Inflection\u2019s cofounders and much of the team. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **Google\u2013Character.AI (Aug 2024):** Google signed a **non-exclusive license** and rehired Character.AI cofounders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search5\ue201  \n- **Amazon\u2013Adept (Jun 2024):** Amazon hired Adept\u2019s CEO David Luan and other cofounders; Adept stayed independent and Amazon paid a licensing fee for some tech. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue201  \n\nAnd **regulators have noticed**:\n- DOJ has probed Google\u2019s Character.AI agreement (reported May 2025). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- FTC sought more details on Amazon\u2019s Adept arrangement (July 2024). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search4\ue201  \n\nSo: calling these \u201cacquihire-like\u201d is reasonable.\n\n**But Shapiro\u2019s leap** is treating the *existence of the structure* as proof of the *motivation* (\u201ckneecap,\u201d \u201cneutralize threats,\u201d \u201cfiction of competition\u201d) and the *outcome* (\u201czombie startup\u201d)\u2014as if those are invariant.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing from his argument:\n- **Alternative explanations** that fit the same facts:\n  - The startup couldn\u2019t raise enough to keep competing at the frontier (capital intensity, manufacturing constraints, software ecosystem gaps).\n  - The founders/team wanted the distribution power of an incumbent.\n  - The license lets the startup monetize IP while still operating (sometimes a \u201cbest available exit,\u201d not a conspiracy).\n- **Counterexamples / partial counterexamples**: Character.AI, for instance, may be \u201cno longer training frontier models,\u201d but it can still be a big consumer platform (that\u2019s not a \u201ctiny niche\u201d by default). \ue200cite\ue202turn4news40\ue202turn4search5\ue201  \n\nSo the right critical stance is: **Yes, this structure can reduce traditional merger review friction and can reduce competitive pressure.

Reuters has repeatedly cited Nvidia commanding about **~80%** share in the AI chip/GPU market context, and policy reports also describe GPU supply as highly concentrated. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search14\ue202turn3search15\ue201  \n\nWhere his framing gets thin:\n- He collapses \u201cAI compute\u201d into \u201cNvidia GPUs,\u201d but the real competitive map includes:\n  - hyperscaler **application-specific integrated circuits** (ASICs) (Google **Tensor Processing Units** (TPUs), Amazon Trainium/Inferentia, etc.),\n  - AMD\u2019s GPU stack,\n  - inference-specific challengers (like Groq\u2019s pitch),\n  - full system/network integration (Nvidia\u2019s platform advantage is not only CUDA).\n- He also implies \u201cmost others are husks\u201d (SambaNova, Habana, etc.). That\u2019s rhetoric. For example, Habana was acquired by Intel years ago\u2014calling it a \u201chusk\u201d is a judgment, not a factual status report. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n\n## 4) Cerebras: he\u2019s right about the *concept*, wrong on key *details*, and dated on IPO status\n\n**Right, conceptually**\n- Wafer-scale integration reduces a lot of inter-chip communication overhead (within a node) by putting massive compute + on-chip fabric on one wafer-scale device. Cerebras\u2019 WSE-3 specs: **4T transistors, 900k cores, 44GB on-chip SRAM**, plus large external memory options. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- National-lab/sovereign use cases are real; Sandia has publicly discussed deploying CS-3/WSE-3 capabilities, and Cerebras highlights work with US national labs. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search1\ue202turn10search7\ue201  \n\n**Wrong / misleading**\n- \u201cTwo terabytes of memory on a single chip\u201d is not correct. The WSE-3 public spec is **44GB on-chip SRAM**, not terabytes. (They talk about *external memory* in the terabyte range as part of systems/attachments.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- \u201cEach one costs $2 million\u201d may be in the right ballpark for *systems* by rumor/estimates, but pricing is not cleanly standardized/public for \u201ca chip,\u201d and estimates vary by configuration.\n\n**Out of date / incomplete**\n- IPO story: Cerebras **withdrew** its IPO filing in Oct 2025, and Reuters later reported it was preparing to **refile**, targeting a potential 2026 listing timeline. Shapiro\u2019s \u201cattempting to go public\u201d is not crazy, but it omits the withdrawal and the reasons that surfaced around that process. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search10\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n\n**His \u201cbecome #1 inference provider on Hugging Face\u201d claim**\n- Cerebras *is* integrated as a Hugging Face inference provider (real). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search1\ue201  \n- But \u201c#1\u201d is not a substantiated metric in the way he states it\u2014Hugging Face lists multiple providers; there isn\u2019t an obvious public ranking that makes that statement factual rather than aspirational.\n\n## 5) The CUDA moat: largely correct, but he caricatures the alternatives\n\nFirst, define terms:\n- **CUDA** = *Compute Unified Device Architecture*, Nvidia\u2019s GPU programming platform + ecosystem.\n- **Moat** = switching costs + tooling + trained developers + libraries (e.g., cuDNN, TensorRT, NCCL) + deployment maturity.\n\nHe\u2019s right that:\n- The competitive battle is not \u201cjust silicon,\u201d it\u2019s **silicon + software + systems + developers**. Reuters explicitly notes CUDA\u2019s role in Nvidia\u2019s dominance. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue201  \n\nBut he overstates with lines like \u201cthere\u2019s no real viable alternative.\u201d\n- There *are* alternatives (AMD ROCm, SYCL, OpenXLA stacks, etc.). The real claim should be: **no alternative has matched CUDA\u2019s breadth + maturity + mindshare at the same scale**.\n\nAlso: he calls CUDA \u201cNvidia\u2019s proprietary inference stack.\u201d That\u2019s technically sloppy\u2014CUDA is a general GPU compute platform; inference is one major workload.\n\n## 6) His projections: plausible directions, shaky timelines, missing incentive conflicts\n\n### (A) \u201cWe need Linux for AI\u201d via Triton + MLIR\n- **Triton** (kernel programming/compiler tooling) and **MLIR** (*Multi-Level Intermediate Representation*, compiler infrastructure) can help portability, but they are not remotely \u201ca full Linux-equivalent\u201d by themselves.\n- A credible \u201cLinux for AI\u201d needs: stable compiler toolchains, kernel libraries, collective communication, debugging/profiling, runtime scheduling, and tight integration with major frameworks.\n\n**Main missing piece in Shapiro\u2019s optimism:** coordination incentives.\nHyperscalers often *say* they want reduced Nvidia dependency, but they also want **differentiation** and may prefer \u201cour proprietary stack + our ASIC\u201d over a fully commoditized open standard.\n\n### (B) Hyperscaler coordination\nPlausible in principle, but hard in practice:\n- Coordination creates **collective-action** problems (free-riders) and **strategic conflict** (each wants leverage, not neutrality).\n- They may coordinate on *interfaces* and still compete fiercely on *implementations*.\n\n### (C) Antitrust intervention \u201cforcing CUDA interoperability\u201d\nThis is where he\u2019s most hand-wavy.\n- Yes: regulators are scrutinizing these \u201chire + license\u201d arrangements. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn4search4\ue201  \n- But \u201cmandate CUDA interoperability\u201d is a very strong remedy and not the most typical form of antitrust action. Far more likely are narrower conduct remedies, deal challenges, or reporting/approval requirements for certain structures (varies by jurisdiction).\n\n### (D) Architectural disruption: neuromorphic / optical / thermodynamic\nPossible long-run, but he uses it like a near-term escape hatch.\n- These paradigms have *serious* commercialization barriers (manufacturing, error correction, programmability, integration with existing software).\n- A more realistic \u201creset\u201d mechanism in the medium term is less sci-fi: **new model architectures + new training/inference patterns** that favor different memory/interconnect tradeoffs\u2014still likely implemented on GPUs/ASICs.\n\n## 7) Bottom line: how to \u201cgrade\u201d Shapiro\u2019s analysis\n\n**What he gets right**\n- The Groq deal\u2019s broad structure (license + exec/team moves + no acquisition) is real. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n- There is a genuine industry pattern of \u201chire + license\u201d deals, and regulators are scrutinizing them. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn4search4\ue201  \n- Nvidia\u2019s moat is substantially software/ecosystem-driven, not only chip specs. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue201  \n\n**What he gets wrong (or misleading)**\n- Treating \u201cnon-exclusive license\u201d as equivalent to \u201cNvidia gets the patents / core value extracted\u201d (not demonstrated).\n- Overconfident \u201czombie startup\u201d determinism.\n- Technical error on Cerebras memory (GB vs TB). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n\n**What he\u2019s really doing rhetorically**\nHe\u2019s translating a nuanced \u201cincentives + antitrust + ecosystems\u201d story into a morally charged chess narrative (\u201cinsidious,\u201d \u201chollowed out,\u201d \u201cillusion of competition\u201d).

The move highlights Amazon's ambition to compete with leading AI companies and marks a significant organizational shift in its approach to AGI development.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":3105,"end_idx":3124,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/google-faces-doj-probe-over-deal-ai-tech-bloomberg-law-reports-2025-05-22/","https://www.reuters.com/business/google-faces-doj-probe-over-deal-ai-tech-bloomberg-law-reports-2025-05-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/google-faces-doj-probe-over-deal-ai-tech-bloomberg-law-reports-2025-05-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Google faces DOJ probe over Character.AI deal ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/google-faces-doj-probe-over-deal-ai-tech-bloomberg-law-reports-2025-05-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747929433.737,"snippet":"22 May 2025 \u2014 The US Justice Department is probing whether Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google violated antitrust law in its agreement with Character.AI.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search4\ue201","start_idx":3196,"end_idx":3215,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-seeking-details-amazon-deal-with-ai-startup-adept-source-says-2024-07-16/","https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-seeking-details-amazon-deal-with-ai-startup-adept-source-says-2024-07-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-seeking-details-amazon-deal-with-ai-startup-adept-source-says-2024-07-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"FTC seeking details on Amazon deal with AI startup Adept, ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-seeking-details-amazon-deal-with-ai-startup-adept-source-says-2024-07-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1721133211.72,"snippet":"16 Jul 2024 \u2014 The US Federal Trade Commission has asked Amazon.com (AMZN.O) to provide more details on its deal to hire top executives and researchers from artificial ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4news40\ue202turn4search5\ue201","start_idx":4124,"end_idx":4155,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/f2a9b5d4-05fe-4134-b4fe-c24727b85bba","https://www.ft.com/content/f2a9b5d4-05fe-4134-b4fe-c24727b85bba?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-hires-characterai-cofounders-licenses-its-models-information-reports-2024-08-02/","https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-hires-characterai-cofounders-licenses-its-models-information-reports-2024-08-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/f2a9b5d4-05fe-4134-b4fe-c24727b85bba?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Character.ai abandons making AI models after $2.7bn Google deal","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/f2a9b5d4-05fe-4134-b4fe-c24727b85bba?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1727870453.884,"snippet":"Character.ai has shifted its strategy away from developing large language models (LLMs) following a $2.7 billion deal with Google, which included a one-time license for its models and the hiring of 20% of its workforce, including co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas. The company now seeks to focus on enhancing its successful consumer-facing chatbot products, abandoning the costly and competitive race to build frontier AI models. Interim CEO Dominic Perella emphasized that the consumer product division has gained substantial traction, particularly among users aged 13-25, with 20 million monthly active users.\n\nThis strategic pivot echoes a broader trend among smaller AI start-ups like Aleph Alpha, who are finding it financially unfeasible to compete with giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Despite the staff loss, Character.ai retains most of its technology and personnel and plans to continue AI research. The Google deal also enabled the company to buy out early investors and restructure as an employee-owned cooperative, providing financial runway for the next 18 months.

The withdrawal followed scrutiny from U.S. national security officials related to an investment by UAE-based tech firm G42, which has since been removed as an investor after Cerebras obtained clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

major financial win for its employees and investors. Despite no equity changing hands in the deal, most shareholders in Groq will receive substantial per-share distributions based on the $20 billion valuation. The company, founded in 2016, had raised approximately $3.3 billion in venture capital, with a notable $750 million round this past fall valuing it at nearly $7 billion post-money. The arrangement addresses widespread speculation on social media regarding potential payouts for employees, including those who remain at Groq and those joining Nvidia.

Groq specializes in developing chips optimized for artificial intelligence (AI) model processing. Amid growing competition in the AI sector, the startup is shifting its strategy to emphasize cloud-based services for AI developers rather than direct chip sales. Groq aims to have over 100,000 chips deployed by the end of Q1 2025 and plans to scale up to 1.5 million chips by the end of 2025.

Ross, a former Google engineer who initiated its AI chip program, will join Nvidia alongside key engineering team members. While the financial details remain undisclosed, CNBC reported an estimated $20 billion transaction, although Groq maintains it will continue operations as an independent entity under new CEO Simon Edwards.\n\nThis move is part of a broader industry trend where major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia use licensing and executive hires instead of outright acquisitions to acquire talent and technology, potentially sidestepping antitrust scrutiny. Analysts have noted regulatory risks persist, but the non-exclusive structure may help preserve the appearance of competition.\n\nGroq\u2019s technology specializes in inference and uses SRAM-based on-chip memory to bypass global memory shortages, making it a challenger in a space increasingly important as AI trends shift from training to real-time inference. Groq raised its valuation to $6.9 billion in 2024 and is a key competitor to Cerebras Systems, another startup reportedly eyeing a public listing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1766620881.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-chip-startup-groq-valued-28-bln-after-latest-funding-round-2024-08-05/","title":"AI chip startup Groq valued at $2.8 bln after latest funding round","snippet":"AI chip startup Groq has secured $640 million in a Series D funding round, boosting its valuation to $2.8 billion. The investment was led by Cisco Investments, Samsung Catalyst Fund, and BlackRock Private Equity Partners. Based in Silicon Valley and founded by a former Alphabet engineer, Groq develops AI inference chips, which are optimized for executing pre-trained AI models. The company is emerging as a competitor to industry leader Nvidia by offering alternatives amid high demand and limited supply of Nvidia's processors.\n\nPreviously valued at $1.1 billion in 2021, Groq has now introduced support for Meta\u2019s LLaMA model on its chips. The funds will be used to expand its tokens-as-a-service platform, GroqCloud, and integrate more models and features. By Q1 2025, Groq plans to deploy over 108,000 Language Processing Units built by Global Foundries. Additionally, Stuart Pann, formerly of Intel and HP, has joined as COO, while Meta\u2019s AI chief Yann LeCun has been appointed technical adviser.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1722856193.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"finance.yahoo.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-groq-deal-underscores-how-the-ai-chip-giant-uses-its-massive-balance-sheet-to-maintain-dominance-183347248.html","title":"Nvidia's Groq deal underscores how the AI chip giant uses ...","snippet":"17 hours ago \u2014 CNBC reported the agreement to be worth $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest-ever deal.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"finance.yahoo.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GROQ.PVT/","title":"Groq (GROQ.PVT) Valuation, History & News","snippet":"Latest Funding Date Sep 17, 2025; Total Amount Raised 1.8B; Latest Amount Raised 750M; Total Funding Rounds 6; Latest Share Class Series D-3.

Nvidia\u2019s CUDA platform, which supports over 4 million developers, has contributed significantly to its $2.2 trillion valuation by tightly integrating software with its AI chips. The newly formed UXL Foundation seeks to break this dependency by building tools based on Intel\u2019s OneAPI that can run across various chip architectures, not just Nvidia\u2019s. The group intends to finalize technical specifications in 2024 and expand support to cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft Azure. Backed by increasing venture financing\u2014$2 billion in 2023 alone\u2014UXL wants to attract developers to a more open platform. While Nvidia acknowledged the broader innovation in accelerated computing, its entrenched position remains strong due to CUDA\u2019s 15-year integration into AI workflows. Despite the uphill battle, UXL and nearly 100 startups are pushing forward to establish software ecosystems that encourage greater hardware flexibility and competition in AI development.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1711414877.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-buys-ai-software-provider-schedmd-expand-open-source-ai-push-2025-12-15/","title":"Nvidia buys AI software provider SchedMD to expand open-source AI push","snippet":"On December 15, 2025, Nvidia announced its acquisition of AI software firm SchedMD, further bolstering its investment in open-source technology amid rising competition in the artificial intelligence sector. Nvidia, known for its high-performance AI chips and proprietary CUDA software, aims to strengthen its AI ecosystem by integrating SchedMD\u2019s scheduling technology, Slurm\u2014an open-source platform that optimizes the management of large-scale computing jobs within data centers. Despite the acquisition, Nvidia confirmed SchedMD's software will remain open-source, with continued support and development.\n\nSlurm is widely used in generative AI, aiding model training and inference infrastructure. The acquisition follows Nvidia's earlier reveal of a new suite of open-source AI models designed to outperform previous iterations. Founded in 2010 by Morris \"Moe\" Jette and Danny Auble, SchedMD is based in Livermore, California, and employs approximately 40 people. Its clients include companies like CoreWeave and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.

The internal project, named \"TorchTPU,\" aims to address a key obstacle: most AI developers use PyTorch, which traditionally runs optimally on Nvidia GPUs via Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software. Google has historically favored Jax, an internal framework less common among developers outside the company, making it harder for others to adopt TPUs without extra work.\n\nTo accelerate compatibility and adoption, Google is collaborating closely with Meta, the main backer of PyTorch. Meta has a vested interest in optimizing PyTorch for TPUs to cut reliance on Nvidia and reduce inference costs. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the TorchTPU software to widen its appeal.\n\nSince 2022, Google Cloud has increased external access to TPUs, previously reserved mainly for internal use, and is now also selling TPUs directly to customers for local data center deployment. With high AI infrastructure demand, Google hopes this move will challenge Nvidia\u2019s grip by lowering customer transition costs and enhancing TPU usability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1765983773.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"medium.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://medium.com/%40adnanmasood/assessing-the-viability-of-multi-vendor-accelerator-architectures-for-ai-workloads-f2ce336f7dbb","title":"Assessing the Viability of Multi\u2011Vendor Accelerator ...","snippet":"At a high level, ROCm now provides many of the components needed for AI: it has the HIP programming model (allowing code written for CUDA to be ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1764848474.939,"attribution":"medium.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://medium.com/%401kg/nvidia-cuda-vs-amd-rocm-rocm-and-cuda-battle-for-gpu-computing-dominance-fc15ee854295","title":"NVIDIA CUDA vs AMD ROCm","snippet":"ROCm primarily supports AMD GPUs but, through the HIP programming model, can also run on NVIDIA GPUs, offering broader hardware compatibility.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1742762009.021,"attribution":"medium.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://medium.com/%40harshduhan/is-nvidias-cuda-moat-about-to-be-breached-a-small-british-company-holds-the-key-aa5572d10437","title":"Why Every Dollar You Spend on NVIDIA Chips is a Bet ...","snippet":"But Nvidia's dominance isn't just about superior hardware; it's largely built upon a decade-long software lock-in known as CUDA.

The company focuses on enabling applications written with Nvidia's CUDA platform to run on other hardware, such as AMD or Intel chips, thereby addressing the lock-in effect created by Nvidia\u2019s dominant GPU ecosystem. Founded in 2018 by Michael S\u00f8ndergaard, Chris Kitching, Nicholas Tomlinson, and Francois Souchay, the startup's main product, SCALE, allows CUDA applications to operate on non-Nvidia GPUs without modification. While current support is limited to some AMD architectures, future expansion is planned.\n\nSCALE is free for non-commercial use and has collaborations with academic institutions. For commercial applications, Spectral licenses the software to cloud service providers and large enterprises. Unlike previous efforts such as ZLUDA, Spectral employs a distinct source-by-source code compatibility approach, ensuring legal compliance. The funding round, led by Costanoa with participation from Crucible and angel investors, will help accelerate product development, market expansion, and team growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1762784619.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techradar.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techradar.com/pro/brave-or-foolhardy-huawei-takes-the-fight-to-nvidia-cuda-by-making-its-ascend-ai-gpu-software-open-source","title":"Brave or foolhardy?

CUDA has long been criticized for locking developers into Nvidia's ecosystem, limiting cross-platform development. In contrast, Huawei\u2019s CANN offers a more flexible, multi-layered framework, now poised to grow through an open-source community.\n\nHuawei is actively engaging with Chinese AI companies, academia, and partners to contribute to this new ecosystem, aiming to foster a collaborative development environment akin to CUDA\u2019s\u2014though the ecosystem is still in its infancy. This decision also aligns with China's broader strategy for AI self-sufficiency amid U.S. sanctions.\n\nWhile Huawei's Ascend hardware has shown promising benchmarks, real success hinges on the maturity and support of the software environment\u2014particularly for demanding tasks such as large language models. If successful, CANN could emerge as the first serious alternative to CUDA, though Huawei faces a steep challenge in replicating Nvidia\u2019s scale, trust, and ecosystem stability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1754952120.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6951332987d083209180f26800a38608","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing Groq's financial position and competition risks","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"7f7fb2d5-bb55-41aa-bde9-d47e62450884","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5772ff9c-b675-483a-943a-6a799db0251d","turn_exchange_id":"f645c630-8b1d-4e68-b3dd-9d5ca9fc9f96","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5772ff9c-b675-483a-943a-6a799db0251d","children":["5047783f-dd42-4c48-87e7-d7f73f731e8a"]},"5047783f-dd42-4c48-87e7-d7f73f731e8a":{"id":"5047783f-dd42-4c48-87e7-d7f73f731e8a","message":{"id":"5047783f-dd42-4c48-87e7-d7f73f731e8a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766929242.244673,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering critical sources for Groq and NVIDIA analysis","content":"I\u2019ve got sources lined up, including NVIDIA\u2019s annual report and articles on the UXL Foundation and Google\u2019s TorchTPU.

major financial win for its employees and investors. Despite no equity changing hands in the deal, most shareholders in Groq will receive substantial per-share distributions based on the $20 billion valuation. The company, founded in 2016, had raised approximately $3.3 billion in venture capital, with a notable $750 million round this past fall valuing it at nearly $7 billion post-money. The arrangement addresses widespread speculation on social media regarding potential payouts for employees, including those who remain at Groq and those joining Nvidia.

Ross, a former Google engineer who initiated its AI chip program, will join Nvidia alongside key engineering team members. While the financial details remain undisclosed, CNBC reported an estimated $20 billion transaction, although Groq maintains it will continue operations as an independent entity under new CEO Simon Edwards.\n\nThis move is part of a broader industry trend where major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia use licensing and executive hires instead of outright acquisitions to acquire talent and technology, potentially sidestepping antitrust scrutiny. Analysts have noted regulatory risks persist, but the non-exclusive structure may help preserve the appearance of competition.\n\nGroq\u2019s technology specializes in inference and uses SRAM-based on-chip memory to bypass global memory shortages, making it a challenger in a space increasingly important as AI trends shift from training to real-time inference. Groq raised its valuation to $6.9 billion in 2024 and is a key competitor to Cerebras Systems, another startup reportedly eyeing a public listing.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1766620881.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-chip-startup-groq-valued-28-bln-after-latest-funding-round-2024-08-05/","title":"AI chip startup Groq valued at $2.8 bln after latest funding ...","snippet":"5 Aug 2024 \u2014 Semiconductor startup Groq said on Monday it has raised $640 million in a Series D funding round led by Cisco Investments, Samsung Catalyst Fund and BlackRock ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1722855826.687,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-chip-startup-groq-secures-15-billion-commitment-saudi-arabia-2025-02-10/","title":"AI chip startup Groq secures $1.5 billion commitment from ...","snippet":"10 Feb 2025 \u2014 U.S. semiconductor startup Groq said on Monday it has secured a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to expand the delivery of its ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1739206992.843,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-chip-startup-groq-discusses-6-billion-valuation-information-reports-2025-07-09/","title":"AI chip startup Groq discusses $6 billion valuation, The ...","snippet":"9 Jul 2025 \u2014 U.S. semiconductor startup Groq has spoken to investors about raising between $300 million and $500 million at a $6 billion post-investment ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1752102070.553,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/company/globalfoundries-inc/","title":"Globalfoundries Inc","snippet":"Chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries said on Monday it has acquired Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF), a Singapore-based chipmaker that focuses on silicon photonics ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investors.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-groq-ai-tech-licensing-deal/","title":"Nvidia Deal With Groq Called 'Strategic' Amid Rise Of Custom AI Chips","snippet":"Nvidia has entered into a strategic technology licensing agreement with AI startup Groq, signaling a focus shift from AI training to inference. The deal includes the nonexclusive licensing of Groq's inference technology and the hiring of key Groq personnel, including CEO Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra, to help expand the technology at Nvidia. Groq will continue to operate independently, now led by CFO-turned-CEO Simon Edwards, and its cloud service, GroqCloud, will remain operational.\n\nAlthough CNBC had incorrectly reported a full acquisition by Nvidia for $20 billion, the actual deal is a licensing and talent acquisition move, likely designed to avoid antitrust scrutiny. Analysts view the agreement as strategically important, reinforcing Nvidia's dominance in AI. Groq's inference-focused Language Processing Unit (LPU), developed by Ross, complements Nvidia\u2019s GPU-based training tech. Analysts believe this could lead to broader LPU adoption using Nvidia's CUDA tools. Nvidia stock responded positively to the news, and the company maintains strong ratings with price targets up to $275.\n\nOverall, the deal is seen as a defensive and complementary strategy to maintain Nvidia's leadership as AI inference becomes more prominent.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1766783460.0,"attribution":"www.investors.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/groq-execs-to-join-nvidia-as-part-of-ai-chip-licensing-deal-1d155338","title":"Groq execs to join Nvidia as part of AI-chip licensing deal","snippet":"Nvidia has entered a nonexclusive licensing agreement with AI chipmaker Groq, acquiring some of its executive team as part of the deal.

Contrary to earlier CNBC reports claiming Nvidia was acquiring Groq for $20 billion, Groq clarified via a blog post that it remains independent, with its cloud services continuing and CFO Simone Edwards stepping in as CEO.\n\nAnalysts from Bernstein, led by Stacy Rasgon, view the agreement as a strategic move for Nvidia to bolster its position in AI inference, complementing its already strong leadership in AI training. This aligns with Nvidia\u2019s push to expand in increasingly competitive AI sectors. Nvidia\u2019s stock rose 0.8% in premarket trading following the news, contributing to a 40.5% gain in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 17.9% increase.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1766755620.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-reaches-licensing-agreement-with-groq-hires-ai-top-talent-2025-12","title":"In a new deal, Nvidia hires Groq's top engineering talent, including its founder, who built AI chips at Google","snippet":"Nvidia has entered into a licensing agreement with AI hardware startup Groq, acquiring some of its top engineering talent, including founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. As part of the deal, several Groq executives will join Nvidia, while Groq continues operating independently. The agreement, which is non-exclusive and has undisclosed financial terms, is not an acquisition. Groq is known for its Language Processing Unit (LPU), a chip tailored for AI inference tasks, and was recently valued at $6.9 billion after raising $750 million.\n\nRoss, along with Douglas Wightman, previously worked at Google on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which directly compete with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in the AI space. This move reflects a broader trend in Silicon Valley where major tech firms engage in \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 selectively hiring startup talent through licensing or investment deals, rather than full acquisitions. Similar recent deals involved companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft making targeted hires from AI startups, often leaving many employees behind. This showcases a growing emphasis on acquiring specialized talent over entire companies in the AI industry.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1766628295.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"groq.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://groq.com/newsroom/groq-and-nvidia-enter-non-exclusive-inference-technology-licensing-agreement-to-accelerate-ai-inference-at-global-scale","title":"Groq and Nvidia Enter Non-Exclusive Inference ...","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 Today, Groq announced that it has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"groq.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://groq.com/news_press/saudi-arabia-announces-1-5-billion-expansion-to-fuel-ai-powered-economy-with-ai-tech-leader-groq/","title":"Saudi Arabia Announces $1.5 Billion Expansion to Fuel AI ...","snippet":"10 Feb 2025 \u2014 Announced at LEAP 2025, this major agreement advances the Kingdom's position as a global leader in AI computing infrastructure while meeting ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"groq.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://groq.com/blog/saudi-arabia-announces-1-5-billion-expansion-to-fuel-ai-powered-economy-with-groq","title":"Saudi Arabia Announces $1.5 Billion Expansion to Fuel AI ...","snippet":"10 Feb 2025 \u2014 Groq has secured a $1.5 billion commitment from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for expanded delivery of its advanced LPU-based AI inference infrastructure.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"groq.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.rohan-paul.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.rohan-paul.com/p/meta-open-sourced-perception-encoder","title":"\u26a1 Meta open-sourced Perception Encoder Audiovisual (PE ...","snippet":"3 days ago \u2014 ... 108,000 LPUs made by GlobalFoundries by the end of Q1 2025.

Two different questions get conflated:\n\n**A. \u201cHusk\u201d as an independent *hardware challenger* to Nvidia**  \nOn this definition, the risk is **high**. The core reasons are structural:\n- **Founder/CEO and key leaders are gone** (Ross + Madra + others), and in frontier hardware/software, leadership + taste + architecture continuity matter more than people admit. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news39\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- Nvidia now has a **license to Groq\u2019s inference technology**. Even if non-exclusive, that narrows Groq\u2019s differentiation moat: the incumbent can incorporate ideas, integrate tooling, and \u201cmeet you on your own axis.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2news39\ue201  \n- Post-liquidity, Groq\u2019s incentives likely shift toward **operational excellence** (cloud + deployments) rather than the risky multi-year bet of remaining a top-tier chip platform competitor.\n\n**B. \u201cHusk\u201d as a *business that withers into irrelevance***  \nMuch less clear. There are plausible paths where Groq stays meaningfully alive:\n- If GroqCloud has real traction and margins, it can be a durable inference utility even without \u201cowning the whole ecosystem.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- The Saudi commitment suggests demand for non-Nvidia inference infrastructure can exist for geopolitical/security/sovereignty reasons. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search9\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n- The company *just raised* $750M in Sept 2025; regardless of how much was distributed now, that indicates the business had enough momentum to attract large capital recently. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2news38\ue201  \n\n**My critical take:**  \nShapiro\u2019s \u201czombie/husk\u201d prediction is **most defensible** if he means \u201cGroq is no longer a credible long-run platform competitor to Nvidia.\u201d It is **not** defensible as a confident prediction that Groq becomes economically irrelevant\u2014because (i) GroqCloud is an existing revenue channel, (ii) they have sovereign infrastructure tailwinds, and (iii) they may be capitalized well enough to operate for years. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news38\ue202turn2search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## (ii) Challenges to the CUDA moat \u2014 and why \u201csilicon doesn\u2019t matter\u201d is the wrong critique\n\n### First: what CUDA actually is in Nvidia\u2019s value stack\nNvidia itself describes CUDA-X as a layered stack of domain libraries/tools that turns GPU capability into usable accelerated computing (i.e., the \u201cecosystem moat\u201d framing is not fringe; Nvidia sells it that way). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \nReuters has also reported CUDA\u2019s scale (millions of developers) and how competitors are explicitly targeting **software lock-in** rather than trying to out-benchmark Nvidia on raw silicon alone. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search12\ue201  \n\nSo Shapiro is right about **direction**: *platform beats component*.\n\n### The strongest credible challenges to CUDA (and what could make them work)\n\n#### 1) Multi-vendor \u201cwrite once, run anywhere\u201d pushes (standards + foundations)\nA coalition (including Qualcomm, Google, Intel, etc.) has worked on open tooling aimed at weakening CUDA dependence (e.g., UXL Foundation / oneAPI-based approaches). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search12\ue201  \n**Obstacle:** standards don\u2019t win by announcing themselves; they win when they ship performance, debugging, comms libraries, and stable tooling for years.\n\n#### 2) Compiler-level portability via PyTorch 2.x / Triton / IR stacks\nA major structural shift is away from hand-written CUDA kernels toward **compiler-generated kernels** (Triton, Inductor, MLIR-like pipelines). That can, in principle, reduce CUDA-specific code. Research and vendor work are pushing Triton toward more portability. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search13\ue201  \n**Obstacle:** portability that\u2019s *technically possible* is different from portability that preserves *performance, determinism, profiling UX, and deployment simplicity*.\n\n#### 3) ROCm maturation + translation layers\nAMD\u2019s ROCm ecosystem is explicitly chasing API parity; even at the tooling level, HIPIFY support tracks newer CUDA APIs (e.g., ROCm 7 notes). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n**Obstacle:** \u201cit runs\u201d is not \u201cit runs at the same speed with the same reliability across the same workload zoo.\u201d\n\n#### 4) \u201cCompatibility products\u201d that run CUDA code on non-Nvidia hardware\nStartups like Spectral Compute are explicitly trying to let CUDA applications run on other GPUs (a direct attack on lock-in). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news43\ue201  \n**Obstacle:** these face huge engineering scope, plus legal and support questions for enterprise adoption.\n\n#### 5) Hyperscaler vertical stacks that bypass CUDA by changing the developer on-ramp\nGoogle is trying to make TPUs more PyTorch-friendly (\u201cTorchTPU\u201d), working with Meta (PyTorch\u2019s major backer) specifically to reduce switching friction away from Nvidia. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news49\ue201  \n**Obstacle:** even if PyTorch runs well, enterprises still care about migration cost, operator tooling, and ecosystem depth (debuggers, profilers, distributed training/inference maturity).\n\n#### 6) Geopolitical ecosystems building \u201cnot-CUDA\u201d stacks\nHuawei open-sourcing its Ascend toolkit is an example of a parallel ecosystem trying to grow outside Nvidia\u2019s orbit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news46\ue201  \n**Obstacle:** ecosystem maturity takes years, and international trust/supply constraints complicate global adoption.\n\n### Now the critique: \u201csilicon isn\u2019t central\u201d is an overcorrection\nA better statement is:\n\n**Silicon alone is insufficient \u2014 but silicon is still foundational.**\n\nWhy Shapiro\u2019s \u201cnot silicon\u201d framing is too extreme:\n\n1) **CUDA\u2019s dominance is partly an effect of Nvidia hardware being repeatedly the best default.**  \nIf Nvidia\u2019s chips stopped being top-tier on performance-per-dollar/per-watt, the economic incentive to invest in portability layers and alternative ecosystems would spike (and hyperscalers would fund it aggressively).\n\n2) **Modern Nvidia\u2019s \u201chardware\u201d advantage is not just the GPU die.**  \nIt\u2019s *systems*: memory (HBM), interconnect (NVLink/InfiniBand), packaging, and rack-level integration \u2014 plus the software stack that exploits these. Nvidia\u2019s own investor communications emphasize that software acceleration doesn\u2019t automatically happen; CUDA libraries encapsulate Nvidia-engineered algorithms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search23\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n\n3) **Enterprise value = platform rent on scarce, high-performance compute.**  \nIn 2025 Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue growth is repeatedly tied to next-gen platform ramps (e.g., Blackwell) \u2014 i.e., the market is paying for *delivered performance and availability*, not \u201cecosystem vibes\u201d alone. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n\n**My critical stance:**  \n- The **central pillar** of Nvidia\u2019s enterprise value is the *integrated platform* (hardware + systems + software + ecosystem + supply execution).  \n- CUDA is the **force multiplier** and the **switching-cost engine**, but it is not a free-standing asset that survives hardware inferiority.  \n- So Shapiro\u2019s thesis is strongest when reframed as: **\u201cNvidia\u2019s moat is platform lock-in, not benchmark leadership alone.\u201d** When he says \u201csilicon isn\u2019t the battlefield,\u201d that\u2019s rhetorically punchy but analytically misleading.\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Key recent reporting on Groq\u2019s deal economics and the CUDA moat challenge\ue202turn2news38,turn2news39,turn1news49,turn1news40,turn1news43\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2news38\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":262,"end_idx":293,"safe_urls":["https://groq.com/newsroom/groq-raises-750-million-as-inference-demand-surges","https://groq.com/newsroom/groq-raises-750-million-as-inference-demand-surges?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.axios.com/2025/12/28/nvidia-groq-shareholders","https://www.axios.com/2025/12/28/nvidia-groq-shareholders?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/28/nvidia-groq-shareholders?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Scoop: Nvidia deal a big win for Groq employees and investors","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/28/nvidia-groq-shareholders?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1766885797.0,"snippet":"Groq, an AI chipmaking startup, has entered into a significant $20 billion non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia, marking a major financial win for its employees and investors.

While current support is limited to some AMD architectures, future expansion is planned.\n\nSCALE is free for non-commercial use and has collaborations with academic institutions. For commercial applications, Spectral licenses the software to cloud service providers and large enterprises. Unlike previous efforts such as ZLUDA, Spectral employs a distinct source-by-source code compatibility approach, ensuring legal compliance.

The internal project, named \"TorchTPU,\" aims to address a key obstacle: most AI developers use PyTorch, which traditionally runs optimally on Nvidia GPUs via Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software. Google has historically favored Jax, an internal framework less common among developers outside the company, making it harder for others to adopt TPUs without extra work.\n\nTo accelerate compatibility and adoption, Google is collaborating closely with Meta, the main backer of PyTorch. Meta has a vested interest in optimizing PyTorch for TPUs to cut reliance on Nvidia and reduce inference costs. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the TorchTPU software to widen its appeal.\n\nSince 2022, Google Cloud has increased external access to TPUs, previously reserved mainly for internal use, and is now also selling TPUs directly to customers for local data center deployment. With high AI infrastructure demand, Google hopes this move will challenge Nvidia\u2019s grip by lowering customer transition costs and enhancing TPU usability.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news46\ue201","start_idx":7935,"end_idx":7953,"safe_urls":["https://www.techradar.com/pro/brave-or-foolhardy-huawei-takes-the-fight-to-nvidia-cuda-by-making-its-ascend-ai-gpu-software-open-source","https://www.techradar.com/pro/brave-or-foolhardy-huawei-takes-the-fight-to-nvidia-cuda-by-making-its-ascend-ai-gpu-software-open-source?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/brave-or-foolhardy-huawei-takes-the-fight-to-nvidia-cuda-by-making-its-ascend-ai-gpu-software-open-source?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Brave or foolhardy?

In contrast, Huawei\u2019s CANN offers a more flexible, multi-layered framework, now poised to grow through an open-source community.\n\nHuawei is actively engaging with Chinese AI companies, academia, and partners to contribute to this new ecosystem, aiming to foster a collaborative development environment akin to CUDA\u2019s\u2014though the ecosystem is still in its infancy. This decision also aligns with China's broader strategy for AI self-sufficiency amid U.S. sanctions.\n\nWhile Huawei's Ascend hardware has shown promising benchmarks, real success hinges on the maturity and support of the software environment\u2014particularly for demanding tasks such as large language models. If successful, CANN could emerge as the first serious alternative to CUDA, though Huawei faces a steep challenge in replicating Nvidia\u2019s scale, trust, and ecosystem stability.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"TechRadar"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search23\ue202turn1search4\ue201","start_idx":8990,"end_idx":9023,"safe_urls":["https://images.nvidia.com/pdf/Annual-NVIDIA-CEO-Letter-2025.pdf?linkId=100000365055773","https://images.nvidia.com/pdf/Annual-NVIDIA-CEO-Letter-2025.pdf?linkId=100000365055773&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_presentations/2025/08/Q226-NVDA-Company-Overview-Final.pdf","https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_presentations/2025/08/Q226-NVDA-Company-Overview-Final.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([S201](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_presentations/2025/08/Q226-NVDA-Company-Overview-Final.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"August 2025","url":"https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_presentations/2025/08/Q226-NVDA-Company-Overview-Final.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Software is not automatically accelerated in the presence of a GPU or accelerator.
