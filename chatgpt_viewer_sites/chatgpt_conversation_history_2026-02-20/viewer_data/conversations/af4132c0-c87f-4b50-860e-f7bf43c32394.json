In Markdown, we can use bullet points for each item and use bold text to emphasize the field names and italic text for the types.

The cell will be highlighted, indicating that it is selected.\n\n2. **Enter Edit Mode**: \n   - If the cell is not already in edit mode, you can enter edit mode by either double-clicking on the cell or by selecting the cell and pressing `Enter`. This will open the cell for editing, allowing you to make changes to the text.\n   \n3. **Edit the Markdown Text**: Once in edit mode, you'll see the Markdown text as plain text. You can now add, delete, or modify the content as needed. You can use Markdown syntax to format the text, add links, images, bullet points, etc.\n\n4. **Preview the Markdown**: \n   - To preview the Markdown cell after editing, press `Shift + Enter` to run the cell. This will exit the edit mode and render the Markdown text as formatted HTML. \n   - Alternatively, you can also use the toolbar at the top of the Jupyter Notebook interface. After selecting the cell and making your edits, click on the \"Run\" button (looks like a play button) in the toolbar to render the Markdown.\n\n5. **Making Further Edits**:\n   - If you need to make further edits after previewing the Markdown, simply double-click the cell again or select it and press `Enter` to go back into edit mode.\n\nRemember, Markdown cells in Jupyter Notebooks are used for adding explanatory text, headings, links, images, and even LaTeX equations to complement the code in the code cells. This makes your notebook more readable and informative, especially when sharing your work with others."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","parent_id":"aaa22d09-d0c5-43fe-89e1-737a9003499c","request_id":"85ec9fb939f4468b-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa22d09-d0c5-43fe-89e1-737a9003499c","children":["aaa20cc2-01a7-497f-8402-e1ac60a26b6f"]},"aaa20cc2-01a7-497f-8402-e1ac60a26b6f":{"id":"aaa20cc2-01a7-497f-8402-e1ac60a26b6f","message":{"id":"aaa20cc2-01a7-497f-8402-e1ac60a26b6f","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1709500484.915822,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I would like the markdown text to simply given the variable followed by the description in the form Age: Age of the Patient"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"85eca34d69555fcf-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"435b6a9e-3019-4a5c-ab0b-69ab6282e6d1","children":["6da2cf52-a9f4-4f7a-ae2e-a2ddcc5265e0"]},"6da2cf52-a9f4-4f7a-ae2e-a2ddcc5265e0":{"id":"6da2cf52-a9f4-4f7a-ae2e-a2ddcc5265e0","message":{"id":"6da2cf52-a9f4-4f7a-ae2e-a2ddcc5265e0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1709500501.629296,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["To format your YAML-formatted text into a simplified Markdown format with just the variable name followed by its description, you can follow this straightforward structure.
