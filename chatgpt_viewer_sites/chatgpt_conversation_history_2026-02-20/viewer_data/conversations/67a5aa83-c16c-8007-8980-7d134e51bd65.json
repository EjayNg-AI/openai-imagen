Mdm Ho says: Finally had a chance to dig into DeepSeek\u2019s \u2026 \nLet me break down why DeepSeek's AI innovations are blowing people's minds (and possibly threatening Nvidia's $2T market cap) in simple terms.\r\nFirst, some context: Right now, training top AI models is INSANELY expensive. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. spend $100M+ just on compute. They need massive data centers with thousands of $40K GPUs. It's like needing a whole power plant to run a factory.\r\nDeepSeek just showed up and said \"LOL what if we did this for $5M instead?\" And they didn't just talk - they actually DID it.  Their models match or beat GPT-4 and Claude on many tasks. The AI world is (as my teenagers say) shook.\r\nHow? They rethought everything from the ground up. Traditional AI is like writing every number with 32 decimal places. DeepSeek was like \"what if we just used 8? It's still accurate enough!\" Boom - 75% less memory needed.\r\nThen there's their \"multi-token\" system. Normal AI reads like a first-grader: \"The... cat... sat...\" DeepSeek reads in whole phrases at once. 2x faster, 90% as accurate. When you're processing billions of words, this MATTERS.\r\nBut here's the really clever bit: They built an \"expert system.\" Instead of one massive AI trying to know everything (like having one person be a doctor, lawyer, AND engineer), they have specialized experts that only wake up when needed.\r\nTraditional models? All 1.8 trillion parameters active ALL THE TIME. DeepSeek? 671B total but only 37B active at once. It's like having a huge team but only calling in the experts you actually need for each task.\r\nThe results are mind-blowing:\r\n- Training cost: $100M \u2192 $5M\r\n- GPUs needed: 100,000 \u2192 2,000\r\n- API costs: 95% cheaper\r\n- Can run on gaming GPUs instead of data center hardware\r\n\"But wait,\" you might say, \"there must be a catch!\" That's the wild part - it's all open source. Anyone can check their work. The code is public. The technical papers explain everything. It's not magic, just incredibly clever engineering.\r\nWhy does this matter? Because it breaks the model of \"only huge tech companies can play in AI.\" You don't need a billion-dollar data center anymore. A few good GPUs might do it.\r\nFor Nvidia, this is scary. Their entire business model is built on selling super expensive GPUs with 90% margins. If everyone can suddenly do AI with regular gaming GPUs... well, you see the problem.\r\nAnd here's the kicker: DeepSeek did this with a team of <200 people. Meanwhile, Meta has teams where the compensation alone exceeds DeepSeek's entire training budget... and their models aren't as good.\r\nThis is a classic disruption story:  Incumbents optimize existing processes, while disruptors rethink the fundamental approach. DeepSeek asked \"what if we just did this smarter instead of throwing more hardware at it?\"\r\nThe implications are huge:\r\n- AI development becomes more accessible\r\n- Competition increases dramatically\r\n- The \"moats\" of big tech companies look more like puddles\r\n- Hardware requirements (and costs) plummet\r\nOf course, giants like OpenAI and Anthropic won't stand still. They're probably already implementing these innovations. But the efficiency genie is out of the bottle - there's no going back to the \"just throw more GPUs at it\" approach.\r\nFinal thought: This feels like one of those moments we'll look back on as an inflection point. Like when PCs made mainframes less relevant, or when cloud computing changed everything.\r\nAI is about to become a lot more accessible, and a lot less expensive. The question isn't if this will disrupt the current players, but how fast?  One of the reasons of market fall across the globe."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"90e161568d4edd7b-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2f572692-9a0d-444e-9c7b-a5c0686dbf80","children":["2435d5d5-ed4b-4de7-ac9e-dc192dc300b3"]},"2435d5d5-ed4b-4de7-ac9e-dc192dc300b3":{"id":"2435d5d5-ed4b-4de7-ac9e-dc192dc300b3","message":{"id":"2435d5d5-ed4b-4de7-ac9e-dc192dc300b3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738910350.905397,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"858d6276-ac99-4417-8b90-6e33a7108b5c","request_id":"90e161568d4edd7b-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"858d6276-ac99-4417-8b90-6e33a7108b5c","children":["f44e8de5-ab32-450e-ace8-2b44fe802974"]},"f44e8de5-ab32-450e-ace8-2b44fe802974":{"id":"f44e8de5-ab32-450e-ace8-2b44fe802974","message":{"id":"f44e8de5-ab32-450e-ace8-2b44fe802974","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738910350.905511,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"search()"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002,200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"2435d5d5-ed4b-4de7-ac9e-dc192dc300b3","request_id":"90e161568d4edd7b-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web","channel":null},"parent":"2435d5d5-ed4b-4de7-ac9e-dc192dc300b3","children":["2b443520-740e-40cb-8ddb-aed6e0d86acb"]},"2b443520-740e-40cb-8ddb-aed6e0d86acb":{"id":"2b443520-740e-40cb-8ddb-aed6e0d86acb","message":{"id":"2b443520-740e-40cb-8ddb-aed6e0d86acb","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web","metadata":{}},"create_time":1738910350.905573,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":""},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"search","status":"finished","is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"f44e8de5-ab32-450e-ace8-2b44fe802974","request_id":"90e161568d4edd7b-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"assistant","channel":null},"parent":"f44e8de5-ab32-450e-ace8-2b44fe802974","children":["4c7acee2-73c3-4e2a-80b9-a4e0e21b1d4f"]},"4c7acee2-73c3-4e2a-80b9-a4e0e21b1d4f":{"id":"4c7acee2-73c3-4e2a-80b9-a4e0e21b1d4f","message":{"id":"4c7acee2-73c3-4e2a-80b9-a4e0e21b1d4f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1738910350.905632,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\ue203DeepSeek,

**Summary of Mdm Ho Ching's Views on DeepSeek's AI Innovations**\n\nMdm Ho Ching provides a compelling analysis of DeepSeek's AI breakthroughs, emphasizing their disruptive potential in the artificial intelligence industry. Her key points include:\n\n1. **Radical Cost Reduction**  \n   - Traditional AI training (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) is extremely expensive, often exceeding $100M in compute costs.  \n   - DeepSeek has managed to train competitive models for just **$5M**, an astonishing 95% reduction.  \n\n2. **Technical Innovations**  \n   - **Lower Precision Computation:** Instead of using high-precision (32-bit) computations, DeepSeek leverages lower-precision (8-bit), slashing memory usage.  \n   - **Multi-Token Processing:** Their models process entire phrases at once instead of single tokens, boosting efficiency.  \n   - **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture:** Unlike monolithic AI models where all parameters are always active, DeepSeek activates only relevant sub-networks (e.g., only **37B parameters** active out of **671B**).  \n\n3. **Market Disruption & Nvidia\u2019s Vulnerability**  \n   - If AI can be run on cheaper hardware (including gaming GPUs), **Nvidia\u2019s dominance and high-margin business model could be under threat**.  \n   - **API costs drop by 95%**, making AI much more accessible.  \n\n4. **Open-Source Approach**  \n   - DeepSeek's work is public and open-source, allowing transparency, scrutiny, and broad adoption.  \n   - This **breaks the monopoly** of large tech firms like OpenAI and Google, enabling **smaller players to enter the AI space**.  \n\n5. **Historical Parallels & Industry Shifts**  \n   - Compares this moment to past technological revolutions (e.g., **PCs vs. mainframes, cloud computing vs. traditional servers**).  \n   - Predicts a shift from hardware-intensive AI development to **smarter, optimized software-driven models**.  \n\n6. **AI Democratization & Competition**  \n   - AI will **no longer be limited to billion-dollar companies**.  \n   - More players in the AI space = **more innovation, lower costs, and faster progress**.  \n   - **OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google will need to adapt quickly**, or risk falling behind.  \n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Mdm Ho Ching\u2019s Views**\n\nMdm Ho Ching's take on DeepSeek is insightful, highlighting the efficiency breakthroughs and their disruptive impact on AI economics. However, her analysis can be examined through **four key lenses**:\n\n#### **1. Technical Validity**\n\u2705 **Accurate:**  \n- **Lower-precision arithmetic (8-bit)** and **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architectures are well-known efficiency improvements.  \n- **Multi-token processing** is a promising optimization that speeds up inference.  \n\n\u26a0 **Potential Oversimplifications:**  \n- **Not all tasks can tolerate low precision**\u2014some complex reasoning tasks require high-precision computation.  \n- MoE models are **not new** (Google\u2019s Switch Transformers, Anthropic\u2019s Claude) but still face challenges, including **training instability and inference inefficiencies**.  \n\n#### **2. Economic & Market Impact**\n\u2705 **DeepSeek challenges Nvidia\u2019s dominance**  \n- If AI can run on cheaper, off-the-shelf gaming GPUs, Nvidia\u2019s high-margin business model could **erode significantly**.  \n- **Cloud providers and AI startups** may start shifting towards DeepSeek\u2019s efficiency-driven approach.  \n\n\u26a0 **But Nvidia is still ahead**  \n- **Hardware remains a bottleneck**\u2014even DeepSeek still needs **2,000 GPUs** for training.  \n- Nvidia is already investing in **low-precision optimizations (FP8, TensorRT, Grace Hopper chips)** to stay competitive.  \n\n#### **3.
