That is, from `./`, execute `cd src`, and run `python main.py`.\r\n\r\n- The database will be downloaded and saved if that has not yet been done, and the pipeline will process the data. The machine learning modles developed during training will then be saved in the `src/` folder. If run using Github Actions, any files saved, including the database and model files, will only be transient.\r\n\r\n# Objective of this Project\r\n\r\nThis aim of this project is to develop machine learning models for lung cancer prediction, based on a dataset containing patient data from Singapore public hospitals.\r\n\r\n# Components of the project\r\n\r\nThe project consists of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as well as an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.\r\n\r\nAs a first step in the machine learning pipeline, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study and visualize the impact that factors such as age, smoking habits, and exposure to air pollution have on the occurrence of lung cancer in patients. This will be useful for assisting us in determining which covariates are suitable for inclusion into a machine learning model. The EDA is saved in `./eda.ipynb`\r\n\r\nThe end to end machine learning pipeline is developed and saved in this Github repository.\r\n\r\n# Pipeline execution\r\n\r\nThe project first performs data preprocessing and cleaning. Then machine learning models are executed using the configuration settings is `./config.yaml`. \r\n\r\nEach model specified by the config file is trained in turn. Currently, the config file specifies that XGBoost, CatBoost, and RandomForest models be developed.\r\n\r\nThe pipeline uses `scikit-learn`'s `GridSearchCV` to train each model, performing a hyperparamter grid search with cross-validation during the training process. The cross-validation approach employed prevents data leakage by separating the training and test data for every cross-validation fold. \r\n\r\nAfter training is completed, the best performing model is saved in the `./src/` directory. The model files can be extracted and later re-used for prediction tasks by running the pipeline locally.\r\n\r\nDuring the pipeline execution process, the characteristics of the best performing model for each machine learning method, and the filename in which the model is saved, is outputted to the console.\r\n\r\n# Overview of key EDA findings\r\n\r\n## Variables that were not statistically significant\r\n\r\nSome covariates were not statistically significant as measured by the p-values of their correlation measures as well as their statistical tests such as the chi-square test of association. These variables included Age (which is surprising, because Age is usually a determinant of chronic health conditions), Frequency of Tiredness, Dominant Hand, and both the Smoking metrics (which again is a surprise becasue traditional wisdom dictates that smokers generally are more at risk of developing health conditions).  \r\n\r\n## Variables that were statistically significant\r\n\r\nBeing of the female gender, the presence of COPD History, having the Genetic Markers for cancer, having higher exposure to air pollution, and having taken bronchodilators was found to increase the risk of lung cancer. However, the Risk Ratio measures for some of these variables was near 1, suggesting at least that by this metric, the risk between groups are almost identical. These groups included COPD history and taking bronchodilators.\r\n\r\nThe weight metrics were also statistically significant, but in a very surprising way. It was strongly statistically significant that people of lower current weight, and people who had lost weight, were more likely to develop lung cancer than those of higher current weight, or those who had gained weight.\r\n\r\n# Impact of EDA findings on training pipeline\r\n\r\nAs a result of the EDA findings, it was decided to remove Age and Dominant Hand as they were weakly correlated with the outcome. However, even though the smoking metrics and frequency of tiredness were also weakly correlated, they were not removed from the model training process because medical science has so far, to the best of my knowledge, maintained these as contributors or as indicators of chronic health conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the strange negative correlation between smoking and lung cancer risk was noted, it was decided to retain the smoking metrics in model training because smoking is also traditionally regarded as a contributing factor to both short and long term respiratory ailments including lung cancer. \r\n\r\n# How input features are processed prior to model training\r\n\r\nThese processing operations are carried out prior to model training.\r\n\r\n| Variable       | Processing Method | Remark |\r\n|----------------|----------------|----------------|\r\n| **ID** | Column Removed |  |\r\n| **Age** | Column Removed |  |\r\n| **Gender** | Turned to lowercase | nan entries deleted |\r\n| **COPD History** | Assume \"No\" if blank |  |\r\n| **Genetic Markers** | NIL |  |\r\n| **Air Pollution Exposure** | Row deleted if blank |  |\r\n| **Last Weight** | Column Removed | Replaced with Weight Changed |\r\n| **Current Weight** | NIL |  |\r\n| **Start Smoking** | Column Removed | Replaced with Smoking Duration |\r\n| **Stop Smoking** | Column Removed | Replaced with Smoking Quotient |\r\n| **Taken Broncodilators** | Assume \"No\" if blank | |\r\n| **Frequency of Tiredness** | NIL | |\r\n| **Dominant Hand** | Column Removed ||\r\n| **Lung Cancer Occurrence** | NIL | Dependent Variable |\r\n\r\nThe new variable \"Smoking Quotient\" is calculated from the Smoking Duration and the number of years since the patient quit. It is designed to be close to 1 if the patient has smoked for a long time, and close to 0 if the patient has quit for a long time.\r\n\r\n# Evaluations of Models\r\n\r\nThe metric of choice to train all models was the Recall metric, because we seek to minimize the occurrence of false negatives. False negatives in this scenario refer to wrongly concluding a person will not develop lung cancer when in fact he will. In the healthcare setting, this is a key scenario to avoid as the cost to the patient and to the healthcare system will far exceed the cost of false positives.\r\n\r\nThe models were optimized using the recall metric, and the AUC metric was then examined. The AUC metric is of particular importance in binary classification tasks such as this as it is a metric that is threshold and scale invariant (meaning that it is not dependent on the threshold probability of deciding the binary outcome, and also it is unchanged under scale transformations which compress a continuous variable into a fixed interval). The AUC metric is thus the most generalizable metric for binary classification tasks.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the best performing model was XGBoost, with Recall of 0.9889 and AUC of 0.7404. Since the AUC of XGBoost was not very far off from the other models, and it was the best model in terms of Recall, so it is recommended that the XGBoost model be used with these hyperparameters:\r\n\r\n- colsample_bytree': 1.0, \r\n\r\n- 'gamma': 0.5, \r\n\r\n- 'learning_rate': 0.01, \r\n\r\n- 'max_depth': 3, \r\n\r\n- 'min_child_weight': 1, \r\n\r\n- 'n_estimators': 100, \r\n\r\n- 'subsample': 1.0\r\n\r\n# \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"9382eaee1c07a3ee-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"90dc159a-8f1d-46ac-9244-de3c83db30da","children":["e98940a8-c68a-4a67-99bb-f48087bd1ee5"]},"e98940a8-c68a-4a67-99bb-f48087bd1ee5":{"id":"e98940a8-c68a-4a67-99bb-f48087bd1ee5","message":{"id":"e98940a8-c68a-4a67-99bb-f48087bd1ee5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745972892.438297,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Your README is detailed, logically structured, and reflects clear technical insight\u2014especially commendable for a first technical assessment.
