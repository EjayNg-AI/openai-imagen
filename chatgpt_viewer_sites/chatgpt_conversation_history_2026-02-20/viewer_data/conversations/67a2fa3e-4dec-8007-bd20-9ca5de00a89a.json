His governance has been defined by a hawkish approach to security, assertive international diplomacy, and a hardline stance on the Palestinian conflict. Below is an analysis of Netanyahu\u2019s political beliefs, policy actions, and overall philosophy in three key areas \u2013 **Security and Defense**, **International Relations**, and **Conflict with Gaza and the Broader Middle East** \u2013 followed by an overview of domestic critiques and internal divisions. The discussion is fact-based and neutral, incorporating perspectives from across Israel\u2019s political spectrum, with references to credible sources.\n\n## 1. Security and Defense Policy under Netanyahu (2009\u2013Present)  \nNetanyahu\u2019s core political philosophy centers on ensuring Israel\u2019s security through strength, deterrence, and technological superiority. A former special forces soldier, he views national security as the paramount duty of government. In a national security strategy document he authored, Netanyahu asserted that Israel\u2019s security rests on **\u201cfour main pillars\u201d**: robust military power (deterrence, early warning, strong defensive and offensive capabilities), economic strength, resilient political alliances, and the \u201csocial and spiritual\u201d fortitude of Israeli society\u301013\u2020L260-L268\u3011\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011. This reflects his belief that military might and national morale are essential to survival in a hostile region. He has described threats like a nuclear-armed Iran as **\u201cthe greatest threat to Israeli security and world peace,\u201d** urging international action to neutralize such dangers\u301047\u2020L450-L458\u3011. \n\n**Military Strategy and Defense Initiatives:**  Netanyahu has consistently prioritized defense spending and military modernization. Under his watch, Israel deployed advanced anti-missile systems (notably the Iron Dome in 2011) and built sophisticated border barriers to protect civilians from rockets, missiles, and infiltrations\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011. He emphasizes maintaining a qualitative military edge through technology, intelligence, and air power, while also improving ground capabilities (e.g. drones, cyber warfare, tunnel detection)\u301013\u2020L279-L288\u3011\u301013\u2020L289-L297\u3011. Defense budgets remained high throughout his tenure, and in 2016 his government secured a landmark $38\u00a0billion U.S. military aid package to upgrade fighter jets, improve army mobility, and strengthen missile defenses \u2013 the largest such aid deal in U.S. history\u301042\u2020L161-L169\u3011. Despite friction with the Obama administration, Netanyahu agreed to this decade-long aid framework, which underscored the continuity of U.S.-Israel security ties\u301042\u2020L179-L187\u3011. \n\n**Counterterrorism and Military Operations:**  Netanyahu\u2019s strategy against terrorism and hostile militants is unapologetically forceful. He has endorsed targeted killings of terrorist leaders and clandestine operations abroad to preempt threats. For example, Israeli forces (reportedly with Netanyahu\u2019s approval) conducted numerous airstrikes in Syria to interdict Iranian weapons bound for Hezbollah, all while avoiding clashes with Russian forces through careful coordination\u301038\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u301038\u2020L171-L179\u3011. Major military operations have been a hallmark of his tenure, especially involving Hamas in Gaza. Notable campaigns include **Operation Pillar of Defense (2012)** and **Operation Protective Edge (2014)**. In July 2014, after Hamas\u2019s escalating rocket fire, Netanyahu ordered a large-scale offensive in Gaza; after 50 days of intense fighting, he declared that Hamas\u2019s rocket-launching capabilities were severely degraded\u301026\u2020L480-L488\u3011. However, that war also incurred a high human cost \u2013 over 2,000 Palestinians were killed \u2013 drawing international criticism for the scale of Palestinian civilian casualties\u301026\u2020L480-L488\u3011. Netanyahu defended the campaign as a necessary self-defense measure and pointed to Hamas\u2019s tactics (operating within civilian areas) as the cause of the tragic toll. \n\nThroughout his leadership, Netanyahu\u2019s **doctrine has been one of deterrence and \u201cconflict management.\u201d** He has often opted for **punitive but limited military operations** rather than full-scale wars of conquest. Israeli officials under Netanyahu spoke of \u201c**mowing the lawn**\u201d \u2013 periodic strikes to weaken Hamas and other terror groups, without reoccupying Gaza\u301014\u2020L114-L122\u3011. This approach aimed to buy periods of calm through shows of force, accepting that absolute victory over militant groups might be unachievable or too costly. For instance, Netanyahu resisted calls by hawks to topple Hamas rule in Gaza, arguing that reoccupying Gaza would entangle Israel in a quagmire and incur heavy casualties\u301014\u2020L85-L94\u3011\u301014\u2020L95-L104\u3011. Instead, his governments combined military pressure with economic incentives (such as allowing Qatar to deliver aid money into Gaza) to maintain a fragile calm\u301014\u2020L114-L122\u3011. This **pragmatic yet hardline stance** \u2013 hitting terrorists hard but stopping short of regime change \u2013 underscores Netanyahu\u2019s overall philosophy: security is to be relentlessly pursued, but with calculated caution to avoid strategic overreach.\n\n**Defense Spending and Military Preparedness:**  Under Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s defense budget has grown substantially to address evolving threats. Even before the 2023 Gaza war, annual defense spending was about $20 billion (over 5% of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world) and is set to increase further\u301024\u2020L33-L36\u3011. Netanyahu justifies high defense outlays as the cost of safeguarding Israel\u2019s existence in a volatile region. Investments have gone into multi-layered missile defense (Arrow, David\u2019s Sling, Iron Dome), offensive capabilities (advanced fighter jets, cyber units), and fortifications (the Gaza border barrier, upgraded security fences). He frequently highlights the **\u201cforce multiplier\u201d** effect of technological superiority \u2013 for example, the Iron Dome system intercepted hundreds of rockets from Gaza, saving civilian lives and preventing larger wars\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011. Netanyahu also stresses maintaining a qualitative edge over any combination of regional foes, echoing an earlier doctrine that *\u201cIsrael cannot afford to lose a single war\u201d*\u301010\u2020L125-L133\u3011. This imperative drives his support for preemptive strikes when needed and his insistence that Israel must always be ready for a multi-front conflict\u301013\u2020L296-L304\u3011\u301013\u2020L298-L307\u3011.\n\nIn summary, Netanyahu\u2019s security and defense philosophy since 2009 has been characterized by **hawkish realism** \u2013 a belief in military strength, proactive defense measures, and deterrence to ensure Israel\u2019s survival, tempered by an aversion to reckless adventures that could overstretch the IDF. He posits that peace will only be achievable once adversaries are convinced Israel cannot be destroyed, a view tracing back to Zeev Jabotinsky\u2019s famed \u201cIron Wall\u201d doctrine of unassailable Jewish defense\u301010\u2020L98-L106\u3011\u301010\u2020L108-L116\u3011. This outlook has guided Netanyahu\u2019s actions: he prioritizes countering immediate threats (Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran) and maintaining security control, even if it means deferring diplomatic compromises. Critics argue this emphasis on military solutions sometimes comes at the expense of diplomatic opportunities \u2013 a point addressed in later sections \u2013 but it undeniably reflects Netanyahu\u2019s core belief that **Israel\u2019s security must be guaranteed through strength above all**.\n\n## 2. International Relations under Netanyahu  \nOn the global stage, Netanyahu has been an assertive and often polarizing figure. His foreign policy is driven by the conviction that Israel must vigorously defend its interests abroad just as it does at home. He has sought to strengthen alliances with great powers, forge new partnerships (especially in the Middle East), and rally the world against common threats like Iran\u2019s ambitions. Netanyahu\u2019s tenure since 2009 can be characterized by **close alignment with certain allies (notably the United States under specific administrations)**, a pragmatic outreach to non-traditional partners (from Arab Gulf states to Asian powers), and a combative diplomatic style when confronting adversaries or critics.\n\n**Relations with the United States:**  The U.S.\u2013Israel relationship, a cornerstone of Israeli foreign policy, saw **highs and lows** during Netanyahu\u2019s leadership. He enjoyed a particularly warm rapport with Republican administrations (George W. Bush in his early years, and later Donald Trump), but a more contentious relationship with Democratic President Barack Obama. Under Obama (2009\u20132016), tensions arose over two key issues: Israeli settlement policy and Iran\u2019s nuclear program\u301047\u2020L490-L498\u3011\u301047\u2020L492-L499\u3011. Obama pressed for a freeze in West Bank settlement expansion and pursued a negotiated nuclear deal with Iran \u2013 both policies Netanyahu opposed. Netanyahu openly criticized the emerging Iran nuclear agreement, warning that it **\u201cwould ultimately leave Iran with the option of developing nuclear weapons\u201d** and insisting that sanctions and international pressure be maintained instead\u301047\u2020L490-L498\u3011\u301047\u2020L493-L496\u3011. In a highly unusual move, Netanyahu accepted a 2015 invitation by the U.S. Congress (extended by the House Speaker without White House coordination) to speak out against the Iran deal. In that speech to Congress, he harshly condemned the proposed agreement. While Netanyahu saw this as a vital stand on a life-and-death security issue, it was controversial; **critics in Israel and the U.S. charged that by aligning with Obama\u2019s political opponents in Congress, Netanyahu risked undermining bipartisan U.S. support for Israel**\u301026\u2020L500-L507\u3011. Indeed, Obama administration officials viewed the speech as a breach of protocol and a foray by Netanyahu into partisan U.S. politics\u301026\u2020L500-L507\u3011. Despite these strains, security cooperation remained strong \u2013 as evidenced by the 2016 $38\u00a0billion aid MOU noted above, which both Obama and Netanyahu endorsed to bolster Israel\u2019s military for the next decade\u301042\u2020L179-L187\u3011.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s relationship with President Donald **Trump** (2017\u20132020) was markedly closer. The two leaders shared similar views on the Iranian threat and Middle East policy. Trump reversed several Obama-era positions in line with Netanyahu\u2019s wishes: the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 (a move Netanyahu praised as the \u201cright decision\u201d to stop Iran\u2019s malign activities), and the Trump administration took the historic step of **recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital** and moving the U.S. Embassy there in 2018\u301019\u2020L576-L584\u3011. Netanyahu hailed this as a diplomatic victory and validation of Israel\u2019s claims, while Palestinians and many international actors decried it. Under Trump, the U.S. also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights (2019), another long-sought goal of Netanyahu. The close Netanyahu-Trump alignment extended to a shared skepticism of multilateral institutions and strong support for each other politically. However, it also further **polarized American perceptions of Israel**, as Netanyahu was seen as favoring one side of the U.S. political spectrum. Even some Israeli analysts noted with concern that Netanyahu\u2019s overt cheerleading for Trump-era policies (and open criticism of Democrats like Obama) **put Israel\u2019s traditionally bipartisan support in Washington at risk**\u301026\u2020L500-L507\u3011. Netanyahu, for his part, argued that he would work with any U.S. president but that Israel\u2019s national interest required him to speak out when its security was on the line \u2013 as in the case of Iran.\n\n**Relations with Europe and Other Western Allies:**  Netanyahu\u2019s interactions with European leaders have been mixed. Western European governments have frequently criticized his hard line on the Palestinians and settlement construction, leading to cooler relations with countries like France, Germany, and the UK at various times. For example, EU officials condemned Israel\u2019s settlement expansions as illegal and an obstacle to peace, which Netanyahu\u2019s government staunchly rejected\u301022\u2020L9-L17\u3011. In 2016, when the UN Security Council passed a resolution denouncing settlements (with the Obama administration abstaining), Netanyahu reacted angrily, even temporarily downgrading ties with states that backed the measure. Nonetheless, he also cultivated alliances within Europe: he found common cause with several nationalist or conservative leaders in Eastern and Central Europe. Notably, Netanyahu developed a friendly partnership with Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n and others, leveraging them to **block EU consensus on measures critical of Israel**. This approach, while controversial, helped Israel avoid isolation in some international forums\u301013\u2020L264-L268\u3011. In addition, Netanyahu expanded strategic and economic ties with countries like **Greece and Cyprus** (cooperating on energy development in the Mediterranean) as a counterweight to Turkey, whose relations with Israel deteriorated sharply during his tenure. With **Canada and Australia**, Netanyahu also enjoyed generally positive relations, as their governments often supported Israel in international fora during the 2010s.\n\n**Outreach to Russia and Asia:**  Demonstrating pragmatism, Netanyahu pursued engagement with non-traditional partners such as Russia, China, and India. With **Russia**, despite Moscow\u2019s ties to Iran and Syria, Netanyahu maintained a functional relationship with President Vladimir Putin. He visited Moscow frequently to coordinate military deconfliction in Syria \u2013 an arrangement to ensure Israeli Air Force strikes against Iranian weapons shipments in Syria did not clash with Russian forces based there\u301038\u2020L171-L179\u3011. In September 2015, Netanyahu and Putin agreed on a \u201cmechanism to prevent misunderstandings\u201d between their militaries in Syria\u301038\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u301038\u2020L171-L179\u3011. This allowed Israel to continue striking Iranian and Hezbollah targets next door (crucial to Netanyahu\u2019s anti-Iran strategy) without directly confronting Russia. Netanyahu\u2019s balancing act was on display during the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well \u2013 he tried to preserve Israel\u2019s freedom of action in Syria and the safety of Russia\u2019s Jewish community while not completely alienating Israel\u2019s Western allies. Critics at home sometimes accused him of **being too accommodating to Putin**, but Netanyahu argued that Russia\u2019s role in the region necessitated Israeli dialogue with the Kremlin for Israel\u2019s security interests.\n\nWith **China**, Netanyahu was the chief architect of dramatically expanded ties. Seeing China\u2019s rise as an economic superpower, he frequently spoke of a \u201c**marriage made in heaven**\u201d between Israel\u2019s tech innovation and China\u2019s capital and markets\u301040\u2020L134-L142\u3011. Since 2009, Israel-China trade and investment have skyrocketed \u2013 Chinese firms invested billions in Israeli high-tech, infrastructure (like Haifa port and Tel Aviv\u2019s metro), and other ventures. Netanyahu made high-profile visits to Beijing (e.g. in 2013 and 2017) to promote business links. He touted these ties as diversifying Israel\u2019s diplomatic portfolio and reducing reliance on any single ally\u301040\u2020L134-L142\u3011\u301040\u2020L147-L155\u3011. At the same time, he walked a **diplomatic tightrope**: Washington grew concerned about Chinese involvement in Israel (especially in sensitive sectors like telecommunications and ports). Under U.S. pressure, Netanyahu\u2019s government established stricter investment screening in 2019 and barred some Chinese bids, trying to reassure Washington while still welcoming Chinese economic opportunities\u301040\u2020L147-L155\u3011\u301040\u2020L155-L163\u3011. This balancing act reflects Netanyahu\u2019s foreign policy realism \u2013 he seeks strategic benefits from all world powers but is careful not to rupture the all-important U.S. alliance.\n\n**Regional Diplomacy and the Abraham Accords:**  Perhaps the most striking shift in international relations during Netanyahu\u2019s recent tenure was the breakthrough in normalization with several Arab states. Netanyahu long advocated for **\u201cpeace through strength\u201d and regional realignment**, positing that cooperation with Arab countries could proceed based on mutual interests (like countering Iran and boosting trade) even without a final peace agreement with the Palestinians. This approach came to fruition with the **Abraham Accords of 2020**, when Israel \u2013 with heavy U.S. mediation \u2013 established official diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, later followed by Sudan and Morocco. The agreements were signed at the White House in September 2020 and marked a historic end to decades of Arab boycott of Israel\u301030\u2020L612-L620\u3011\u301030\u2020L618-L627\u3011. For Netanyahu, these accords vindicated his strategy: Arab states, seeing Israel as a regional power and partner against common threats (such as Iran and militant Islamism), were willing to normalize ties without waiting for a resolution of the Palestinian issue\u301030\u2020L612-L620\u3011\u301030\u2020L615-L623\u3011. He proudly proclaimed a \u201cnew era of peace\u201d and lauded the economic and security partnerships that quickly blossomed \u2013 from direct flights and tourism to technology and intelligence-sharing. The **shared threat perception of Iran** was indeed a key driver of these friendships\u301030\u2020L615-L623\u3011, aligning with Netanyahu\u2019s longstanding effort to form a regional coalition isolating Tehran. The Abraham Accords also eased Israel\u2019s regional isolation and opened lucrative Gulf markets to Israeli business. Critics noted that Netanyahu had to **suspend his plan to annex parts of the West Bank** to secure the UAE deal (a concession welcomed by international observers), but Netanyahu viewed it as a worthy trade-off for a strategic diplomatic win. By decoupling Arab-Israeli rapprochement from the Palestinian issue, Netanyahu\u2019s policy marked a paradigm shift in Middle East diplomacy\u301030\u2020L618-L627\u3011.\n\nBeyond the Gulf, Netanyahu also quietly improved ties with **Saudi Arabia** \u2013 a nation with which Israel has no formal relations but growing behind-the-scenes contacts. Reports emerged of covert meetings and intelligence cooperation between Israel and Saudi Arabia against Iranian influence. While full normalization with Saudi Arabia had not occurred by 2021, Netanyahu often hinted it was a goal on the horizon, contingent on U.S. support and regional developments. Additionally, under Netanyahu, Israel deepened relations with **Egypt** (especially on security cooperation against militants in Sinai and containing Gaza) and with **Jordan** (though ties with Amman were frequently strained by the Palestinian issue and Jerusalem tensions).\n\n**Approach to Iran and Other Adversaries:**  A cornerstone of Netanyahu\u2019s international philosophy is a hard line on Iran. He has consistently made Iran\u2019s Islamist regime and its nuclear program the focal point of Israel\u2019s foreign policy agenda. Netanyahu believes a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an existential threat to Israel; he often points to Iranian leaders\u2019 hostile rhetoric and Tehran\u2019s support for Hezbollah and Hamas to underscore this danger. Consequently, he lobbied world powers incessantly to **impose strict sanctions and \u201cleave all options on the table\u201d** regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities\u301047\u2020L450-L458\u3011. In dramatic fashion, Netanyahu used global forums to sound the alarm \u2013 famously holding up a cartoon bomb diagram at the United Nations in 2012 to illustrate how close Iran was getting to a bomb (in his view). His pressure contributed to tough international sanctions earlier in the 2010s. However, Netanyahu was deeply skeptical of diplomacy that he felt only delayed Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. He condemned the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal as a dangerous mistake, straining Israel\u2019s relations with allies in Europe who supported the accord\u301026\u2020L490-L498\u3011. Netanyahu\u2019s government is also believed to have pursued covert sabotage and espionage against Iran\u2019s nuclear program (though Israel doesn\u2019t officially acknowledge it) \u2013 such as cyberattacks (e.g. the Stuxnet virus) and the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists \u2013 to slow Iran\u2019s progress. In addition, under Netanyahu, the IDF carried out an intensive **\u201cwar-between-wars\u201d campaign** in Syria and beyond, striking Iranian bases, weapons convoys, and proxy forces to prevent Iran from entrenching on Israel\u2019s borders\u301013\u2020L302-L307\u3011. This relentless focus on Iran has won Netanyahu praise from some quarters as a **clear-eyed strategist rallying the world against a shared menace\u301047\u2020L450-L458\u3011**, but also criticism for potentially pushing Iran to accelerate its nuclear efforts or for alienating allies with his uncompromising stance\u301026\u2020L500-L507\u3011.\n\nIn summary, Netanyahu\u2019s foreign policy is characterized by **assertiveness and realpolitik**. He is willing to defy even close allies if he perceives a vital threat (as seen in the Obama-era disagreements), yet he\u2019s also adept at building new alliances (e.g. with Gulf Arab states, Asian powers) that leverage Israel\u2019s strengths. Netanyahu\u2019s overarching philosophy is that Israel must **\u201cstand strong among the nations,\u201d** guarding its sovereignty and security proactively. Whether on the diplomatic stage or through backchannels, he seeks to position Israel as a key player \u2013 one that punches above its weight via military prowess, technological innovation, and alliances based on mutual interests rather than concessions. The fruits of this approach can be seen in the Abraham Accords and deepening global ties, even as the confrontational aspects (like his handling of the Palestinian issue and partisan leanings in the U.S.) have drawn significant criticism addressed below.\n\n## 3. Conflict with Gaza, the Palestinians, and the Broader Middle East  \nNetanyahu\u2019s tenure has been marked by recurrent conflict with Hamas in Gaza, a stalled peace process with the Palestinians, and a broader regional strategy that prioritizes security over diplomatic compromise. His **overall philosophy toward the Palestinian question** has been described as status-quo management rather than proactive resolution. Netanyahu is a lifelong skeptic of the Oslo peace process; however, early in his second stint (under U.S. pressure) he voiced conditional support for a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d in a famous 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University. He agreed **\u201cin principle\u201d** to a demilitarized Palestinian state alongside Israel, but only if the Palestinians recognized Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people and met stringent security conditions\u301047\u2020L440-L448\u3011. In practice, these conditions were non-starters for the Palestinian leadership, and negotiations made little headway. A partial 10-month freeze on West Bank settlement construction in 2009\u20132010 enabled a brief round of U.S.-brokered talks in 2010, but once that moratorium expired, Netanyahu refused to extend it, and the talks broke down with **\u201cthe peace process remaining at a standstill\u201d** thereafter\u301047\u2020L440-L448\u3011. \n\n**Settlement Policy and West Bank:**  Under Netanyahu, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank (and East Jerusalem) continued to expand, which became a major point of contention. While he occasionally slowed or paused construction under international pressure (as noted with the 2009\u201310 moratorium), in general Netanyahu aligned with his right-wing base in promoting settlement growth. The settler population rose sharply during his years in power: roughly **155,000 additional Israelis moved into West Bank settlements from 2009 to 2020**, an increase from about 297,000 to over 450,000 settlers\u301032\u2020L107-L112\u3011. His government regularly approved new housing units in settlements (though actual building sometimes lagged behind plans). Netanyahu argued that Jewish settlers have a historic right to live in these biblical lands, and he resisted Palestinian and international demands for a complete freeze. Critics, however, say this expansion has **\u201celiminated any practical possibility of a Palestinian state\u201d** by fragmenting the territory\u301022\u2020L13-L18\u3011. Netanyahu balanced pressures carefully: for example, during the Trump administration he floated plans to annex portions of the West Bank (applying Israeli sovereignty unilaterally), a longtime demand of the settler right. But ultimately, he suspended annexation in 2020 as part of the Abraham Accords deal with the UAE, indicating a willingness to postpone ideological goals for strategic gains. This maneuver exemplified his pragmatic streak \u2013 using the **prospect** of annexation as both a bargaining chip and a bone to throw to domestic supporters, without actually upending the status quo. Still, to Palestinians and peace advocates, Netanyahu\u2019s tenure entrenched an occupation and settlement enterprise that they view as antithetical to a two-state peace agreement. The lack of substantive negotiations after 2014 is often attributed to Netanyahu\u2019s reluctance to make concessions (such as territorial withdrawals or halt settlement building), combined with Palestinian political divisions.\n\n**Gaza and Hamas:**  Perhaps the most acute challenges Netanyahu faced have been the recurring conflicts with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Hamas, the Islamist militant group that governs Gaza, has fought several mini-wars with Israel on Netanyahu\u2019s watch. Netanyahu\u2019s approach to Gaza has been a mix of **military force and containment**. He inherited the policy of blockading Gaza (imposed jointly by Israel and Egypt after Hamas seized power in 2007) and maintained it as a means to restrict Hamas\u2019s ability to import weapons. When Hamas or allied militants fire rockets into Israel, Netanyahu has responded with airstrikes and sometimes ground incursions to degrade their capabilities. Major flare-ups under his leadership included: \n\n- **Operation Pillar of Defense (Nov 2012):** Triggered by Hamas rocket fire and the targeting of a top Hamas commander, this week-long Israeli offensive focused on air strikes. It ended with an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire. Netanyahu was cautious about launching a ground invasion, and the truce terms involved Hamas pledging to halt fire. Both sides claimed success, and Netanyahu\u2019s decision to stop short of a full war drew mixed reviews domestically (some praised avoidance of a quagmire, while some right-wing voices felt Hamas was let off the hook). \n\n- **Operation Protective Edge (July\u2013August 2014):** This was the most intense Gaza war during Netanyahu\u2019s tenure. After a surge in Hamas rocket attacks and the discovery of cross-border attack tunnels, Netanyahu\u2019s government embarked on a 50-day campaign involving heavy airstrikes and a ground operation primarily aimed at destroying the tunnel network. By the end, over 2,250 Palestinians (including many civilians) and 73 Israelis had been killed\u301026\u2020L480-L488\u3011. Netanyahu stated that **the operation achieved its objectives** of weakening Hamas and destroying terror tunnels\u301026\u2020L480-L488\u3011. Indeed, Hamas\u2019s ability to fire rockets was set back for a time. However, the war devastated Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and humanitarian situation, prompting international outcry. International observers **criticized the \u201cdisproportionate\u201d toll on Palestinian civilians** and accused Israel of using excessive force\u301026\u2020L480-L488\u3011. Netanyahu and the IDF countered that Hamas bore responsibility by embedding its military assets in civilian areas and using human shields. Politically, Netanyahu faced dueling pressures at home: the left and center lambasted the war\u2019s destruction and lack of a diplomatic endgame, while hardliners in his security cabinet (like then-Economy Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman) argued the operation should have gone further to definitively **topple Hamas**. Netanyahu opted to accept an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire rather than escalate, reflecting his pragmatic tendency to seek limited objectives. In public, he defended the outcome as a **\u201cgreat success\u201d** in crippling Hamas, citing the quiet that followed\u301036\u2020L4-L12\u3011. Yet, the long-term strategic gains were debated, as Hamas rebuilt and rearmed in subsequent years.\n\n- **Subsequent Clashes (2018, 2019):** During Netanyahu\u2019s later years in office, there were shorter rounds of violence \u2013 e.g. a spate of border protests and clashes in 2018 (the \u201cGreat March of Return\u201d), periodic rocket barrages met with Israeli strikes, etc. Netanyahu often calibrated his response to avoid uncontrolled escalation. Notably, in **November 2018**, after a brief gun battle and Hamas rocket salvo led to fighting, Netanyahu agreed to a quick truce \u2013 a decision that prompted Defense Minister Avigdor **Lieberman to resign in protest**, accusing Netanyahu of being too soft on Hamas\u301019\u2020L538-L546\u3011. Lieberman\u2019s hawkish Yisrael Beiteinu party quit the coalition over this issue, illustrating how contentious Gaza policy was even within Netanyahu\u2019s government\u301019\u2020L538-L546\u3011. Netanyahu argued that a ground war at that time would have been a needless risk and that Israel had achieved deterrence; Lieberman and others on the right felt that tolerating continued Hamas rule was a mistake.\n\n- **May 2021 Conflict (Operation Guardian of the Walls):** Although Netanyahu was briefly out of office in 2021 (the Bennett-Lapid government took over in June), he was Prime Minister during the 11-day war with Hamas in May of that year. Tensions in Jerusalem (over Sheikh Jarrah evictions and clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque) led Hamas to fire rockets at Israeli cities including Jerusalem, to which Netanyahu\u2019s government responded with massive airstrikes on Gaza. The conflict killed at least 248 Palestinians and 13 people in Israel\u301044\u2020L181-L189\u3011\u301044\u2020L184-L187\u3011. After 11 days, Netanyahu agreed to an **Egyptian-mediated ceasefire** that halted the fighting without any clear political resolution\u301044\u2020L158-L166\u3011. Both Netanyahu and Hamas\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh claimed victory in the exchange\u301044\u2020L158-L166\u3011. Netanyahu pointed to the severe blows dealt to Hamas\u2019s military infrastructure, while Hamas touted its ability to fire rockets even at Tel Aviv as a sign of resistance. The destruction in Gaza was extensive, and humanitarian concerns rose again\u301044\u2020L181-L189\u3011. Domestically, this conflict occurred amid a political crisis (Israel was between inconclusive elections), and Netanyahu\u2019s critics suggested that he was partly distracted by his battle to remain in power. Nonetheless, the military outcome was similar to prior rounds \u2013 a return to uneasy calm, with Hamas bruised but not eliminated.\n\n**Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza/Hamas Strategy:**  Over time, a pattern in Netanyahu\u2019s approach to Gaza became evident: **containment** rather than resolution. Even **some security analysts dubbed this the \u201cNetanyahu doctrine\u201d \u2013 allowing Hamas to survive in Gaza as a counterweight to the Palestinian Authority, but keeping it weak and isolated**\u301045\u2020L325-L333\u3011\u301045\u2020L329-L337\u3011. Netanyahu did not initiate the Hamas-Fatah split (that occurred in 2007), but he arguably capitalized on it. He would often rhetorically ask with whom Israel should negotiate peace \u2013 implying that the Palestinians were divided between the PA in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, thus there was \u201cno partner\u201d for a comprehensive deal. Critics allege that Netanyahu had an interest in **perpetuating the rift**. Notably, his government at times facilitated the transfer of Qatari funds into Gaza to ease humanitarian conditions and stabilize Hamas\u2019s governance, a move his opponents decried as propping up Hamas rule\u301034\u2020L156-L164\u3011\u301034\u2020L160-L164\u3011. Opponents (especially in the centrist and left camps) argue Netanyahu pursued a cynical \u201cdivide and rule\u201d policy: by bolstering Hamas just enough to keep it as a foil to the Palestinian Authority, he undermined Palestinian unity and thus **undercut negotiations for statehood**\u301034\u2020L156-L164\u3011. They point to statements by his Likud allies suggesting it was beneficial to have Hamas in charge in Gaza rather than the PA, to prevent a unified Palestinian state. Netanyahu vehemently denies *\u201cbuilding up Hamas\u201d* deliberately, calling such claims \u201cridiculous\u201d\u301034\u2020L156-L164\u3011. However, the events of 2023 (when a surprise large-scale Hamas attack occurred) brought this debate to the forefront, as many Israelis questioned whether years of tolerating Hamas had backfired. (We will return to these critiques in the domestic section.)\n\n**Broader Middle East Strategy:**  Regionally, Netanyahu\u2019s focus (beyond the Palestinian arena) has been on countering hostile states and groups like Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Islamist extremist movements, while forging tacit alliances with Sunni Arab powers. In practice, this meant **isolating Iran** (as covered earlier) and conducting numerous covert or low-level military actions to curtail Iranian influence. Netanyahu presided over what Israeli officials call the \u201cwar between wars\u201d campaign, which included hundreds of airstrikes against Iranian arms transfers and militias in Syria, as well as reported strikes on Iranian-backed targets as far afield as Sudan and Iraq. This relentless pressure aimed to degrade Iran\u2019s ability to threaten Israel via proxies. With Hezbollah, Netanyahu has maintained deterrence since the 2006 Lebanon war (which occurred under a predecessor). There have been occasional flare-ups on the northern border, but Netanyahu has been careful to avoid a full-scale war in Lebanon, knowing the devastation it would bring to both sides. Instead, he concentrates on disrupting Hezbollah\u2019s precision missile project (often through covert means) and working with international partners to enforce arms embargoes.\n\nA notable aspect of Netanyahu\u2019s broader strategy is his **realignment of Middle East diplomacy**: rather than making concessions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to gain peace with Arab states (the old paradigm), he pursued peace with Arab states to strengthen a united front against common adversaries, chiefly Iran. The Abraham Accords are the clearest example, but even prior to that, Netanyahu had quietly built security cooperation with Egypt (against Sinai jihadists and Hamas) and intelligence sharing with Gulf states. He capitalized on what he called a **\u201cmeeting of interests\u201d** between Israel and Sunni Arab governments who were alarmed by Iran\u2019s expansionism and jihadist terror. By leveraging Israel\u2019s high-tech economy and military intel, Netanyahu made Israel an attractive partner. This strategy paid off with the diplomatic breakthroughs of 2020\u301030\u2020L615-L623\u3011\u301030\u2020L618-L627\u3011 and has shifted regional dynamics. However, it also meant that the Palestinian issue was sidelined \u2013 something the Palestinians themselves denounced as a betrayal by fellow Arabs. Netanyahu contends that **improving Israel\u2019s strategic position and economic ties in the region ultimately creates better conditions for any future peace with the Palestinians**, because it diminishes incentives for violence and shows that Israel is here to stay. Detractors counter that excluding Palestinians from these accords undermines any leverage moderate Palestinian leaders have and deepens their despair.\n\n**Ceasefires and Negotiations:**  In handling conflicts with Hamas, Netanyahu has relied on third-party mediators (Egypt, the United Nations, Qatar) to broker truces. He has generally avoided direct negotiations with Hamas (which Israel labels a terrorist organization), but indirect talks have led to prisoner swaps (e.g. the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, where Netanyahu released over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one captured Israeli soldier \u2013 a move he defended on humanitarian grounds but which some in Israel criticized for emboldening Hamas). Ceasefire understandings often involve Israel easing some restrictions on Gaza or allowing financial aid in, in return for calm. These arrangements have been temporary and prone to collapse, resulting in the on-and-off cycle of fighting. Netanyahu\u2019s critics argue that he has no long-term strategy for Gaza beyond **\u201cmanaging\u201d the conflict**, which they view as untenable. Indeed, an analysis by a security think tank observed that Israel essentially resigned itself to managing rather than solving the Gaza conflict \u2013 periodically **\u201cmowing the lawn\u201d** via military strikes, without a clear endgame other than hoping Hamas would one day collapse on its own\u301014\u2020L114-L122\u3011\u301014\u2020L116-L124\u3011.\n\nIn sum, Netanyahu\u2019s approach to the Palestinian conflict and regional issues is characterized by **cautious stalemate on the diplomatic front and aggressive containment on the military front**. He has favored the *status quo* over risky peace overtures, given the unstable regional context and his belief that Israel cannot compromise on security. His supporters credit him with keeping Israel safe and stable in a turbulent era \u2013 noting that there were no major peace breakthroughs, but also no catastrophic wars on his watch until 2023. His mantra has been **\u201cpeace through strength\u201d**, insisting that only a militarily and economically strong Israel can eventually negotiate peace from a position of advantage. Detractors, however, see a leader who perpetuated conflict by refusing to address its root causes, expanded settlements that complicate future separation, and pursued short-term security at the cost of long-term peace. The **internal Israeli critiques and divisions** over these policies are explored next.\n\n## 4. Domestic Critiques and Internal Divisions in Israel  \nNetanyahu\u2019s leadership has been as divisive at home as it has been consequential. Within Israel, opinions on his policies and style are sharply split along ideological, religious, and even generational lines. He is admired by many on the right as a guarantor of security and Jewish nationalism, yet reviled by many on the left and center who accuse him of autocratic tendencies and undermining the prospects for peace. Additionally, some of his natural allies on the right \u2013 including ultra-nationalists and religious groups \u2013 have, at times, criticized him for not going far enough in advancing their agendas. Here we outline critiques from different segments of Israeli society:\n\n**Left-Wing and Centrist Opposition:**  The Israeli left and centrist parties have been Netanyahu\u2019s most vocal critics, especially regarding his handling of democracy, the peace process, and societal issues. Leaders from Labor, Meretz (left-wing), and Yesh Atid, Blue and White (centrist) have often accused Netanyahu of intransigence towards the Palestinians and prioritizing his political survival over the national interest. They argue that his refusal to earnestly pursue a two-state solution \u2013 evident in continued settlement expansion and what they view as lip-service to peace \u2013 has **\u201cwrecked\u201d the Oslo Accords and any hope of ending the conflict\u301022\u2020L1-L4\u3011**. For instance, former Labor Prime Minister Ehud Barak has lambasted Netanyahu for lacking initiative and \u201cplaying for time\u201d while the window for a two-state solution closes. Centrists like Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz have similarly criticized Netanyahu for international isolation due to settlement policies and for deteriorating relations with moderate Palestinians. They point to the *standstill in negotiations since 2014*\u301047\u2020L440-L448\u3011 as proof that Netanyahu deliberately avoided peace efforts, preferring the status quo. Moreover, left-leaning critics condemn the humanitarian impact of Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza strategy \u2013 the blockades and wars \u2013 calling them both morally troubling and ultimately ineffective in bringing lasting quiet.\n\nOn domestic governance, centrists and leftists have decried Netanyahu\u2019s **populist and polarizing style**. They accuse him of eroding democratic norms by attacking key institutions like the free press, the judiciary, and law enforcement, particularly as corruption investigations encircled him. (Netanyahu has been indicted on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in cases involving alleged media manipulation and gifts, which he vehemently denies and calls a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d\u301017\u2020L331-L339\u3011\u301017\u2020L341-L347\u3011.) According to observers, Netanyahu often rallies his base by portraying the media and the \u201cleft\u201d as enemies of the people \u2013 rhetoric that critics say mimics illiberal populists elsewhere\u301017\u2020L349-L357\u3011\u301017\u2020L361-L369\u3011. At a 2017 rally, for example, he blasted the \u201cliberal media\u201d and \u201cleft-wing\u201d for trying to topple him since they couldn\u2019t beat him at the polls, even using the term \u201c**fake news**\u201d in Trumpian fashion\u301017\u2020L349-L357\u3011\u301017\u2020L361-L369\u3011. Opponents argue this divisive approach has **\u201ceroded basic norms of democracy and national unity\u201d** in Israel\u301017\u2020L363-L371\u3011. The mass protests in 2020\u20132021 and again in 2023 \u2013 whether over his alleged corruption, his government\u2019s attempted judicial overhaul, or most recently the public outrage after the October 2023 Hamas attack \u2013 all underscored deep mistrust of Netanyahu among a large section of Israelis. Polls consistently show the country split down the middle: a 2023 survey found **52% of Israelis viewed Netanyahu unfavorably vs. 47% favorably**, with almost all left-wingers negatively and the vast majority of right-wingers positively\u301016\u2020L190-L198\u3011\u301016\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Additionally, secular Jews and Arab citizens largely disapprove of him, while religious Jews strongly support him\u301016\u2020L201-L208\u3011, highlighting societal cleavages.\n\nAnother frequent criticism from centrists is that Netanyahu personalizes his rule and prioritizes staying in power at any cost. They cite his maneuvering through multiple elections (2019\u20132021) while under indictment, including controversial alliances with far-right figures, as evidence that he put himself above the country\u2019s stability. His former allies like Avigdor Lieberman and Gideon Sa\u2019ar (who broke away from Likud) have accused him of fostering a **\u201ccult of personality\u201d** in Likud and sidelining anyone who challenges him. Centrist critics also highlight governance issues: under Netanyahu\u2019s watch socio-economic problems (cost of living, inequality) often took a backseat to security. Indeed, in 2011, massive social justice protests erupted against high housing costs and living expenses, indicating public frustration that Netanyahu\u2019s market-oriented policies weren\u2019t addressing middle-class needs\u301047\u2020L459-L468\u3011. While Netanyahu did implement some reforms and kept Israel\u2019s economy growing robustly, opponents claim he neglected domestic welfare in favor of his security-first agenda.\n\n**Right-Wing and Ultra-Nationalist Critics:**  It may seem counterintuitive, but Netanyahu has also faced criticism from his right flank, though far less frequently than from the left. Ultra-nationalist and hard-right elements have generally been Netanyahu\u2019s political base, but they have pressured him to go further on issues like annexing territory, being more aggressive against Hamas, and asserting Jewish sovereignty. For example, religious-nationalist leaders and settler representatives were outraged by Netanyahu\u2019s 2009 settlement freeze and his later willingness (in 2020) to pause West Bank annexation for the sake of the Abraham Accords\u301032\u2020L94-L102\u3011\u301032\u2020L107-L112\u3011. Some settlers feel Netanyahu talks a good game but ultimately has **\u201cnever annexed an inch\u201d** and even removed outposts at times under court order, falling short of their ideal. The nationalist right also criticized Netanyahu for the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange, arguing it rewarded terrorism by freeing convicted terrorists (Netanyahu countered that bringing home captured soldiers is a sacred duty in Israel). \n\nThe most notable right-wing rebellion was Avigdor **Lieberman\u2019s resignation in 2018**. As Defense Minister, Lieberman was incensed that Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas after a bout of fighting, calling the truce **\u201ca capitulation to terror.\u201d** He quit the cabinet, accusing Netanyahu of not being tough enough \u2013 a stance that echoed some in the security establishment who wished for a more decisive blow to Hamas\u301019\u2020L538-L546\u3011. Similarly, Naftali Bennett (then Education Minister) threatened to resign around the same time, demanding a harsher Gaza strategy. Netanyahu managed to keep Bennett briefly, but both Bennett and Lieberman would go on to form or join rival right-wing parties, at times uniting with centrists to oust Netanyahu (as happened in the short-lived \u201cchange government\u201d of 2021\u201322). Such actions indicate that while Netanyahu\u2019s rhetoric is maximalist, his pragmatism (e.g. halting wars short of victory, limiting annexation to preserve foreign ties) has frustrated the most hardline factions. In their view, Netanyahu **\u201cmanaged the conflict\u201d** instead of winning it, and they desired more revolutionary steps (like full sovereignty in the West Bank). A recent analysis in a conservative forum even labeled the longtime strategy of merely containing Hamas as **\u201cIsrael\u2019s great strategic failure,\u201d** arguing Netanyahu and predecessors erred by not ousting Hamas when they had the chance\u301014\u2020L114-L122\u3011\u301014\u2020L122-L128\u3011. \n\nDespite these periodic critiques, it\u2019s important to note that most of the Israeli right has ultimately rallied behind Netanyahu as their champion \u2013 especially when faced with the alternative of a center-left government. He has an acute political sense for appeasing right-wing concerns just enough (for instance, authorizing steady, if slow, settlement growth and passing the Nation-State Law defining Israel officially as the Jewish nation-state). His electoral base appreciates that he kept issues like **Jewish identity, security, and territorial claims** at the forefront.\n\n**Religious and Ultra-Orthodox Groups:**  Netanyahu has also relied on ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) parties as key coalition partners. These religious factions (such as Shas and United Torah Judaism) generally support Netanyahu strongly, because he champions their interests in maintaining state support for yeshiva students, welfare budgets for large Haredi families, and exemptions from military conscription for Torah scholars. Haredi leaders have called Netanyahu a true friend to their community, and in return their voters have been a loyal bloc for him. However, there have been tensions: at times, Netanyahu\u2019s need to balance secular and religious demands caused friction. A prime example was the **debate over Haredi conscription**. In late 2018, a showdown emerged over legislation to end or extend the blanket draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men. Haredi parties insisted on preserving their community\u2019s exemptions, while secular-right politicians (like Lieberman) demanded a law to require more ultra-Orthodox to serve. Caught in the middle, Netanyahu tried to delay any decision, but the issue contributed to the collapse of his government and early elections in 2019\u301019\u2020L540-L548\u3011. This highlighted an internal division: Netanyahu\u2019s alliance with religious groups alienated some secular nationalist allies, illustrating the broader societal divide between secular and religious Israelis. Still, the Haredim themselves rarely criticize Netanyahu publicly \u2013 any dissatisfaction is usually negotiated behind closed doors in coalition agreements (e.g. over budgets or Sabbath laws). As long as Netanyahu protects their autonomy and funding, the ultra-Orthodox parties prefer him in power against the more secular, pluralist agenda of centrist rivals.\n\nAmong **religious Zionists** (national-religious Jews), Netanyahu historically had solid support, though some more extreme elements felt he was too cautious. For instance, Temple Mount activists and the furthest right settlers sometimes protested that Netanyahu enforced restrictions on Jewish prayer at the sensitive Al-Aqsa/Temple Mount compound to avoid inflaming tensions, which they saw as weak. During the 2020 election cycles, Netanyahu brokered a partnership of far-right factions (including the controversial Jewish Power party) to ensure they entered the Knesset \u2013 a move critics condemned as legitimizing racists, but which Netanyahu defended as necessary to maintain a right-wing majority\u301015\u2020L9-L17\u3011. This underscores how he managed to keep even fringe religious-nationalist elements within his tent. After his 2022 comeback, Netanyahu indeed formed the most right-religious government in Israel\u2019s history, reliant on ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist ministers who themselves sometimes outflank him on policy. Should he ever try to moderate, he could face pushback from these partners \u2013 a scenario currently unfolding in debates over how to handle the post-war situation in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\n**Public Opinion and Internal Division:**  Overall, Israeli society is deeply polarized over Netanyahu. Surveys indicate stark splits: for example, **85% of self-identified right-wing Israelis view Netanyahu favorably, versus only 15% of centrists and 6% of left-wingers**\u301016\u2020L199-L207\u3011\u301016\u2020L201-L208\u3011. Likewise, 93% of ultra-Orthodox and 72% of religious Jews rate him positively, against only 22% of secular Jews who do\u301016\u2020L203-L211\u3011. These figures reflect how Netanyahu has come to symbolize an entire political worldview. To his supporters, he is *\u201cMr. Security,\u201d* a statesman who improved Israel\u2019s global standing and kept the nation safe during tumultuous times. They credit him with economic growth, the Abraham Accords, and resisting international pressure in defense of Israel\u2019s interests. To his detractors, Netanyahu is seen as a **corrupt, power-hungry demagogue** who has polarized the nation, assaulted democratic institutions, and presided over the deterioration of Israel\u2019s internal cohesion and moral fiber. This dichotomy has led to years of intense elections essentially serving as referenda on Netanyahu\u2019s rule \u2013 a cycle that repeated from 2019 through 2022 with inconclusive outcomes.\n\nEven within his Likud party, there were quiet murmurs of fatigue during the deadlock years, but Netanyahu\u2019s iron grip and political savvy kept potential rivals at bay. Only once \u2013 in June 2021 \u2013 did an unprecedented coalition of diverse parties (ranging from right-wing nationalists like Bennett to centrist Lapid to an Arab Islamist party) unite solely to remove Netanyahu from power, under the banner of a \u201cchange government.\u201d This eclectic alliance reflected how broad the anti-Netanyahu sentiment had become, uniting factions that agreed on little else. They accused Netanyahu of **toxifying public discourse and entrenching himself like a \u201cKing Bibi\u201d**, unwilling to let the country move on. However, that coalition fell apart after a year, and Netanyahu returned to office in late 2022, proving his enduring influence.\n\n**Recent Critiques (Post-2023 War):** It\u2019s worth noting that the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023 \u2013 the deadliest terrorist assault in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 unleashed a new wave of domestic criticism at Netanyahu, including from quarters that once supported him. Many Israelis blamed a **colossal security failure** on his government\u2019s watch, saying that the focus on other issues (like the judicial overhaul) and the policy of tolerating Hamas\u2019s rule contributed to the disaster\u301045\u2020L313-L321\u3011\u301045\u2020L331-L339\u3011. Prominent voices, including reservists, former generals, and even some in right-wing media, have called for Netanyahu to take responsibility and resign, accusing him of misjudgments. They argue that his long-held approach \u2013 **\u201callowing Hamas to exist but not an independent Palestinian state\u201d** \u2013 has been fundamentally discredited by the massacre\u301045\u2020L325-L333\u3011. Netanyahu\u2019s insistence on blaming the security apparatus rather than any policy decisions further inflamed these critics\u301045\u2020L333-L342\u3011. This represents a potential fracture in his base: while many Israelis still trust his wartime leadership, polling after the attack showed plummeting confidence in Netanyahu personally\u301045\u2020L347-L352\u3011. For the first time in his career, significant numbers of Israelis on the right and center appeared to agree with the left that Netanyahu\u2019s era may have been a **liability** rather than an asset for Israel\u2019s security. That said, Netanyahu has weathered countless crises before, and his supporters caution against rushing to pin all blame on one man for systemic failures.\n\n**Leadership Style:**  Netanyahu\u2019s leadership style has itself been a subject of debate. He is often described as a **shrewd, tactical politician** with a focus on the long game. Admirers say he\u2019s exceptionally skilled on the world stage (fluent in English, an effective communicator of Israel\u2019s case) and has a near-encyclopedic grasp of policy details, especially security matters. Detractors contend that he is **risk-averse on big decisions** \u2013 preferring not to gamble on bold peace moves or drastic military adventures, which in their view leads to missed opportunities and a perpetuation of conflict. They also point to his tendency to centralize authority, relying on a tight inner circle and sometimes sidelining the professional defense establishment or diplomats if they disagree. For instance, reports have surfaced of tensions between Netanyahu and the IDF brass or Mossad chiefs over Iran policy (with some security officials warning against strikes that Netanyahu allegedly considered). In domestic politics, his tenacity and occasional embrace of polarizing allies (far-right or ultra-Orthodox) are criticized as putting his coalitions\u2019 survival over social harmony. Yet, to his base, these are signs of Netanyahu\u2019s commitment to a right-wing vision and his unwillingness to bow to leftist or international pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, **internal Israeli opinion on Netanyahu is sharply divided**. He inspires both deep loyalty and deep loathing. The critiques from various quarters illustrate the challenge Netanyahu faced in balancing Israel\u2019s numerous factions: he has been pulled between peace advocates and hardliners, between secular and religious demands, and between liberal democratic norms and populist impulses. Netanyahu\u2019s ability to navigate this minefield for so long attests to his political acumen, but the rifts that widened in Israeli society during his tenure are part of his complex legacy. As one analysis put it, Netanyahu\u2019s ideology of **accommodating Hamas while indefinitely denying Palestinian statehood** is now at a crossroads, and Israelis are split on whether that approach has secured the nation or left it more vulnerable\u301045\u2020L325-L333\u3011\u301045\u2020L333-L342\u3011. Ultimately, how one evaluates Netanyahu\u2019s leadership often correlates with one\u2019s broader worldview: security-first realists largely applaud him, while those prioritizing peace negotiations and liberal values largely denounce him. \n\n## **Conclusion**  \nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s era (since 2009) has undeniably reshaped Israel\u2019s security posture, foreign relations, and internal politics. His **security and defense policies** embodied a philosophy of strength and vigilance \u2013 yielding advanced defensive systems and repeated military operations that bolstered deterrence, albeit without definitively ending the threats. In **international affairs**, Netanyahu leveraged Israel\u2019s power to build new alliances (culminating in historic peace accords with Arab states) and took a confrontational stance against Iran and other foes, sometimes at the expense of friction with traditional allies. Regarding the **Palestinian conflict**, he maintained a hardened status quo: expanding Israel\u2019s territorial entrenchment and containing adversaries like Hamas through force, while largely sidelining negotiations. This approach has been praised for maintaining short-term security and stability, but also blamed for deepening the impasse and contributing to cycles of violence. \n\nWithin Israel, Netanyahu\u2019s leadership has been **deeply polarizing**. He is lauded by supporters as a patriot who safeguarded the nation and enhanced its global standing, yet vilified by opponents as a divider who put personal power and ideological rigidity above reconciliation and democratic health. Israel\u2019s political landscape during his tenure was often a **referendum on Netanyahu himself**, reflecting stark divides between right and left, religious and secular, Jewish and Arab constituencies\u301016\u2020L199-L208\u3011. Critiques from across the spectrum \u2013 whether accusing him of being too hawkish or not hawkish enough, too deferential to ultra-Orthodox demands or too beholden to populist tactics \u2013 underscore the complexity of governing a fractious society amid existential threats.\n\nIn sum, Netanyahu\u2019s overall philosophy can be seen as **realist-nationalist**: he believes Israel must be exceedingly strong and self-reliant in a dangerous region, that diplomatic progress follows from power dynamics rather than concessions, and that the Jewish people\u2019s interests must be assertively defended. His record since 2009 reflects those convictions. The legacy of his policies is still unfolding, and history\u2019s judgment will likely hinge on events yet to come \u2013 including whether Israel moves toward a different strategy in his absence or continues on the path he charted. What is clear is that Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s imprint on Israel\u2019s security doctrine, foreign relationships, and internal discourse has been profound and enduring, provoking debate that will continue long after his time in office. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Britannica \u2013 *Benjamin Netanyahu Biography*\u301026\u2020L480-L488\u3011\u301026\u2020L490-L498\u3011\u301047\u2020L440-L448\u3011\u301047\u2020L450-L458\u3011  \n- Jewish Virtual Library / FDD \u2013 *Netanyahu\u2019s National Security Strategy* (four pillars doctrine)\u301013\u2020L260-L268\u3011\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011  \n- Reuters \u2013 *2016 US-Israel $38 Billion Military Aid Deal*\u301042\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u301042\u2020L179-L187\u3011; *May 2021 Gaza Conflict Ceasefire*\u301044\u2020L158-L166\u3011\u301044\u2020L181-L189\u3011; *Netanyahu-Putin Syria Coordination 2015*\u301038\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u301038\u2020L171-L179\u3011  \n- JINSA (Security Think Tank) \u2013 *\u201cManaging the Conflict\u201d in Gaza*\u301014\u2020L114-L122\u3011  \n- Politico EU \u2013 *Criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s Qatar-Hamas Policy*\u301034\u2020L156-L164\u3011  \n- Pew Research Center \u2013 *Israeli Public Opinion on Netanyahu (2023)*\u301016\u2020L190-L199\u3011\u301016\u2020L201-L208\u3011  \n- Atlantic Council \u2013 *Analysis of Netanyahu\u2019s View on Hamas vs Palestinian State*\u301045\u2020L325-L333\u3011\u301045\u2020L333-L342\u3011  \n- Jerusalem Post \u2013 *West Bank Settler Population Growth 2009\u20132020*\u301032\u2020L107-L112\u3011  \n- Times of Israel / Haaretz \u2013 (Referenced in-line via analysis of political events and quotes)\u301019\u2020L538-L546\u3011\u301017\u2020L349-L357\u3011.  \n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":1478,"end_ix":1492,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"From Ben-Gurion to Netanyahu: The Evolution of Israel\u2019s National Security Strategy","url":"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/from-ben-gurion-to-netanyahu-the-evolution-of-israel-s-national-security-strategy#:~:text=Netanyahu%20asserts%20that%20Israel%E2%80%99s%20security,be%20better%20characterized%20as%20human","text":"Netanyahu asserts that Israel\u2019s security rests on four main pillars.
