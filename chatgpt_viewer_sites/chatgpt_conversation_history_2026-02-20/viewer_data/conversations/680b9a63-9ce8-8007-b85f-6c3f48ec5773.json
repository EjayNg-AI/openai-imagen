In this paradigm, light propagating through optical circuits serves as qubits or qumodes (quantum modes), manipulated with beam splitters, phase shifters, and interferometers\u30101\u2020L131-L139\u3011\u30101\u2020L149-L158\u3011. Unlike matter-based quantum computers that use electrons, ions, or superconducting loops, photonic systems can operate at room temperature and naturally interface with quantum communication links\u30101\u2020L144-L152\u3011\u30101\u2020L159-L168\u3011. This report provides an academic-level overview of photonic quantum computing with a global focus. We present a **historical overview** of key concepts from the field\u2019s origins to the present, examine the **current state of research** including major players and platforms, compare photonic approaches to **matter-based quantum computing** (e.g. superconducting qubits and trapped ions) with an analysis of strengths and weaknesses, discuss the **scientific and engineering challenges** limiting photonic quantum computers today, and outline a **forward-looking roadmap** toward scalable and commercially viable photonic quantum computing. A consolidated list of key research papers and breakthroughs is provided at the end.\n\n## 1. Historical Overview of Photonic Quantum Computing  \n**Early Foundations (1980s\u20131990s):** The idea of using photons for quantum computation traces back to early quantum optics experiments and proposals. Photons, being fast and low-noise carriers of information, were recognized as ideal \u201cflying qubits\u201d for quantum communication and potentially computation\u30101\u2020L144-L152\u3011. However, photons do not naturally interact with each other, posing a fundamental challenge for building two-qubit logic gates. Early schemes explored **optical nonlinearities** (e.g. using Kerr media) to induce photon\u2013photon interactions, but direct nonlinear approaches proved extremely difficult with available technology. By the 1990s, researchers began investigating linear optics combined with measurements and **ancilla photons** as an alternative route to quantum computing\u30102\u2020L23-L31\u3011\u30102\u2020L39-L45\u3011. In 1994, Reck *et al.* showed that any arbitrary interferometer can be constructed from a mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters\u30101\u2020L159-L168\u3011\u30101\u2020L169-L175\u3011, laying a groundwork for thinking of optical circuits as universal interferometric processors.\n\n**The KLM Breakthrough (2001):** A seminal moment came in 2001 when Emanuel **Knill**, Raymond **Laflamme**, and Gerard **Milburn** (KLM) published a landmark Nature paper\u301016\u2020L508-L516\u3011. They proposed a scheme for **efficient quantum computation with linear optics** that uses beam splitters, phase shifters, **single-photon sources**, and photon detectors, along with **projective measurements**, to enact effective interactions between photons\u30102\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u30102\u2020L37-L45\u3011. The KLM protocol showed that **quantum gates can be realized probabilistically** \u2013 for example, a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate can succeed with a certain probability less than 1, and if the gate fails the attempt can be retried. Crucially, they proved **linear optical quantum computing is theoretically universal** for quantum computation\u30101\u2020L131-L139\u3011\u30101\u2020L159-L168\u3011. The trade-off is that KLM\u2019s gates are nondeterministic, requiring many auxiliary photons and **post-selection** (conditioning on detection outcomes). This opened the door to photonic quantum computing research by establishing that no exotic nonlinear optical materials were strictly necessary \u2013 ordinary linear optics could suffice, at the price of overhead in resources\u30102\u2020L71-L78\u3011\u30102\u2020L73-L81\u3011.\n\n**Early Experimental Milestones (2003\u20132010):** Following KLM, labs worldwide rushed to demonstrate basic photonic quantum logic. In 2003, several groups achieved the first **two-photon entangling gates** using linear optics. O\u2019Brien *et al.* and Pittman *et al.* independently demonstrated a photonic CNOT gate using beam splitters, optical interference, and photon detection to conditionally flip qubit states\u30102\u2020L29-L37\u3011. These early experiments were proof-of-principle, often with success probabilities on the order of a few percent and with just 2\u20134 photons. Another line of research pursued **entangled multi-photon states** and one-way quantum computing. In 2005, researchers generated small **cluster states** of photons (entangled graphs of 4\u20136 photons) and showed they could perform simple algorithms via sequential measurements (the **one-way quantum computer** model). \n\nBy the late 2000s, photonic quantum computing advanced with the integration of optics on chips. In 2008\u20132009, Jeremy O\u2019Brien\u2019s team at the University of Bristol demonstrated the first **silicon photonic quantum chips** that integrate waveguides and beam splitters on a miniature interferometric circuit\u301027\u2020L6-L10\u3011. Notably, in 2009 they implemented **Shor\u2019s algorithm to factor the number 15** on a photonic chip\u301031\u2020L1-L4\u3011 \u2013 a small-scale demonstration of a quantum algorithm using four photonic qubits to find 3\u00d75=15\u301030\u2020L9-L17\u3011. Around the same time, **Pan Jian-Wei\u2019s group** at USTC (China) and **Andrew White\u2019s group** in Australia also demonstrated factoring 15 with photonic qubits using bulk optical elements\u301030\u2020L21-L29\u3011. Though factoring 15 is a toy problem, these experiments were landmark **demonstrations of photonic quantum logic and algorithms** on a few-qubit scale. Researchers also showed **quantum teleportation** and entanglement distribution with photons over long distances in this period, highlighting photons\u2019 strength in communication tasks.\n\n**Boson Sampling and Quantum Advantage (2010s):** In 2011, Scott **Aaronson** and Alex **Arkhipov** introduced **Boson Sampling** \u2013 a proposal for a simplified photonic quantum computer that is not universal, but could solve specialized problems exponentially faster than classical computers\u301018\u2020L233-L242\u3011\u301018\u2020L238-L247\u3011. Boson sampling involves sending many indistinguishable photons through a large interferometer and sampling the output distribution. While not a general-purpose computer, it became a crucial stepping stone to demonstrate a quantum computational **advantage** (formerly \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d). Throughout the 2010s, incremental progress in boson-sampling experiments was made: proof-of-concept results with 3\u20135 photons (2013), then 6\u20138 photons, and so on. By 2017\u20132019, integrated photonic platforms could manage boson sampling with roughly a dozen photons detected, pushing into regimes hard to simulate on classical supercomputers\u301032\u2020L7-L14\u3011.\n\nA major breakthrough came in **December 2020** when Pan Jian-Wei\u2019s team unveiled **Jiuzhang 1.0**, a photonic quantum computer that performed Gaussian boson sampling with **76 detected photons** on average (up to 113 input photons)\u301023\u2020L103-L110\u3011\u301023\u2020L108-L114\u3011. They reported that Jiuzhang completed a boson-sampling task in 200 seconds that would take a classical supercomputer an estimated **2.5 billion years** to simulate\u301018\u2020L238-L247\u3011. This represents a quantum speedup by a factor of ~10^14 (100 trillion), an achievement heralded as reaching **quantum supremacy** in photonics\u301012\u2020L1361-L1369\u3011\u301012\u2020L1367-L1370\u3011. The result, published in *Science* in 2020, was the first definitive claim of a quantum computational advantage using photons\u301014\u2020L3238-L3246\u3011 \u2013 coming just a year after Google\u2019s 2019 superconducting-qubit supremacy experiment. This was quickly followed by **Jiuzhang 2.0** in 2021, which improved the photon count to 113 detected photons, and then by **Xanadu\u2019s** team in Canada who demonstrated their own photonic quantum advantage in mid-2022.\n\n**Integrated Photonics and Scaling Up (2020\u2013Present):** The **current decade** has seen photonic quantum computing enter a new phase with **programmable photonic processors** and substantial investments in scalability. In June 2022, **Xanadu** (Toronto, Canada) announced **Borealis**, a photonic quantum computer accessible via the cloud, which achieved a quantum advantage using **Gaussian boson sampling** with up to **219 photons (125 on average)**\u301023\u2020L103-L110\u3011\u301023\u2020L108-L114\u3011. Borealis is **fully programmable** in its interferometer settings, setting it apart from fixed optical networks. It completed a task in **36 microseconds** that would take a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer an estimated **9,000 years**\u301025\u2020L114-L122\u3011\u301025\u2020L115-L123\u3011, a staggering speedup of 12 orders of magnitude. This experiment, published in *Nature* (2022), cemented that photonics is a leading platform for quantum computational advantage\u301025\u2020L114-L122\u3011. Meanwhile, in 2023, Pan\u2019s group in China announced **Jiuzhang 3.0** with **255-photon** detection capability \u2013 a further leap in the scale of boson sampling experiments\u301038\u2020L81-L89\u3011\u301038\u2020L95-L104\u3011. According to their preprint, Jiuzhang 3.0 can generate a single boson-sampling output sample in 1.2 microseconds, whereas simulating that sample on the fastest supercomputer (Frontier) would take on the order of $6\\times10^2$ years (for one sample), and some instances would take ~$10^{10}$ years\u301038\u2020L95-L104\u3011\u301038\u2020L101-L109\u3011. This represents a **$10^{16}$ ($10$ quadrillion) speedup** over classical computing, extending the gap of photonic quantum advantage\u301038\u2020L81-L89\u3011\u301038\u2020L83-L90\u3011. These results underscore how rapidly photonic hardware has progressed in pushing the frontier of computational speed for specific tasks.\n\nIn parallel with record-setting experiments, there have been steady advances in the underlying **technologies**: development of high-quality **single-photon sources** (e.g. quantum dot emitters and parametric down-conversion sources), ultra-low-loss waveguides and optical fiber loops, fast optical **switches**, and superconducting **nanowire single-photon detectors** for readout. By late 2023, **PsiQuantum**, a startup founded by academic leaders in photonics, unveiled a manufacturable photonic quantum computing chipset called **Omega**\u301041\u2020L59-L68\u3011. The Omega chip integrates single-photon sources, beam splitters, phase modulators, and detectors on a semiconductor platform (silicon photonics) fabricated in a commercial CMOS foundry (GlobalFoundries)\u301041\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Impressively, it demonstrated fidelity benchmarks nearing 99.9% for single-qubit state preparation and >99.2% for two-qubit entangling operations called \u201cfusion\u201d gates\u301041\u2020L61-L68\u3011. This shows that **error rates in photonic circuits can approach fault-tolerance thresholds**, provided losses are minimized. The history of photonic quantum computing thus spans from fundamental theory in the 1990s, to proof-of-concept gates in the 2000s, to today\u2019s **cutting-edge photonic processors achieving tasks beyond any classical computer**.\n\n## 2. Current State of Photonic Quantum Computing Research  \nPhotonic quantum computing research today is vibrant and global, with efforts spanning academia, industry startups, and government labs. The field encompasses multiple technical approaches \u2013 from **discrete-variable photonics** (using individual photons as qubits, as in the KLM scheme) to **continuous-variable (CV) photonics** (using squeezed light and optical oscillators) \u2013 and a variety of hardware platforms (bulk optics vs. integrated chips). Below we survey the current state of the art, highlighting key players, platforms, and capabilities as of 2025:\n\n- **University Research Labs:** Academic groups remain at the forefront of photonic quantum information science. The **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, led by Jian-Wei Pan, is a world leader, having realized massive boson sampling experiments (Jiuzhang series) and multi-photon entanglement records. USTC\u2019s machines are generally free-space optical setups with dozens of mirrors, beam splitters, and **parametric down-conversion sources** to generate entangled photons\u301038\u2020L95-L104\u3011\u301038\u2020L101-L109\u3011. In Europe, groups like **University of Bristol** (UK) pioneered on-chip photonic circuits, and **Sapienza University of Rome** (Italy) has performed photonic quantum walks and intermediate-scale boson sampling. **Australian** universities (Queensland, Sydney) have a strong history in optical quantum computing, including early demonstrations of gates and cluster-state computing. **US** groups at MIT, NIST, and others work on integrated photonics and novel sources (e.g. quantum dot single-photon sources). **Japanese** researchers (e.g. at University of Tokyo, NTT) have advanced continuous-variable photonics, creating large entangled cluster states of light for one-way computing (achieving thousands of entangled modes via time-domain multiplexing). These academic efforts, often in collaboration across countries, continue to push the boundaries of both theory (e.g. new protocols for error correction) and experiments (e.g. increasing photon counts, demonstrating small algorithms).\n\n- **Startup Companies and Industry:** Several startups have emerged with the explicit goal of building scalable photonic quantum computers. **PsiQuantum** (U.S./UK) is a notable example \u2013 the company has raised significant funding (over $700M) and formed partnerships (e.g. with **GlobalFoundries**) to fabricate photonic chips in conventional semiconductor fabs\u301041\u2020L59-L67\u3011. PsiQuantum\u2019s approach is to use many identical photonic chips connected by optical fiber, implementing a **fusion-based quantum computing** architecture: single photons are generated on chip, then *fused* (entangled) via two-photon interference to gradually build up large entangled states for computation\u301041\u2020L77-L85\u3011. Their recent Omega chip demonstrations of high-fidelity sources and photonic circuits are critical milestones toward a million-qubit photonic quantum computer\u301041\u2020L59-L68\u3011\u301041\u2020L77-L85\u3011. **Xanadu** (Canada) is another key player \u2013 their focus is on **continuous-variable photonics** using squeezed light in fiber loops. Xanadu already offers cloud access to their photonic processors (first the 8-mode **X8** and 12-mode **X12**, and now the more powerful **Borealis** machine)\u301012\u2020L1359-L1367\u3011\u301012\u2020L1361-L1369\u3011. This allows researchers worldwide to run quantum algorithms (such as sampling problems or small optimization tasks) on photonic hardware over the internet, a significant step for accessibility. **Quandela** (France) has developed deterministic single-photon sources and in late 2022 launched what they called the first European photonic quantum computing platform in the cloud, based on a few photon qubits, showcasing Europe\u2019s commitment to the technology. Other startups include **QuiX Quantum** (Netherlands), building photonic quantum processors for quantum simulations, and **Lightmatter/LightOn**, which use photonic processors for specialized computing (though more for classical or neuromorphic computing than qubit-based quantum computing). Established companies like **Toshiba** and **Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)** also have photonic quantum information projects, especially in quantum cryptography and computing hybrids.\n\n- **Government and National Programs:** Photonic quantum computing features in national quantum initiatives across the globe. For instance, China\u2019s national quantum program has heavily supported USTC\u2019s photonic quantum computer development, leading to rapid progress (from Jiuzhang 1.0 through 3.0 in just three years). The EU\u2019s Quantum Flagship program includes projects on **quantum photonic integrated circuits**, aiming to develop on-chip light-based qubit systems. In the United States, agencies like DARPA and the Air Force Research Laboratory have awarded contracts to companies like PsiQuantum to develop utility-scale photonic quantum computers for strategic purposes (e.g., a recent $22.5M contract was aimed at a photonic quantum computing prototype with fault-tolerant architecture, in collaboration with GlobalFoundries). These investments underscore that photonic platforms are viewed as a compelling route to large-scale quantum computing, alongside superconducting and ion-trap approaches.\n\n**Current Capabilities:** Today\u2019s state-of-the-art photonic quantum devices can **generate and manipulate on the order of 50\u2013100 photons** (or modes) in sophisticated ways. For specialized tasks like boson sampling, they far exceed classical capabilities\u301025\u2020L114-L122\u3011. However, for general-purpose algorithms, photonic computers are still in the **prototype stage** with only a handful of qubits or logic gates realized in practice. No universal photonic quantum computer with error-corrected qubits exists yet, but pieces of the puzzle are coming together. Experimental **quantum logic gates** (like CNOT gates, Fredkin gates, etc.) have been demonstrated with photonic qubits at small scales. **Quantum simulators** for chemistry have been run on photonic hardware in rudimentary forms (e.g. variational algorithms using a few optical modes to find molecular energies). Continuous-variable photonic systems have produced large **entangled cluster states** (up to thousands of modes entangled in a time-multiplexed loop), which in principle could be used for one-way quantum computing if suitable error correction is applied. **Integrated photonic chips** now routinely incorporate 50+ components (phase shifters, beamsplitters, etc.) and can perform complex interference reliably. Moreover, photonic chips have demonstrated **high-fidelity operations** that rival other platforms \u2013 for example, the Omega chip\u2019s 99.5% two-photon interference visibility and 99.22% two-qubit gate fidelity are near the thresholds required for error correction\u301041\u2020L63-L70\u3011\u301041\u2020L65-L72\u3011. **Detectors** and **sources** have also improved: superconducting nanowire detectors can approach 95% detection efficiency with low noise, and quantum dot single-photon sources can generate photons on demand with high indistinguishability (~99% in some reports). \n\nIn summary, the current state of photonic quantum computing features **record-breaking demonstrations of quantum advantage**, **active development of programmable photonic processors**, and rapid progress in integrating optical components for scaling. Key industry and academic players around the world are now focused on transitioning from these physics experiments toward scalable, error-corrected photonic quantum computers.\n\n## 3. Photonic vs. Matter-Based Quantum Computing: Strengths and Weaknesses  \nQuantum computing can be implemented with various physical systems. The leading non-photonic (matter-based) approaches include **superconducting qubits** (used by IBM, Google, etc.) and **trapped-ion qubits** (used by IonQ, Quantinuum, etc.). Each technology has its own advantages and challenges. Here we compare photonic quantum computing with these matter-based approaches:\n\n- **Information Carriers:** Photonic computers use **photons** (light particles) to carry quantum information, whereas superconducting devices use currents in Josephson junction circuits, and trapped-ion systems use internal states of ions. Photons are intrinsically fast and **carry information at the speed of light**, which means photonic gates based on interference can, in principle, operate at very high rates (GHz or more). Matter qubits like superconductors and ions typically have gate times ranging from nanoseconds (superconducting) to microseconds or milliseconds (ions). Photons also **do not decohere easily** just by propagation \u2013 a photon traveling through vacuum or fiber largely maintains its quantum state (no spontaneous emission or coupling to stray fields), which is a strength in preserving coherence\u301018\u2020L238-L247\u3011\u301018\u2020L243-L249\u3011. By contrast, superconducting qubits can lose coherence in microseconds due to noise, and ions can decohere from ambient fields or motional heating (though trapped ions have impressively long coherence times on the order of seconds in some cases). However, photons can be lost (absorbed or scattered), which is a form of decoherence (an **\u201cerasure\u201d error** essentially). In matter qubits, loss of a qubit is not a typical error mode \u2013 instead, the qubit stays but its state dephases or has operational errors. Thus, photonic systems trade **decoherence times** for **loss sensitivity**.\n\n- **Interactions and Gates:** A major difference is how qubits interact. **Superconducting qubits** on a chip interact via electric/magnetic coupling tunable by circuit elements, enabling **deterministic two-qubit gates** (like controlled-phase gates) on demand. **Trapped ions** interact via collective motional modes\u2014using laser pulses, any pair of ions can be entangled deterministically (e.g. through M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gates). These matter-based platforms have *direct qubit\u2013qubit interactions* engineered by design. In contrast, **photons do not directly interact** in linear optical systems\u30102\u2020L21-L29\u3011. All multi-qubit gates in linear optics are achieved either *probabilistically* (as in the KLM scheme, where coincident detections herald gate success)\u30102\u2020L31-L39\u3011 or via intermediary matter systems (e.g. using an atom or quantum dot as a mediator, or using optical nonlinearities which are typically weak). The lack of deterministic interactions is a **fundamental weakness of photonic quantum computing** \u2013 it means that straightforward two-qubit gate operations succeed only with some probability < 1, requiring many attempts or adding extra overhead to boost success probability. This is why photonic approaches often rely on generating a large entangled resource state (like a cluster state) *offline*, and then performing computation by measurements on that state rather than doing sequential gates in realtime. **Boson sampling** itself avoids the need for explicit two-qubit gates by hard-wiring the entangling operation into an optical network, but it\u2019s limited to one class of computation\u301018\u2020L233-L242\u3011\u301018\u2020L238-L247\u3011. Summarily, **photonic gates are currently less straightforward than gates in matter-qubit systems** \u2013 superconducting and ion qubits can perform a universal gate set deterministically, while photonic qubits achieve universality with non-deterministic gates (hence requiring more resources and clever protocols). Recent progress (e.g. PsiQuantum\u2019s *fusion* gates) is closing this gap by improving photonic gate fidelity and success rates\u301041\u2020L63-L71\u3011\u301041\u2020L65-L72\u3011, but the challenge remains.\n\n- **Scalability and Integration:** Photonic systems have an edge in **potential scalability and communication**. Since photons can **be routed in fiber or free space across long distances with low loss**, photonic quantum computers can naturally be networked or distributed. It is feasible to envision modular photonic processors connected by optical links, because transmitting qubits as light between modules is relatively easy (no need for converting stationary qubits to flying qubits \u2013 they *are already flying* by nature)\u301018\u2020L268-L275\u3011\u301018\u2020L272-L279\u3011. Trapped ion and superconducting qubit systems, on the other hand, face challenges in scaling beyond a single processor module. Superconducting qubits are confined to a cryogenic chip; connecting two chips involves either wiring classical coax lines (for measurement outcomes) or developing photonic interconnects to convert microwave photons to optical (an area of active research). Trapped ions can be moved between traps or entangled via photonic links (ion-photon interfaces), but that introduces additional complexity and potential error. Thus, **for long-distance or distributed quantum computing, photonic qubits have a natural advantage**\u301018\u2020L268-L275\u3011. Photonics also leverages decades of progress in the telecom and semiconductor photonics industry \u2013 the same technology used to manufacture silicon photonic circuits for data centers can be used to make photonic quantum chips. This means, in principle, photonic qubit hardware could be mass-manufactured relatively *easily* once designs are validated\u301041\u2020L59-L68\u3011\u301041\u2020L69-L77\u3011. By contrast, superconducting qubit fabrication is highly specialized and not as easily transferred to high-volume foundries (though companies are exploring it), and trapped ion setups involve delicate vacuum and laser systems that are not yet commoditized.\n\n- **Operating Conditions:** Another strength of photonic quantum computers is their ability to operate **at room temperature or with minimal cooling**. Photons themselves don\u2019t require a cryogenic environment. Single-photon detectors often need cooling (superconducting nanowire detectors run at 2\u20134 K), but this is much milder than the millikelvin temperatures required for superconducting qubits. In fact, PsiQuantum\u2019s design eliminates dilution refrigerators entirely, using cooling at 2\u20134 K for the whole system, which is far simpler and cheaper than maintaining 10 milliKelvin for superconductors\u301041\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301041\u2020L71-L78\u3011. Trapped ions operate at room temperature vacuum chambers (though they need stable lasers), so ions and photons share the benefit of not requiring extreme cooling of the qubit *itself*. The **lower infrastructure overhead** could make photonic systems easier to deploy in ordinary data centers or even satellites (for quantum communication integration).\n\n- **Current Maturity and Quantum Volume:** Superconducting qubit platforms currently are the most advanced in **number of qubits and algorithmic demonstrations**. IBM has built devices with 127 qubits (as of 2021) and is aiming for >1000 qubits in a few years, with quantum error correction prototypes underway. These qubits can run small algorithms (e.g. variational chemistry simulations, optimization) with some success, although noise still limits them. Trapped ions achieve very high-fidelity gates (record >99.9%) and have demonstrated fully connected registers of ~20+ ions solving optimization problems or error-correcting a logical qubit for a short time. Photonic quantum computers *today* have demonstrated **quantum advantage in sampling tasks** (surpassing classical computers)\u301025\u2020L114-L122\u3011, but they have not yet executed a wide variety of algorithms or a universal gate set on a large scale. A fair comparison is that **photonic systems excel at certain tasks (like boson sampling or quantum communications)**, while superconducting/ion systems currently excel at **general gate-based computations on small numbers of qubits**. In terms of **error rates**, photonic systems are catching up: superconducting qubits have 1\u20132% error per two-qubit gate typically, trapped ions ~0.1\u20131%, and photonic fusion gates are now reported around 0.78% error\u301041\u2020L61-L68\u3011\u301041\u2020L63-L70\u3011 (i.e. ~99.22% fidelity). The photon loss rate in large optical circuits is still a concern \u2013 a 50-photon experiment might lose several photons during operations, which is a significant error if uncorrected \u2013 whereas matter qubits don\u2019t \u201cdisappear\u201d during computation. But ongoing improvements in photonic component quality promise to reduce loss and error rates further.\n\nIn summary, **photonic quantum computing\u2019s strengths** include *high-speed operation, low decoherence of flying qubits, natural ability to network, and use of room-temperature/semiconductor photonics technology*. Its **weaknesses** include *lack of deterministic interactions, sensitivity to loss, and currently fewer demonstrations of broad algorithms*. **Superconducting qubit computers** offer *strong control over interactions and are ahead in qubit count*, but need extreme cooling and face wiring/connectivity challenges. **Trapped-ion computers** offer *excellent fidelity and long coherence*, but have slower gates and require complex laser control, making rapid scaling difficult. The best approach may ultimately be hybrid: for example, using photonic interconnects to link matter-based quantum modules, or using matter qubits as quantum memory and photons as communication/execution channels\u301018\u2020L268-L275\u3011\u301018\u2020L272-L279\u3011. Each platform\u2019s strengths can complement the others, but photonics clearly stands out in the **integration of computing and communication** in one platform\u30101\u2020L144-L152\u3011, and in the promise of manufacturability and deployment at scale.\n\n## 4. Major Challenges in Photonic Quantum Computing  \nDespite remarkable progress, significant **scientific and engineering challenges** must be overcome to move photonic quantum computing from laboratory demonstrations to practical, large-scale systems. Here we outline the major hurdles limiting advancement today:\n\n- **Single-Photon Sources:** A foundational requirement is the ability to generate **indistinguishable single photons** on demand. Most experiments to date have used **spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)** in nonlinear crystals, which produce photon pairs probabilistically \u2013 heralding one photon by detecting its partner\u301042\u2020L321-L329\u3011. SPDC sources have limitations: they can produce zero or multiple photon pairs with certain probabilities, leading to inherently probabilistic outputs and requiring careful synchronization and filtering. Achieving deterministic single-photon generation with high purity and efficiency is challenging. **Quantum dot** emitters in semiconductors have shown promise as near-deterministic single-photon sources (when optically or electrically excited, a quantum dot can emit one photon at a time). However, collecting that photon into a circuit with high efficiency and making each emitted photon identical (same spectrum, polarization, etc.) remains difficult. The state-of-art sources can have brightness (efficiency) on the order of 50\u201380% and indistinguishability >90%, but scaling an array of identical sources is nontrivial. Without reliable photon sources, photonic processors must often employ **resource-intensive multiplexing** \u2013 using many SPDC sources in parallel and gating the output photons to use only successful emissions. This adds complexity and optical loss. Therefore, improving single-photon sources (through better quantum dot cavities, integrated SPDC waveguides, or emerging sources like two-dimensional materials) is a top priority.\n\n- **Optical Loss and Scaling:** **Loss is the Achilles\u2019 heel** of photonic quantum computing. Every optical component (fiber, beam splitter, mirror, waveguide, etc.) has some chance of absorbing or scattering a photon. In small setups with few components, losses are manageable, but as circuits scale up to many modes and operations, the probability that *all* photons survive through the computation drops exponentially if loss per component is not extremely low. For instance, consider creating a 50-photon entangled state: if each photon has a 95% chance to make it through the circuit, the chance all 50 survive is $(0.95)^{50} \\approx 7.7\\%$. This is why many experimental photonic demonstrations with high photon counts have low overall success rates \u2013 most trials fail due to lost photons, and one only registers the rare successful runs. Loss also complicates **error correction** because a lost photon is an erasure error that must be detected and handled by the code (often requiring additional redundancy). To combat loss, researchers are developing **ultra-low-loss components**. This includes using low-loss materials (silicon nitride waveguides, fused silica interferometers), better anti-reflection coatings, and cryogenic operation for some devices to reduce scattering. The Omega photonic chip\u2019s use of **Barium Titanate (BTO)** for low-loss, fast switching is one approach to maintain low loss while adding functionality\u301041\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301041\u2020L71-L78\u3011. Integrated photonics can be optimized for very low propagation loss (<0.1% per cm in some platforms), and novel **photonic crystal waveguides** or **hollow-core fibers** might further reduce losses. Nonetheless, achieving *near-unity throughput* in a complex photonic network remains a significant challenge \u2013 one that must be solved for scalable photonic quantum computers.\n\n- **Two-Photon Entangling Operations (Fusion Gates):** As discussed, photons do not natively interact, so entangling them usually involves interference and measurement. A key operation in many photonic architectures is the **fusion gate** (or Bell measurement): interfering two photons on a beam splitter and detecting them in certain patterns can project other photons (entangled with these) into an entangled (fused) state. Fusion gates are inherently probabilistic \u2013 for example, a particular detection click pattern might succeed in entangling two photonic qubits with 50% probability. If the attempt fails (different detector clicks), the photons might be lost or the state un-entangled. Improving the **success probability and fidelity of photonic entangling gates** is an active area. One strategy is **time multiplexing**: if a gate fails, one can try again with the same photons by storing them briefly (e.g. in a fiber delay loop) and then re-interfering. Another approach is to use **ancilla photons and feed-forward** control to effectively achieve a near-deterministic gate \u2013 this is related to the original KLM idea of using multiple ancillas to boost success probability via teleportation. However, feed-forward (the ability to change the optical circuit on the fly based on measurement outcomes) needs ultra-fast optical switches and modulators, because decisions must be made at the speed of photons traveling (often within nanoseconds between components). Designing a circuitry that can rapidly route photons based on previous detections is challenging but necessary for scaling. **High-speed Pockels cells** or electro-optic modulators can do this, but they often introduce loss and require strong electrical pulses. The engineering problem is making these fast optical switches low-loss and integrable. The reported fidelity ~99.2% for PsiQuantum\u2019s **two-photon \u201cfusion\u201d gate** is encouraging\u301041\u2020L61-L68\u3011\u301041\u2020L65-L72\u3011, but further improvements toward 99.9% and making gates nearer to deterministic (via redundancy) will be critical. Moreover, for continuous-variable platforms, achieving high-quality **squeezed states** and interference such that entanglement (in cluster states) is high fidelity is the parallel challenge \u2013 CV entangling operations can be deterministic in principle, but are limited by squeezing level and optical loss.\n\n- **Error Correction in Photonic Systems:** No large-scale quantum computer can function without quantum error correction (QEC) to overcome noise and loss. Photonic qubits pose special challenges for QEC. Many error-correction codes assume qubits are always present and occasionally flip or dephase. Photons, however, can disappear entirely (loss error), so codes and **error-detection schemes** must be able to handle erasures. Luckily, erasure errors are easier to detect (a missing photon can be noticed by a lack of click in a detector), so some protocols treat loss in a way that the error is known and thus slightly easier to correct than an unknown qubit flip. Nonetheless, implementing QEC requires redundantly encoding one logical qubit into many physical photonic qubits. This might take the form of **entangled cluster states for fault tolerance** or concatenated bosonic codes. One promising avenue in photonics is to use **bosonic codes** in optical modes \u2013 for example, the **Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code** encoding a qubit into a grid of squeezed state superpositions in a single optical mode. Such encodings spread quantum information within one mode in a way that certain errors (shifts in phase space) can be detected and corrected. There have been theoretical proposals and some small demonstrations of GKP states in optics, but generating high-quality GKP states is quite challenging (it requires very high squeezing or photon number states). Another approach is **quantum parity codes** using multiple photons \u2013 e.g. encoding a qubit in a single photon being in multiple paths (a multi-rail code) so that if one path\u2019s photon is lost, some information remains in the others. This trades complexity for some loss tolerance. Overall, photonic QEC will likely involve **large entangled states** and **frequent measurements** to check for errors (losses or other errors). The sheer resource overhead is enormous: estimates for fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computing suggest needing thousands of photons (physical qubits) per logical qubit using standard codes\u30102\u2020L39-L45\u3011\u30102\u2020L43-L48\u3011. This overhead could be reduced by more efficient codes or using fusion-based techniques that localize errors. As of 2025, no photonic experiment has demonstrated a fully error-corrected qubit, though there are first steps (e.g. small redundancy codes that detect a single photon loss). Achieving QEC in photonics is thus a major scientific milestone that lies ahead.\n\n- **Timing, Synchronization, and Distinguishability:** In photonic circuits, especially those using many **independent sources**, all photons must be **indistinguishable** (same wavelength, bandwidth, polarization, etc.) and **arrive simultaneously** at interferometers to interfere properly. This demands precise timing synchronization down to sub-picosecond scales for photons traveling through different paths. If one photon is even slightly delayed relative to another, the interference visibility drops, degrading entangling operations\u301041\u2020L63-L70\u3011. In small experiments, this is handled with fixed optical delays and careful alignment. But in a large machine with many components, active synchronization will be needed. This could involve electronic timing control, optical phase-locked loops, or cavity locking for sources. Mode matching between photons is another aspect \u2013 photons from different sources might have different spectral profiles; filtering them to a common shape can induce loss. Thus, simultaneously optimizing indistinguishability and brightness is an ongoing challenge in source engineering. Additionally, managing **time-multiplexed** photons (as in loop-based architectures like Borealis) requires storing photons in delay lines that keep them coherent. Long delay lines can suffer loss and noise (especially if fiber delays are tens of meters long, the loss can be significant). Research is being conducted into low-loss optical buffers or even converting photons to long-lived quantum memory in matter (e.g. storing a photon in an atomic ensemble and retrieving later) to act as a quantum delay line, though this adds complexity.\n\n- **Detection and Readout:** Photonic computing relies on measuring photons, often in single-photon detectors or homodyne detectors (for CV measurements). For qubit approaches, single-photon detectors need near-unity efficiency and low dark count rates so that measurement doesn\u2019t become the bottleneck for errors. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have made great strides, with efficiencies >95% and count rates of tens of MHz, which is generally sufficient for current experiments. However, a large-scale photonic quantum computer might need thousands or millions of detectors all working in parallel at high rates. Scaling up detector arrays (while maintaining low noise and cooling them, since SNSPDs need cryogenic operation) is non-trivial. There are proposals for on-chip **photon number resolving detectors** (to distinguish 0, 1, 2,... photons in a pulse), which would help in certain architectures (like Gaussian boson sampling uses slight number resolving ability). Transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors can resolve photon number, but they are slower and require very low temperatures. **Readout bandwidth** is also a factor \u2013 one needs to process the detection signals and perhaps feed them back into the system quickly for feed-forward. That means fast electronics and classical computing in the loop with the photonic system, adding another engineering layer.\n\nIn summary, while photonic quantum computing has shown spectacular one-off feats, scaling to a general, robust quantum computer demands overcoming **engineering obstacles (source quality, component loss, integration, detectors)** and **physics obstacles (heralding entanglement, correcting errors, synchronizing many photons)**. Many of these challenges are actively being addressed by the community: for example, integrated photonic chips like Omega aim to minimize loss and provide stable, manufacturable components\u301041\u2020L59-L67\u3011\u301041\u2020L69-L77\u3011, and new theoretical protocols seek to reduce the resource overhead for photonic error correction\u30102\u2020L39-L45\u3011\u30102\u2020L43-L48\u3011. The next section outlines a roadmap of how these challenges might be surmounted on the path to scalable photonic quantum computers.\n\n## 5. Roadmap to Scalable and Commercial Photonic Quantum Computing  \nTransitioning photonic quantum computing from today\u2019s prototypes to tomorrow\u2019s large-scale, fault-tolerant machines will require a coordinated roadmap of technological breakthroughs and engineering integration. Here we sketch a forward-looking roadmap, highlighting key steps and milestones toward scalability, widespread adoption, and commercial viability:\n\n**Near-Term (1\u20133 years):** In the immediate future, we can expect **incremental improvements and demonstrations**. Research groups and companies will aim to **increase photon numbers and circuit complexity** in experiments. We may see, for example, boson sampling with >300 photons, pushing further beyond classical simulability. Importantly, there will be efforts to demonstrate **small-scale error correction** in photonic systems. A possible  milestone would be encoding a logical qubit in a photonic code (like a small 3-photon repetition code or a bosonic mode GKP code) and showing it has longer coherence or can be reliably transmitted even with some photon loss. **Source and detector integration** on chip will advance \u2013 we might see chips that include on-board quantum dot sources coupled directly into waveguides, feeding into interferometers, and then into on-chip SNSPD detectors, all in one package. This integration would reduce coupling losses (no more fiber coupling in/out of chip) and increase stability. \n\nWe also anticipate the launch of **cloud-accessible photonic quantum processors** by more platforms. Xanadu\u2019s Borealis is already online; others like Quandela and perhaps PsiQuantum (in partnership with national labs) might put early devices on the cloud for developers to experiment with. On the software side, improved **programming frameworks** (like Xanadu\u2019s Strawberry Fields or QuiX\u2019s software) will make it easier to program photonic chips, especially as they become more configurable. During this phase, photonic quantum computers will still be mostly in the lab or cloud and used by specialized researchers, not yet performing broad commercial applications. However, they could start to show utility in niche areas like generating certified random numbers (using the inherent quantum randomness of boson sampling outputs) or simulating specific quantum systems (e.g. molecular vibronic spectra via Gaussian boson sampling, which has applications in chemistry).\n\n**Mid-Term (4\u20137 years):** In this period, the roadmap envisions tackling **scalability through modularity and error correction**. A crucial target is to achieve a **demonstration of a fault-tolerant logical qubit** in a photonic platform. This might involve building a sizeable entangled resource state (for instance, a large 3D cluster state for a topological code, or a concatenated code using many photons) and using it to store a qubit with active error correction. Achieving even a single logical qubit that outperforms a physical one would be a watershed moment \u2013 it would validate the whole approach as viable for scaling. PsiQuantum\u2019s plan, for instance, is to use fusion-based entangling to create a giant cluster state that encodes logical qubits in a fault-tolerant way; by this mid-term, they aim to have enough physical qubits (maybe on the order of a few hundred thousand photons and thousands of sources) to encode one or a few logical qubits with error correction.\n\nTechnologically, this phase will see **specialized hardware infrastructure** being built. For example, **Quantum Data Centers** or **Quantum Compute Centers** might emerge where multiple photonic racks are installed. PsiQuantum has announced plans for quantum data centers in places like Chicago and Bristol to house their first machines\u301041\u2020L79-L87\u3011. These would be the photonic analog of today\u2019s supercomputers \u2013 large installations with many optical components, likely requiring cryogenic cooling (but at Kelvin temperatures, integrated with industrial cryo-coolers as mentioned)\u301041\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301041\u2020L71-L78\u3011. Photonic chips will be networked together via optical fiber with precise timing. Achieving **millions of photons per second through a system** with synchronization will require significant engineering \u2013 expect the development of high-speed optical **switch networks** to direct photons where needed, and perhaps photonic **chip-to-chip interconnects** with >99% fidelity over tens of meters (Omega already demonstrated 99.72% inter-chip quantum link fidelity over 250 m of fiber\u301041\u2020L63-L70\u3011\u301041\u2020L77-L81\u3011, which is encouraging). \n\nBy the end of this mid-term stage (say ~2030), the goal would be a photonic quantum computer with on the order of **10\u201350 logical qubits**. Such a machine, if achieved, could start performing **useful quantum algorithms** that outstrip classical abilities \u2013 e.g. solving certain optimization or algebraic problems, running simplified versions of Shor\u2019s algorithm on meaningful numbers, or simulating complex quantum systems that are classically intractable. This would mark the beginning of **commercial viability**: companies and governments could start using photonic quantum computers for real-world tasks (cryptography, drug discovery, material science simulations, etc.), likely via cloud access or dedicated centers.\n\n**Long-Term (8\u201315 years):** In the long run, the roadmap aims for truly **large-scale, general-purpose quantum computers** built on photonic technology. This means reaching **hundreds or thousands of logical qubits**, requiring perhaps **millions of physical photonic qubits**. Achieving this scale will rely on the foundations laid earlier: error correction that works, modular architecture, and integrated manufacturing. If photonic quantum computing succeeds, by this stage we would see **quantum computers that are assembled like modern supercomputers** \u2013 with racks of photonic chips, fiber bundles connecting them, and possibly hybrid interposers connecting photonic chips to conventional electronic control hardware. Widespread adoption will depend on whether these machines can solve problems of high value. We anticipate that if all goes well, photonic quantum computers could tackle problems like breaking certain cryptographic codes (Shor\u2019s algorithm on RSA would require thousands of logical qubits), or solving large instances of optimization problems faster than classical algorithms (impacting logistics, finance, etc.), or simulating complex molecules and materials at the quantum level (impacting pharmaceuticals and energy). \n\nTo reach commercial viability, costs need to come down as well. Photonic hardware should leverage **economies of scale** in the photonics and semiconductor industries. Unlike some other quantum tech, photonics can piggyback on existing fabrication infrastructure for photonic integrated circuits. If each photonic chip can be made on a wafer with many chips per wafer and good yield, the cost per qubit can drop significantly. Also, photonic systems might be easier to maintain \u2013 no need for as ultra-low temperatures or precision calibration of many microwave lines, etc. This could mean lower operational expenses. \n\nWe also expect photonic quantum computers to become part of **hybrid systems**. For instance, a future quantum computer might use photonic qubits for some processes and couple to superconducting qubits for others, or use trapped ions as memory nodes that interface with photonic processors. Already, companies like Quantinuum (Honeywell + Cambridge Quantum) plan ion-trap processors that communicate via photonic links, which could be extended to link with photonic processors. Photonic quantum computers might also serve as **quantum network nodes** themselves, doubling as servers in a quantum internet due to their communication-friendly nature\u301018\u2020L268-L275\u3011\u301046\u2020L7-L10\u3011. This dual role could spur adoption \u2013 a photonic quantum computer at a data center could perform computation and also securely communicate quantum information to other sites, enabling new cloud architectures.\n\nFinally, achieving **fault tolerance** at scale with photonics would be a monumental scientific and engineering feat, likely making photonic approaches one of the frontrunners in the quantum computing race. The next decade will be crucial for validating if the theoretical scalability of photonics (with its ability to use massive parallelization and networking) can be practically realized given the challenges of sources and loss. If successful, photonic quantum computing might become the workhorse for **ubiquitous quantum computing applications** in the mid-21st century.\n\n## Conclusion  \nPhotonic quantum computing has evolved from a theoretical concept into a burgeoning field showcasing some of the most dramatic quantum computational feats to date. The historical journey from the KLM protocol in 2001\u301016\u2020L508-L516\u3011 to **Jiuzhang\u2019s** quantum supremacy in 2020\u301018\u2020L238-L247\u3011 and **Borealis\u2019s** cloud-based advantage in 2022\u301025\u2020L114-L122\u3011 highlights both the ingenuity and challenges in using light for computing. Today\u2019s state-of-the-art photonic systems are pushing boundaries with novel platforms (integrated photonic chips, time-multiplexed loops) and achieving tasks no classical computer can do, albeit in specialized domains. When compared to matter-based qubit systems, photonics stands out in some areas (speed, connectivity) while lagging in others (gate determinism, maturity of error correction). The field faces formidable hurdles \u2013 from perfecting single-photon sources to engineering large low-loss circuits and implementing error correction \u2013 but progress on all these fronts is evident. With strong efforts worldwide, photonic quantum computing is on a roadmap that leads from today\u2019s few-qubit demonstrations toward tomorrow\u2019s million-qubit, fault-tolerant machines. If that roadmap is realized, we can expect photonic quantum computers to become a cornerstone of both fundamental science and practical technology, enabling breakthroughs in computation while seamlessly linking into the global fiber-optic network that our modern world is built on.\n\n## Key Research Papers and Technological Breakthroughs (Chronological)  \n\n- **1999 \u2013 Adami & Cerf propose linear optics for quantum computing:** Early conceptual work suggesting quantum computation using linear optical elements\u301016\u2020L500-L508\u3011.  \n- **2001 \u2013 Knill, Laflamme & Milburn (KLM) linear optics scheme:** Nature paper demonstrating that efficient quantum computation is possible with linear optics, single photons, and post-selection\u301016\u2020L508-L516\u3011.
