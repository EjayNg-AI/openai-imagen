We have\r\n0:05\r\nsome questions from the troopers which\r\n0:09\r\nwe will answer at this time. First one\r\n0:12\r\nmaybe uh a classic question with a\r\n0:15\r\nlittle spin on it. Let's go. Okay. All\r\n0:17\r\nright. Uh okay. My son's dream since he\r\n0:20\r\nwas 8 years old is to be a Navy Seal.\r\n0:22\r\nHe's now in co he's a college freshman\r\n0:24\r\nnow business management major NOTC\r\n0:27\r\nprogram. He's intelligent, hardworker,\r\n0:29\r\nstrong-minded, patriot, and athletically\r\n0:33\r\nsuperb. He was not excited to join\r\n0:35\r\ncollege because all he thinks about is\r\n0:37\r\nto be a seal in college is quote unquote\r\n0:39\r\nis not his thing, but due to his\r\n0:41\r\neyesight and medical advice was that\r\n0:44\r\nvision correction surgery would not\r\n0:46\r\nhappen until he turns 21. My husband and\r\n0:48\r\nI encouraged him to go to school until\r\n0:50\r\nhis vision is corrected. We believe that\r\n0:52\r\neducation is important, especially if he\r\n0:54\r\nwishes to run for office one day.\r\n0:56\r\nRecently, he has expressed that he wants\r\n0:58\r\nto leave school, return home and work,\r\n1:00\r\nand maybe attend college for a few\r\n1:02\r\nclasses until he's 21. He has no\r\n1:04\r\ninterest in being an officer because he\r\n1:06\r\nwants to be the quote unquote first\r\n1:07\r\nboots on the ground. If he becomes an\r\n1:10\r\nofficer, he would not be able to do\r\n1:11\r\nthat. My fear is that he could be he\r\n1:14\r\ncould be just fascinated by the movies,\r\n1:17\r\nbooks, books he reads, and how cool it\r\n1:19\r\nis to be a SEAL. I support him with all\r\n1:21\r\nmy heart, but I'm very scared he would\r\n1:23\r\nlose an education opportunity. I\r\n1:25\r\ncontinue to advise him without pushing\r\n1:27\r\ntoo hard and finish and to finish school\r\n1:29\r\nso he'll have something to fall back on.\r\n1:31\r\nBut he believes that failure is not an\r\n1:33\r\noption and if he fails, it's his choice.\r\n1:37\r\nI don't believe nor wish that he would\r\n1:39\r\nfail, but his father and I have been\r\n1:40\r\nthrough life and we believe in backup\r\n1:42\r\nplans. How do I direct him in a positive\r\n1:44\r\nway and how to find peace with his\r\n1:47\r\ndecision if he decides to leave college?\r\n1:49\r\nWe appreciate your services. God bless.\r\n1:51\r\nUh so I look at it like this. The easy\r\n1:53\r\nthe easiest part of this question is the\r\n1:55\r\nactual little question here, which is\r\n1:59\r\nhow do I um direct him in a positive way\r\n2:02\r\nto find peace if he decided to leave\r\n2:04\r\ncollege? Like if he leaves college, it's\r\n2:07\r\nnot that big of a deal. You go to\r\n2:08\r\ncollege when you're 20, when you're 19,\r\n2:11\r\nwhen you're 25, when you're 23, like you\r\n2:13\r\ncan go to college. College is not that\r\n2:16\r\nbig of a deal. You can go when you're\r\n2:18\r\n30, you can go if you're 33, right? So\r\n2:21\r\nit's not that big of a deal.\r\n2:23\r\nSo, if he, and by the way, if you've got\r\n2:25\r\nyour kids going to college and it costs\r\n2:27\r\nmoney to go to college and he's not into\r\n2:29\r\nit, he's not learning anything, he's not\r\n2:30\r\npaying attention, he's not getting\r\n2:31\r\nstraight A's, he's not developing a\r\n2:32\r\nplan, he's not networking with people,\r\n2:34\r\nhe's not doing internships to find a\r\n2:36\r\nfollow- on job, you see what I'm saying,\r\n2:37\r\nit's just a big freaking waste. Yeah.\r\n2:40\r\nSo, if he's like, \"Hey, I don't want to\r\n2:42\r\ngo to college anymore.\" Be like, \"Cool.\r\n2:43\r\nLet's keep that money. let me have my\r\n2:46\r\nmoney back that I'm paying for you to go\r\n2:47\r\nto college and you go get a job and you\r\n2:51\r\ncan pay for rent, right? Because I think\r\n2:53\r\nit's important you want to pull out of\r\n2:54\r\ncollege. Cool. Cuz I'm supporting you\r\n2:56\r\ncuz it's a long-term investment in your\r\n2:58\r\nfuture, which I'm doing so that someday\r\n3:00\r\nwhen I'm old, you can take care of me.\r\n3:01\r\nThere's a there's the return on\r\n3:02\r\ninvestment there, right? Of course, you\r\n3:04\r\nwant your kid to do well. You want them\r\n3:05\r\nto be more successful for you. That's\r\n3:07\r\ngreat. But you're also paying so that\r\n3:08\r\nwhen you get old, someone's going to be\r\n3:10\r\nable to take care of you. So, there's a\r\n3:12\r\nlittle return on investment that you're\r\n3:14\r\nlooking for. and you're investing in\r\n3:15\r\nthem so they can make more money in the\r\n3:17\r\nfuture. There's a a bunch of reasons for\r\n3:18\r\nthat.\r\n3:20\r\nSo, if he wants to pull out of college,\r\n3:21\r\nI don't think it's that big of a deal.\r\n3:22\r\nAnd by the way, I am a person that\r\n3:24\r\ndoesn't believe you need to go to\r\n3:25\r\ncollege at all. Like, you can be an\r\n3:27\r\nelectrician, a plumber, a welder.\r\n3:29\r\nThere's all kinds of jobs you can get\r\n3:31\r\nthat you don't have to go to college to\r\n3:32\r\ndo. And by the way, there's white, you\r\n3:34\r\ncould be a go in the finance industry\r\n3:37\r\nwith very without going to college,\r\n3:39\r\ncertain financial jobs. So there's\r\n3:41\r\nthings that you could do to to have a\r\n3:43\r\ncareer, whatever. So if he's going to\r\n3:45\r\ndrop out of college, that's cool. Just\r\n3:46\r\nmake sure that he's an adult now and he\r\n3:47\r\nunderstands that. And if he wants to\r\n3:49\r\nmove home,\r\n3:51\r\nuh, cool, he can get a job and he can\r\n3:54\r\ncontribute to household expenses, i.e.\r\n3:56\r\nyou have to pay the mortgage, so he can\r\n3:57\r\nhelp with rent. You have to pay for\r\n3:58\r\nfood. He can help pay for food. You\r\n4:00\r\nknow, you could that cell phone that's\r\n4:02\r\nin your pocket. Yep. You can give me 80\r\n4:03\r\nbucks a month. You see what I'm saying?\r\n4:06\r\nIf he wants to do that, fine. But he has\r\n4:07\r\nto understand what that means. College\r\n4:09\r\nis a privilege. College is a gift. If\r\n4:11\r\nyou're not taking advantage of it, don't\r\n4:12\r\ngo there. And by the way, if my kid was\r\n4:14\r\ngoing to college and not be not putting\r\n4:16\r\nout and getting into it, I'd be like,\r\n4:18\r\n\"Oh, yeah, you're cut off. We're not\r\n4:20\r\nsending you. It's a waste of freaking\r\n4:21\r\nmoney.\" So, I think that would be fine.\r\n4:24\r\nAnd it's not going to change the\r\n4:25\r\ntrajectory of his life. In fact, if he\r\n4:27\r\ngets a job doing some entry-level job\r\n4:29\r\nsomewhere, he's going to learn a lot.\r\n4:32\r\nHe's going to learn a lot about life and\r\n4:34\r\nabout value and about work effort.\r\n4:38\r\nSo, I think that's the easy part. He\r\n4:39\r\nwants to drop out of college for a\r\n4:40\r\nwhile, cool. Drop out of college. You\r\n4:42\r\nwant to come home, get a job, you want\r\n4:43\r\nto start working as a laborer on a\r\n4:44\r\nconstruction site, go do it. It'd be\r\n4:46\r\nawesome. It's going to be good for you.\r\n4:47\r\nYou want to come and you want to get a\r\n4:49\r\njob at a restaurant being a bus boy, you\r\n4:51\r\nknow, work your way up to being a waiter\r\n4:53\r\nafter a few years. You know what I'm\r\n4:55\r\nsaying? People don't realize, oh, no,\r\n4:57\r\nit's hard work. Mhm. So, let's think\r\n5:00\r\nabout that. You want to come and you\r\n5:01\r\nwant to join the work force at 19? Cool.\r\n5:04\r\nCome and join it. You will go back to\r\n5:06\r\nschool. You may decide to go back to\r\n5:07\r\nschool in two years like, \"Yep, I'm\r\n5:08\r\ngoing to college. I'm getting a degree.\r\n5:09\r\nThis is what I'm interested. I don't\r\n5:10\r\nwant to have to do that type of work.\r\n5:12\r\nHere's what I want to do.\" Good. You got\r\n5:13\r\na plan now. So, I like that. You want to\r\n5:16\r\npull out of college? Cool. We're done. I\r\n5:18\r\nthink that's easy. And he's got plenty\r\n5:20\r\nof time and he'd do a better job. Dude,\r\n5:22\r\nI went to college when I was 28 years\r\n5:25\r\nold. What a freaking like you ever you\r\n5:27\r\nknow the kids that get held back so\r\n5:29\r\nthey're like in school in high school so\r\n5:32\r\nthey're you know older than the other\r\n5:34\r\nkids they can kick ass in wrestling or\r\n5:36\r\nwhat you know in wrestling. Yeah. Fully\r\n5:39\r\nor football. Yeah. Yeah. Or football or\r\n5:41\r\nwhatever. So they're grown men. Dude,\r\n5:44\r\nthat's what that's what it was like when\r\n5:45\r\nI went to college. Yeah. I was a fully\r\n5:48\r\nformed adult male. Yeah. with 10 years\r\n5:54\r\nof labor under my belt of in the\r\n5:56\r\nworkforce supporting myself and a\r\n5:58\r\nfamily. You think I'm not ready to rock\r\n6:00\r\nand roll in college? That's so it wasn't\r\n6:02\r\neven it wasn't even fair. Straight A's,\r\n6:04\r\ndude. You could not stop me.\r\n6:07\r\nIf I went to college when I was 18, it'd\r\n6:09\r\nbe like, uh, how's that working out for\r\n6:11\r\nyou? I'm an idiot. So, I think that is\r\n6:14\r\ntotally fine. I think the hard part\r\n6:16\r\nabout this question is whether or not\r\n6:19\r\nyou want to\r\n6:22\r\nencourage him or discourage him from\r\n6:25\r\njoining the Navy for an attempt at being\r\n6:29\r\na SEAL because the training is really\r\n6:30\r\nhard and 80% of people don't make it.\r\n6:34\r\nAnd 100% of the people don't think\r\n6:37\r\nthey're part of that 80%. 100% of the\r\n6:40\r\npeople think they're going to make it.\r\n6:42\r\n100% of the parents think they're going\r\n6:43\r\nto make it. Maybe that's not true. maybe\r\n6:45\r\n90%.\r\n6:48\r\nAnd so\r\n6:50\r\nyou think you're going to make it. And\r\n6:51\r\nby the way, of the 80%, the 80% that\r\n6:55\r\ndon't make it,\r\n6:57\r\n75% of those that don't make it, of the\r\n7:00\r\n80% are studs.\r\n7:03\r\nThey're freaking studs. They're varsity\r\n7:06\r\nathletes, multiple sports. They're\r\n7:07\r\ncollegiate athletes. They're\r\n7:09\r\nprofessional athletes. They're Olympic\r\n7:11\r\nathletes.\r\n7:14\r\nThey're Ivy League educated\r\n7:17\r\nand countless of those type of people\r\n7:19\r\nwhich are as you put it like\r\n7:21\r\nintelligent, hardworking, strong-minded,\r\n7:22\r\npatriotic, and athletically superb means\r\n7:25\r\nnothing. Those guys quit by the bushel.\r\n7:29\r\nBy the bushel they quit.\r\n7:33\r\nSo, no one thinks that it's going to be\r\n7:35\r\nthem.\r\n7:37\r\nNo one thinks it's going to be them, but\r\n7:38\r\nit is them.\r\n7:41\r\nhim stating that he doesn't want to be\r\n7:42\r\nan officer because he wants to be first\r\n7:43\r\nboots on the ground. It's an\r\n7:44\r\nunderstandable idea. Uh but the chance\r\n7:47\r\nthat he would not be able to become an\r\n7:49\r\nofficer anyways because he's like uh not\r\n7:53\r\neven focused on school,\r\n7:57\r\nyou know what I mean? You're not going\r\n7:58\r\nto be a person like the kids that are\r\n8:00\r\ngetting picked up as officers. They're\r\n8:02\r\nfreaking not only studs, but they've\r\n8:05\r\nbeen focused since they were 14 years\r\n8:07\r\nold on getting the grades and the SAT\r\n8:11\r\nscores and the ACT scores and the\r\n8:13\r\nrecommendations and the community\r\n8:15\r\nservice and the athletic leadership.\r\n8:17\r\nThey're getting all those things chocked\r\n8:18\r\noff.\r\n8:20\r\nSo, you're think you're going to compete\r\n8:21\r\nwith a kid that's been focused on this\r\n8:22\r\nsince he was 13 years old, who has\r\n8:25\r\nactual straight A's that went to the\r\n8:28\r\nNaval Academy or that went to the ROC\r\n8:31\r\nprogram at at their college and got a\r\n8:34\r\nscholarship there and and are the the\r\n8:38\r\nbrigade commander of their ROC. You see\r\n8:40\r\nwhat I'm saying?\r\n8:43\r\nSo, you don't this young man, and I'm\r\n8:46\r\nsure he's a great young man, he doesn't\r\n8:47\r\nhave a chance for being an officer.\r\n8:48\r\nWell, that's just off the table anyways.\r\n8:52\r\nI shouldn't say he's totally off the\r\n8:53\r\ntable. He would have to like refocus his\r\n8:55\r\nentire existence\r\n8:57\r\nbecause he would have to be like, \"Oh,\r\n8:59\r\nI'm in college right now cuz I want to\r\n9:00\r\nbecome an officer. That's why I'm\r\n9:02\r\ngetting straight A's. That's why I'm\r\n9:03\r\nstudying these courses. That's why I'm\r\n9:04\r\ntaking two languages, Farsy and\r\n9:07\r\nRussian.\" You see what I'm saying? Hey,\r\n9:09\r\ndude.\r\n9:11\r\nUm,\r\n9:13\r\nthe fact that he co run for office one\r\n9:16\r\nday, that's a weird thing to talk about\r\n9:19\r\nright now for a 19-year-old kid. It's\r\n9:22\r\nnot a great sign, by the way, cuz if you\r\n9:24\r\nif if your goal is to run for office,\r\n9:26\r\nit's not a great sign. Uh, it means you\r\n9:28\r\nwant to build your resume, which is it\r\n9:31\r\nwhich is not a good sign. The desire to\r\n9:34\r\nbe a resume builder does not bode well\r\n9:36\r\nfor making it through SEAL training. Nor\r\n9:38\r\ndoes it be bode well for being the type\r\n9:40\r\nof leader that performs well in the SEAL\r\n9:41\r\nteams. If you're type of person that\r\n9:44\r\nwants to like go into politics, it's not\r\n9:45\r\na good sign.\r\n9:48\r\nSome of them end up in politics. I get\r\n9:49\r\nit. But\r\n9:53\r\nthey do not go with the intent of going\r\n9:55\r\nto politics. They kind of end up there.\r\n10:00\r\nSo, let's just keep that in mind. Um,\r\n10:05\r\nhere's another thing. Like, I'll just\r\n10:07\r\nthrow these out there. Like, how many\r\n10:08\r\npull-ups can he do? Can he do 25 to 30\r\n10:10\r\ndead hang pull-ups? Can he do, you know,\r\n10:13\r\nwhat's his four mile run time? Is it\r\n10:14\r\nunder 26 minutes right now? What's his\r\n10:16\r\n500 me swim? Is it under 9 minutes right\r\n10:18\r\nnow? Is he comfortable in the water? Did\r\n10:20\r\nhe play water polo? Like, what did he\r\n10:22\r\nsurf growing up? Is he have real comfort\r\n10:24\r\nin the water?\r\n10:26\r\nUm, well, has he had any injuries\r\n10:29\r\nbecause he was, you know, an athlete?\r\n10:30\r\nHas he had a ACL injury? Has he had a\r\n10:34\r\nshoulder injury? Those shoulder injuries\r\n10:36\r\nand back injuries and elbow injuries and\r\n10:39\r\nknee injuries that you show up to BUDS\r\n10:41\r\nwith, they're going to get tested in a\r\n10:43\r\nway that is not it's it's barely even an\r\n10:46\r\nethical freaking thing to have happen.\r\n10:50\r\nBecause they don't care because combat\r\n10:52\r\ndoesn't care.\r\n10:55\r\nSo there's another option. Oh, he\r\n10:58\r\ndoesn't. And he's got to wait. Okay.\r\n11:00\r\nHe's got to wait till he's 21. So\r\n11:01\r\nthere's an eye surgery. Echo Charles.\r\n11:03\r\nThey put lasers into your eyes. Yeah.\r\n11:06\r\nAnd they cut things. Your eye, believe\r\n11:09\r\nit or not, is still developing until you\r\n11:11\r\nturn 21. Yeah. And so you can't get the\r\n11:14\r\nsurgery before you turn 21. I\r\n11:16\r\nunderstand. Which is a bummer. And so\r\n11:18\r\nyou have to wait. Now, one thing that\r\n11:20\r\nthis kid, maybe this kid's 18, was he a\r\n11:22\r\nfreshman? You could probably go to four\r\n11:23\r\nyears in the army or the Marine Corps.\r\n11:25\r\nGet a good like baseline as an\r\n11:26\r\ninfantryman.\r\n11:28\r\nSo\r\n11:30\r\nthat would give you a good uh base too\r\n11:32\r\nfor what it takes to make it through\r\n11:35\r\nSEAL training. The the SEAL route is\r\n11:38\r\nhard. We need to keep that in mind.\r\n11:42\r\nAnd the chances that this young\r\n11:44\r\nindividual sounds like a great kid,\r\n11:45\r\nintelligent, hardworking, like really\r\n11:48\r\nfocused, the chances are that he won't\r\n11:49\r\nmake it.\r\n11:51\r\nSo, we have to keep that in mind.\r\n11:55\r\nIt's a hard route\r\n11:57\r\nand\r\n11:59\r\nit it is something that I do not\r\n12:04\r\nencourage people to do.\r\n12:07\r\nI don't encourage people to do it\r\n12:09\r\nbecause if I say, \"Hey, Billy, the SEAL\r\n12:13\r\nteams is the best. You should go for\r\n12:14\r\nit.\" and then they don't make it and\r\n12:16\r\nthen they hate their lives.\r\n12:19\r\nAnd and\r\n12:21\r\nI don't want to be responsible for\r\n12:24\r\nruining their life.\r\n12:27\r\nSo I do not encourage people to do it.\r\n12:31\r\nAnd as much as we believe in, like I\r\n12:33\r\nsaid, the kids that don't make it\r\n12:35\r\nthrough are studs.\r\n12:37\r\nDivision one athletes, name the sport.\r\n12:39\r\nName the sport. Wrestling, football,\r\n12:41\r\nswimming, running, they all quit.\r\n12:43\r\nThey've all quit. Hey, they've all made\r\n12:45\r\nit too, but they've all quit, so it\r\n12:47\r\nmeans nothing.\r\n12:51\r\nAll that being said, there is a certain\r\n12:53\r\ndrive in a small percentage of young men\r\n12:56\r\nthat for no logical reason,\r\n13:00\r\nso what I realized, actually, I realized\r\n13:02\r\nthat when I was thinking about this\r\n13:03\r\nquestion, there's no logical reason to\r\n13:06\r\ntry and go to to try and go in the field\r\n13:08\r\nteams. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't\r\n13:11\r\nmake logical sense. If you were to be uh\r\n13:14\r\nput into AI, the pros and cons of the\r\n13:17\r\nvarious branches of, you know, should I\r\n13:20\r\ngo special forces? Should I go Ranger?\r\n13:22\r\nShould I go Air Force CCT? Should I go\r\n13:24\r\nMarine Raider?\r\n13:26\r\nWhat? I did I miss any? You if you put\r\n13:28\r\nthat into chat GPT and said, \"Okay,\r\n13:31\r\nhere's here's who I am. Here's what I\r\n13:32\r\nhave. What is the best what is the best\r\n13:35\r\nroute for me to take?\" AI would tell you\r\n13:38\r\nany of the other branches.\r\n13:40\r\nIt would tell you any of the other\r\n13:42\r\nbranches. It would just look at the\r\n13:43\r\npercentage of people get dropped. It\r\n13:44\r\nwould look at the amount of injuries,\r\n13:46\r\nthe amount of people that get\r\n13:47\r\ndisqualified, the amount of people that\r\n13:49\r\ndon't make it. And what happens when you\r\n13:51\r\ndon't make it? Because what happens when\r\n13:54\r\nyou don't make it through SEAL training,\r\n13:55\r\nyou end up in the Navy. And the Navy is\r\n13:57\r\nindustrial jobs for the most part, which\r\n14:00\r\npeople that want to be SEALs don't want\r\n14:02\r\nindustrial jobs. They want commando\r\n14:03\r\njobs. They want infantrymen jobs. And\r\n14:05\r\nyou don't get those in the regular Navy.\r\n14:08\r\nSo, it doesn't make any logical sense\r\n14:13\r\nto\r\n14:16\r\ngo that route. But guess what? The\r\n14:20\r\npeople that do that route for no logical\r\n14:22\r\nreason that there's just one job that\r\n14:24\r\nthey want. There's one job that they\r\n14:26\r\nwant and that's it.\r\n14:30\r\nYour son might be one of those people.\r\n14:32\r\nAnd here's the thing. If he is one of\r\n14:34\r\nthose people, he's going to go for it.\r\n14:39\r\nand he needs to make that decision. And\r\n14:41\r\nin the unlikely, the highly unlikely\r\n14:44\r\nevent, because you hear the 80%\r\n14:45\r\nattrition rate, that just counts people\r\n14:47\r\nthat show up to Buds. Most people don't\r\n14:48\r\neven make it to Buds.\r\n14:52\r\nSo, in the unlikely event that he makes\r\n14:54\r\nit through the most arduous, selective,\r\n14:56\r\nrandom, brutal, and ridiculous training\r\n14:59\r\npipeline, it's the best job ever. It's\r\n15:02\r\nthe best job ever.\r\n15:04\r\nHe's got to make that decision. And you\r\n15:06\r\ncan't actually help him in either way.\r\n15:09\r\nCuz if you talk him out of it, he's\r\n15:12\r\ngoing to regret it and he's going to\r\n15:13\r\nresent you. And if you talk him into it\r\n15:16\r\nand he doesn't make it, he's going to\r\n15:17\r\nregret it and he's going to resent you.\r\n15:20\r\nSo he's a young man\r\n15:23\r\nand he needs to decide what he's going\r\n15:24\r\nto do. And the best thing you can do is\r\n15:28\r\nsupport his decision and wish him luck.\r\n15:34\r\nThat's my assessment here. Sounds like\r\n15:35\r\nhe raised a great kid.\r\n15:38\r\nSo you're saying in in a nutshell he\r\n15:40\r\neither way college, good deal, but not\r\n15:44\r\nnecessarily a rush to go to college. No\r\n15:46\r\nrush to go to college, you know, if he\r\n15:48\r\nwants to be in the workforce for a\r\n15:50\r\ncouple years while he's waiting to get\r\n15:51\r\nhis eye surgery. Cool. And I personally\r\n15:53\r\nthink it's a waste of money anyways if\r\n15:55\r\nhe's not into it. Yeah. If he doesn't\r\n15:57\r\nhave a plan, Yeah. I think so. And he's\r\n15:59\r\nnot going to become an officer,\r\n16:02\r\ndude. Save make a bunch of money and\r\n16:03\r\nsave it. Yeah. Yeah. That way when you\r\n16:05\r\njoin the Navy or whatever branch you,\r\n16:07\r\nyou have some money in the bank and like\r\n16:08\r\nmaybe you can be saving for a house, you\r\n16:10\r\nknow, when you when you get stationed\r\n16:11\r\nsomewhere. Yeah. And that would be the\r\n16:14\r\nplan this plan B scenario that they cuz\r\n16:16\r\nyou know how they they were like, \"Oh,\r\n16:17\r\nwe believe in plan B's, you know, cuz\r\n16:20\r\nwe've been through life and stuff like\r\n16:21\r\nthat, which makes sense, I think.\" Yeah,\r\n16:23\r\ntotally. It does make sense, you know,\r\n16:25\r\nand you get people that are like, \"Don't\r\n16:26\r\nhave a backup plan, you know, and I get\r\n16:29\r\nthat mentality.\" Yeah. Yeah. Fully. But\r\n16:34\r\nyou better consider that when again it's\r\n16:37\r\nhard to convince someone that 80% of the\r\n16:41\r\npeople that don't make it, you're one of\r\n16:42\r\nthem. Yeah. Yeah. Fully. Cuz why would\r\n16:45\r\nanyone join if they didn't think they\r\n16:46\r\nwere going to make it? They all think\r\n16:47\r\nthey're going to make it. I was going to\r\n16:48\r\nsay. Yeah. Exactly. And you see studs\r\n16:50\r\nquitting. Yeah. Quit. So, Yep. and your\r\n16:55\r\nyour whole thing and I always looked at\r\n16:56\r\nI didn't always look at buds but when I\r\n16:58\r\nthink of buds which is the primary time\r\n17:02\r\nwhere people quit, right? I I'm always I\r\n17:06\r\nalways keep in mind that it's not even\r\n17:08\r\nnecessarily just quitting. There's way\r\n17:10\r\nthere's many many other ways for you not\r\n17:12\r\nto make it. There are many many other\r\n17:14\r\nways not to make it. And the injury part\r\n17:16\r\nof it is I always go to injury because\r\n17:18\r\nthat's that's like similar to how sports\r\n17:20\r\nare, you know, people are like, \"Hey, if\r\n17:22\r\nI dedicate myself, it's like I the\r\n17:23\r\nchance of me going to professional level\r\n17:25\r\nis like pretty high misstep a quarter\r\n17:29\r\ninch on some spin move and you blow out\r\n17:31\r\nyour Achilles and it's a game over.\"\r\n17:32\r\nExactly. Right. So some guys because\r\n17:34\r\nthere's a lot of guys in sports and\r\n17:35\r\nstuff where they play sports their whole\r\n17:37\r\nlife, really talented, genetically\r\n17:38\r\ngifted, all this stuff and they so now\r\n17:41\r\nit it kind of gets narrowed down to work\r\n17:42\r\nethic and what they want to you know how\r\n17:44\r\nthey're going to plan to do this thing.\r\n17:46\r\nAnd then the chances actually are pretty\r\n17:47\r\nhigh if you exclude the potential for\r\n17:50\r\ninjury, but injury is like that's one of\r\n17:52\r\nthose things that bro that's not up to\r\n17:54\r\nyou most pretty much most of the time.\r\n17:56\r\nThere's there's some other things that\r\n17:57\r\naren't up to you too. Mhm. For instance,\r\n18:01\r\nsome people aren't comfortable in the\r\n18:02\r\nwater. Yeah. Then you can work on it a\r\n18:04\r\nlot. Yeah. But if you didn't grow up\r\n18:06\r\nthat way, it can be a problem. Some\r\n18:08\r\npeople aren't very good at p shooting a\r\n18:09\r\npistol. Some people aren't really good\r\n18:11\r\nat shooting a rifle. Some people aren't\r\n18:13\r\nreally good at spatial awareness.\r\n18:15\r\nSome people have a hard time with their\r\n18:19\r\nproprioception while they're skydiving\r\n18:21\r\nand they can't flat. They can't do it.\r\n18:24\r\nYeah. So, there's like things that you\r\n18:26\r\ncan fail. Yeah. and like be out. You're\r\n18:29\r\nout. Some people have the one mistake\r\n18:33\r\nthat they make is an accidental\r\n18:35\r\ndischarge on the range. You're done.\r\n18:37\r\nYeah. You're done. So, it's not just\r\n18:40\r\nquitting. By the way, quitting is the\r\n18:42\r\nvast majority. Oh, for real. Quitting is\r\n18:44\r\nthe vast majority. But then it comes\r\n18:46\r\ndown to performance drops, which is\r\n18:49\r\nlike, oh, you failed a run, now you\r\n18:50\r\nfailed another run. Yeah, but there's no\r\n18:53\r\nbut. You failed a run, you failed\r\n18:55\r\nanother run, you're out. There's no yeah\r\n18:57\r\nbut oh you had water in your lungs. You\r\n19:00\r\nhad a cough. You had a sore knee. You\r\n19:02\r\nhad a sprained ankle. No one cares.\r\n19:03\r\nCombat doesn't care and no one at Buds\r\n19:05\r\ncares.\r\n19:07\r\nYou failed underwater not tying.\r\n19:11\r\nYou failed some evolution in the pool.\r\n19:16\r\nSome evolution in the pool. The tread.\r\n19:19\r\nYou know what the tread is? You're\r\n19:21\r\nwearing your scuba gear and you got to\r\n19:22\r\ntread water with your hands out out of\r\n19:24\r\nthe water. Oh yeah, dude. To fail that.\r\n19:28\r\nYeah. You're done. Bye-bye. Yeah. So,\r\n19:33\r\nthere's a lot of things. It It doesn't\r\n19:34\r\nmake a lot.\r\n19:41\r\nThat is a little excerpt of what we are\r\n19:44\r\ndoing on the Joo Underground podcast.\r\n19:47\r\nSo, if you want to continue to listen,\r\n19:49\r\ngo to joounderground.com\r\n19:52\r\nand subscribe.

On top of quitting, there are many other failure modes (injury, performance drops, water competency, weapons/range errors, skydiving issues), so past \u201cstud\u201d credentials don\u2019t protect you. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- **Bad fallback if you miss.** If you don\u2019t make it, you\u2019re still in the Navy, often doing industrial/shipboard work\u2014very far from the \u201ccommando\u201d role many imagined. That mis-match can breed long-term regret; he refuses to be responsible for pushing someone into that outcome. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n- **It\u2019s not the \u201clogical\u201d optimization.** If you weighed injury risk, wash-out probabilities, and post-failure assignments, other branches (Rangers, SF, CCT, Raiders) often dominate on expected value for a motivated 18\u201320-year-old. In his words, going SEAL often isn\u2019t a logical decision\u2014it\u2019s a singular, non-rational drive some people have. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n- **Ownership of the decision.** If parents (or he) talk a candidate *into* it and they fail, resentment follows; if they talk them *out* of it and the person never tries, resentment also follows. Therefore the decision must rest fully with the individual; he\u2019ll neither sell the dream nor block it. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\nHe\u2019s *not* anti-SEAL. He\u2019s anti-**recruitment cheerleading**. His stance is: if you have the rare, immovable drive to be a SEAL, you\u2019ll go try without anyone hyping you; everyone else should weigh the statistics and consider alternatives. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** Willink discourages *encouraging* young men into SEALs because the selection pipeline is a high-variance gamble with a harsh downside, and he refuses the moral hazard of persuading someone into long-odds suffering. If you still want it after absorbing those facts, that\u2019s your call\u2014and your responsibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201","start_idx":718,"end_idx":750,"safe_urls":["https://www.shortform.com/podcast/episode/jocko-podcast-2024-12-17-episode-summary-jocko-underground-don-t-try-to-be-a-seal-feeling-unappreciated-in-my-marriage?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv0ZP7R_PRY&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv0ZP7R_PRY&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Don't Go To BUDS.
