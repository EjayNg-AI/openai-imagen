GitHub Mobile, and Visual Studio Code. This new feature, available through a public preview, is accessible to users with Copilot Pro Plus or Copilot Enterprise subscriptions. The integration is part of GitHub\u2019s Agent HQ initiative, aimed at making AI agents a core part of the development workflow by allowing developers to select from Copilot, Claude, Codex, or custom agents for specific tasks. These agents assist in issue resolution and pull request management, and their performance can be evaluated by developers.\n\nGitHub emphasizes reducing friction in development by eliminating the need for switching tools during the coding process. This move also reflects GitHub\u2019s openness to incorporating rival AI models to boost its Copilot capabilities. GitHub already provides access to models from Anthropic, Google, xAI, and OpenAI, and plans to expand agent availability across more subscription tiers soon. Furthermore, GitHub is collaborating with companies like Google, Cognition, and xAI to introduce more agents into its products. Meanwhile, Microsoft is internally comparing Claude Code with Copilot to enhance GitHub Copilot\u2019s performance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1770224400.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318628/jules-google-ai-coding-agent-gemini-2-0-announcement","title":"Google's new Jules AI agent will help developers fix buggy code","snippet":"Google has unveiled an experimental AI agent named \"Jules,\" designed to assist developers in fixing coding errors. Announced alongside the updated Gemini 2.0 AI model, Jules can generate multi-step solutions, modify multiple files, and create pull requests for Python and JavaScript projects within GitHub workflows. Unlike traditional tools, Jules focuses on automating bug fixes and repetitive tasks, allowing developers to concentrate on more creative aspects of coding. While Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot and AI systems like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT offer similar capabilities, Jules marks Google\u2019s strategic push into AI-assisted software development.\n\nThe tool does not automatically spot errors; developers must direct it to known issues. They retain control over reviewing and editing Jules' plans before integrating any code. Although still in early development and susceptible to errors, internal testing suggests that Jules significantly boosts productivity. Initially, it will be accessible to a select group of testers, with a broader release planned for early 2025.

This move allows developers\u2014currently limited to Pro and Max subscribers\u2014to perform coding tasks directly from their browsers. Claude Code now supports secure integration with GitHub, automating workflows such as cloning repositories, setting up coding environments, modifying code, running tests, and creating pull requests. It operates in an isolated virtual machine for enhanced security, with pre-installed support for multiple programming languages including Python, Java, and Rust.\n\nThe rollout reflects Anthropic\u2019s push to make AI development tools more accessible and portable, especially for developers working remotely or without high-powered machines. Despite a few limitations\u2014like the exclusive use of GitHub and shared rate limits\u2014Claude Code aims to offer a secure, flexible alternative to local development setups. This web expansion strengthens Anthropic\u2019s position as a key competitor to OpenAI and complements its growing partnership with Microsoft, which has integrated Claude into platforms like Azure, Teams, and Outlook.

GitHub is expanding Copilot\u2019s compatibility to all major programming languages, including Java.

Initially skeptical, the author was intrigued after hearing positive feedback from a friend and decided to give Replit a try. The platform impressed with its ease of use, fast setup, and AI-powered assistance, which can suggest, troubleshoot, and generate code based on plain language input. The interface is clean and intuitive, removing much of the technical friction that typically deters new coders.\n\nReplit is especially praised for allowing users to quickly build and share projects through shareable links, making it ideal for prototyping and personal projects. While powerful, it still requires oversight, especially when using AI-generated code. Compared to tools like Claude Code\u2014which excels in complex reasoning and debugging\u2014Replit shines as a quick-start environment perfect for experimentation, learning, and showcasing work.\n\nHowever, the article mentions limitations such as reduced flexibility compared to local development environments and a $25/month fee to publish apps. Overall, Replit is recommended as a great starting point for anyone interested in learning to code without the typical setup hassles.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1769326200.0,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698c3c2ff0588332bbd916b5bc53fcaa","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"5845bd82-6448-45bf-b03c-a2dca8c6b2c0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"bb193ad6-e85b-4a2b-9277-f1ba663388f4","turn_exchange_id":"862070ae-6aee-472d-81b3-e53f5af0d651","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bb193ad6-e85b-4a2b-9277-f1ba663388f4","children":["5bad4bc8-80ef-4635-8db7-43b995e8ad2b"]},"5bad4bc8-80ef-4635-8db7-43b995e8ad2b":{"id":"5bad4bc8-80ef-4635-8db7-43b995e8ad2b","message":{"id":"5bad4bc8-80ef-4635-8db7-43b995e8ad2b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1770798130.548675,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s a solid **\u201cfirst-apps\u201d checklist for a new Windows desktop geared toward a Python coder using GitHub, VS Code, and AI coding tools** \u2014 covering essential dev utilities, productivity helpers, and AI assistants:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf0 Development Foundations\n\n### **Language & Package Management**\n- **Python** \u2013 the latest stable Python installer from python.org (includes `pip` and optional PATH setup).  \n- **Git for Windows** \u2013 Git version control + Git Bash shell to sync with GitHub.  \n- **Windows Terminal** \u2013 modern terminal with tabs & PowerShell/Wsl/bash support.\n\n### **Editors & IDEs**\n- **\ue200link_title\ue202Visual Studio Code (VS Code) \u2013 Code editor**\ue202turn0search8\ue201 \u2014 your main editor for Python and AI workflows.  \n- **Optional Python IDEs** (for alternative workflows or debugging):\n  -

This new feature, available through a public preview, is accessible to users with Copilot Pro Plus or Copilot Enterprise subscriptions. The integration is part of GitHub\u2019s Agent HQ initiative, aimed at making AI agents a core part of the development workflow by allowing developers to select from Copilot, Claude, Codex, or custom agents for specific tasks. These agents assist in issue resolution and pull request management, and their performance can be evaluated by developers.\n\nGitHub emphasizes reducing friction in development by eliminating the need for switching tools during the coding process. This move also reflects GitHub\u2019s openness to incorporating rival AI models to boost its Copilot capabilities. GitHub already provides access to models from Anthropic, Google, xAI, and OpenAI, and plans to expand agent availability across more subscription tiers soon. Furthermore, GitHub is collaborating with companies like Google, Cognition, and xAI to introduce more agents into its products.
