The challenge is to do so **pragmatically and ethically**, ensuring AI becomes a **lever for deeper learning** rather than a crutch, and that students remain well-prepared for traditional closed-book exams with uncompromised breadth and rigor. Below, we outline impactful strategies spanning curriculum integration, project work, classroom practice, and assessments, all under a unifying theme: **use AI to complement and enhance education while preserving robust understanding and creative problem-solving**.\n\n## Infusing AI Across the Curriculum (All Subjects)  \nRather than treating AI as a standalone topic, MOE can **integrate AI meaningfully into existing subjects** so every student gains AI literacy in context\u301019\u2020L41-L45\u3011. This means tailoring AI\u2019s use beyond STEM into the humanities, languages, and arts, with teachers guiding usage at age-appropriate levels\u301034\u2020L185-L193\u3011\u301034\u2020L193-L200\u3011:\n\n- **Languages & Humanities:** In English and mother tongue languages, generative AI can act as a writing coach. For example, students might draft an essay or reflection and then use ChatGPT to get *feedback in the form of questions* that prompt improvement\u30107\u2020L1628-L1636\u3011\u30107\u2020L1645-L1653\u3011. Teachers like those at Manjusri Secondary have had students ask ChatGPT for metacognitive feedback questions instead of direct edits, so that students refine their own work\u30107\u2020L1628-L1636\u3011. In history or social studies, AI tools can summarize complex articles or generate debate prompts. Students could then critically examine these summaries for bias or inaccuracies, reinforcing their understanding. (E.g. in one class, students dissected ChatGPT\u2019s response *sentence by sentence* to spot inconsistencies\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011.) This not only builds content knowledge but also teaches source evaluation. For literature, AI image generators can visualize a scene or character description from a text, sparking discussion \u2013 a method Fuchun Secondary\u2019s literature class used to compare interpretations of a character in a local play\u30108\u2020L1789-L1797\u3011. Such cross-talk between AI output and student analysis enriches classroom discussion and ensures the subject\u2019s nuances are understood, not glossed over.  \n\n- **STEM Subjects:** Mathematics and science education can leverage AI-powered tutors and adaptive practice systems. Singapore has already rolled out AI-driven **Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS)** for math and other subjects on the Student Learning Space platform\u301020\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301034\u2020L211-L219\u3011. These systems **personalize practice** questions based on a student\u2019s performance, providing hints and step-by-step feedback for weaker areas\u301020\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301020\u2020L153-L161\u3011. For instance, an AI \u201clearning feedback assistant\u201d in math guides students through solving a problem (offering hints and checking steps) rather than just checking the final answer\u301020\u2020L41-L49\u3011. This allows students to learn at their own pace, while teachers later receive analytics on which concepts need reinforcement\u301020\u2020L109-L117\u3011. In science classes, AI tools like virtual labs or physics problem solvers can be used for **simulations and data analysis**, but with a crucial caveat: students must explain the reasoning behind solutions. Teachers can instruct students to **attempt problems manually first, then verify or explore alternate solutions with AI**, ensuring that AI supplements their problem-solving process instead of replacing it. \n\n- **Arts, Design & Other Subjects:** Creative subjects stand to gain as well. In Design & Technology (D&T) and Arts, generative AI can broaden students\u2019 creative horizons. D&T teachers in Singapore have begun guiding students to use tools like ChatGPT and *Vizcom* (a generative design tool) to brainstorm design ideas and visualize prototypes\u301034\u2020L193-L200\u3011. Under teacher guidance, students use AI to **sketch and imagine solutions**, then refine those ideas through hands-on modeling\u301034\u2020L193-L200\u3011. Similarly, in **Nutrition and Food Science (NFS)** coursework, students at some schools use AI to generate recipe ideas or meal plans, then evaluate and test them\u301034\u2020L199-L203\u3011. The key across these examples is that AI introduces fresh ideas and efficiency (e.g. quickly generating design variations), while students remain the decision-makers who critique and develop these ideas further. Importantly, students are taught to **corroborate AI-generated content** with reliable sources (for example, checking an AI-suggested nutritional fact against textbooks or databases)\u301034\u2020L199-L203\u3011. This reinforces subject knowledge and research skills. Even in visual arts or music, AI tools can be used to inspire creativity (like generating an initial melody or artwork idea), but students would then apply theory and personal style to transform that into a final piece.\n\nBy **infusing AI into every subject area**, students see it as a natural part of learning \u2013 much like calculators or reference books \u2013 and gain a nuanced understanding of both its power and limits. This comprehensive integration also ensures no subject is left behind in the AI era, aligning with MOE\u2019s push for broad digital literacy. As Dr. Ashley Tan notes, integrating generative AI isn\u2019t about a new syllabus but about *\u201cinfusing it meaningfully and strategically into existing subjects.\u201d*\u301019\u2020L41-L45\u3011 This approach provides a rich, contextual learning experience where AI serves as a learning amplifier rather than a shortcut to answers.\n\n## Building AI Literacy and Responsible Use  \nTo ensure AI is a **lever and not a crutch**, schools must explicitly teach students *how* to use AI tools **ethically, safely, and critically**. MOE has emphasized that technical skills must go hand-in-hand with ethics: *\u201cWe will always couple the learning of the technical use of AI with the ethical use of AI,\u201d* said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing, highlighting that students should know both the benefits and downsides of AI tools\u30103\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301031\u2020L79-L87\u3011. Key strategies include:\n\n- **Explicit AI Literacy Lessons:** Introduce curriculum modules on understanding what AI (and generative AI) is, how it works at a basic level, and its limitations. For example, schools might use materials from the **AI Student Outreach Programme** by AI Singapore or content on MOE\u2019s Student Learning Space to cover concepts like machine learning, data bias, and model limitations\u301029\u2020L139-L148\u3011\u301029\u2020L152-L160\u3011. Students can learn through age-appropriate examples \u2013 e.g. secondary students experimenting with a simple image recognition app, or JC students exploring how large language models predict text. Some schools have already embedded such content: Montfort Secondary\u2019s Applied Learning Programme teaches basic AI applications (image recognition, chatbots, etc.) before students apply them in projects\u301034\u2020L185-L193\u3011. By demystifying AI, students will be less likely to treat ChatGPT as an \u201call-knowing oracle\u201d and more as a tool with patterns and blind spots.\n\n- **Ethics and Integrity Emphasis:** From cyber wellness classes to project guidelines, emphasize *academic integrity and ethical use* of AI. Students should be taught that using AI to generate content **without proper acknowledgment is akin to plagiarism**. The International Baccalaureate (IB) board, for instance, permits AI-generated material in essays only if it is *cited and credited* like any other source\u301022\u2020L5-L13\u3011\u301022\u2020L15-L18\u3011. MOE can adopt similar policies in schools: encourage students to **cite AI assistance** in project work or research assignments (e.g. \u201cChatGPT was used to draft an outline for Section 2, which I then expanded\u201d). Indeed, some local schools have already started this \u2013 students at Peirce and Yuan Ching Secondary are explicitly taught to *acknowledge their use of AI tools and other sources in their reports*, reinforcing honesty in AI use\u301034\u2020L199-L203\u3011. Normalizing such citation removes the temptation to pass off AI work as one\u2019s own and frames AI as a legitimate research aid. It also opens the door for discussions on copyright and originality: e.g. who \u201cowns\u201d AI-generated text or art, and why presenting AI work as personal work is misleading.\n\n- **Critical Evaluation of AI Output:** Perhaps the most crucial skill is **AI skepticism \u2013 teaching students to verify and think critically about AI-generated content**. Generative AI is notorious for producing confidently presented misinformation or biased outputs. MOE\u2019s own ethics framework cautions that *\u201cinappropriate AI use may impede the development of critical thinking\u2026 or propagate misinformation.\u201d*\u301031\u2020L79-L87\u3011 To counter this, teachers can engage students in activities that turn AI\u2019s flaws into learning opportunities. For example:  \n  - *Fact-Checking Exercises:* A teacher might supply an AI-written paragraph on a topic with some errors hidden within. Students must fact-check each statement against textbooks or credible websites and identify the inaccuracies. This practice, akin to what one NYT columnist called detecting an *\u201cintellectual snow job\u201d*, reinforces content knowledge while training students not to accept AI answers at face value\u301026\u2020L85-L94\u3011\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011. In a CNA feature, a literature teacher recounted how her students discovered ChatGPT was *making up details* about a local literature text, which drove home the lesson that the AI can fabricate information\u30108\u2020L1821-L1827\u3011. Such experiences teach skepticism and the habit of cross-verifying with human-vetted sources.\n  - *Bias Detection:* Assign students to probe AI for biases. For instance, in social studies or GP, students could prompt the AI on a controversial issue and analyze whether the answer shows any cultural or gender bias. Because AI is trained on internet data, underrepresented perspectives might be marginalized\u301026\u2020L99-L107\u3011. Students can present their findings and discuss how those biases might be mitigated or why a diverse training set matters. This aligns with MOE\u2019s principle of **Fairness** in AI use \u2013 systems should be as free from bias as possible, and users made aware of potential bias\u301031\u2020L159-L168\u3011\u301031\u2020L171-L179\u3011.\n  - *\u201cSpot the AI\u201d Challenges:* To sharpen awareness of AI\u2019s stylistic limitations, teachers might show several short essays or answers \u2013 some written by students, one by AI \u2013 and have the class debate which is AI-generated\u301026\u2020L110-L119\u3011\u301026\u2020L119-L127\u3011. Students often find that AI text, while grammatically sound, may lack the **personal voice, nuance, or emotional depth** of human writing\u301026\u2020L112-L120\u3011. This not only teaches them the tell-tale signs of AI-generated work (e.g. generic phrasing, lack of original insight) but also reinforces the value of their own authentic voice.  \n\n- **Privacy and Safety Guidance:** Students should learn the **do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of data privacy** when using AI tools. Public AI platforms (ChatGPT, Bing Chat, etc.) might store queries, so students must avoid inputting sensitive personal data or school confidential content. Schools can issue clear guidelines: e.g. *\u201cDo not paste exam questions or student particulars into online AI tools.\u201d* At younger ages, this could be part of cyber wellness lessons (many schools already teach data security and discerning fake news as part of the curriculum\u301029\u2020L159-L167\u3011). At JC level, discussions can extend to AI ethics in society \u2013 for example, the impact of deepfakes or the importance of AI governance frameworks. (Singapore\u2019s Model AI Governance Framework and the new MOE AI in Education Ethics Framework can be reference points for class discussions on how AI should be regulated\u301025\u2020L87-L95\u3011\u301025\u2020L99-L107\u3011.) The goal is to cultivate **\u201csmart and secure AI users\u201d**, as MOE described \u2013 people who can leverage AI\u2019s benefits while guarding against its risks\u301029\u2020L137-L144\u3011\u301029\u2020L159-L167\u3011.\n\n- **Age-Appropriate Exposure:** Ensure that the **depth of AI usage corresponds to students\u2019 maturity and skill levels**\u30103\u2020L159-L167\u3011. Chan Chun Sing noted that younger students get foundational exposure, while older students engage more deeply with AI tools\u30103\u2020L159-L167\u3011. In practice, secondary students might use AI within tightly guided scenarios (with prompts often given by teachers\u30108\u2020L1745-L1753\u3011), whereas JC students can be granted more independence to explore AI in research and self-study (with the expectation of self-regulation and proper attribution). For example, a secondary class might use ChatGPT in a scripted way \u2013 the teacher provides a \u201cprompt recipe\u201d to ensure the AI\u2019s feedback is pedagogically sound\u30108\u2020L1745-L1753\u3011 \u2013 whereas a JC project group might be allowed to use AI to gather sources or analyze data, subject to critical evaluation and teacher checkpoints. By scaffolding the experience, we prevent younger students from over-reliance before they have a solid skill foundation. At the same time, we challenge older students to integrate AI thoughtfully into advanced coursework or independent study (e.g. using AI to test code in a Computing class, or to simulate a chemistry experiment\u2019s expected results for comparison). Always, the use of AI should be *presented as a tool under the student\u2019s and teacher\u2019s control* (preserving human **agency** in learning decisions\u301031\u2020L119-L128\u3011\u301031\u2020L129-L137\u3011) \u2013 never as an infallible answer-machine.\n\nThrough these measures, students will internalize that **AI is a powerful assistant but not an authoritative brain**. The outcome is a generation of learners who can *use* ChatGPT or similar tools to **augment their own thinking** \u2013 brainstorming, getting feedback, accelerating research \u2013 yet remain fully capable of thinking for themselves. This culture of responsible AI use addresses MOE\u2019s concern that critical thinking must not be dulled; rather, AI should *\u201cstrengthen [students\u2019] disposition to think and learn,\u201d* as one teacher put it\u30106\u2020L129-L137\u3011. By explicitly teaching ethics and evaluation, we ensure AI becomes a **springboard for deeper inquiry**, not a shortcut that circumvents learning.\n\n## Enhancing Project Work with AI Assistance  \nProject-based learning and research projects are prime areas where AI can be leveraged to improve outcomes **without reducing rigor**. In Secondary schools and JCs, project work (whether informal class projects, coursework for subjects like History/Geography, or the formal JC Project Work subject) can be reimagined to incorporate AI at various stages. The guiding principle is to let AI **complement students\u2019 creativity and research skills** \u2013 helping with idea generation, analysis, or presentation \u2013 while **students retain full ownership and understanding** of the work. Here are strategies to achieve that balance:\n\n- **Brainstorming and Planning:** AI tools are excellent brainstorming partners. Students can use generative AI to generate initial ideas, research questions, or outlines for their projects. For example, a group tasked with a geography project on urban heat islands could prompt ChatGPT for \u201cpossible factors contributing to urban heat islands in Singapore\u201d. This might yield a list of factors or case studies that students hadn\u2019t initially considered. By getting a broad sweep of ideas from AI, students ensure they explore multiple angles before settling on their approach. **However,** to avoid AI oversimplification, students should then evaluate those AI-suggested ideas: Which are most relevant or feasible? Are any based on outdated or incorrect info? The team can cross-check facts (e.g. verifying any statistics or claims via authoritative sources) and discuss which ideas to pursue. Essentially, AI can act as a research \u201cassistant\u201d that gathers raw material, but students must exercise *research skills* in filtering and building on that material. Teachers can require that the *research log/appendix* includes documentation of any AI-assisted brainstorming along with the students\u2019 commentary on how they used or discarded AI outputs. This transparency reinforces that students, not AI, drive the project\u2019s direction.\n\n- **Content Gathering and Analysis:** For research-heavy projects, AI tools (especially ones connected to the internet or trained on large corpora) can help gather information or summarize complex content. Students might use a tool like **Bing Chat or Perplexity AI** (which provide sources) to get summaries of academic articles, or use ChatGPT to explain difficult concepts in simpler terms. In language projects or history, AI could even **play the role of a simulated interviewee** \u2013 e.g. students could prompt ChatGPT to *\u201cact as a 19th-century immigrant in Singapore and describe your daily challenges\u201d* to spark ideas for a social studies project. These uses can make research more efficient and widen students\u2019 perspectives. **Crucially,** students must treat AI outputs as *starting points*. Any information used should be double-checked. For instance, if ChatGPT summarizes a scientific study, students should locate the original study (or at least a reliable summary) to confirm accuracy. MOE\u2019s guidance already pushes for this: students using AI in NFS projects were taught to *corroborate AI-generated content with other reliable sources*\u301034\u2020L199-L203\u3011. Teachers can institute checkpoints: before a group finalizes their project report, they must show they have verified key facts from AI and that they understand them. One good practice is the \u201c**AI fact-check worksheet**\u201d \u2013 a table where students list any AI-provided info they used, alongside a credible source confirming or correcting it. This turns AI into a research aid that *trains better research habits* (since students often have to dig deeper to validate AI\u2019s claims).\n\n- **Idea Refinement and Creative Design:** AI can boost the creative element of projects, helping students push the boundaries of what they can create. In design and invention projects, as seen in D&T coursework, AI image generators and text prompts can help students quickly visualize concepts. For example, a group designing a prototype eco-friendly home could ask an AI image generator to *\u201cshow a tiny house design with sustainable materials\u201d*. This might produce variations that inspire the students\u2019 own design sketches. **Teachers\u2019 role** here is to ensure AI-generated ideas are used to *enhance students\u2019 imagination, not replace it*. D&T teachers already *guide students to use AI to expand ideation (new ideas, sketches, visualizations)*, but then require students to develop the actual prototype themselves\u301034\u2020L193-L200\u3011. We can extend such practices: students should be asked to **modify or build upon AI-generated designs** \u2013 for instance, take an AI-generated concept and improve its functionality or adapt it to local context. Similarly, in writing or media projects, students might have AI draft a sample script or short story idea, then use it as a springboard for their original work. Teachers can encourage a compare-and-improve approach: *\u201cWhat did the AI come up with, and how can you make it better or more relevant?\u201d* This mindset positions AI as a creative collaborator that challenges students to refine and assert their own vision. It also naturally prevents plagiarism; the AI output is just too generic or not fully aligned with project goals, so student creativity must fill the gap \u2013 exactly as intended.\n\n- **Maintaining Originality and Accountability:** To ensure AI is not used as a cheat in project work, MOE can implement **accountability measures**. One effective method is requiring students to detail how AI was used in their process. For instance, in the project report or presentation, include a brief section: \u201cUse of AI Tools \u2013 The team utilized ChatGPT to generate initial questions about our topic and used DALL\u00b7E2 for concept art. We then validated ChatGPT\u2019s suggestions by \u2026 and redesigned the AI-generated images by \u2026\u201d. By formalizing this reflection, students are made aware of AI\u2019s auxiliary role and are less likely to rely on it for the heavy lifting. Additionally, having an **oral presentation or viva component** in project assessments can help. During Q&A, teachers can ask probing questions about any sophisticated content to check that students truly understand what\u2019s presented. For example: \u201cYour report used a very polished economic analysis \u2013 can you explain how you arrived at those figures?\u201d If the students had just copied it from an AI, they will falter; if they used AI to assist but learned from it, they should be able to articulate it. This mirrors the approach some teachers took when they found unusually excellent work \u2013 one teacher recounted a student submitting a near-perfect essay written with her parent\u2019s heavy help; the teacher acknowledged it but then **engaged the student to ensure she understood what made it good**\u30108\u2020L1844-L1852\u3011\u30108\u2020L1853-L1861\u3011. Now AI can play the role of the \u201chelpful parent\u201d to level the playing field, as that teacher noted, *but the student still must internalize the quality of the work*\u30108\u2020L1853-L1861\u3011.\n\n- **Improving Project Rigor with AI:** Paradoxically, allowing AI in projects can **raise the bar** of what students achieve, which in turn can raise rigor. Since AI can handle mundane tasks or provide quick information, students can attempt more complex, in-depth projects than before. For example, a JC group doing a science research project could use AI to run simulations or crunch large datasets (via coding assistance), freeing them to focus on analyzing results and designing experiments. In language projects, if AI helps with basic grammar or translation, students can spend more time on higher-level narrative style or deeper literary analysis. The teacher\u2019s role is to accordingly **adjust the assessment rubrics** to focus on those higher-order skills and original contributions. If AI provided some content, then creativity, critical analysis, and reflection should weigh more in grading. Essentially, we expect students to go *beyond* the AI output. This also means educators might pose **more open-ended, locally grounded project prompts** that AI cannot directly solve. For instance, instead of a generic project like \u201cclimate change impacts,\u201d a prompt could be \u201cinvestigate climate resilience strategies in your neighborhood.\u201d AI can give general ideas, but students will have to do fieldwork, surveys or localized analysis \u2013 things AI can\u2019t furnish. These design choices ensure that while AI might assist with knowledge, it **cannot complete the task alone**, preserving the necessity of student insight and effort.\n\nIn summary, **AI becomes a powerful aid in project work \u2013 for ideation, research, and creativity \u2013 but under structured guidance that ensures students remain the driving force**. By teaching students to use AI for the grunt work (idea generation, quick info, drafts) and then **add their own human touch \u2013 critical thinking, ethical judgment, personal voice, and real-world validation \u2013 the quality of projects can improve without any loss of learning value**. In fact, students end up learning *more*: they gain content knowledge, project skills, and meta-skills of using AI as a professional tool. As seen in Singapore\u2019s D&T and NFS coursework examples, this approach not only produced inventive projects but also instilled good practices like source corroboration and citation\u301034\u2020L199-L203\u3011. AI thus *complements* project-based learning by extending students\u2019 capabilities, all the while under the safety net of teacher oversight and reflective assessment.\n\n## Enriching Classroom Learning and Discussions with AI  \nClassroom teaching can be dynamically enhanced by using AI tools to facilitate **interactive discussions, personalized feedback, and exploratory learning activities**. Singapore\u2019s schools have begun to pilot such uses \u2013 treating AI as a \u201cteaching assistant\u201d that can engage students in new ways\u30107\u2020L1612-L1621\u3011\u30107\u2020L1615-L1623\u3011. The aim is to make class time more engaging and to cultivate self-directed learners, all while avoiding the pitfalls of spoon-feeding answers. Here are strategies for leveraging AI in daily teaching, from routine lessons to spontaneous Q&A, in both secondary and JC settings:\n\n- **AI-Augmented Feedback and Tutoring:** One of AI\u2019s most impactful classroom uses is providing *instant, individualized feedback* to students. In a traditional setting, a teacher can\u2019t feasibly give detailed feedback to every student simultaneously during class. But as an example at Manjusri Secondary showed, ChatGPT made it possible for every student to receive personalized questions and suggestions on their writing in real-time\u30107\u2020L1612-L1621\u3011\u30107\u2020L1615-L1623\u3011. The teacher had students submit a paragraph and then guided them to prompt ChatGPT for feedback in question form (e.g. \u201cWhat questions can improve my thesis?\u201d). The AI effectively acted like a *\u201csecond teacher\u201d* circulating the room \u2013 one that *\u201ccould attend to them all at the same time and pose different questions to each to help them improve\u201d*\u30107\u2020L1612-L1621\u3011\u30107\u2020L1615-L1623\u3011. To implement this widely, MOE can train teachers to use AI feedback tools or chatbots in class for subjects like writing, programming, or even problem solving:  \n  - **Writing Classes:** As in the example, English teachers can incorporate an \u201cAI review\u201d step. Students write a draft, then use an AI (with a prompt designed by the teacher to suit the assignment) to get feedback. Critically, the teacher should frame it such that the AI *asks* the student guided questions instead of just fixing the essay\u30107\u2020L1628-L1636\u3011. This coaching style (e.g. \u201cWhat\u2019s a clearer way to express X?\u201d) pushes students to think and revise, rather than accepting a corrected text passively. It turns editing into a dialogue, mirroring how a teacher might Socratically question a student. Teachers Erica Rodriguez and Faith Ong at Manjusri Sec reported that using ChatGPT in this manner strengthened students\u2019 thinking and metacognitive skills\u30108\u2020L1749-L1757\u3011\u30108\u2020L1754-L1762\u3011. Over time, students begin to internalize those questions and improve their self-editing skills.\n  - **Personalized Q&A in Various Subjects:** AI chatbots (even something like a customized \u201cMath GPT\u201d or \u201cChemistry ChatTutor\u201d) could be available for students to query during practice sessions. For instance, in a math class, if a student is stuck, they might ask the AI for a hint. The AI, trained to not give away answers, could provide a step or point out an error in their working. This was essentially the design of MOE\u2019s **Math Learning Feedback Assistant**, which provides step-by-step hints and guides rather than final answers\u301020\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301020\u2020L43-L48\u3011. In physics or chemistry, an AI could quickly check if a solution is balanced or if a concept is applied correctly, freeing the teacher to help students with deeper misunderstandings. The benefit is twofold: students get immediate help (keeping them engaged instead of frustrated), and teachers can *\u201cdivide\u201d their attention effectively*. Temasek JC reported that students enjoyed using such AI tools independently, getting instant affirmations that built their confidence while the teacher\u2019s attention could be on those who needed human intervention\u301020\u2020L147-L155\u3011\u301020\u2020L153-L161\u3011. \n\n  It is important, however, that the teacher *remains in control of AI\u2019s role*. MOE\u2019s ethics guidelines insist on **human-in-the-loop**: teachers should exercise professional judgment on when and how AI assists learning\u301031\u2020L129-L137\u3011. In practice, this means the teacher sets the parameters (e.g. providing the AI prompt or choosing the AI tool), monitors the outputs, and steps in when the AI falters or a student is confused. During the Manjusri class, the teacher still circulated and helped students refine their queries if they weren\u2019t getting useful feedback\u30106\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u30106\u2020L71-L79\u3011. Maintaining this oversight ensures AI doesn\u2019t inadvertently mislead students without correction. It also reassures students that the **teacher is the ultimate guide**, and AI is just an aid \u2013 preserving the teacher-student relationship of trust.\n\n- **Interactive Class Discussions via AI:** AI can introduce new **kinds of class activities** that stimulate discussion and critical thinking. Teachers can use generative AI to generate content *for* the class to analyze, debate, or improve. Some ideas:\n  - *\u201cDebate the Chatbot\u201d*: For a topic in General Paper or Social Studies, the teacher can have ChatGPT generate arguments for one side of an issue and present that to the class. Students then must argue the opposite side or critique the chatbot\u2019s arguments. For example, if studying environmental policy, ChatGPT might list reasons **for** nuclear energy; students then debate against those reasons, or point out any logical fallacies in the AI\u2019s case. This not only teaches content but also how to identify weaknesses in arguments \u2013 a key critical thinking skill.\n  - *Bias or Perspective Analysis:* In history classes, an AI could be prompted to narrate an event from a particular perspective (say, *\u201cExplain the causes of World War I from a Russian historian\u2019s perspective\u201d*). Students hear/read the AI\u2019s output and then discuss how and why that perspective might differ from others, or which biases are present. This exposes them to multiple viewpoints quickly and trains them to question source bias. It\u2019s a modern twist on source-analysis: the AI compiles a perspective from its data, and students treat it like a primary source to interrogate.\n  - *Creative Collaboration:* In language or literature classes, AI can help generate creative prompts. For instance, students could collectively feed lines to an AI to co-create a story or poem, then analyze the result. Alternatively, the teacher can ask the AI to rewrite a passage in a different style (say, \u201crewrite this poem in Shakespearean English\u201d or \u201cmake this story sci-fi\u201d), and students then examine how tone or meaning changed. This sparks discussion on literary techniques and gives instant examples that would be time-consuming to produce manually.\n  - *Error Spotting Quizzes:* As mentioned earlier, teachers can display AI-written answers (some correct, some subtly wrong) and engage the class in a \u201cspot the mistake\u201d game. Students, either in teams or as a whole class, debate which parts of the AI response are accurate and which are flawed\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011\u301026\u2020L125-L133\u3011. This has been suggested as a pedagogical use: for instance, an AI-generated essay lacking human touch can be critiqued for its weak voice or lack of nuance\u301026\u2020L112-L120\u3011. Such discussions not only deepen understanding of the subject matter but also heighten students\u2019 discernment of quality in work.\n\n- **Differentiated Learning through AI:** Every class has a mix of fast and slow graspers. AI can help **differentiate instruction** to cater to this spread. As noted by a teacher in the CNA article, when a uniform prompt was given to all students, *\u201cthe feedback from ChatGPT is tailored to their needs\u201d* \u2013 stronger students got more advanced questions, weaker ones got more baseline prompts\u30108\u2020L1758-L1766\u3011\u30108\u2020L1761-L1769\u3011. This suggests that AI can adjust to the student\u2019s level in real-time. Teachers can formalize this by preparing **tiered AI prompts**: for a given task, have one prompt that yields a simpler scaffolded response and another that challenges with extension questions, and guide different students to use the appropriate one. Alternatively, allow advanced students to \u201cpush\u201d the AI further (e.g. ask follow-up questions that dig deeper) and encourage those who need reinforcement to ask the AI for more examples or simpler explanations. AI\u2019s ability to provide *instant examples, translations, summaries, or advanced applications* means it can be a personal tutor for each student. The teacher can oversee this by having students share what they learned from the AI \u2013 a quick oral sharing or a note in their work (e.g. \u201cAI Clarification: I asked the bot to explain X differently, and it said\u2026 which helped me understand Y\u201d). This ensures accountability and lets the teacher quickly correct any misunderstanding from the AI\u2019s explanation.\n\n- **Teacher Collaboration and Preparation:** Aside from in-class student use, AI is a boon for **teacher preparation**, which indirectly enriches classroom interactions. Teachers can use generative AI to **create lesson materials, quizzes, and differentiated exercises**. For example, the new **Authoring Copilot** introduced by MOE helps teachers generate lesson plans and activity ideas given the topic and objectives\u301020\u2020L31-L39\u3011\u301020\u2020L117-L125\u3011. A teacher could ask an AI, \u201cGive me three real-world examples to illustrate Newton\u2019s third law for a Secondary 3 class,\u201d saving time on resource gathering. Similarly, AI can generate custom practice questions at varying difficulty, which teachers can curate and share with students. Mrs. Wong, a teacher cited in *The Straits Times*, noted that using such tools to create quizzes and lesson segments freed up time to focus more on interacting with students\u301020\u2020L127-L135\u3011\u301020\u2020L133-L140\u3011. The result is a teacher who is **less burdened by routine prep** and can invest more energy in facilitating rich discussions or one-on-one coaching during class. However, it\u2019s essential that teachers review and **tweak any AI-generated materials**\u301020\u2020L133-L140\u3011 \u2013 ensuring accuracy, alignment with local context (AI content can be US- or Euro-centric otherwise), and appropriateness. In one case, a teacher found ChatGPT\u2019s model answer too \u201cAmerican-centric\u201d for a literature essay, so he used it as a chance to teach students how to localize and personalize the content\u30108\u2020L1798-L1806\u3011\u30108\u2020L1802-L1810\u3011. This underscores that AI\u2019s output often needs a human touch, but providing that is far easier than starting from scratch. Ultimately, better-prepared lessons and more teacher bandwidth lead to **higher-quality classroom engagement**, where teachers can focus on mentoring students and guiding discussions instead of scribbling notes on the fly.\n\nBy weaving AI into classroom practice in these ways, lessons become more interactive, **student-centered, and exploratory**. Students can receive more feedback and engage in novel activities (debates, analyses, creative exercises) that make learning active and fun. Notably, AI enables a shift in the teacher\u2019s role: from primarily delivering content to **orchestrating learning experiences**. Teachers become facilitators who set up the prompts, scenarios, and guardrails for AI use, then coach students as they navigate those learning experiences. This resonates with MOE\u2019s direction that *\u201cthe teacher continues to be the main designer of learning\u201d* even as technology is used\u301020\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301020\u2020L77-L80\u3011. As former EdTech head Aaron Loh described, lesson time can be \u201csupercharged by AI\u201d with teachers guiding the process\u30103\u2020L123-L131\u3011\u30103\u2020L125-L132\u3011. When done right, students in these AI-enhanced classrooms practice independent learning \u2013 asking questions, seeking help, critiquing information \u2013 **all skills that prepare them to excel without AI when needed**.\n\n## Strengthening Student\u2013Teacher Interactions with AI  \nIn an AI-enriched educational landscape, the **human connection between students and teachers** remains paramount. In fact, one of the promises of using AI in education is that it can **automate the drudgery** and free up teachers to engage more deeply with students\u301020\u2020L81-L89\u3011\u301020\u2020L85-L94\u3011. The Singapore approach explicitly aims to leverage AI so that teachers can spend *\u201cmore time with students and provide more complex guidance to advance learning.\u201d*\u301031\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301031\u2020L81-L87\u3011 Here\u2019s how AI can enhance (not replace) student-teacher interactions and ensure that mentorship, personalized support, and social-emotional learning are strengthened:\n\n- **Reducing Administrative Load:** Grading quizzes, marking repetitive assignments, taking attendance, drafting routine worksheets \u2013 these tasks consume countless teacher hours. AI systems and **education tech tools** can handle many of these efficiently. For instance, MOE\u2019s AI marking assistants for English and short-answer questions instantly grade and give feedback on student responses, catching grammar errors or key points missed\u301020\u2020L37-L45\u3011\u301020\u2020L49-L57\u3011. A biology teacher shared that by using the short-answer feedback assistant to auto-mark and give immediate comments on quizzes, she could switch from mostly multiple-choice tests to more open-ended questions without drowning in marking\u301020\u2020L153-L161\u3011\u301020\u2020L159-L167\u3011. This meant she got a **truer picture of student understanding** (no more lucky guessing) and could target her teaching accordingly\u301020\u2020L159-L167\u3011. With AI taking care of first-pass grading and analysis, teachers can focus their follow-up on **conceptual feedback and remediation** \u2013 tasks that truly require their expertise. Likewise, AI-assisted lesson planning (via tools like Authoring Copilot) cuts planning time significantly (one teacher reported a lesson that used to take a week to design now takes 2-3 days\u301020\u2020L169-L177\u3011). All these efficiency gains translate into teachers having more bandwidth to hold consultations, design enrichment activities, or simply talk with students. In MOE\u2019s vision, technology is used *\u201cto complement the professionalism of the teacher\u2026 so the teacher continues to be the main designer of learning.\u201d*\u301020\u2020L75-L83\u3011 Freed from some clerical duties, teachers can **design richer learning experiences and build stronger rapport** with their classes.\n\n- **Focused Remediation and Mentoring:** With AI handling routine feedback, teachers can better identify which students need extra help or greater challenges. Many AI systems provide analytics \u2013 e.g. which questions a student got wrong, how many tries they needed, which topics are troublesome. Teachers can use these insights to **personalize their interventions**. For example, if an adaptive practice system flags that a group of students struggles with a particular math concept, the teacher can pull those students aside for a small-group reteaching while others move ahead. Or, noticing a top student is breezing through standard work (perhaps the AI system keeps giving them harder questions which they still ace), the teacher might assign an advanced project or mentorship role to keep them engaged. In effect, AI can *triage* student needs, allowing teachers to be **more strategic in their support**. As Mr. Gerald Ajam from MOE\u2019s tech division noted, *\u201cA better use of the teacher\u2019s time is to look at the holistic progress of a student, and give very specific comments on how to improve\u2026 If we can free up some time (via AI), they can spend more time on the human side \u2013 engaging them\u2026 and delving deep.\u201d*\u301020\u2020L81-L89\u3011\u301020\u2020L85-L94\u3011. This \u201chuman side\u201d might include mentoring students on study habits, giving encouragement, or advising on personal growth \u2013 things no AI can do genuinely. The data AI provides acts like a compass for teachers to direct their attention where it\u2019s most needed.\n\n- **Enhanced Communication and Feedback Cycles:** AI can also facilitate **better communication between students and teachers outside class time**. For instance, a teacher might set up a class forum where students can pose questions about homework and an AI bot provides instant answers or hints \u2013 and the teacher monitors the interactions. If the AI answers correctly, the student gets help immediately; if it\u2019s unsure or a student still feels confused, the teacher can step in during the next check or class. This kind of system keeps students from staying stuck and signals to teachers which questions are commonly arising. Another angle is using AI to help teachers draft **personalized feedback comments** on assignments. A teacher could input a student\u2019s common errors or performance data and have AI suggest feedback templates, which the teacher then customizes. This was mentioned as a potential future use \u2013 scaling detailed feedback without losing personalization\u301020\u2020L143-L151\u3011\u301020\u2020L147-L155\u3011. When students receive timely, specific feedback (even if AI helped write the first draft of it), and sense that the teacher is attuned to their work, it fosters a better student-teacher connection. They feel \u201cmy teacher understands my needs and is helping me improve\u201d \u2013 even if behind the scenes AI summarized those needs for the teacher. The result is **more frequent and richer feedback loops** that guide students, which previously might have been limited by a teacher\u2019s finite time.\n\n- **AI as a Conversational Partner (with Teacher Oversight):** Some educators are experimenting with AI-powered chatbots tailored to the curriculum that students can \u201cchat\u201d with to explore topics. For example, a history teacher might have a chatbot trained on historical documents, so a student can \u201cinterview\u201d it as if talking to a historical figure or an expert. This can be engaging, but the teacher should oversee or debrief these interactions. A student might converse with an AI \u201cSang Nila Utama\u201d to learn about ancient Singapore, but the teacher later discusses which answers seemed realistic and which might be questionable. This three-way interaction (student-AI-teacher) can actually bring students *closer* to their teacher, as they together evaluate the AI\u2019s knowledge and possible errors. It frames the teacher as a co-learner and guide in navigating information. The teacher might say, \u201cLet\u2019s see if the AI\u2019s explanation matches what primary sources say \u2013 if not, we\u2019ll figure out why.\u201d Students see their teachers not just as evaluators, but as mentors helping them discern truth from AI output. This dynamic can **humanize the learning process** further, ironically using the AI as a foil to highlight the value of teacher expertise and guidance.\n\n- **Social-Emotional Focus:** With AI picking up some cognitive tutoring, teachers can dedicate more effort to students\u2019 **social and emotional development**. Singapore\u2019s education places importance on character and citizenship education (CCE) and well-being. Now, during class or form teacher periods, instead of drilling more academic content, teachers freed by AI could facilitate circles or discussions about online ethics, stress management, or teamwork \u2013 often tied to how technology impacts life. For example, after using AI in a project, a teacher could lead a reflection discussion: *\u201cHow did using AI make you feel about your learning? Did it ever frustrate or overrule your own ideas? How did your team decide when to trust your own judgment over the AI\u2019s suggestions?\u201d* Such dialogues help students become more self-aware learners and underscore that the teacher cares about them as individuals, not just grades. Furthermore, teachers can more actively monitor students for any negative effects of AI use \u2013 e.g. if a student is relying too much on an AI and losing confidence, the teacher can counsel them, or if students encounter disturbing content, the teacher can address it (backed by MOE\u2019s safety principle to avoid negative psychological effects\u301031\u2020L185-L194\u3011\u301031\u2020L195-L203\u3011). In essence, **teachers get to be more of the coach and cheerleader** for students, with AI taking on the role of a tireless practice partner.\n\nOverall, when routine tasks are pared back, teachers have the **energy to be creative and compassionate educators**, which strengthens their relationships with students. The ideal scenario is one where a student feels supported not only by cool new AI-powered tools giving them feedback, but also by a teacher who is highly available \u2013 someone who has time to discuss their progress, challenge them with higher-order questions, or just ask how they\u2019re doing. This synergy was highlighted by MOE: *\u201cIf technology can free up time, [teachers] can spend more time on the human side of a student\u2019s progression \u2013 engaging them\u2026 and really delving deep\u2026\u201d*\u301020\u2020L85-L94\u3011. AI, then, acts as a **force-multiplier for teacher effectiveness and empathy**. Singapore\u2019s approach keeps the teacher at the center (\u201cguide on the side\u201d but very much present) while AI works in the background. Such an environment will likely make students feel **more seen and guided than before**, because the teacher can focus on what matters most: understanding each student\u2019s needs and helping them grow.\n\n## Preserving Exam Rigor and Authentic Learning in the AI Era  \nEven as AI becomes a staple in daily learning, Singapore\u2019s education system continues to value the rigorous closed-book examinations that test individual mastery. The goal is to ensure students can perform at the same level of breadth and depth **without AI assistance** when it comes to pen-and-paper exams, while also harnessing AI to enhance their learning leading up to those exams. This requires a multifaceted strategy to **maintain robustness in testing and guard against AI becoming an academic crutch**. Key approaches include redesigning assessment methods to emphasize understanding, teaching study strategies that balance AI use and independent work, and instilling academic integrity. \n\n- **Designing \u201cAI-Resilient\u201d Assessments:** To maintain rigor, exam and assignment formats may need adjustment in light of AI\u2019s capabilities. If a standard factual question can be answered by a chatbot in seconds, teachers should consider focusing assessments on higher-order skills that require a student\u2019s own reasoning or insight. This doesn\u2019t mean making exams harder for the sake of it, but rather ensuring they truly gauge understanding, not rote recall. Concrete steps:  \n  - **Emphasize Application and Analysis:** Questions that involve applying knowledge to novel situations or analyzing unseen data are inherently more AI-resistant. For example, instead of asking for a definition or a well-known explanation (which AI can easily supply from memory), an exam could present a new case study or a problem context and ask students to apply concepts. A biology exam might give a short description of a newly discovered organism and ask how certain principles (e.g. natural selection, cell biology) apply to it. Because this scenario isn\u2019t in any textbook or AI training data, students must truly understand the concepts to answer. As one teacher noted, using AI freed her to move beyond multiple-choice to content-based questions that assess analysis, not just recall\u301020\u2020L155-L163\u3011\u301020\u2020L159-L167\u3011. This shift ensures that even if students practiced with AI, their understanding is what\u2019s measured. \n  - **Personalized or Local Contexts:** Incorporate questions tied to local context or students\u2019 personal experiences \u2013 things an overseas-trained AI is less likely to have perfect answers for. For instance, General Paper or History could ask students to evaluate a recent local policy or a trend in their community. AI might provide generic arguments, but a top-scoring answer would require concrete local examples or personal observations that only the student could provide. This deters students from relying on pre-written answers (AI wouldn\u2019t have those specifics readily) and rewards original thought. A literature example: One JC teacher found ChatGPT\u2019s essay on a local play *Boom* to be lacking accuracy and context\u30108\u2020L1821-L1829\u3011\u30108\u2020L1823-L1831\u3011. If an exam question centers on local literature or any work that\u2019s not globally prominent, students can\u2019t depend on AI summaries \u2013 they must engage with the text directly.\n  - **Show Your Thinking:** Continue and expand the practice of requiring students to **show working, explain answers, or justify choices**. Even if an AI could compute a math answer or spew out a history essay, it cannot easily fake a student\u2019s thought process, especially if the question asks, *\u201cExplain why you chose this approach\u201d* or *\u201cProvide two pieces of evidence from Source A to support your answer.\u201d* By designing questions that demand explanation or evaluation, exams ensure students demonstrate their reasoning. This way, even if AI was used in studying, in the exam the student must articulate in their own words. Some educators also discuss \u201cauthentic assessment\u201d \u2013 e.g. an open-ended project or presentation \u2013 but since the question emphasizes closed-book exams, the focus is on tweaking those exams to be less vulnerable to AI-prepped responses. In summary, exam setters can consciously filter out questions that reward mere regurgitation and favor those requiring *understanding, not just knowledge*.  \n\n- **Practice Without AI (Strategic Withdrawal):** To prepare students for the reality of closed-book exams, schools should incorporate **\u201cAI-off\u201d practice sessions**. That is, alongside using AI in coursework and homework, teachers should regularly give assignments or mock exams under exam conditions \u2013 no internet, no AI tools, strictly timed. This could be in the form of weekly timed essays in class, periodic no-device quizzes, or requiring students to hand-write answers to ensure they aren\u2019t copying from a screen. These practices serve multiple purposes: they reinforce memory and manual skills, build exam stamina, and also let students gauge their own mastery without AI support. Students might find that while homework was easy with Grammarly or ChatGPT hints, writing an essay unaided is challenging \u2013 this feedback loop pushes them to truly learn the material, not just learn to prompt AI. Teachers can point out discrepancies (\u201cYour homework was great but your test struggled on the same concepts \u2013 let\u2019s identify the gap\u201d) which often indicates over-reliance on tools. Secondary schools, for instance, might implement \u201ccommon last questions\u201d on tests that must be done independently to see how well students can integrate everything. JCs might hold more frequent exam simulations given the high stakes of A-levels. The key is to **make students comfortable switching off the AI** and still performing. We can liken it to using calculators: students use them in practice but also learn to estimate and do mental math so they aren\u2019t lost if the calculator isn\u2019t there. Likewise, students should use AI to learn *how* to get to an answer, but also practice getting there themselves through repetition and recall.\n\n- **Leveraging AI for Mastery, Not Answers:** Coaches often say \u201cpractice like you play.\u201d Students should be taught to use AI during study in a way that actually builds their skills for the exam, not bypasses them. For example:\n  - In math or science, instead of inputting the full homework question into Wolfram or ChatGPT and copying the solution, students can attempt the problem first, then use AI to check their work or to get a hint for the next step if they\u2019re stuck. Essentially, treat AI as a *tutor* that gives corrective feedback, not as a solution manual. Teachers can encourage this by only giving full credit when students show attempt and then the AI hint is annotated. If a student just has the final answer and it\u2019s clear they used AI without learning (perhaps they can\u2019t explain it when asked), there should be minimal credit and a conversation about learning goals. By contrast, using AI to test oneself (e.g. asking \u201cgive me a new problem similar to this one\u201d or \u201cis my reasoning for this question correct?\u201d) could be promoted as a good study technique.\n  - In essay-based subjects, students could use AI to *critique* their drafts or generate practice questions. For instance, after writing an essay, a student can ask ChatGPT, \u201cWhat are some weaknesses in the above essay or possible counter-arguments I should consider?\u201d and then work on those areas. This approach \u2013 getting AI feedback and then improving \u2013 means the student still produces the final content and learns the skill. It\u2019s very different from asking AI to write the essay outright, which teaches little. If students develop the habit of iterative improvement with AI (draft -> AI feedback -> refine), they are essentially training themselves in self-editing and critical thinking, which will show on a closed-book exam when they plan and review their answers. Teachers can model this process in class (as done in that Sec 2 English class, where the **focus was on using AI feedback questions to further the students\u2019 own thinking**\u30107\u2020L1628-L1636\u3011\u30107\u2020L1632-L1640\u3011). The message is: *AI can ask you good questions, but **you** must answer them.* This mindset prevents passivity and fosters mastery.\n\n- **Authenticity in Coursework:** To reduce any temptation for misuse of AI and to robustly test understanding, schools can design **assignments that AI can\u2019t easily do**. As education experts have suggested, tasks that involve personal experience, unique combinations, or physical hands-on components inherently defy pure AI solutions\u301026\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u301026\u2020L139-L147\u3011. For example:\n  - An English assignment might require students to interview a family member and connect that interview to themes in a novel\u301026\u2020L125-L133\u3011. AI cannot replicate that personal interview content, so the student must engage in the real-world exercise and analysis. \n  - A history essay might ask students to compare two less commonly juxtaposed events or sources (ensuring it\u2019s not a \u201ctime-worn\u201d comparison easily found online)\u301026\u2020L137-L145\u3011\u301026\u2020L139-L147\u3011. The originality of the task makes AI less useful, and students have to formulate their own insights.\n  - In sciences, lab experiments or field surveys can be integral to assignments \u2013 AI can\u2019t conduct an experiment for them or observe local phenomena. Students can use AI to help analyze results, but if they didn\u2019t actually do the experiment, they\u2019ll have no data to feed it. This preserves the integrity of learning by doing.\n  \n  By increasing the weight of such authentic assessments (projects, portfolios, oral presentations, etc.) in the overall evaluation, schools ensure that a significant portion of a student\u2019s grade comes from work that had to be done meaningfully by the student. This complements the closed-book exam and gives students a chance to demonstrate creative and practical skills. It\u2019s reassuring that MOE still mandates Project Work at JC and coursework components in subjects like Design & Technology, which already emphasizes originality. These should continue, perhaps with updated rubrics to include ethical AI use (e.g. as long as AI usage is documented and reflection is shown, it\u2019s acceptable, but the innovation and analysis must be student-driven).\n\n- **Academic Honesty Policies & AI Detection:** MOE can reinforce exam rigor by updating academic honesty agreements to explicitly cover AI. Students should sign or be briefed that using AI in a closed-book exam or in assignments where it\u2019s disallowed is cheating. While AI-detection tools are imperfect, teachers can use them as a flagging mechanism if needed (similar to plagiarism checkers). More effectively, having students do a quick viva or reflection after submitting major assignments can catch discrepancies (\u201cThis code you submitted works flawlessly; can you walk me through how you wrote it?\u201d). Schools might also adopt the IB\u2019s stance in spirit: using AI isn\u2019t banned, but **undisclosed use is**\u301022\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301022\u2020L15-L23\u3011. By bringing AI use into the open, we actually *reduce* misconduct \u2013 students won\u2019t feel the need to sneak AI answers if they can instead openly say \u201cI got inspiration from an AI and here\u2019s how I built on it.\u201d They\u2019ll also be aware that in exam halls, the absence of AI is the great equalizer \u2013 everyone relies on their own mind, so they must train that mind.\n\n- **Cultivating a Growth Mindset:** Lastly, ensuring students don\u2019t use AI as a crutch is also about motivation and mindset. Teachers and counselors should encourage a **growth mindset toward learning** \u2013 valuing effort and progress over just the correct answer. If students understand that struggling through a problem themselves (even if aided by hints) builds their capability, whereas copying an AI answer teaches them nothing, they may self-regulate their AI use. Celebrate when students use AI wisely: for example, a student might share how they got something wrong, then used AI to understand the mistake and finally mastered it \u2013 highlight this as the ideal use-case. Conversely, if a student just turns in flawless AI-written work, have a gentle conversation: \u201cThis looks perfect, but I\u2019m more interested in seeing *your* ideas and growth. Let\u2019s try another task without any AI, and you might discover you know more than you think.\u201d By reinforcing that **exams are ultimately about what *they* can do**, educators can instill pride in original work. Over time, students will likely echo what one 13-year-old initially thought \u2013 *\u201cyou need to use your own brain\u201d*\u30106\u2020L77-L84\u3011\u30106\u2020L79-L87\u3011 \u2013 but with a mature understanding that AI can be a tool to sharpen that brain, not replace it.\n\nIn conclusion, preserving exam rigor in the age of AI is entirely feasible with thoughtful strategies. Singapore\u2019s education system can maintain its high standards by evolving assessment design, promoting healthy study habits, and emphasizing authenticity and integrity. Importantly, these measures don\u2019t stifle AI use; rather, they channel it into **enhancing learning instead of shortcutting it**. By practicing with AI in a way that deepens understanding and by regularly practicing without AI to build independence, students will be well-prepared to excel in traditional exams unaided. They will walk into examination halls confident that *their* knowledge, skills, and problem-solving abilities \u2013 bolstered by AI-enhanced learning experiences \u2013 are more than equal to the challenge. Maintaining this balance of AI integration with academic rigor ensures that AI remains a **lever for lifting student performance and creativity, never a crutch that weakens it**.\n\n## Conclusion: AI as an Educational Lever \u2013 Empowering Students and Teachers  \nAcross secondary schools and junior colleges, the integration of AI tools \u2013 from ChatGPT-like chatbots to adaptive learning systems \u2013 offers a transformative opportunity to enrich teaching and learning. Singapore\u2019s approach is to embrace these technologies while **safeguarding the core values of education: deep understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and integrity**. In implementing the strategies above, MOE can cultivate an ecosystem where AI **complements human educators and learners at every turn**:\n\n- In the **curriculum**, AI is woven through all subjects, not only boosting efficiency and engagement in each discipline but also teaching students universal skills in AI literacy and ethical digital citizenship.\n- In **project work and assignments**, AI acts as a catalyst for innovation and inquiry, helping students achieve more than they could alone, yet under conditions that require them to fully grasp and extend what the AI provides.\n- In **classrooms**, AI brings in personalization and interactivity \u2013 instant feedback, diverse perspectives, and creative exercises \u2013 turning one-size-fits-all lessons into tailored experiences. All the while, teachers guide the process, using AI\u2019s assistance to focus on higher-order guidance and personal connections.\n- In **student-teacher interactions**, AI liberates time and provides data so that teachers can be mentors and coaches. The precious human elements of teaching \u2013 inspiration, pastoral care, motivation \u2013 are given more space to flourish, supported by the insights AI offers.\n- In **assessments**, standards remain high. Exams and evaluations evolve to continue challenging students\u2019 minds, ensuring that the availability of AI does not dilute academic rigor but rather encourages a shift to more meaningful assessment of skills. Students are explicitly trained to stand on their own intellectual feet, with AI as a scaffolding during learning that is removed during testing.\n\nUnderpinning all these is the philosophy that **AI should be leveraged, not blindly trusted**. It\u2019s a means to an end \u2013 that end being better learning outcomes \u2013 and not an end in itself. This aligns with MOE\u2019s ethical stance that while AI can *\u201cfurther customise learning and encourage self-directed learning\u201d*, it must be used in ways that don\u2019t *\u201cimpede critical thinking\u201d* or spread falsehoods\u301031\u2020L79-L87\u3011. Indeed, Singapore\u2019s educators are already exemplifying this balance: teaching students to use AI *legitimately and ethically* to *\u201cstrengthen their disposition to think and learn,\u201d* rather than to do the thinking for them\u30108\u2020L1749-L1757\u3011.\n\nBy adopting the strategies detailed above, the Ministry of Education can ensure that AI becomes a powerful ally in education \u2013 one that **amplifies the capabilities of both teachers and students**. Students will graduate not only well-prepared to ace traditional exams through their own ability, but also well-versed in harnessing AI tools in higher education and the workplace. In other words, they will have the best of both worlds: the *rigorous knowledge and problem-solving skills* that come from a strong academic foundation, and the *modern competencies* of using technology wisely and creatively. This comprehensive preparation fulfills the promise of \u201cAI as leverage, not crutch\u201d \u2013 students leaning on AI to climb higher, but never so dependent that they can\u2019t walk on their own.\n\nUltimately, education is about empowering people. AI, when integrated thoughtfully, can be a profound empowerment tool. It can give a student with learning gaps a personal guide to catch up, or provide an advanced learner with enrichment beyond the textbook. It can lighten a teacher\u2019s load so their passion shines brighter in the classroom. With deliberate strategy, continuous professional development for teachers, and clear communication of ethical expectations, Singapore can lead the way in showing how **AI in education elevates human potential**. In such a model, far from diminishing the need to \u201cuse your own brain,\u201d AI in fact helps students *use their brains more effectively*, creatively, and confidently \u2013 which is exactly the outcome we seek for the next generation of learners.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Singapore MOE \u2013 *AI in Education Ethics Framework (2025)*\u301031\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301031\u2020L129-L137\u3011  \n- Singapore MOE \u2013 *Parliamentary Reply on AI integration in schools (Jan 2023)*\u301034\u2020L193-L200\u3011\u301034\u2020L199-L203\u3011  \n- *Channel NewsAsia* \u2013 \u201cChatGPT is making its presence felt in classrooms\u2026\u201d (Feb 12, 2024)\u30107\u2020L1628-L1636\u3011\u30108\u2020L1782-L1790\u3011  \n- *The Straits Times* \u2013 \u201cWhat are MOE\u2019s newest AI tools, and how are schools using them?\u201d (July 29, 2024)\u301020\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301020\u2020L153-L161\u3011  \n- *Edutopia* \u2013 Geoff Richman, *Using ChatGPT in Middle and High School Classes* (Feb 16, 2023)\u301026\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u301026\u2020L139-L147\u3011  \n- UNESCO Bangkok \u2013 *How generative AI is reshaping education in Asia-Pacific* (Nov 2023)\u301023\u2020L501-L510\u3011\u301023\u2020L522-L531\u3011  \n- Ashley Tan \u2013 *Integrating GenAI* (Aug 15, 2024), reflecting on AI literacy beyond skills\u301019\u2020L41-L45\u3011 and integrated curriculum design."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":1025,"end_ix":1037,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Integrating GenAI | Another dot in the blogosphere?","url":"https://ashleytan.wordpress.com/2024/08/15/integrating-genai/#:~:text=,August%2014%2C%202024","text":"> \u2014 Dr Ashley Tan (@ashley) August 14, 2024","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":19,"cited_message_id":"32808577-1084-49e0-a5dd-158c13418078","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":41,"end_line_num":45,"connector_source":null},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":1176,"end_ix":1190,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Artificial Intelligence | MOE","url":"https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/20230109-artificial-intelligence#:~:text=10,habits%20and%20automate%20money%20deposits","text":"10.
