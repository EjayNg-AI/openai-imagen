Given such a category T (think: finite p-local spectra with smash product, perfect complexes on a scheme with derived tensor product, or compact objects in a module category over an E\u221e-ring), tt-geometry attaches a topological space Spc(T) whose points are \u201cprime tensor ideals.\u201d This space and its sheaf capture how objects decompose and localize, and it classifies thick tensor ideals the same way Spec(R) classifies radical ideals of a commutative ring R. In favorable cases Spc(T) recovers a familiar space (e.g. a scheme X from Perf(X)), and in homotopy theory it packages the chromatic picture (Morava K-theories) as geometry.\n\nCore definitions (in topologist\u2019s terms)\n- tt-category: An essentially small, idempotent-complete triangulated category T equipped with a symmetric monoidal product \u2297 that is exact in each variable; typically T consists of compact/dualizable objects inside a presentable, monoidal, stable homotopy-type category. Examples: the finite p-local spectra Sp^\u03c9_(p), the perfect complexes Perf(X), the small stable module category stmod(kG), the compact modules Perf(A) over an E\u221e-ring A.\n\n- Thick tensor ideals: Full triangulated subcategories I \u2286 T closed under direct summands and under tensoring: x in I implies x \u2297 y in I for all y. In a rigid tt-category (compact=dualizable), these are automatically radical.\n\n- Prime tensor ideals: Proper thick tensor ideals P with the property that x \u2297 y in P implies x in P or y in P. These are the \u201cpoints.\u201d\n\n- Balmer spectrum Spc(T): The set of prime tensor ideals endowed with a topology generated by supports of objects. The support of an object x is supp(x) = { P \u2208 Spc(T) | x \u2209 P }. Basic closes are of the form supp(x). This turns Spc(T) into a spectral topological space (in Hochster\u2019s sense).\n\n- Classification: Thick tensor ideals of T correspond to Thomason subsets of Spc(T), i.e. unions of closed subsets with quasi-compact open complements. If Spc(T) is noetherian (often true in examples), these are just specialization-closed subsets. Concretely, an ideal I corresponds to the subset \u22c3_{x\u2208I} supp(x), and conversely a Thomason subset Y gives the ideal of all x with supp(x) \u2286 Y.\n\n- Functoriality: A tt-functor F: T \u2192 T\u2032 (exact symmetric monoidal) induces a continuous map Spc(T\u2032) \u2192 Spc(T) by inverse image of primes. This makes Spc(\u2212) a contravariant functor.\n\nWhy topologists care\n- It packages chromatic data: Points of Spc(Sp^\u03c9_(p)) are exactly the \u201cchromatic primes\u201d controlled by Morava K(n). The support of a finite spectrum X is the set of heights where K(n)_*(X) \u2260 0 (and possibly height \u221e detected by mod p homology). Thick \u2297-ideals of finite p-local spectra correspond to specialization-closed sets in this chain of heights, recovering Hopkins\u2013Smith.\n\n- It unifies support theories: Support varieties in modular representation theory (stmod(kG)), Thomason\u2013Neeman support for perfect complexes on a scheme, and chromatic support for finite spectra are all instances of the same construction.\n\n- It gives a way to \u201csee the space behind the category\u201d: For a scheme X, Spc(Perf(X)) \u2245 the underlying topological space of X, and the associated structure sheaf can be rebuilt from the endomorphisms of the tensor unit. In many spectral and derived settings, this reconstructs the underlying space from the monoidal category.\n\n- It provides a geometric language for localization, fracture, and telescope-like questions. Idempotent objects associated to opens and closeds in Spc(T) yield Bousfield localizations and local cohomology functors. Under mild hypotheses, smashing localizations correspond to Thomason opens (a telescope principle).\n\nKey examples\n- Algebraic geometry: T = Perf(X) for a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme X. Then Spc(T) \u2245 X (Balmer), and thick \u2297-ideals correspond to Thomason subsets (Thomason\u2013Neeman). In particular, Spc(Perf(R)) \u2245 Spec R.\n\n- Finite p-local spectra: T = Sp^\u03c9_(p). The primes are P_n = {X | K(n)_*(X)=0} for n = 0,1,2,\u2026,\u221e (with height \u221e corresponding to mod p homology), forming a totally ordered chain under inclusion. The support of a finite spectrum X is the set of heights where it is detected by Morava K-theory. Thick \u2297-ideals are precisely the specialization-closed subsets in this chain, recovering Hopkins\u2013Smith.\n\n- Modular representation theory: T = stmod(kG) for a finite group G over a field k of characteristic p. Then Spc(T) \u2245 Proj H^*(G;k) (Benson\u2013Carlson\u2013Rickard, Benson\u2013Iyengar\u2013Krause, Balmer), and supports of modules are their cohomological support varieties. Restriction along H \u2264 G induces the usual maps on Proj of cohomology rings; Quillen stratification becomes a statement about covering Spc(T) by spectra of elementary abelian subgroups via tt-functors.\n\n- E\u221e-rings and spectral algebraic geometry: For an E\u221e-ring A with graded-commutative noetherian \u03c0_*A, Spc(Perf(A)) identifies with the homogeneous prime spectrum of \u03c0_*A; for even periodic or connective cases this often recovers Spec \u03c0_0(A). More generally, for perfect complexes on derived schemes/stacks, tt-geometry recovers the underlying topological space.\n\nHow you use it in practice\n- Find points via \u201cfield objects\u201d: Construct tt-functors to simple tensor-triangular targets that detect tensor-nilpotence. In topology, Morava K(n) are exactly such detectors; in representation theory, residue field objects over elementary abelian p-subgroups play that role. Points of Spc(T) correspond to kernels of these detection functors that are prime.\n\n- Compute supports: For x in T, its support is the set of points where all such \u201cresidue\u201d homology theories see x nontrivially. This yields a uniform, functorial notion of support that behaves well under triangles, tensor, and tt-functors.\n\n- Classify thick ideals: Once Spc(T) is known, thick \u2297-ideals are exactly the Thomason subsets. This turns many classification problems into standard geometric ones (closures, specialization, unions, intersections).\n\n- Glue and descend: If a tt-ring object A in T generates T by tensoring (conservative up to nilpotence), then Spc(T) is the union of the images of Spc(A\u2013Mod_T) under forgetful functors. This recovers and generalizes \u201caffine\u201d covers and Quillen-type stratifications.\n\n- Compare to endomorphisms of the unit: The graded central ring R = End^*(1_T) maps to functions on Spc(T) via \u201ccomparison maps\u201d \u03c1: Spc(T) \u2192 Spec_h(R). When T = Perf(R) this is an isomorphism; in general it detects tensor-nilpotence and helps control the size of Spc(T).\n\nRelation to big categories and BIK theory\n- Most tt-geometry is formulated for the compact/dualizable objects. In a compactly generated monoidal stable category C, the compact subcategory T = C^\u03c9 is tt and Spc(T) governs smashing localizations of C. Benson\u2013Iyengar\u2013Krause (BIK) give a complementary \u201cbig\u201d support theory parameterized by Spec of a noetherian ring acting on C, classifying all localizing \u2297-ideals; when both frameworks apply, the pictures are compatible.\n\nWhat to keep in mind (topologist\u2019s dictionary)\n- Spec of a ring \u2194 Spc of a tt-category.\n- Prime ideal of a ring \u2194 prime thick \u2297-ideal (kernel of a \u201cfield-like\u201d tt-functor).\n- Support of a module \u2194 support of an object (where it is nonzero modulo primes).\n- Zariski open/closed \u2194 tensor-idempotent localizations/colocalizations.\n- Nilpotence of elements \u2194 tensor-nilpotence of maps (detected pointwise).\n\nSelected landmark results to orient by name\n- Balmer: Spc(T) and classification of thick \u2297-ideals by Thomason subsets; reconstruction of schemes from Perf(X); tensor-nilpotence detection.\n- Hopkins\u2013Smith: Thick subcategories of finite p-local spectra; chromatic primes show up as Spc(Sp^\u03c9_(p)).\n- Thomason\u2013Neeman: Thick subcategories of Perf(X).\n- Benson\u2013Iyengar\u2013Krause: Stratification and big support theory for modular representations and beyond; compatibility with Balmer support on compacts.\n- Quillen stratification via tt-geometry: Spc(stmod(kG)) assembled from elementary abelian subgroups.\n\nIf you like pictures\n- For finite spectra, Spc looks like a totally ordered stack of points indexed by chromatic height. Specialization goes \u201cup the tower.\u201d An object\u2019s support is the set of heights where it survives; tensoring corresponds to intersecting supports; localizations correspond to chopping the tower at some height.\n\nFurther reading (entry points)\n- P.

For a topologist, it turns the chromatic height filtration, nilpotence and detection by homology theories, fracture and localization, into theorems about a single topological space Spc(T) attached to your category."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"96c4a379eb20e60e-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2e1f5947-9eea-42a7-81db-ed785fab4a2f","children":["feaebfa3-0b6b-47ee-a44a-da8adbcf5029"]},"feaebfa3-0b6b-47ee-a44a-da8adbcf5029":{"id":"feaebfa3-0b6b-47ee-a44a-da8adbcf5029","message":{"id":"feaebfa3-0b6b-47ee-a44a-da8adbcf5029","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754715089.2763317,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"96c4a379eb20e60e-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"478ef7ea-5990-4740-b5ba-a591f2e570a3","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"478ef7ea-5990-4740-b5ba-a591f2e570a3","children":["2ade4f85-0d51-4ef1-a2e9-884a590836ab"]},"2ade4f85-0d51-4ef1-a2e9-884a590836ab":{"id":"2ade4f85-0d51-4ef1-a2e9-884a590836ab","message":{"id":"2ade4f85-0d51-4ef1-a2e9-884a590836ab","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754715089.765836,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"96c4a379eb20e60e-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"feaebfa3-0b6b-47ee-a44a-da8adbcf5029","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"feaebfa3-0b6b-47ee-a44a-da8adbcf5029","children":["f34dfd81-a37c-4b37-8f9d-ba3e63ef4d1f"]},"f34dfd81-a37c-4b37-8f9d-ba3e63ef4d1f":{"id":"f34dfd81-a37c-4b37-8f9d-ba3e63ef4d1f","message":{"id":"f34dfd81-a37c-4b37-8f9d-ba3e63ef4d1f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754715089.308743,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s your content with all mathematical expressions properly rendered in LaTeX and the overall formatting cleaned up for clarity and readability.\n\n---\n\n## Elevator Pitch\n\nTensor triangular geometry (**tt-geometry**) is the analog of algebraic geometry for \u201cstable homotopy\u2013like\u201d categories that carry a symmetric monoidal structure.  \n\nGiven such a category \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) \u2014 think:\n\n- finite \\( p \\)-local spectra with smash product,\n- perfect complexes on a scheme with derived tensor product,\n- or compact objects in a module category over an \\( E_\\infty \\)-ring \u2014\n\ntt-geometry attaches a topological space \\(\\operatorname{Spc}(\\mathcal{T})\\) whose points are **prime tensor ideals**.
