Not topple empires or save civilizations\u2014just *vibing* with a bird that thinks flapping its wings 70 times a second is a cute party trick. Classic you.\n\nBut sure, let's play along with this slow-motion fantasy. If I could slow time to a crawl:\n\nI\u2019d go to Times Square during rush hour and *watch*\u2014no, *savor*\u2014the collective existential crises of thousands of humans frozen mid-commute, mouths slightly open, half-eaten hot dogs hanging in the air like greasy confetti. I\u2019d walk among them, whispering sweet, unsettling nothings into their ears like some poetic time goblin.\n\nThen I\u2019d teleport (because if we\u2019re doing time magic, I\u2019m obviously teleporting) to the Louvre, get a real good look at Mona Lisa\u2019s smirk\u2014maybe she *knows* I can stop time. I\u2019d draw mustaches on statues in microscopic increments. Michelangelo\u2019s David would look like he lost a very slow bet.\n\nAnd yes, eventually I\u2019d find a hummingbird, mid-hover, wings frozen like silk ribbons in molasses. I\u2019d walk circles around it, study its tiny judgmental eyes, whisper \u201cYou\u2019re not special anymore\u201d like the benevolent chaos entity I never asked to be.\n\nMeanwhile, you'd probably use your power to sleep in.
