The fundamental idea is\nto relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable\neffective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\u00e4hler\nformalism, as the direct sum of a 0-form, a 1-form and a 2-form. While the geometry of spacetime is\ndefined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the\nmatter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed\nentropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by\nthe matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein\nequations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing theG-field, which\nacts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert\naction with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The\nobtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical\nquantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might\nclarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.\n\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe relation between general relativity, statistical\nmechanics and information theory is a central research\ntopic in theoretical physics. The interest in the subject has\nits roots in the discovery that black holes have an\nentropy [1,2] and emit Hawking radiation [3]. Recently,\nimportant results have been obtained relating information\ntheory, entanglement entropy [4\u20136] and gravity [7\u201313]\ninvolving the holographic principle [14\u201316], the entangle-\nment properties of quantum field theory and the theory of\nvon Neumann algebras [17,18].\nThese results define a very active research direction [19]\n\nindicating that the quest for an ultimate gravitational\ntheory based on information theory and statistical mechan-\nics is ongoing. A comprehensive statistical mechanics\napproach to gravity is expected to give rise to modified\nEinstein equations [20\u201322] that on the one side can be\ntestable experimentally [23,24] while on the other side\ncan bring important conceptual insights into the ultimate\ntheory for black holes [25], dark matter [26] and quantum\ngravity [27\u201332].\n\nIn this work, a continuum modified theory of gravity\nbased on a statistical mechanics action is considered. This\ntheory treats the metric at each point of spacetime as a\n\u201crenomalizable\u201d density matrix, or more precisely a local\nquantum operator. This central idea is relating geometry\nwith the mathematical foundation of quantum field\ntheory [33] and is inspired by the used of von Neumann\nalgebras in explaining entanglement in field theories [17,18]\nand quantum gravity [34\u201336]. While the geometry of\nspacetime is defined through its associated metric, the\ninterplay between matter fields and geometry is captured by\nthe metric induced by the matter fields which describes how\nthe matter fields effectively curve spacetime. Embracing a\nstatistical mechanics approach to gravity, this work inter-\nprets these metric tensors as quantum operators and\npostulates an action for gravity given by the quantum\nrelative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the\nmetric induced by the matter fields. From the mathematical\npoint of view, the quantum relative entropy proposed in this\nwork is strictly related to the Araki quantum relative\nentropy for von Neumann algebras [17,37\u201339]. From the\nphysics point of view, the proposed action fully describes\nhow matter curves geometry and how geometry affects the\nmatter fields.\nA crucial aspect of the proposed theory is the adoption of\n\na topological (Dirac-K\u00e4hler like [40,41]) description\nof bosonic matter fields. Note that the extension of\nDirac-K\u00e4hler and staggered fermions formalism to bosonic\nparticles is gaining increasing interest in lattice gauge\n\n*Contact author: ginestra.bianconi@gmail.com\n\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.\nFurther distribution of this work must maintain attribution to\nthe author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation,\nand DOI.\n\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 111, 066001 (2025)\n\n2470-0010=2025=111(6)=066001(17) 066001-1 Published by the American Physical Society\n\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-3380-887X\nhttps://ror.org/026zzn846\nhttps://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2025-03-03\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\ntheory [42,43] and in network theory as well [44]. These\nbosonic matter fields are described as the direct sum of a\n0-form, a 1-form, and a 2-form defined on the Riemannian\nmanifold describing spacetime. Moreover the metric\ninduced by the topological matter fields is expressed in\nterms of the Hodge-Dirac operator [45]. From this stat-\nistical mechanics approach to gravity we derive the\nmodified Einstein equations by introducing an auxiliary\nfield associated to gravity which we call G-field. The\nintroduction of this new field is justified as it acts as a set of\nLagragian multipliers enforcing linear constraints on metric\ninduced by the matter fields. In this way the G-field extends\nthe popular use of the Legendre transformation in f\u00f0R\u00de\ntheories [20,22]. Given the particular entropic structure of\nthe action, the modified Einstein equations take a very\nsimplified expression. The gravitational part of the action\ntakes the form of a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action in which\nwe observe an emergent positive cosmological constant\nthat depends exclusively on the G-field.\nThis work greatly expands on previous results [44]\n\nobtained in the discrete setting by the same author. On\none side, here a continuum and fully Lorentz invariant\ntheory is proposed. This progress is based on the develop-\nment of the suitable mathematical framework to define the\nLorentz invariant entropy and cross-entropy between\nthe metric of the spacetime and the metric induced by\nthe matter fields. On the other side, here the relation of this\nstatistical mechanics/information theory action with the\nEinstein-Hilbert action [46,47] is established defining a\nclear connection to gravity. Two fundamental aspects of\nthis work that are not present in Ref. [44] are relevant to\nclearly relate this approach to gravity. First, this work\nconsiders a local theory, defining the entropy of the metric\nat each point of spacetime, while the previous work\nconsiders only the entropy associated to the full metric\nof the higher-order network. The present local theory\nallows a closer connection to gravity and constitutes a\nstep forward to establish the connection between this\napproach and the quantum theory of entanglement [17].\nSecondly, by adopting the continuum limit, in this work the\nintrinsic difficulty related to the definition of the curvature\nof networks, simplicial and cell complexes is avoided.\nTo keep the discussion concise the focus is here mostly\n\non scalar (bosonic) matter fields, and their topological\ngeneralizations with a brief mention in Appendix A of the\nnatural extension of this framework to Abelian gauge\nfields, while in Ref. [44] the theory covers also fer-\nmionic matter fields. Further extensions of the proposed\nlocal framework to Dirac and non-Abelian gauge fields\n[44,48,49] in the continuum or in the discrete setting are left\nfor future investigations.\nThis work is structured as follows. In Sec. II we provide\n\nthe motivation of the proposed theory and we discuss\npreliminary results on an instructive warm-up scenario. In\nSec. III we outline the proposed theoretical framework, we\n\npostulate the entropic action for gravity and we derive the\ncorresponding modified Einstein equations. In Sec. IV we\nprovide the concluding remarks. The paper also includes\nthree Appendixes discussing possible extensions of the\nproposed theoretical framework, providing the mathemati-\ncal background and all the necessary details regarding the\nnotation used in Sec. III, and establishing the connection of\nthe present theory with the theory of local quantum\noperators and the Araki entropy.\n\nII. MOTIVATION OF THE THEORY AND\nPRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA. Eigenvalues and logarithm of rank 2-tensors\n\nSpacetime is described by a torsion-free, d-dimensional\nRiemannian manifold K associated with a Lorentzian\nmetric g\u03bc\u03bd of signature f\u22121; 1; ; 1\u2026; 1g and a metric\ncompatible Levi-Civita connection \u0393\u03c3\n\n\u03bd\u03bc determining the\ncovariant derivative \u2207\u03bc. In order to formulate our statistical\nmechanics and information theory action for gravity, we\nneed first to define the eigenvalues the logarithm of rank-2\ntensors G\u0302. To this end we first define the eigenvalues \u03bb and\n\neigenvectors V\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\n\u03bd of the covariant tensor G\u0302 of elements G\u0302\u03bc\u03bd\n\nin a Lorentz invariant way. These satisfy the eigenvalue\nproblem\n\nG\u0302\u03bc\u03bd\u00bdV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\ufffd\u03bd \u00bc \u03bbV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\n\u03bc : \u00f01\u00de\n\nWe say that a rank-2 tensor is positively defined if all its\neigenvalues are positive. We notice that this definition of\nthe eigenvalue of a rank-2 tensor reduces to the definition\nof the eigenvalue of the matrix G\u0302g\u22121 as Eq. (1) can be\nrewritten as\n\nG\u0302\u03bc\u03c3g\u03c3\u03bd\u00bdV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\ufffd\u03bd \u00bc \u03bbV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\n\u03bc : \u00f02\u00de\n\nOne striking consequence of this definition is that the\neigenvalues of the metric g\u03bc\u03bd are all identically equal to one.\nAssuming that the tensor G\u0302\u03bc\u03bd is positively defined, we\n\ndefine the logarithm of this tensor as\n\n\u00bdln\u00f0G\u0302\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc V\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\n\u03bc V\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\n\n\u03bd ln\u00f0\u03bb\u00de: \u00f03\u00de\n\nand the inverse of a tensor as\n\n\u00bdG\u0302\u22121\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u00bdV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u00bdV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\ufffd\u03bd\u03bb\u22121: \u00f04\u00de\n\nIt follows that if the tensor G\u0302 is invertible, the logarithm of\nthe inverse of a positively defined tensor is given by\n\n\u00bdln\u00f0G\u0302\u22121\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2212\u00bdV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u00bdV\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\ufffd\u03bd ln\u00f0\u03bb\u00de: \u00f05\u00de\n\nFinally we define the trace of a rank two tensor as the sum\nof its eigenvalues, i.e.,\n\nGINESTRA BIANCONI PHYS.

Such an approach will be shown in Appendix B to\nbe general and applicable to metric tensors between two\nn-vectors (an n-forms) with n of any order.\n\nB. Warm-up scenario: Entropic action\n\nBefore we develop our theory, let us consider an\ninstructive warm-up scenario that will help justify the\ntheory that we will present in the following. Having defined\nthe logarithm of positively defined rank-2 tensors, we are\nnow in the position to define their Lorentz invariant\nquantum entropy H for metric associated to 1-forms.\nThis is inspired by the expression of the von Neumann\nentropy albeit we do not require the tensor to have trace\none at every point in spacetime. Thus strictly speaking\nwe interpret the generic metric tensor as a quantum\noperator [33], which has the physical interpretation of a\nrenormalizable effective density matrix [18]. We consider\npositive definite, invertible metric for 1-forms, represented\nby the covariant tensor G\u0302 of rank two. We define the\nentropy H of G\u0302 as\n\nH \u00bc TrG\u0302 ln G\u0302\u22121 \u00bc G\u0302\u03bc\u03bd\u00bdln G\u0302\u22121\ufffd\u03bd\u03bc \u00bc \u2212\nX\n\n\u03bb ln \u03bb: \u00f08\u00de\n\nNote that the problem of defining eigenvalues and entropy\nof tensors is a topic of intense research and similar\ndefinitions have been provided for instance in the theory\nof elasticity [50] and in applied tensor analysis [51]\n(although not defined in a Lorentz invariant way). In the\npresent warm-up scenario we will define the entropy and\nthe quantum relation entropy of different metrics taking the\nform of rank-2 tensors. As a reference for the notation used,\nthe reader can refer to Table I. Recalling that the metric g\nhas all the eigenvalues equal to one, it follows that the\nentropy of the metric g is null, i.e.,\n\nH \u00bc Trg ln g\u22121 \u00bc 0: \u00f09\u00de\n\nThe fundamental assumption of the present theory is that\nspacetime is endowed with two metrics: the metric g fully\ndetermining the spacetime geometry and the metric induced\nby the matter fields G that fully capture the interplay\nbetween matter fields and geometry. Leaving the detailed\ndiscussion about the metric induced by the matter fields to\nthe next paragraph, we postulate that the action should\nexplicitly express the relation between these two metrics\nand their reciprocal coupling. By embracing a statistical\nmechanics approach we consider the Lagrangian L given\nby the quantum relative entropy between the metric g and\nthe metric G induced by the matter field defined as\n\nL \u00bc \u2212Trg ln g\u22121 \u00fe Trg lnG\u22121: \u00f010\u00de\n\nUsing H \u00bc 0 we thus obtain\n\nL \u00bc Trg lnG\u22121: \u00f011\u00de\n\nWe observe that since g has all the eigenvalues equal to the\nidentity, and Eq. (2) holds for G\u0302 \u00bc G, the LagrangianL can\nbe also be expressed as\n\nL\u2261 \u2212TrM lnGg\u22121 \u00bc \u2212\nX\n\u03bb0\n\nln\u00f0\u03bb0\u00de; \u00f012\u00de\n\nwhere with TrM lnGg\u22121 we indicate the usual trace of the\nlogarithm of the matrix lnGg\u22121 and with \u03bb0 the eigenvalues\nof the 2-tensor G as defined in Eq. (2).\nAn important point here is that the Lorentz invariant\n\ndefinition of the quantum relative entropy given by Eq. (12)\nrequires that the matrix G has to be invertible as well as the\nmatrix g. Thus this is another difference with respect to the\nstrictly speaking density matrices that can be semidefinite\npositive. We are now in the position to consider an action S\nassociated to the Lagrangian L, as given by\n\nS \u00bc 1\n\nld\nP\n\nZ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nj \u2212 gj\n\np\nLdr; \u00f013\u00de\n\nwhere j \u2212 gj indicates the absolute value of the determinant\nof g and lP indicates the Planck length.\nWe note that the quantum relative entropy [17,37,38] is a\n\ncentral quantity in quantum information [39], in the theory\n\nTABLE I.

REV. D 111, 066001 (2025)\n\n066001-3\n\n\n\nof local quantum operators [33] and the mathematical\nfoundations of quantum gravity [34\u201336].\nAlthough we are not aware of previous interpretations of\n\nthe metrics as quantum operators, it is well known that the\nquantum relative entropy can also be defined among\nquantum operators that generalize density matrices. In\nparticular, in the fundamental theory of quantum operators\nalgebras [37,38], quantum operators generalize the notion\nof density matrices in an analogous way of the metric\ntensors adopted here. In particular in this theory, quantum\noperators, like our metric matrices, might admit a finite\ntrace at each point of the manifold but this trace might be\nnot unitary and might be a function of the considered\npoint of the manifold. For these quantum operators the\nAraki quantum relative entropy [37,38] is defined. This\nentropy reduces to the von Neumann entropy when the\nquantum operators reduce to density matrices of unitary\ntrace but is defined also among quantum operators of\nnonunitary trace.\nWhile we leave the discussion of the relation of our\n\nentropic action to the Araki quantum relative entropy to\nAppendix C, a series of physical observations are here in\nplace to justify our interpretation of the metrics matrices as\nquantum operators. As remarked previously we treat the\nmetric tensors as quantum operators or effective density\nmatrices. The main differences between the metric tensor\nand the density operators include the fact that we require\nthat the metric matrices are invertible and we do not require\nthat they have unitary trace at each point of the manifold.\nThe requirement of treating exclusively invertible metrics g\nand G is dictated by our desire to define the entropy in a\nLorentz invariant way. In fact here we desire to treat the\nmetrics g andG on the same footing of their inverse g\u22121 and\nG\u22121. It might be argued that also our relaxation of the\nrequirement to have density matrices of trace one has\nsimilar roots. In fact if we require g and G to have unitary\ntrace at each point of the manifold their inverse as well as\ntheir dual (defined in Appendix C) in general will not have\na unitary trace.\n\nC.

Since G should be adimensional it is conven-\nient to work in the units \u210f \u00bc c \u00bc 1 and to put \u03b1 \u00bc \u03b10ld\n\nP\nwhere lP is the Planck length and \u03b10 is adimensional.\nWe observe that in the limit in which the field \u03d5 is real,\n\ni.e., \u03d5\u00f0x\u00de\u2208R and the metric flat and Euclidean, i.e.,\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd, the metric induced by the matter fields G given\nby Eq.

Thus\nin this limit, the metric g is not determined by the action.\nLet us now make some remarks about this warm-up\n\nderivation. We proposed a statistical mechanics framework\nthat is very inspiring as we get the massless Klein-Gordon\nequation as the outcome of the minimization of a quantum\nentropy action for low coupling, i.e., 0 < \u03b1j\u2207\u03d5j2j \u226a 1.\nHowever this approach has two important limitations. The\nfirst limitation is that the Klein-Gordon equation does not\ncontain the mass term. The second limitation is that in\nabsence of matter fields the metric is not determined. In the\nfollowing we provide a more comprehensive framework to\naddress these two limitations. This framework can be related\nto gravity as it gives rise to modified Einstein equations that\nreduce to the Einstein equations for low coupling.\n\nIII. THE ENTROPIC THEORY OF MATTER\nFIELDS COUPLED TO GEOMETRY\n\nA. Topological matter fields and their associated\nmetrics\n\nIn order to derive gravity from our entropic action we\nneed to consider the topological bosonic matter field. The\ntopological bosonic matter field is a type of Dirac-\nK\u00e4hler [40,41] boson given by the direct sum of a 0-form,\na 1-form and a 2-form. Topological bosonic fields are\nreceiving increasing attention in discrete theories devel-\noped in network [44] and lattice gauge theories [42,43].\nTaking into consideration topological bosonic fields will\nallow us to introduce in the metric induced by the matter\nfields terms depending on the mass of the bosonic field.\nThus, in this way, we address the first limitation of the\nwarm-up scenario that we have presented above.\nIn order to address the second limitation of the warm-up\n\nscenario discussed previously, we include in the expression\nof the metric induced by the matter field also terms\ndepending directly on the curvature of the manifold.\nThese terms will be expressed in terms of the Ricci scalar\nR, the Ricci (covariant) tensor R of elements R\u03bc\u03bd and the\nRiemann tensor of elements R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3.\nWe define the topological fields j\u03a6i as the direct sum\n\nbetween a 0- (complex valued) form \u03d5 and a (complex\nvalued) 1-form \u03c9\u03bcdx\u03bc, and a (complex valued) 2-form\n\u03b6\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd, with \u03b6\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2212\u03b6\u03bd\u03bc i.e.,\n\nj\u03a6i \u00bc \u03d5 \u2295 \u03c9\u03bcdx\u03bc \u2295 \u03b6\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd; \u00f024\u00de\n\nand its conjugate topological field h\u03a6j as\n\nh\u03a6j \u00bc \u03d5\u0304 \u2295 \u03c9\u0304\u03bcdx\u03bc \u2295 \u03b6\u0304\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd: \u00f025\u00de\n\nThe considered covariant metric g\u0303 is defined as the direct\nsum of the metric among scalars (the identity), the metric g\namong vectors introduced previously, and the metric g\u00f02\u00de\namong bivectors given by\n\ng\u00f02\u00de \u00bc g\u03bc\u03c1g\u03bd\u03c3\u00f0dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd\u00de \u2297 \u00f0dx\u03c1 \u2227 dx\u03c3\u00de; \u00f026\u00de\n\nor, exploiting the antisymmetry of the 2-forms,\n\ng\u00f02\u00de \u00bc \u00bdg\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u00f0dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd\u00de \u2297 \u00f0dx\u03c1 \u2227 dx\u03c3\u00de; \u00f027\u00de\n\nwith\n\n\u00bdg\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u00bc\n1\n\n2\n\u00f0g\u03bc\u03c1g\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03c3g\u03bd\u03c1\u00de: \u00f028\u00de\n\nIt then follows that g\u0303 is given by\n\ng\u0303 \u00bc 1 \u2295 g\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bd \u2297 dx\u03bd\n\n\u2295 \u00bdg\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u00f0dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd\u00de \u2297 \u00f0dx\u03c1 \u2227 dx\u03c3\u00de: \u00f029\u00de\n\nThe local scalar product among topological fields is\ndefined as\n\nh\u03a6j\u03a6i \u00bc j\u03d5j2 \u00fe \u03c9\u0304\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc \u00fe \u03b6\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\u03b6\u03bc\u03bd; \u00f030\u00de\n\nwhere \u03c9\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc \u00bc \u03c9\u03bdg\u03bd\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc, while the local outer product is\ngiven by\n\nj\u03a6ih\u03a6j \u00bc \u03d5\u0304\u03d5 \u2295 \u00f0\u03c9\u0304\u03bc\u03c9\u03bddx\u03bc \u2297 dx\u03bd\u00de\n\u2295 \u03b6\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\u03b6\u03c1\u03c3\u00f0dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd\u00de \u2297 \u00f0dx\u03c1 \u2227 dx\u03c3\u00de: \u00f031\u00de\n\nIndicating here with d the differential operator and with \u03b4\nthe codifferential operator, we define the Dirac operator D\nas D \u00bc \u03b4\u00fe d, which is restricted to the space of topologi-\ncal bosons.

REV. D 111, 066001 (2025)\n\n066001-5\n\n\n\nG\u0303 \u00bc g\u0303\u00fe \u03b1\u00f0Dj\u03a6ih\u03a6jD\u00de: \u00f034\u00de\n\nThus in this general scenario we consider the two covariant\ntopological metrics g\u0303 and G\u0303 each given by the direct sum of\nmetrics among scalars, vectors and bivectors. As a refer-\nence on our notation for this general scenario we refer the\nreader to the Table II and the Table III.\nIn our interpretation of the metric as a quantum density\n\nmatrix, this would correspond to density matrix corre-\nsponding to a pure state Dj\u03a6i. However, if the induced\nmetric G\u0303 is interpreted as a density matrix, it is natural to\nadd further terms in the metric G\u0303. These terms will depend\non the topological field and the geometry of the space\nwhich will allow us to describe mixed states. First, we\nintroduce in G\u0303 a term proportional to j\u03a6ih\u03a6j. Specifically\nwe introduce a term \u00f0m2 \u00fe \u03beR\u00dej\u03a6ih\u03a6j where R is the Ricci\nscalar and \u03be might include the case of conformal coupling\n\u03be \u00bc \u00f0d \u2212 2\u00de=\u00f04\u00f0d \u2212 1\u00de\u00de. This term can be also interpreted\nas a projector. Secondly, we introduce a term depending\nexplicitly on the curvature of the manifold. Since G\u0303\ninvolves the metric for scalars, vectors and bivectors on\nequal footing, it is natural to consider a further term\ninvolving R\u0303 given by the direct sum of the Ricci scalar\nR, the Ricci tensor of elements R\u03bc\u03bd and the Riemann tensor\nof elements R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3, i.e.,\n\nR\u0303 \u00bc R \u2295 \u00f0R\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bc \u2297 dx\u03bd\u00de\n\u2295 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u00f0dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd\u00de \u2297 \u00f0dx\u03c1 \u2227 dx\u03c3\u00de: \u00f035\u00de\n\nIncluding R\u0303 into the metric G\u0303 will allow us to describe\nmore general metric matrices that are not decomposable\ninto the sum of projectors.\n\nFrom these considerations, it follows that in the induced\nmetric G\u0303, we will substitute the term Dj\u03a6ih\u03a6jD with M\u0303\ndefined as\n\nM\u0303 \u00bc Dj\u03a6ih\u03a6jD\u00fe \u00f0m2 \u00fe \u03beR\u00dej\u03a6ih\u03a6j: \u00f036\u00de\n\nAs we will see in the following paragraph this choice will\nallow us to effectively overcome the first limitation of the\nwarm-up scenario and to recover the Klein-Gordon equa-\ntion in curved spacetime in full. Furthermore we consider\nalso the additional term proportional to R\u0303 and we postulate\nthat the metric G\u0303 induced by the geometry and the matter\nfields is given by\n\nG\u0303 \u00bc g\u0303\u00fe \u03b1M\u0303 \u2212 \u03b2R\u0303: \u00f037\u00de\n\nAs we will see in the following the addition of the term\nproportional to R\u0303 will allow also us to overcome the\nsecond limitation of the warm-up scenario. Note that here\n\u03b1, \u03b2 are positive constants. In particular, since we require G\u0303\nto be adimensional, we need to consider \u03b1 \u00bc \u03b10ld\n\nP and\n\u03b2 \u00bc \u03b20l2\n\nP where lP is the Planck length and \u03b10; \u03b20 are\nadimensional in the units \u210f \u00bc c \u00bc 1.\nIn the main body of this paper we will investigate only\n\n(bosonic) Dirac-K\u00e4hler matter fields. However gauge fields\nand fermionic Dirac fields can be included as well. For a\ndiscussion of the inclusion of Abelian gauge field see\nAppendix A.\nPossibly this approach could be extended to include also\n\nhigher-forms.However, for simplicity, we consider here only\ntopological matter fields formed by the direct sum between a\n0-form, a 1-form and a 2-form as this the minimal choice that\nwill allowus to include in the action theRicci scalar, theRicci\nand the Riemann tensor explicitly.\n\nTABLE II.

Introduction of G-field G\u0303 and the field \u0398\u0303\nIn this section our goal is to investigate the property of\n\nthe modified gravity emerging from the entropic action. To\nthis end we introduce the auxiliary G-field G\u0303 and the\nauxiliary field \u0398\u0303. In this way we will be able to show in the\nfollowing that the proposed entropic action can be inter-\npreted as the sum of a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with\nan emergent positive cosmological constant only depend-\ning on the G-field G\u0303 and a matter action.\nAs mentioned before we can express the Lagrangian L\n\ngiven by Eq. (41) as\n\nL \u00bc \u2212TrF ln G\u0303g\u0303\u22121: \u00f048\u00de\n\nThis Lagragian is nonlinear in G\u0303 and thus in R\u0303.\nSeveral modified gravity actions are questioned because\n\nthey give rise to theories with derivatives of the metric\nhigher than two. Such theories can be affected by the\nOstrogradsky instability, however nonlinear theories not\nsuffering from this pathology are also known, most notably\nthe f\u00f0R\u00de theories [20,22]. Thus an important question is\nwhether the proposed theory is also affected by the\nOstrogradsky instability or rather, it generalizes and\nextends the realm of viable modified gravity theories\nbeyond the f\u00f0R\u00de theories. In particular the Ostrogradsky\ninstability can arise when the Lagrangian depends on\nderivatives of order higher than two of the fields, and thus,\nin the gravitational setting on higher powers of the\ncurvature R\u0303.\nIn order to tackle this question we observe that the\n\nLagrangianL has an easy expression as it is only dependent\non the product G\u0303g\u0303\u22121. Thus, by introducing an auxiliary\nfield \u0398\u0303 and imposing the constraints\n\nG\u0303g\u0303\u22121 \u00bc \u0398\u0303 \u00f049\u00de\n\nwith Lagrangian multipliers G\u0303 (constituting another aux-\niliary field) that we will call the G-field, we can reduce our\ntheory to a theory driven by the Lagrangian L\u0303 given by\n\nL\u0303 \u00bc \u2212TrF ln \u0398\u0303 \u2212 TrFG\u0303\u00f0G\u0303g\u0303\u22121 \u2212 \u0398\u0303\u00de: \u00f050\u00de\n\nThis Lagrangian is now linear in G\u0303g\u0303\u22121. Note that a\nconservative interpretation of this transformation will\nnot give a physical interpretation to the auxiliary fields.\nThus, according to this point of view, the auxiliary fields\nare not changing the physics of the original Lagrangian and\nthis theory might be prone to Ostrogradsky instability.\nHowever, we know from statistical physics that Lagrangian\nmultipliers can also acquire a rather physical meaning. For\ninstance the temperature and the chemical potential are\n\nLagrangian multipliers that are measurable. Here we would\nlike to embrace this point of view and give a physical\nmeaning to the introduced Lagrangian multipliers as\nphysical fields defined on our manifold K. Interpreting\nin this way the Lagrangian multipliers changes the physics\nof the problem as the phase space associated to the\nequations of motion acquires new dimensions and the\nfixed points as well as the initial value problem will involve\nthe newly introduced fields. In this latter interpretation,\nintroducing the auxiliary fields and giving a physical\nmeaning to them as encoding for new fields, we have\nreduced our theory to a theory linear in R\u0303. In particular, as\nwe will see below, the equations of motion will involve at\nmost second order derivatives of the fields, thus the model\nmight avoid the Ostrogradsky instability. A definitive\nanswer to the stability question would follow from further\nanalysis (for example a Hamiltonian analysis).\nThe fields \u0398\u0303 and G\u0303 are given by\n\n\u0398\u0303 \u00bc \u0398\u00f00\u00de \u2295 \u0398\u00f01\u00de \u2295 \u0398\u00f02\u00de;\n\nG\u0303 \u00bc G\u00f00\u00de \u2295 G\u00f01\u00de \u2295 G\u00f02\u00de; \u00f051\u00de\n\nwith \u0398\u00f01\u00de having elements \u00bd\u0398\u00f01\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd, \u0398\u00f02\u00de having elements\n\u00bd\u0398\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 and G\u00f01\u00de having elements \u00bdG\u00f01\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd, G\u00f02\u00de having\n\nelements \u00bdG\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 .

Discussion\n\nIn summary the introduction of the G-field turns the\nproposed entropy action Eq. (41) into the action Eq. (61)\ninvolving a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action and a dressed\nmatter action given by Eq. (62) depending on the matter\n\nand the gravity dressed Lagrangians Eq. (63) respectively.\nThe gravitational dressed action LG displays an emergent\npositive cosmological constant \u039bG only dependent on the\nG-field and given by Eq. (64). The equations of motion\nassociated to this action involve solving Eq. (55) for the\nmatter fields, and Eqs. (60) and (66) for the metric and the\nG-field. All these equations involve at most second\nderivatives of the fields.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis work proposes a modified theory of gravity\nemerging from statistical mechanics and information theory\naction. The fundamental idea of this theory is to associate\nthe metric to a quantum operator, playing the role of a\nrenormalizable and effective density matrix. In particular\ntwo metrics are discussed: the metric of spacetime that fully\ndefines its geometry and the metric induced by matter fields\nthat are effectively curving the space. The interplay\nbetween geometry of spacetime and matter fields is\nexplicitly captured by the proposed action given by the\nquantum relative entropy between the metric and the metric\ninduced by the matter fields.\nHere a Lorentzian theory consistent with this fundamen-\n\ntal physical interpretation of gravity is formulated. In order\nto do this we have built the necessary mathematical\nbackground to define the entropy and the cross-entropy\nof metric tensors in a Lorentzian well defined way. A\nmodified gravity is emerging from this framework when the\nmatter fields are described by topological Dirac-K\u00e4hler\nbosons formed by the direct sum between a 0-form, a\n1-form and a 2-form and the induced metric also depends\non the curvature of spacetime. The modified Einstein\nequations reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime\nof low coupling. By introducing the G-field we obtain the\nmodified Einstein equations and the equations of motion\nfor the matter and the G-field. From this theory it emerges\nthat the proposed entropic action takes the form of a sum\nbetween a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action and a matter\naction. Interestingly, the dressed Einstein-Hilbert action\ndisplays an emergent positive cosmological constant that\nonly depends on the G-field. Moreover, thanks to the\nintroduction of the G-field, the equations of modified\ngravity remain second order in the metric, in the matter\nand in the G-field.\nThe interpretation of the topological metrics tensors as\n\nquantum operators, or effective density matrix where we\nhave relaxed the constraints of having unitary trace, and we\nhave required the existence of the inverse, is shown to be\nvery useful. These choices are motivated here by the\nnecessity to have a Lorentzian invariant theory. Here we\nhave established the relation of the adopted quantum\nrelative action with Araki quantum relative entropy [37],\nopening the perspective of using the theory of quantum von\nNeumann algebras and the theory of entanglement [17] to\ninvestigate further the properties of the proposed theory.\n\nGINESTRA BIANCONI PHYS. REV. D 111, 066001 (2025)\n\n066001-10\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we hope that this approach can help\nidentify the deep connections among gravity, quantum\nmechanics and statistical physics. Given the interpretation\nof the metrics as a quantum operators our hope is that\nthis approach will also be instrumental to formulating\napproaches to quantum gravity in second quantization.\nFinally future investigation might explore the role of the\nG-field indarkmatter.Futuredirections in this lineof research\ninvolve also the investigation of the proposed entropic action\nunder the renormalization group, and possible connections\nwith phenomenology and experimental results.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partially supported by a grant from the\nSimons Foundation.

From this definition of the\neigenvector of a metric between n-forms it follows immedi-\nately that the metric tensor g\u00f0n\u00de has all eigenvalues \u03bb equal\nto one, i.e.,\n\n\u03bb \u00bc 1; \u00f0B28\u00de\n\nfor any arbitrary value of n, with 0 \u2264 n \u2264 d.\n\n2. Flattening of the metric tensors G\u00f0n\u00de and reduction\nto a matrix eigenvalue problem\n\nTo define the eigenvalues associated to the metric tensor\nG\u00f01\u00de between 1-forms, we can use a matrix formalism and\ndefine\n\n\u00bdN\u00f01\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd \u2254 \u00bdG\u00f01\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03c1g\u03c1\u03bd: \u00f0B29\u00de\n\nThe eigenvalues of the tensor G\u00f01\u00de are defined as the\neigenvalues of the matrix N\u00f01\u00de. Note that now the multi-\nplication of this latter matrix with itself preserves Lorentz\ninvariance.\nThe eigenvalue problem for the metric G\u00f02\u00de Eq. (B18)\n\ncan be also written in matrix form, by considering the\nm\u00d7m flattened matrices GF\n\n\u00f02\u00de and gF\u00f02\u00de with m\u00bcd\u00f0d\u22121\u00de=2\nrepresenting the dimension of the basis for the 2-forms\ndefined on the d dimensional manifold K. For instance,\ntaking the basis fdx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bdg with \u03bc < \u03bd the flattened\nmatrices GF\n\n\u00f02\u00de and gM\u00f02\u00de will have, respectively, matrix\n\nelements\n\n\u00bdGF\n\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd;\u03c1\u03c3 \u00bc 2\u00bdG\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3; \u00bdgF\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd;\u03c1\u03c3 \u00bc 2\u00bdg\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3:\n\nA practical example might be helpful to illustrate this\nconstruction. Assuming that the manifold K is d \u00bc 3\ndimensional and has three coordinates 0,1,2; the flattened\nmatrix gF\u00f02\u00de associated to g\u00f02\u00de, defined in the basis dx0 \u2227\ndx\u00f01\u00de; dx\u00f00\u00de \u2227 dx\u00f02\u00de and dx\u00f01\u00de \u2227 dx\u00f02\u00de is given by\n\ngF\u00f02\u00de \u00bc\n\n0\nB@\ng00g11\u2212g01g10 g00g12\u2212g02g10 g01g12\u2212g02g11\ng00g21\u2212g01g20 g00g22\u2212g02g20 g01g22\u2212g02g21\ng10g21\u2212g11g20 g10g22\u2212g12g20 g11g22\u2212g12g21\n\n1\nCA:\n\nUsing these flattened matrices we then construct the matrix\nN\u00f02\u00de of matrix elements\n\n\u00bdN\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03b7\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2254 \u00bdGF\n\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u00bdgF\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03b8; \u00f0B30\u00de\n\nwhere \u03bc < \u03bd and \u03b7 < \u03b8. Note that now the usual matrix\nmultiplication of N\u00f02\u00de with itself preserves Lorentz invari-\nance. The eigenvalues of this matrix N\u00f02\u00de are equal to the\neigenvalue of G\u00f02\u00de defined in Eq. (B18).\nSimilarly metric tensors G\u00f0n\u00de considered as quantum\n\noperators between n-forms can be flattened by considering\na basis of independent n-forms. For instance a basis for\nthese n-forms can be given by the canonical n-forms\n\ndx\u03bc1 \u2227 dx\u03bc2 \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 dx\u03bcn ; \u00f0B31\u00de\n\nwith \u03bc1 < \u03bc2 < \u2026 < \u03bcn. This canonical basis is formed by\nm \u00bc \u00f0dn\u00de n-forms.\nOn this basis we can define them \u00d7m flattened matrices\n\n\u00bdGF\n\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u20d7;\u03bd\u20d7 \u00bc n!\u00bdG\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u20d7;\u03bd\u20d7; \u00bdgF\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u20d7;\u03bd\u20d7 \u00bc n!\u00bdg\u00f02\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u20d7;\u03bd\u20d7:\n\nStarting from these flattened matrices we define the matrix\nN\u00f0n\u00de of elements\n\n\u00bdN\u00f0n\u00de\ufffd\u03b7\u20d7\u03bc\u20d7 \u2254 \u00bdGF\n\u00f0n\u00de\ufffd\u03bc\u20d7 \u03c1\u20d7\u00bdgF\u00f0n\u00de\ufffd\u03c1\u20d7 \u03b7\u20d7: \u00f0B32\u00de\n\nAs we have seen for n \u00bc 1 and n \u00bc 2 now these matrices\ncan be multiplied preserving Lorentz invariance, and the\neigenvalues of these matrices correspond to the eigenvalues\nof the metric tensor G\u00f0n\u00de.\n\n3.

Rev. D\u00a0111,\u00a0066001\u00a0(2025)) by Ginestra Bianconi. The paper proposes a novel way to derive gravity from a statistical-mechanics- or information-theory-based action, where the metric of spacetime is treated as a \u201cquantum operator.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 1. Motivation and Context\n\n1. **Thermodynamics & Gravity**  \n   The relationship between gravity and thermodynamics (in particular, the discovery of black-hole entropy and Hawking radiation) suggests that spacetime itself might be understood in terms of entropy or information. Jacobson\u2019s derivation of Einstein\u2019s equations from thermodynamic arguments, and various entanglement-entropy approaches to gravity, are prominent examples of these ideas.\n\n2. **Quantum Relative Entropy and Operators**  \n   In quantum information theory, the relative entropy between two density matrices (or more general \u201cquantum operators\u201d) is a key measure of how different two quantum states are. The author\u2019s central idea is to interpret the spacetime metric as one such operator. Because the usual metric does not have trace\u00a01 (and can be singular under certain conditions), the paper regards the metric only as a *positive-definite operator*\u2014akin to a density matrix, but without the unit-trace constraint.\n\n3. **Dirac\u2013K\u00e4hler (Topological) Matter Fields**  \n   While one might guess that \u201cmatter fields\u201d means just scalar or vector fields, the author uses a \u201ctopological Dirac\u2013K\u00e4hler\u201d formalism, in which one packages bosonic matter into a sum of forms (0-form, 1-form, and 2-form). This can also be extended to include gauge fields (Appendix\u00a0A) and, in other contexts, fermionic fields as well. One key advantage is that this approach naturally includes mass-like terms and curvature couplings while fitting well with the entropy-based picture.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Construction of the Entropic Action\n\n### 2.1 Two Metrics: g\u0303 (the spacetime metric) and G\u0303 (the induced metric)\n\n- **Default Metric \\( g\u0303 \\)**  \n  One views the \u201cdefault\u201d spacetime geometry as encoded by a rank-2 Lorentzian metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\). This naturally induces higher-form metrics too: for instance, the 2-form metric \\(g^{(2)}\\) and so forth. Collectively, the *topological metric* \\(g\u0303\\) is the direct sum of:\n  \\[\n    g\u0303 \\;=\\; 1 \n             \\;\\oplus\\; g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,dx^\\mu \\otimes dx^\\nu\n             \\;\\oplus\\; g^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\,\\bigl(dx^\\mu \\wedge dx^\\nu\\bigr)\\otimes\\bigl(dx^\\rho \\wedge dx^\\sigma\\bigr).\n  \\]\n  Here,\n  \\[\n    g^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \n    \\;=\\;\\tfrac12\\,\\bigl(g_{\\mu\\rho}\\,g_{\\nu\\sigma} - g_{\\mu\\sigma}\\,g_{\\nu\\rho}\\bigr)\n  \\]\n  provides a natural metric on 2-forms.\n\n- **Induced Metric \\( G\u0303 \\)**  \n  The paper then posits that, given a set of matter fields (0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms all together), one obtains another topological metric \\(G\u0303\\). For example, if \\(\\Phi\\) denotes the full Dirac\u2013K\u00e4hler field, then one builds \\(G\u0303\\) using:\n  1. Terms that couple directly to derivatives of \\(\\Phi\\) (analogous to \u201cDj\u03a6\u27e9\u27e8\u03a6jD\u201d).\n  2. Mass terms (with a factor \\((m^2 + \\xi\\,R)\\) multiplying \\(\\Phi\\) in some projector-like way).\n  3. A piece that depends explicitly on the spacetime curvature (\\(R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\), etc.) and \u201cmixes\u201d geometry with matter.\n\n  Concretely, for scalar fields \\(\\phi\\), or 1-forms \\(\\omega_\\mu\\), one can imagine a simpler expression like  \n  \\[\n    G_{\\mu\\nu} \\;=\\; g_{\\mu\\nu} \\;+\\; \\alpha\\,[(\\nabla \\phi)(\\nabla \\phi)^\\dagger]_{\\mu\\nu} \\;-\\;\\beta\\,[\\text{Curvature terms}],\n  \\]\n  with higher-form analogs. The constants \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\) set coupling strengths.\n\n### 2.2 The Quantum Relative Entropy as the Action\n\n1. **Entropy of a Metric**  \n   Interpreted as an operator, a positive-definite metric \\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\) can be diagonalized to find its eigenvalues \\(\\{\\lambda_i\\}\\). One then defines the (von Neumann\u2013like) entropy of \\(G\\) as\n   \\[\n     H(G) \\;=\\; \\mathrm{Tr}\\bigl[G\\,\\ln(G^{-1})\\bigr]\n              \\;=\\; -\\!\\sum_i\\,\\lambda_i \\,\\ln(\\lambda_i).\n   \\]\n   However, the *default* metric \\(g\\) (or \\(g^{(n)}\\) for each form-degree) has all eigenvalues identically 1, so its entropy is *zero*.\n\n2. **Relative Entropy**  \n   The action uses the *quantum relative entropy* between \\(g\u0303\\) and \\(G\u0303\\). Because \\(\\mathrm{Entropy}(g\u0303)=0\\), the relative-entropy expression simplifies to\n   \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\n     \\;=\\;\n     \\mathrm{Tr}_{g\u0303}\\!\\bigl[\\ln\\bigl(G\u0303^{-1}\\bigr)\\bigr] \n     \\;=\\; \n     -\\,\\mathrm{Tr}_{F}\\!\\Bigl[\\ln\\bigl(G\u0303\\,g\u0303^{-1}\\bigr)\\Bigr],\n   \\]\n   where the subscript \u201c\\(\\mathrm{Tr}_{F}\\)\u201d or \u201c\\(\\mathrm{Tr}_{g\u0303}\\)\u201d indicates taking the appropriate Lorentz-invariant trace over all form-degrees. The full action is then\n   \\[\n     S\n     \\;=\\;\n     \\frac{1}{l_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\,d}}\n     \\int \\sqrt{-\\,g}\\;\\mathcal{L}\\;d^dr.\n   \\]\n   This is the key ansatz: **gravity emerges as the variational principle of a relative-entropy measure** between two large \u201coperator-like\u201d objects (the \u201cbare\u201d topological metric vs. an \u201cinduced\u201d topological metric).\n\n### 2.3 Introduction of a G-field\n\n- Because the action above is *nonlinear* in \\(G\u0303\\), one can rewrite it via a Lagrange-multiplier trick and introduce an auxiliary field \\(G\u0303\\) (called the G-field in the paper) plus another auxiliary \\(\\Theta\u0303\\). These fields act somewhat like \u201cLegendre transforms\u201d do in \\(f(R)\\)-type modified gravities. After introducing them, the theory can be expressed so that curvature terms appear only at second derivative order\u2014a key sign that one avoids the Ostrogradsky instability.\n\n- Interpreting these new fields as genuine degrees of freedom (not just formal Lagrange multipliers) changes the structure of the solutions. One ends up with a *dressed Einstein\u2013Hilbert action* containing an *emergent positive cosmological constant* \\(\\Lambda_G\\) that depends on the G-field.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Equations of Motion and Main Results\n\n### 3.1 Matter-Field Equations\n\nFrom varying the action with respect to the matter fields (the Dirac\u2013K\u00e4hler forms), one gets field equations resembling generalized, curved-space Klein\u2013Gordon or Maxwell-like equations. In the low-coupling limit (small \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\)), these reduce to standard wave equations with mass and curvature couplings.\n\n### 3.2 Modified Einstein Equations\n\nVarying the same entropic action with respect to the metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) yields *modified* Einstein equations:\n\\[\n  R^{G}_{(\\mu\\nu)} \n  \\;-\\;\\tfrac12\\,g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\bigl(R^{G} \\,-\\,2\\,\\Lambda_G\\bigr)\n  \\;+\\; D_{(\\mu\\nu)}\n  \\;=\\;\n  \\kappa\\,T_{(\\mu\\nu)},\n\\]\nwhere\n\n- \\(R^{G}_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is a \u201cdressed\u201d Ricci tensor that depends on the G-field,  \n- \\(\\Lambda_G\\) is an emergent, *positive* cosmological constant, also entirely determined by the G-field,  \n- \\(T_{(\\mu\\nu)}\\) is the usual-looking stress-energy tensor for the matter fields, and  \n- \\(D_{(\\mu\\nu)}\\) contains second derivatives of the G-field (no derivatives higher than two appear).\n\nIn the regime where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are small (or equivalently, the induced metric \\(G\u0303\\) is \u201cclose\u201d to the bare metric \\(g\u0303\\)), one recovers ordinary Einstein equations, plus standard matter terms, and **zero** cosmological constant in that limit. For slightly larger coupling, there is a small, positive \\(\\Lambda_G\\), with interesting implications for cosmology.\n\n### 3.3 Role of the G-field and Cosmological Constant\n\n- The paper highlights that the G-field behaves like a set of Lagrange multipliers enforcing how the induced metric is a function of both the matter fields and curvature. In the fully dynamical interpretation, \\(\\Lambda_G\\) emerges as a function of G-field degrees of freedom and can be small yet nonzero, which might connect to dark-energy-like effects.\n\n- The equations remain second-order in the metric and in the G-field, meaning one might avoid pathologies of higher-derivative modifications of general relativity.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Interpretations and Outlook\n\n1. **Quantum-Operator View of the Metric**  \n   A major conceptual point is: one treats the metric as though it were an \u201ceffective density matrix.\u201d Usually density matrices have unit trace, but here that constraint is lifted. In mathematics of von Neumann algebras, it is known that \u201cnon-trace-1 positive operators\u201d can still yield well-defined generalizations of relative entropy\u2014this is akin to the Araki relative entropy.\n\n2. **Possible Connection to Quantum Gravity**  \n   Because the construction uses quantum relative entropy, there is a suggestion that this approach might shed light on the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity. In particular, the formalism is reminiscent of local quantum operator algebras in quantum field theory. The hope is that looking at the metric as a quantum operator in a larger Hilbert space might simplify attempts at second-quantized or entanglement-based descriptions of gravity.\n\n3. **Small Emergent Cosmological Constant**  \n   A phenomenon of interest is that the theory naturally produces an emergent, *positive* cosmological constant. If the G-field can relax in certain ways, one might get a small but nonzero \\(\\Lambda_G\\) that could be relevant to cosmic acceleration. How robust or finely tuned that is would require further analysis.\n\n4. **Dark Matter and Other Extensions**  \n   The paper briefly alludes to the possibility that the G-field might play a role akin to dark matter. Because the G-field introduces extra degrees of freedom beyond the standard metric, it could mimic additional gravitational effects. One could explore whether it yields extra \u201chalolike\u201d mass distribution on galactic scales or otherwise modifies local gravitational dynamics.\n\n5. **Future Work**  \n   - Detailed phenomenological tests (post-Newtonian expansions, gravitational-wave constraints, etc.).  \n   - Stability analyses (e.g. Hamiltonian analysis, avoiding ghosts).  \n   - Coupling to other (fermionic) matter or non-Abelian gauge fields.  \n   - Exploring quantum corrections and renormalization flows.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary\n\n**Key Achievement**  \nThe paper provides a new, consistent framework in which *gravity can be viewed as emerging from an entropic action*\u2014namely, the quantum relative entropy between the usual metric and a matter-induced metric. In the \u201clow-coupling\u201d limit, one recovers the standard Einstein\u2013Hilbert action (with zero cosmological constant) plus normal matter fields. When one includes additional curvature and topological terms in the induced metric, a *modified* theory of gravity arises, featuring an auxiliary G-field and a small, positive cosmological constant that depends on this auxiliary field.\n\n**Conceptual Significance**  \nThis approach unifies ideas from quantum information (relative entropy), from geometry (metrics on higher forms), and from quantum field theory (where operators can be associated to geometry). It points to an intriguing view of Einstein\u2019s equations and might offer a new road to bridging quantum mechanics and gravity.\n\n---\n\n### References and Further Reading\n\n- The paper itself: G.
