Here is a reconstituted English version of the article \"The IDF: Humanity's Shield Against the Forces of Darkness\" by Mohammed Saad Khairallah, based on the translated text you provided. I have aimed to present it in continuous, polished English prose, maintaining the rhetorical structure, tone, and emphases of the original.\n\n---\n\n# The IDF: Humanity's Shield Against the Forces of Darkness\n\n**By Mohammed Saad Khairallah**\n\nTo the honorable Iranian people:  \nIt is your historic opportunity to rid yourselves of the nightmare imposed by the mullahs. The world is watching as the masks of the priesthood fall. Now is the time for your will to unite for a new Iran\u2014an Iran that belongs to its ancient civilization, not to the crimes of the mullahs committed in the name of religion.\n\nLet us remember, with both pride and pain, the immortal names who resisted the mullahs\u2019 regime\u2014like Mahsa Amini, the young Kurdish Iranian woman killed by the morality police in September 2022 simply because her veil did not meet the standards of repression. Her martyrdom ignited a massive uprising inside and outside Iran, echoing the slogan \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom.\u201d Or consider Neda Agha Sultan, shot dead during the Green Movement protests of 2009, after demanding a simple right: the freedom and dignity of her people. Countless women and girls have paid with their lives or their liberty for their courage, many still languishing in the regime\u2019s prisons to this day. After all, does anyone blame the clerical regime for these crimes?\n\nWith this legitimate defense, Israel performs a great service to the region and the world. If Israel succeeds in destroying or crippling Iran\u2019s nuclear program, it will have prevented a regime whose violations against its own people are already egregious from possessing the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.\n\nI must thank the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which have demonstrated that they are a moral army, well aware of the value of military honor, proving that the mullahs\u2019 terrorism cannot go unpunished. All gratitude to Israel, which defends not only itself but also the future of our children and grandchildren, and the right of future generations to live in a Middle East where all live in peace\u2014upholding freedom, dignity, and the right to life. Victory to the forces of freedom and humanity, in the face of darkness and bloodshed.\n\nThe bloodshed caused in the Middle East by the Iranian regime deserves to be immortalized in cinematic works that testify to this era. Perhaps the most prominent who could present this visual testimony are David Mamet, Aaron Sorkin, and Stephen Spielberg. These and others could embody the Iranian era of darkness and the heroism of those who resisted it.\n\nThe height of justice was evident in what the IDF did at dawn on Friday, when it struck with precision at Iranian military sites and facilities, making it clear that the machinery of destruction must pay for its crimes. With this legitimate act, Israel is not only defending itself, but is fighting on behalf of the free world against the dark forces led by Iran\u2014forces that sanctify death, assassinate the future, and distort the past with false slogans that have brought only misery. This is a truth I have repeated in my writings, and I reaffirm it today.\n\nAnd here is the true test of our humanity: to which camp do we belong? To the camp of life, freedom, and dignity, or to the camp of darkness and nullity?\n\nIsrael, in its humanity, has proven time and again that it does not target innocent Iranian civilians, but rather conducts its operations with precision, targeting military leaders and nuclear and military facilities\u2014protecting itself, the region, and the world from imminent catastrophe. By contrast, Iran deliberately targets civilians, shelling Israeli cities with rockets to inflict casualties among the innocent. This is the chasm between the values that sustain humanity and the forces that thrive on bloodshed.\n\nIt is unfortunate that some blame Israel for defending itself and the region from a nuclear threat to all of humanity. What injustice is greater than allowing a criminal to go unpunished while the victim is condemned for defending her existence? Is it not fair for Iran to be held responsible for its orchestration of terror, most recently exemplified on October 7, 2023? Is it not logical that Iran should be held accountable for its crimes against the peoples of the Middle East?\n\nAnother aspect that must be remembered in this confrontation between Israel and Iran\u2019s mullahs is the use of unprecedented scientific and technological advances, foremost among them artificial intelligence, by the IDF. This is a stunning development that deserves a series of analytical articles in itself. But today I wish to focus on a deeper reality: the justice that Israel achieves in the face of Iran\u2019s machinery of destruction.\n\nWhen we look at the devastation Iran has wrought in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Gaza, we must be amazed at those who attack Israel while ignoring such rampant destruction. The Arab victims of Iran\u2019s militias far outnumber the casualties of all Arab-Israeli wars throughout history\u2014millions displaced or missing, countless wounded or dead. Iranian glorification of terrorism has even reached the point where Tehran named a street in honor of one of the assassins of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2014a decision reaffirmed just days ago, even as Iran prepares for normalization with Cairo.\n\nMeanwhile, the regime continues its crimes against its own people: suppressing protests, killing peaceful demonstrators, and crushing every voice that demands freedom and a civil state instead of a bloody priesthood. One of the tools of this criminal machine is the so-called Houthi puppet, threatening the Gulf\u2019s security and stability at Tehran\u2019s behest, simply because the people of the Gulf chose construction and peace over empty slogans of war.\n\n---\n\n*Article by Mohammed Saad Khairallah, published June 14, 2025, on \u0625\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0641 (Elaph)*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"dddea935-8f3f-4b7f-bdda-a4526fc810cc","request_id":"9509b5d8bf458348-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dddea935-8f3f-4b7f-bdda-a4526fc810cc","children":[]}}}
