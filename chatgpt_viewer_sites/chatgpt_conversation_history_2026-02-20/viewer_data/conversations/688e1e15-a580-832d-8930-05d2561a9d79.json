The target is to demonstrate *end-to-end professional practice*: reproducible notebooks, clean Python modules, CI-tested code, three performant models, and a containerised inference API running on AWS.  \n\nYour current strengths cover ~40 % of that stack; the gap is mainly **software-engineering rigour** and **deployment**.  The schedule below front-loads those gaps, then locks everything together with two full project simulations.\n\n---\n\n## 1 \u2013 Success Criteria  \n\n| Domain | Concrete evidence the assessor will see |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Data science | Well-annotated notebook, feature pipeline, three models (baseline \u2192 tuned), metrics comparison, `model.pkl` artefacts |\n| Software engineering | `src/` package, `__init__.py`, type-hinted functions, docstrings, unit tests (`pytest`), `pre-commit` hooks, CI badge |\n| Reproducibility | `requirements.txt` / `poetry.lock`, deterministic random seeds, dataset version pin, Markdown README |\n| Containerisation | Minimal `Dockerfile`, multi-stage build, `docker compose up` works locally \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201 |\n| Cloud deployment | Image pushed to **ECR** and running on **ECS Fargate** (serverless containers) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201 |\n| API | `FastAPI` app exposing `/predict` that loads the pickle and returns JSON \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 2 \u2013 Six-Week Roadmap  \n\n### Week 1 \u2013 Refresh Data-Science Core  \n\n* **scikit-learn 1.6 upgrade & review**: new `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` improvements, feature-name preservation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n* Re-read docs on `Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`, target encoding, `GridSearchCV`.  \n* Daily kata: pick a Kaggle dataset \u2264 100 MB, produce a 1-hour EDA notebook.  \n* Git discipline: initialise repo, meaningful commits, push to a private GitHub repo.\n\n### Week 2 \u2013 Software-Engineering for ML  \n\n* Structure code into `src/project_name/{data,features,models}` modules; use *relative imports* and config via `pyproject.toml`.  \n* Unit testing with **pytest 8 +**; explore new traceback improvements and useful plugins (e.g. `pytest-cov`). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n* Static quality: `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`; automate with **pre-commit**.  \n* Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions job that lints, tests, and uploads coverage.\n\n### Week 3 \u2013 Docker Deep-Dive  \n\n* Work through Docker \u201cGet Started\u201d guide end-to-end (install \u2192 Dockerfile \u2192 Compose). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n* Build an image that runs your notebook non-interactively (`papermill`) and another that serves the model with **FastAPI**.  \n* Practise multi-stage builds (builder \u2192 slim runtime) and tagging/pushing to Docker Hub.  \n* Stress-test: spin up three containers locally, use `ab` (ApacheBench) to hit the `/predict` endpoint.\n\n### Week 4 \u2013 AWS Fundamentals & Deployment  \n\n* Create AWS account, set up least-privilege IAM user + Access Keys (rotate afterwards).  \n* **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: push image.  \n* **ECS Fargate with Copilot CLI**:  \n  1. `copilot init --app mlapp --name api --type \"Load Balanced Web Service\"`  \n  2. `copilot svc deploy --name api --env test`  \n  3. Validate endpoint returns inference. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n* Alternative path: Elastic Beanstalk Dockerrun if ECS feels heavy.  \n* Budget awareness: use spot pricing limits; tear down resources daily.\n\n### Week 5 \u2013 Full Simulation #1 (5 days)  \n\n1. **Monday** \u2013 Choose unfamiliar but tidy dataset (e.g. NYC Taxi).  \n2. **Tuesday** \u2013 EDA notebook \u2192 commit.  \n3. **Wednesday** \u2013 Build three models (baseline, tree-based, gradient boosting) with reproducible pipeline; log metrics.  \n4. **Thursday** \u2013 Containerise FastAPI inference, push to ECR, deploy to Fargate.  \n5. **Friday** \u2013 Write README, architecture diagram, unit tests > 80 % coverage, open a pull request and self-review.\n\n### Week 6 \u2013 Polish & Simulation #2  \n\n* Repeat simulation with stricter time box (48 h).  \n* Run linters, tighten docstrings, reduce tech-debt TODOs.  \n* Prepare interview\u2010day cheatsheets: Docker commands, AWS CLI, `sklearn` metrics table.  \n* Mock interview: explain design choices, trade-offs, security controls, failure modes.\n\n---\n\n## 3 \u2013 Daily Cadence (Mon-Sat)  \n\n| Slot | Focus | Example |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| 1 h  | Theory reading | Official docs, design-pattern blogpost |\n| 2 h  | Guided coding | Follow tutorial or build feature |\n| 1 h  | Free coding / notebook cleanup | Refactor, write tests |\n| 30 min | Reflection & notes | What broke?  How did you debug? |\n\nKeep Sundays free \u2013 burnout kills velocity.\n\n---\n\n## 4 \u2013 Resource Short-List  \n\n* **Docker Docs \u201cGet Started\u201d series** \u2013 canonical walk-through \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n* **FastAPI Docker Deployment Guide** \u2013 minimal API pattern \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n* **MachineLearningMastery: Containerising ML with FastAPI** \u2013 step-by-step build/push/test \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n* **AWS Fargate Workshop & Copilot CLI** \u2013 easiest ECS on-ramp \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n* **scikit-learn 1.6 Release Highlights** \u2013 new tricks to showcase \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n* **pytest Docs & Plugin Index** \u2013 testing ecosystem \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 5 \u2013 Risk Mitigation & Pro Tips  \n\n1. **Time boxing** \u2013 avoid rabbit-holes (e.g. advanced SageMaker).  \n2. **Small vertical slices** \u2013 get a \u201cwalking skeleton\u201d (one model, one endpoint) deployed early, then iterate.  \n3. **Automate everything** \u2013 Makefile targets: `make train`, `make test`, `make deploy`.  \n4. **Security hygiene** \u2013 never commit AWS keys; use GitHub Secrets & OIDC.  \n5. **Storytelling** \u2013 in the README narrate problem, approach, decisions, limitations, next steps.\n\nStay disciplined; six weeks of focused, high-leverage practice is enough to transform comfort into professional fluency.
