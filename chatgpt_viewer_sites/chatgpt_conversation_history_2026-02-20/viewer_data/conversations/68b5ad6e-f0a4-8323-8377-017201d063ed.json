It commonly affects soft tissues like the eyelids, mouth, and genitals but can also impact the lungs, digestive tract, arms, legs, and throat. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is rare, affecting approximately 1 in 50,000 people in the US, while acquired angioedema (AAE) is even less common, affecting 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 500,000 people. Allergic angioedema is more prevalent, causing about 1 million emergency department visits annually in the US. Black Americans have a higher incidence of ACEI angioedema, associated with blood pressure medications. Half of all angioedema cases occur in individuals aged 50, and women may experience more severe symptoms than men due to hormonal triggers. Angioedema can become life-threatening if it causes airway blockage, requiring immediate medical attention. Screening and early detection are crucial, especially for individuals on ACE inhibitors.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1672776993.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/lisinopril-causes-cough-1124151","title":"What Is a Lisinopril Cough?","snippet":"Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, commonly causes a persistent dry cough, affecting up to 35% of some user groups. This side effect is due to the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This leads to increased levels of bradykinin, a compound that can trigger inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the airways, resulting in a cough. The onset of the cough can range from hours after the first dose to several months into treatment. Although not everyone experiences this side effect, certain risk factors may increase susceptibility. Treatment typically involves discontinuing the medication, as cough suppressants are ineffective. However, switching from ACE inhibitors to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which do not increase bradykinin levels, may offer a comparable treatment without the cough. Alternatively, adding a calcium channel blocker may alleviate symptoms. Despite the potential side effect, ACE inhibitors remain a first-line treatment in the U.S., with about 20% of patients discontinuing due to adverse effects like coughing.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1433296322.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/ace-inhibitors-blood-pressure-control-in-diabetes-1087278","title":"ACE Inhibitor Uses and Side Effects","snippet":"ACE inhibitors are oral medications primarily used to lower blood pressure and are effective in treating heart-related conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. They also aid in managing complications from diabetes, like diabetic nephropathy, and slow the progression of kidney disease. Approved by the FDA for treating hypertension since 1981, ACE inhibitors are also used off-label for conditions such as migraines and are being studied for potential roles in treating liver disease and uterine fibroids.\n\nThese drugs work by blocking the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels and causes fluid retention. While generally well-tolerated, ACE inhibitors may have side effects, including low blood pressure, dry cough, dizziness, and, rarely, angioedema. Patients with significant kidney damage, those who are pregnant, or breastfeeding should avoid these medications. ACE inhibitors can interact negatively with NSAIDs and excessive salt intake, which may reduce their effectiveness or increase the risk of kidney damage. Dosing varies depending on co-medications and individual health status, and patients should consult healthcare providers for proper dosage and dietary guidance. Regular blood pressure monitoring is advised to optimize medication timing and effectiveness.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1194389184.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b5adb31db880079f9d36bfb84fd11e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching ACE inhibitor side effects and incidence rates","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"978574760fbcfe8c-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"65f0201e-9342-4a37-8142-fcb6ae3e0962","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"65f0201e-9342-4a37-8142-fcb6ae3e0962","children":["89344aef-3059-4104-96c2-504695f2ea1a"]},"89344aef-3059-4104-96c2-504695f2ea1a":{"id":"89344aef-3059-4104-96c2-504695f2ea1a","message":{"id":"89344aef-3059-4104-96c2-504695f2ea1a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756736954.332597,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Choosing reliable sources","content":"I want to make sure I\u2019m using the best sources, and avoid low-quality ones like Verywell unless absolutely necessary.

This side effect is due to the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This leads to increased levels of bradykinin, a compound that can trigger inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the airways, resulting in a cough. The onset of the cough can range from hours after the first dose to several months into treatment. Although not everyone experiences this side effect, certain risk factors may increase susceptibility. Treatment typically involves discontinuing the medication, as cough suppressants are ineffective. However, switching from ACE inhibitors to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which do not increase bradykinin levels, may offer a comparable treatment without the cough. Alternatively, adding a calcium channel blocker may alleviate symptoms. Despite the potential side effect, ACE inhibitors remain a first-line treatment in the U.S., with about 20% of patients discontinuing due to adverse effects like coughing.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1433296322.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor","title":"ACE inhibitor","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752890233.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinin","title":"Bradykinin","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756051854.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b5adb31db880079f9d36bfb84fd11e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Compiling ACE inhibitor cough incidence and risk factors","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"978574760fbcfe8c-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"3b68c84b-b9eb-4068-9338-326c46fc4d97","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3b68c84b-b9eb-4068-9338-326c46fc4d97","children":["83671048-1b6a-439b-9082-54253d710ade"]},"83671048-1b6a-439b-9082-54253d710ade":{"id":"83671048-1b6a-439b-9082-54253d710ade","message":{"id":"83671048-1b6a-439b-9082-54253d710ade","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756737004.88374,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying ACEI contraindications and risks","content":"I won\u2019t rely on Wikipedia for this and will focus on credible, peer-reviewed sources.

Ranges vary by specific drug, dose, and patient factors; I give typical ballparks from large reviews, labels, and guidelines.\n\n### Common / expected\n- **Dry, persistent cough** \u2014 usually tickly, worse at night.  \n  **How likely:** ~5\u201320% overall; higher in East Asian populations and in women/non-smokers. Can start hours to months after initiation and usually resolves 1\u20134 weeks after stopping (sometimes up to 3 months). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search11\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search13\ue202turn4search5\ue201\n- **Dizziness/low blood pressure (first-dose effect)** \u2014 especially if volume-depleted or on diuretics.  \n  **How likely:** symptomatic hypotension/dizziness in a few to ~10% in trials; syncope ~0.1% in lisinopril labeling. Risk highest in the first days/weeks and after dose increases. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search10\ue201\n- **Creatinine rise / eGFR dip** \u2014 a modest rise is expected.  \n  **How likely:** small increases are common; guidelines accept up to a **30%** creatinine rise (or ~25% eGFR fall) in the first 2\u20134 weeks; larger or progressive changes need evaluation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search12\ue201\n- **Hyperkalemia (high potassium)** \u2014 risk increases with CKD, diabetes, older age, potassium-sparing drugs.  \n  **How likely:** a few percent in general use; higher with CKD/concomitant meds. Monitor closely after starting and titrations. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue201\n\n### Less common\n- **Rash, taste disturbance (dysgeusia)** \u2014 more with **captopril** (sulfhydryl group).  \n  **How likely:** uncommon; drug-specific. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue201\n- **GI upset, headache, fatigue** \u2014 generally mild/transient. (Class labeling.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search11\ue201\n\n### Rare but important\n- **Angioedema** \u2014 sudden swelling of lips/tongue/face/airway; can be life-threatening.  \n  **How likely:** ~0.1\u20130.7% overall; higher risk in people of African ancestry; can occur anytime (often in first 3 months). **Stop ACEi and seek urgent care if any swelling/voice change/dyspnea.** \ue200cite\ue202turn6search6\ue202turn1search18\ue201\n- **Kidney injury** \u2014 particularly with severe volume depletion or **renal artery stenosis** (bilateral or solitary kidney).  \n  **How likely:** uncommon but clinically significant in those settings; monitor renal function and volume status. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue201\n- **Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia/agranulocytosis)** \u2014 mainly reported with **captopril**, especially in renal impairment or collagen vascular disease.  \n  **How likely:** rare; consider CBC monitoring in at-risk patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search8\ue202turn7search1\ue201\n- **Drug-induced liver injury** \u2014 cholestatic or hepatocellular; unusual but reported with several ACEi.  \n  **How likely:** rare; resolves after stopping in most cases. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201\n\n### Who is more likely to get certain side effects?\n- **Cough:** women, non-smokers, and East Asian populations have higher observed rates; certain bradykinin-pathway polymorphisms may contribute. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search13\ue201\n- **Angioedema:** higher baseline risk in Black patients; risk also rises with concomitant **DPP-4 inhibitors** (e.g., sitagliptin) due to bradykinin/substance-P effects\u2014absolute risk is small but real. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search18\ue202turn10search2\ue201\n- **Hyperkalemia/renal issues:** CKD, diabetes, older age, dehydration, and interacting meds. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue201\n\n### Drug interactions that materially change risk\n- **NSAID + ACEi + diuretic** (\u201c**triple whammy**\u201d): increases AKI risk; avoid if possible and monitor if unavoidable. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search16\ue201\n- **Potassium-raising drugs** (spironolactone/eplerenone, potassium supplements, **TMP-SMX** antibiotic): increase hyperkalemia risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n- **Lithium:** ACEi can raise lithium levels \u2192 toxicity; avoid or monitor levels closely. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201\n- **Sacubitril/valsartan (ARNI):** **contraindicated within 36 hours** of an ACEi (angioedema risk). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n- **Aliskiren:** **contraindicated** with ACEi in diabetes; avoid in renal impairment. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201\n\n### Pregnancy\nACE inhibitors carry a **boxed warning for fetal toxicity** (2nd/3rd trimester) \u2014 renal failure, oligohydramnios, skull hypoplasia, neonatal death. **Stop immediately if pregnancy occurs.** \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n### Practical monitoring & mitigation\n- **Before starting:** check BP, **creatinine/eGFR**, **potassium**; review NSAIDs, diuretics, lithium, potassium sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue201\n- **After starting or each dose change:** re-check creatinine/eGFR & potassium within **1\u20132 (up to 4) weeks**.  \n  Continue unless creatinine rises >**30%** or potassium becomes uncontrolled; investigate causes (dehydration, NSAIDs, high K\u207a diet, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search22\ue201\n- **If cough develops:** rule out other causes; switching to an **ARB** usually fixes it (ARBs have ~3\u00d7 lower cough risk than ACEi). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue201\n- **If angioedema:** **stop ACEi permanently**; ARBs can still rarely cause angioedema (estimated \u2264~10% recurrence among those with prior ACEi angioedema), so weigh risks carefully. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue201\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me which ACE inhibitor (or other meds/conditions) you\u2019re considering and I\u2019ll tailor these risks and a monitoring plan more precisely (e.g., CKD vs normal renal function, Singapore formulary options)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6search11\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search13\ue202turn4search5\ue201","start_idx":529,"end_idx":589,"safe_urls":["https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692%2815%2952845-6/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6340691/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.nature.com/articles/tpj201551?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thoracrespract.org/pdf/68ab204c-182b-49da-b227-bc7efe058632/articles/TurkThoracJ.2018.18014/36-42.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Chest Journal](https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692%2815%2952845-6/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6340691/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/tpj201551?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Thoracic Research and Practice](https://www.thoracrespract.org/pdf/68ab204c-182b-49da-b227-bc7efe058632/articles/TurkThoracJ.2018.18014/36-42.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor-Induced Cough","url":"https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692%2815%2952845-6/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by PV Dicpinigaitis \u00b7 2006 \u00b7 Cited by 547 \u2014 The incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough has been reported to be in the range of 5 to 35% among patients treated with these agents.

Pregnant women are advised to keep caffeine intake very low. Over 60 plants naturally contain caffeine, and it's also added to other products. Benefits include increased alertness and improved physical performance, but excessive consumption can lead to overdose. Symptoms of overdose include chills, flushing, headache, nausea, heart palpitations, and tremors. A lethal dose is 5-10 grams of caffeine. Accidental overdoses are rare but can occur with highly concentrated caffeine products. If overdose symptoms appear, contact Poison Control or call 911. Preventing overdose involves being aware of caffeine content in foods and medications and following dosage instructions for concentrated caffeine products carefully.

The recommended safe limit is 400 milligrams per day, equivalent to around three cups of coffee, five ounces of espresso, or seven cups of black tea. Consuming more than this can lead to side effects such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, and headaches. Some people, including pregnant women, children, those with anxiety disorders, and individuals on certain medications, should limit or avoid caffeine. The source of caffeine, whether from natural or synthetic sources, generally does not affect its impact on health, though some beverages like matcha tea offer additional compounds that can moderate the effects.

Ephedrine \u2013 Combining with caffeine may cause hypertensive crises, brain bleeds, or psychosis.\n2. ADHD medications \u2013 Both are stimulants; together they can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and anxiety.\n3. Asthma drugs like theophylline \u2013 Caffeine can elevate the drug's levels, altering its effectiveness.\n4. Insomnia treatments such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs \u2013 Caffeine counters their calming and sedative effects.\n5. Blood pressure medications \u2013 Caffeine may reduce the effectiveness of beta and calcium channel blockers and raise blood pressure.\n6. Antibiotics, especially quinolones \u2013 Can intensify caffeine's effects, leading to adverse reactions like jitteriness.\n7. Diuretics \u2013 Both contribute to fluid loss, leading to dehydration risks.\n\nModerating caffeine intake is advisable when on these medications. It's essential to consult healthcare professionals before making any dietary changes that could impact drug efficacy. Additionally, other drinks and foods, such as grapefruit juice, can also interfere with medications and should be discussed with a doctor.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749030600.0,"attribution":"www.the-sun.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b5adb31db880079f9d36bfb84fd11e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing for caffeine and blood pressure interactions","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9789e21bfd4ffd65-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"8130e354-2ebe-4abd-9786-303e2900ebd1","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8130e354-2ebe-4abd-9786-303e2900ebd1","children":["e106f183-9ff1-4e99-8ed7-32c66ff72ccd"]},"e106f183-9ff1-4e99-8ed7-32c66ff72ccd":{"id":"e106f183-9ff1-4e99-8ed7-32c66ff72ccd","message":{"id":"e106f183-9ff1-4e99-8ed7-32c66ff72ccd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756783405.867876,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Refining focus for caffeine and BP","content":"I need to avoid low-quality sources, like tabloids, and rely on trusted authorities like AHA or ACC for evidence.

Potassium-based salt substitutes are advised unless medically contraindicated.\n\nIn a shift from previous guidance, the report now states that avoiding alcohol altogether is optimal for controlling blood pressure, although prior daily limits of one drink for women and two for men still apply. Excess sodium and alcohol can elevate blood pressure by increasing blood volume, narrowing vessels, or triggering stress-related bodily responses.\n\nThe guidelines also endorse using the AHA's PREVENT tool to assess long-term cardiovascular risk, urging earlier medical interventions when necessary.

High blood pressure, defined by new standards as \u2265130/80 mm Hg, is now categorized into six stages from normal to hypertensive emergency. The guidelines highlight that early lifestyle modifications\u2014reduced salt intake, healthy diet (such as the DASH diet), alcohol moderation, and weight loss\u2014can significantly control blood pressure without immediate medication. It also stresses the importance of accurate blood pressure measurement, awareness of hypertension during pregnancy, and the growing prevalence among youth due to poor lifestyle choices.

Current research indicates that moderate coffee consumption (up to three cups per day) is generally safe and can even offer health benefits, including improved gut health, lowered cardiovascular risk, and increased longevity. However, exceeding this amount raises stroke risk, as evidenced by a University of Galway study linking over four cups daily to a 37% increased stroke risk. Excessive caffeine can contribute to raised blood pressure and heart disease, particularly for individuals with hypertension. The preparation of coffee also plays a role; additives like milk and sugar can negate coffee's antioxidant benefits. For most healthy individuals, the European Food Safety Authority recommends limiting caffeine intake to 400mg per day. Pregnant women and individuals sensitive to caffeine should exercise greater caution. Understanding personal tolerance and the impact on sleep and alertness is crucial for safe coffee consumption.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1734012000.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b5adb31db880079f9d36bfb84fd11e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for caffeine and blood pressure guidance","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9789e21bfd4ffd65-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"a798911a-05e5-481a-a208-dd7fcec2f801","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a798911a-05e5-481a-a208-dd7fcec2f801","children":["3374bdec-2e4c-40cb-8756-2b2324110ce8"]},"3374bdec-2e4c-40cb-8756-2b2324110ce8":{"id":"3374bdec-2e4c-40cb-8756-2b2324110ce8","message":{"id":"3374bdec-2e4c-40cb-8756-2b2324110ce8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756783413.451347,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Focusing on trusted sources","content":"I should stick to reliable sources like AHA, ACC, PubMed, NIH, and Harvard, avoiding less credible ones like The Times of India or paywalled content.

The main issue is a **short-lived BP bump** after caffeine.\n\n### What the evidence says\n- **Acute effect:** caffeine raises BP (roughly **+5\u201310 mmHg** systolic and **+3\u20136 mmHg** diastolic) for **\u22653 hours**, even in treated hypertensives. Tolerance is often incomplete. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **Long-term:** habitual coffee intake is **not linked to higher hypertension risk** or worse BP control in cohort studies and reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **How much is \u201cokay\u201d?** Health agencies peg **~400 mg/day** caffeine (\u22483\u20134 cups coffee, product-dependent) as a level not generally associated with harm in healthy adults.

(Inference from CYP data and theophylline studies.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n- **Beta-blockers:** caffeine\u2019s BP rise **still occurs** under beta-blockade; it may also counter symptom control (palpitations) in sensitive patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### How to use caffeine safely with BP meds\n1. **Dose:** start at **\u2264200 mg/day**, increase only if home BPs stay on target; cap near **400 mg/day** if well-controlled. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n2. **Timing:** take your morning BP (and meds) **before** caffeine.

These include ACE inhibitors and ARBs, diuretics, specific antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lithium, certain HIV medications, and calcineurin inhibitors. These drugs can affect the kidneys by reducing blood flow, causing inflammation or allergic reactions, or clogging kidney tubes with debris. Risks are higher when these drugs are used in conjunction with other medications or under specific conditions like dehydration or pre-existing health issues. To mitigate these risks, healthcare providers typically monitor kidney function closely when these medications are prescribed, and patients are advised to share their complete medical history, including all medications and supplements they take.

Avoid ACEi+ARB together. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n### 3) Avoid the \u201ctriple-whammy\u201d\n- **ACEi/ARB + diuretic + NSAID** markedly increases AKI risk.

This helps BP control and kidney outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search13\ue201  \n- If you **have CKD**, most guidance targets **~0.8 g protein/kg/day** (avoid high-protein diets) to reduce progression risk, while maintaining nutrition. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue201\n\n### 8) Blood-pressure discipline\n- Use home BP correctly (pre-caffeine, seated, cuff at heart level). For CKD, KDIGO suggests **SBP <120 mmHg** (standardized office measurement) **when tolerated**. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n### 9) Medication hygiene\n- Keep an up-to-date med list.
