The demand for its advanced 3nm and 5nm technology chips, especially for AI applications driven by Nvidia, played a significant role, though smartphone seasonality partially offset this growth. Despite raising revenue guidance to $22.4-$23.2 billion for the third quarter, TSMC's ADRs fell by 2.7%, influenced by geopolitical concerns following comments from former President Donald Trump regarding the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei acknowledged challenges in meeting CoWoS packaging demand, essential for Nvidia's top AI chips, and indicated potential price increases for advanced services. Analysts remain optimistic about TSMC's growth in the latter half of 2024 and beyond, noting its dominant market position and substantial expansion plans, particularly in the high-end chip market, which includes key clients like Apple and Qualcomm.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1721239200.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68834db211f880079f099d5381244c0d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"964a9ca43de74495-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"169f7da5-7e91-48d0-bc5f-2437b2ad5509","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"169f7da5-7e91-48d0-bc5f-2437b2ad5509","children":["bfb04e6b-c809-42a4-a9b8-b2143a88a942"]},"bfb04e6b-c809-42a4-a9b8-b2143a88a942":{"id":"bfb04e6b-c809-42a4-a9b8-b2143a88a942","message":{"id":"bfb04e6b-c809-42a4-a9b8-b2143a88a942","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753435632.427281,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating GPU production feasibility","content":"Now, we need to assess whether producing 50 million H100 GPUs (or the equivalent computational capacity) is realistic within the next 5 years.

The demand for its advanced 3nm and 5nm technology chips, especially for AI applications driven by Nvidia, played a significant role, though smartphone seasonality partially offset this growth. Despite raising revenue guidance to $22.4-$23.2 billion for the third quarter, TSMC's ADRs fell by 2.7%, influenced by geopolitical concerns following comments from former President Donald Trump regarding the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei acknowledged challenges in meeting CoWoS packaging demand, essential for Nvidia's top AI chips, and indicated potential price increases for advanced services. Analysts remain optimistic about TSMC's growth in the latter half of 2024 and beyond, noting its dominant market position and substantial expansion plans, particularly in the high-end chip market, which includes key clients like Apple and Qualcomm.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1721239200.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68834db211f880079f099d5381244c0d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"964b07883ef3fda6-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"e5158bbe-92bc-4fe8-8892-bb479aea117c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e5158bbe-92bc-4fe8-8892-bb479aea117c","children":["fd927480-910b-42fd-b1b5-7c75236a7323"]},"fd927480-910b-42fd-b1b5-7c75236a7323":{"id":"fd927480-910b-42fd-b1b5-7c75236a7323","message":{"id":"fd927480-910b-42fd-b1b5-7c75236a7323","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753439954.780705,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for CoWoS capacity data","content":"I found a 2015 TSMC report, but it doesn\u2019t mention CoWoS capacity.

| **+29\u202fk\u202fWPM** | **structural break**: generative\u2011AI boom forces emergency builds of new CoWoS lines | **+26.5** |\n| 2024\u202f\u2192\u202f2025 | **+35\u202fk\u202fWPM** | acceleration persists but *rate of acceleration* eases | **\u201120.5** |\n\n*Source basis*  \n* **2021:** ~6.7\u202fk\u202fWPM, back\u2011derived from TSMC\u2019s own statement that its 2025 target of 80\u202fk\u202fWPM is a *12\u2011fold* rise over 2021 levels \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue201.  \n* **2022:** 8\u20139\u202fk\u202fWPM reported by *DigiTimes* and Tom\u2019s Hardware \ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue202turn8search2\ue201.  \n* **2023:** 11\u202fk\u202fWPM capacity, repeatedly cited in industry\u2010tracker notes (TrendForce, HardOCP) \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue201.  \n* **2024:** 35\u201340\u202fk\u202fWPM range in multiple analyst and supplier briefings (TrendForce, EDN, SemiWiki) \ue200cite\ue202turn8search1\ue202turn6search4\ue201.  \n* **2025 (forecast):** 70\u201380\u202fk\u202fWPM according to Morgan Stanley, SemiMedia and TSMC guidance \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn4search8\ue201.\n\n### Long\u2011term growth rates\n* **2015\u202f\u2192\u202f2021:** public disclosures are sparse, but capacity crept from well under 1\u202fk\u202fWPM to ~6\u20137\u202fk\u202fWPM \u2014 a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) around **60\u202f%**.  \n* **2021\u202f\u2192\u202f2025 (proj.):** CAGR jumps to **\u2248110\u202f%**.  \n* **Net 2015\u202f\u2192\u202f2025:** a two\u2011order\u2011of\u2011magnitude leap, driven by the shift from niche FPGA/HPC volumes to mass\u2011market AI accelerators.\n\n### Why the sudden \u201chockey\u2011stick\u201d after 2023?\n1. **Generative\u2011AI shock:** ChatGPT\u2011era demand forced Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and hyperscalers to pre\u2011pay for entire CoWoS lines.  \n2. **HBM ramp synchronisation:** All advanced GPUs now carry 6\u201312 HBM stacks per package, so memory suppliers (SK\u202fHynix, Samsung, Micron) scaled TSV lines in lock\u2011step, making larger CoWoS investments less risky.  \n3. **Cap\u2011ex flywheel:** At ~$2\u202fB per 8\u202fk\u2011WPM module, each new TSMC AP\u2011fab tranche gets paid off in <18\u202fmonths at current pricing, enabling another round of builds.\n\n### Outlook for *velocity* and *acceleration* to 2030\n| Year | CoWoS/SoIC capacity (k\u202fWPM) | \u0394\u202f(k WPM/yr) | Comment |\n|------|------------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| 2025 | 75 | +35 | Blackwell + MI400 peak demand |\n| 2026 | 100\u2013110 | +30 | Rubin & AMD *MI500* era; ASE, Amkor, Intel IMS add panel\u2011level lines |\n| 2027 | 125\u2013135 | +25 | First large\u2011scale panel\u2011level CoWoS\u2011P cuts per\u2011unit clean\u2011room footprint |\n| 2028 | 140\u2013150 | +15 | Capacity expansion slows as supply meets demand; more wafer\u2011starts move to PLP |\n| 2029 | 150\u2013160 | +10 | Diminishing marginal returns, but enough headroom for 0.7\u20131\u202fM ultra\u2011high\u2011end GPUs per year |\n\nThe **first derivative (velocity)** is expected to remain positive through 2027 but begins tapering as utilisation and margins normalise. The **second derivative (acceleration)** has already peaked in 2024; from 2026 onward it likely turns negative but stays above zero \u2014 i.e., capacity still grows, just not *ever faster*.\n\n### Caveats\n* Pre\u20112021 figures rely on analyst back\u2011calculations rather than hard TSMC disclosures; error bars are wide.  \n* These numbers refer **only to TSMC\u2019s CoWoS/SoIC lines**, which today deliver >85\u202f% of world supply. Emerging alternatives (Intel EMIB/O\u2011AMAP, Samsung I\u2011Cube, UMC WM\u2011CM) could add another 15\u201320\u202fk\u202fWPM by 2027, flattening velocity.  \n* Bottlenecks can shift: in 2024\u201125 HBM substrate and ABF laminate availability, not CoWoS per\u2011se, are the gating factors.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n*From 2015\u20112021 capacity grew steadily (~0.5\u20111\u202fk\u202fWPM per year). In 2022\u201123 it doubled its growth rate, and in 2024\u201125 it is surging by **~30\u201135\u202fk\u202fWPM per year** \u2014 a two\u2011order\u2011magnitude acceleration relative to the mid\u20112010s.

2.5D/3D packaging shortens reticle\u2011size limits, keeps yield high, and lets designers tile GPUs, HBM and CPUs like LEGO bricks instead of monoliths.\n\n2. **Memory bandwidth keeps pace**  \n   Each HBM generation roughly doubles per\u2011stack GB/s and capacity, eliminating the \u201cmemory wall\u201d that capped earlier GPU scaling.\n\n3. **Architectural specialisation**  \n   Tensor, matrix\u2011multiply and sparsity engines deliver 10\u2011100\u00d7 perf/W vs 2015\u2011era FP32 shaders, so the *effective* compute per mm\u00b2 skyrockets.\n\n4. **Networking removes cluster bottlenecks**  \n   NVSwitch and 800\u202fG optical fabrics mean thousands of accelerators can be treated as one giant, low\u2011latency memory\u2011coherent device\u2014critical for trillion\u2011parameter LLMs.\n\n5. **Data\u2011centre infrastructure caught up**  \n   Liquid\u2011to\u2011chip cooling and multi\u2011GW campuses remove thermal & power ceilings that would otherwise stall adoption. Liquid\u2011cool penetration in AI racks is projected to hit 57\u202f% by 2026\u00a0\ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201.\n\n6. **Financial flywheel**  \n   Hyperscalers now *pre\u2011pay* multi\u2011year packaging and HBM expansions (similar to how Apple under\u2011wrote early 5\u202fnm). Guaranteed utilisation lets TSMC, ASE and SK\u202fhynix expand at triple\u2011digit CAGR.\n\n---\n\n### Velocity & Acceleration Snapshot\n\n* **CoWoS capacity:**  \n  ~2\u202fk\u202fwpm (2015) \u2192 11\u202fk (2023) \u2192 **40\u202fk (2024)** \u2192 **75\u202fk (2025)**; 2023\u201124 velocity +29\u202fk\u202fwpm/yr, the steepest single\u2011year jump on record\u00a0\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201.\n\n* **HBM output:**  \n  <50\u202fM\u202fGB/yr (2016) \u2192 projected >1.2\u202fB\u202fGB/yr in 2025 as TSV yields climb and 12\u2011/16\u2011high stacks appear\u00a0\ue200cite\ue202turn3news10\ue201.\n\n* **GPU\u2011class AI accelerators:**  \n  Shipments grow from \u22480.4\u202fM units (2016) to \u223c2\u202fM (2025e).
