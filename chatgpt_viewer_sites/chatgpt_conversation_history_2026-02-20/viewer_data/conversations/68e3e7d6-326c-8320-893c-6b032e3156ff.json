Below \\(m_P\\), you can meaningfully talk about particle-like quanta; above \\(m_P\\), you gravitate like a (micro) black hole. Driving \\(\\lambda\\) down to \\(\\ell_P\\) for **any** \\(m\\) simply forces \\(\\gamma\\) large enough that the *energy* reaches \\(\\sim E_P\\) and you are back in the previous paragraph.\n\nIndeed, for a given \\(m\\) and target \\(\\lambda\\ll \\lambda_C\\), the required Lorentz factor is\n\\[\n\\gamma \\simeq \\frac{h}{mc\\,\\lambda}=\\frac{\\lambda_C}{\\lambda}.\n\\]\nSetting \\(\\lambda=\\ell_P\\) yields \\(\\gamma=\\lambda_C/\\ell_P\\), so \\(E=\\gamma mc^2=hc/\\ell_P\\) again, independent of \\(m\\).\n\n# Heisenberg + gravity \u21d2 minimal length (quantum-gravity heuristic)\n\nA purely quantum bound is \\(\\Delta x \\gtrsim \\hbar/(2\\Delta p)\\).

Whether or not you accept the GUP ansatz, the above energy-radius estimates already show that ordinary QFT + classical GR become mutually inconsistent once \\(\\lambda\\) approaches \\(\\ell_P\\).\n\n# Scattering/measurement thought experiment\n\nTo \u201cmeasure\u201d a structure of size \\(\\sim \\lambda\\), you typically use quanta with \\(E\\sim hc/\\lambda\\). At \\(\\lambda=\\ell_P\\), the probe carries \\(E\\sim 2\\pi E_P\\) and therefore has \\(r_s\\sim 4\\pi \\ell_P\\). Any attempt to resolve sub-Planckian detail collapses the interaction region into a trapped surface. Operationally, this means **no experiment can return spatial information below \\(\\sim \\ell_P\\)** within semiclassical reasoning; the measurement nullifies itself by forming a horizon.\n\n# What, mathematically, \u201chappens\u201d as \\(\\lambda\\to\\ell_P^+\\)\n\n1. \\(p\\to h/\\ell_P=2\\pi\\,m_P c\\), \\(E\\to 2\\pi E_P\\).\n2. The associated \\(r_s(E)=4\\pi \\ell_P^2/\\lambda\\) grows to \\(\\sim 4\\pi \\ell_P\\) and then exceeds the wavepacket size if you push further.\n3. The Compton\u2013Schwarzschild crossover (\\(m\\sim m_P/\\sqrt{2}\\)) signals loss of a clean \u201cparticle\u201d description.\n4. Heisenberg localization at \\(\\Delta x\\sim \\ell_P\\) requires \\(\\Delta p\\sim \\hbar/\\ell_P\\), which sources \\(r_s\\sim \\ell_P\\): self-consistent localization below \\(\\ell_P\\) fails.\n5. Therefore the joint equations of (special-relativistic) quantum mechanics + (classical) gravity predict their own breakdown at \\(\\lambda\\sim \\ell_P\\), typically interpreted as **black-hole formation / horizon cloaking** preventing sub-Planckian resolution.\n\n# Caveats and forward-looking notes\n\n- The precise numerical factors (\\(2\\pi,\\,4\\pi\\)) come from using \\(h\\) vs \\(\\hbar\\) in \\(\\lambda=h/p\\). They don\u2019t affect the order-one conclusion: Planckian.\n- Full quantum gravity could modify the threshold (e.g., string length \\( \\ell_s \\gtrsim \\ell_P\\), discrete area spectra in LQG, etc.). But **any** theory reproducing GR+QM in the IR must prevent arbitrarily small \\(\\lambda\\) without new degrees of freedom\u2014typically via a minimal length or new non-local structure.\n- If you assume trans-Planckian kinematics without collapse, you must also specify how gravity is tamed; absent that, the hoop estimate above is the conservative, covariant obstruction.\n\n**Bottom line:** driving a particle\u2019s de Broglie wavelength down to the Planck length necessarily drives its energy to \\(\\sim E_P\\), at which point its gravitational (Schwarzschild) radius becomes \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\ell_P)\\) or larger than the wavepacket. The semiclassical prediction is horizon formation, i.e., the measurement converts into a (micro) black hole rather than yielding sub-Planckian structure.
