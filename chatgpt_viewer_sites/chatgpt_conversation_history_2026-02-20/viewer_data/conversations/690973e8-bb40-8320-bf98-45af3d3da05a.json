scientific computing. Their processors, known as thermodynamic sampling units (TSUs), handle probabilistic bits (p-bits) that model uncertainty, rather than traditional binary bits. This novel approach, inspired by thermodynamic principles and quantum computing, promises significantly higher energy efficiency\u2014potentially thousands of times more efficient than traditional CPUs and GPUs.\n\nExtropic's first working chip, the XTR-0, integrates an FPGA and two X-0 probabilistic chips and has been shared with select partners, including AI labs and weather modeling startups. One user, Johan Mathe of Atmo, confirmed the chip's unique performance in simulating complex weather systems.\n\nComplementing the hardware is TRHML, a software tool allowing developers to simulate TSU behavior on GPUs. The company plans to release a more powerful chip, the Z-1, with 250,000 p-bits, next year. If successful, this innovation could address the enormous energy demands of AI data centers and reshape the future of computing, according to supporters like Vincent Weisser of Prime Intellect.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1761757870.13,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/thermodynamic-computing-ai-guillaume-verdon-based-beff-jezos/","title":"Hot New Thermodynamic Chips Could Trump Classical ...","snippet":"24 Mar 2025 \u2014 Guillaume Verdon is building a new kind of chip to accelerate AI.

Published in *Nature Electronics*, the study highlights that this chip can be up to 1,000 times faster and 100 times more energy-efficient than traditional digital processors. It achieves these results by utilizing resistive random-access memory (RRAM) cells and analog computing principles\u2014processing information through continuous electrical currents rather than binary code.\n\nHistorically, analog computing has been seen as imprecise and difficult to control, limiting its practicality. However, this new design tackles such concerns by combining fast, approximate analog calculations with refining digital-like processing to ensure accuracy. The system is particularly well suited for energy-intensive and high-throughput applications such as artificial intelligence and future 6G communication systems.\n\nThe chip's ability to compute directly within its memory hardware bypasses the traditional energy drain of data transfer between CPU and memory. Built using commercial manufacturing processes, the chip could be mass-produced.

scientific computing. Their processors, known as thermodynamic sampling units (TSUs), handle probabilistic bits (p-bits) that model uncertainty, rather than traditional binary bits. This novel approach, inspired by thermodynamic principles and quantum computing, promises significantly higher energy efficiency\u2014potentially thousands of times more efficient than traditional CPUs and GPUs.\n\nExtropic's first working chip, the XTR-0, integrates an FPGA and two X-0 probabilistic chips and has been shared with select partners, including AI labs and weather modeling startups. One user, Johan Mathe of Atmo, confirmed the chip's unique performance in simulating complex weather systems.\n\nComplementing the hardware is TRHML, a software tool allowing developers to simulate TSU behavior on GPUs. The company plans to release a more powerful chip, the Z-1, with 250,000 p-bits, next year. If successful, this innovation could address the enormous energy demands of AI data centers and reshape the future of computing, according to supporters like Vincent Weisser of Prime Intellect.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1761757870.13,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/extropic-aims-to-disrupt-the-data-center-bonanza/","title":"Extropic Aims to Disrupt the Data Center Bonanza","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 A startup hopes to challenge Nvidia, AMD, and Intel with a chip that wrangles probabilities rather than 1s and 0s.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/thermodynamic-computing-ai-guillaume-verdon-based-beff-jezos","title":"Hot New Thermodynamic Chips Could Trump Classical Computers","snippet":"Guillaume Verdon, co-founder of the startup Extropic, has developed a new computer chip based on thermodynamic computing, which he believes could surpass current silicon and quantum chips.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1755105865.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_690973f818a4832fa447b58d13680584","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for skepticism around Extropic thermodynamic computing","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"249dfe5b-071f-4fbc-8124-2f7df4ca1dfc","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"cd3ff2a9-7513-417f-a3eb-bdeced1a771c","turn_exchange_id":"2ee8b0ed-53a1-495b-91e6-9db42702b742","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cd3ff2a9-7513-417f-a3eb-bdeced1a771c","children":["b9a5eff8-1f4d-4d69-8421-d3ecfc76ff19"]},"b9a5eff8-1f4d-4d69-8421-d3ecfc76ff19":{"id":"b9a5eff8-1f4d-4d69-8421-d3ecfc76ff19","message":{"id":"b9a5eff8-1f4d-4d69-8421-d3ecfc76ff19","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762227239.657301,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Defining key concepts","content":"I should also provide a general explanation of p-bits and Ising machines to give context.

This next-generation Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) achieves impressive ~1ns switching speeds, matching the performance of SRAM, while maintaining non-volatility and power efficiency. Key to this advancement is the stabilization of the rare \u03b2-phase of tungsten, which generates spin currents effectively and is viable for mass production. The team also introduced thin cobalt layers to enhance thermal stability, with the MRAM enduring temperatures up to 700\u202f\u00b0C.\n\nThe collaboration included TSMC, ITRI, NSRRC, Stanford University, and National Chung Hsing University. Their prototype 64kb SOT-MRAM array showed performance superior to DRAM and NAND, with long-term data retention (over 10 years) and robust thermal resistance. Designed to be compatible with standard semiconductor manufacturing processes, this MRAM technology is being targeted toward AI data centers and low-power edge computing applications, promising to transform future memory architecture.","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1760363744.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_690973f818a4832fa447b58d13680584","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for open access MRAM p-bit research papers","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"249dfe5b-071f-4fbc-8124-2f7df4ca1dfc","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"001e9359-cf61-4430-9309-73b1cd6811f4","turn_exchange_id":"2ee8b0ed-53a1-495b-91e6-9db42702b742","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"001e9359-cf61-4430-9309-73b1cd6811f4","children":["fe13592a-93ca-4410-ae60-93aecdc40e5d"]},"fe13592a-93ca-4410-ae60-93aecdc40e5d":{"id":"fe13592a-93ca-4410-ae60-93aecdc40e5d","message":{"id":"fe13592a-93ca-4410-ae60-93aecdc40e5d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762227277.00806,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating \"promising\" aspects","content":"I see that this MRAM info, while tangential, is helpful in showing the broader field.

Concretely, most TC efforts build chips out of **probabilistic elements** (\u201c_p-bits_\u201d) whose state randomly flips, but whose **bias** you can program. Networks of p-bits naturally implement **sampling** from energy-based models (EBMs) via Gibbs/Markov-chain updates, so they\u2019re a good physical substrate for Monte-Carlo inference, diffusion-style generative models, combinatorial search, etc. This isn\u2019t quantum computing; it\u2019s room-temperature, classical hardware that leans on statistical physics. The concept has been brewing in academia (CCC/DARPA visioning; Datta\u2019s p-bit program) for years. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search1\ue202turn16search3\ue202turn12search1\ue201\n\nWhy is this exciting now? AI\u2019s growth is crashing into **energy and interconnect limits**; sampling-heavy workloads (diffusion, Bayesian inference) are everywhere; and TC promises large **energy-per-sample** gains by (i) generating randomness \u201cfor free\u201d from thermal fluctuations and (ii) keeping computation **local** (short wires), minimizing the GPU-era communication tax. IEEE Spectrum\u2019s overview captures the gist and distinguishes TC from older \u201cprobabilistic computing\u201d work. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n# What Extropic is actually building\n\n**Extropic** (founded by ex-Google quantum researchers Guillaume Verdon & Trevor McCourt) is the highest-profile TC startup. In the last week (late Oct 2025) they **announced**:\n\n- A working dev board **XTR-0** (FPGA + two tiny \u201cX-0\u201d chips) that exposes a handful of hardware sampling primitives (p-bit, categorical \u201cp-dit\u201d, Gaussian \u201cp-mode\u201d, Gaussian-mixture \u201cp-MoG\u201d). It\u2019s being seeded to labs/startups for early experiments. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn14view0\ue201  \n- An open-source JAX library **THRML** for simulating their hardware on GPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- An arXiv paper proposing a **denoising thermodynamic model (DTM)**\u2014a diffusion-like generative method mapped to their all-transistor stochastic architecture\u2014claiming **\u224810,000\u00d7 lower energy** than a small GPU baseline on toy benchmarks (via system-level analysis/sim). \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\nWired\u2019s in-depth report (Oct 29, 2025) confirms XTR-0 exists, that early partners are trying it (e.g., weather startup Atmo), and that a larger **Z-1** part (~**250k p-bits**) is targeted \u201cnext year.\u201d These are **ambitions**, not independently verified numbers yet. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nExtropic\u2019s own explainers also say each p-bit flip uses \u201c~**10,000\u00d7 less energy** than a floating-point add,\u201d and they emphasize a fully CMOS, **all-transistor** route (not exotic MRAM/photonic devices), which\u2014if true\u2014helps with manufacturability. Treat those as **vendor claims** until third-party measurements arrive. \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Is the promise real?\n\n**Potential advantages (if they scale):**\n\n1. **Energy per sample.** Sampling is native; GPUs emulate it with matrix math. Extropic\u2019s DTM proposal plus the physical p-bit primitives could cut joules/sample a lot **on the right workloads**. Evidence today is mostly **simulations + tiny demos**, but independent academic work on p-bits/Ising-style hardware points the same direction. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn12search1\ue201  \n2. **Local communication.** TSUs wire nearby nodes and update blocks in parallel via **Gibbs**; less long-distance charging of big capacitances is a direct win in modern nodes. This is exactly the energy wall the CCC report warned about. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue202turn16search1\ue201  \n3. **Fit to probabilistic AI.** Diffusion models, MCMC, graphical models, Bayesian filters, and physics simulation already revolve around **probability flows**. A sampler-native accelerator is a clean match. IEEE Spectrum shows matrix inversion/Gaussian sampling prototypes, and Normal Computing\u2019s separate effort has even **taped-out** a first thermodynamic ASIC (CN101) for data-center workloads. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn10news30\ue201\n\n**Where the hype can outrun reality:**\n\n1. **Scaling & quality parity.** The hard part isn\u2019t flipping a few p-bits; it\u2019s wiring **hundreds of thousands to millions** with controllable couplings, low correlations, short relaxation times, and stable calibration. Academic literature on p-bits and probabilistic hardware is promising, but scaling introduces non-idealities and correlations that **wreck sampling quality** if you\u2019re not careful. \ue200cite\ue202turn18search14\ue202turn3search8\ue201  \n2. **Mixing in multimodal landscapes.** EBMs + Gibbs are notorious for **slow mixing** in strongly multimodal energy surfaces; much of the modern EBM/diffusion literature is about avoiding or mitigating this (tempering, auxiliary diffusions, learned transports, GFlowNets, etc.). Extropic\u2019s DTM idea is a defensible answer, but it must match today\u2019s SOTA quality/latency at scale\u2014still unproven. \ue200cite\ue202turn20search3\ue202turn20search1\ue202turn20search4\ue201  \n3. **Analog/digital headaches.** Analog-ish or noise-driven hardware has a track record of **device drift, variability, read noise, and calibration overhead**. That\u2019s why earlier analog-in-memory accelerators often lost accuracy on large nets without heavy compensation. TC chips could avoid many crossbar pitfalls (they\u2019re not doing analog GEMMs), but they don\u2019t get a free pass on process/temperature/aging variation. \ue200cite\ue202turn19search0\ue202turn19search2\ue201  \n4. **Software & verification.** New chips need a **toolchain, profilers, debuggers, kernels, benchmarks** and a clean story for hybrid GPU+TC execution. Extropic\u2019s THRML is a good first step, but the ecosystem is nascent. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n5. **Vendor exuberance.** Extropic\u2019s explainers are readable, but at least one page contains a glaring factual slip (it attributes the **2024 Nobel Prize** to Hinton & Hopfield, which is incorrect). That\u2019s cosmetic, but it signals you should **insist on independent measurements** before buying the bolder claims. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue201\n\n**Bottom line so far:** there\u2019s serious **signal** here (chips exist; open library; an algorithmic mapping that makes sense; parallel efforts like Normal Computing\u2019s tape-out), but the **order-of-magnitude energy wins** are still **model- and scale-dependent claims**, not industry-standard, third-party benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n# How Extropic\u2019s approach differs from prior hardware\n\n- **All-transistor stochastic cores** (Extropic) vs **spintronics MRAM p-bits** (large body of work) vs **RLC/oscillator networks** (Normal\u2019s early boards) vs **analog IMC crossbars** (Mythic/others). Extropic\u2019s CMOS route avoids exotic devices but still has to demonstrate **large arrays** with controllable couplings and low sample correlation. \ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue202turn18search1\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn19search2\ue201  \n- **Sampling-native** (Extropic/Normal) vs **matrix-multiply-native** (GPUs/AIMC). Sampling-native wins in MCMC/diffusion regimes; matrix-native wins in straight linear algebra. Expect **hybrids** in real systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n# What would count as real validation (next 6\u201318 months)\n\n1. **Independent joules/sample** vs H100/MI300 on standard tasks (denoising steps for CIFAR-10/Imagenette; weather nowcasting kernels; Bayesian posterior sampling), including **output quality** metrics. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n2. **Scale demos**: Z-1-class hardware (\u227310^5 p-bits) running full DTM pipelines, not just primitives; wall-clock latency and throughput. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n3. **Thermal/variability studies**: decorrelation time, long-run stability, calibration cost. \ue200cite\ue202turn19search0\ue201  \n4. **Tooling**: THRML-to-hardware compilers, profiling, kernels for hybrid GPU+TSU workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n5. **Third-party publications**: labs outside the vendor publishing peer-reviewed results on TC chips (there\u2019s already peer-reviewed momentum in p-bit hardware and a Nature Communications-level SPU demo). \ue200cite\ue202turn18search1\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n# A quick, concrete read of the **claims** vs **evidence**\n\n- **\u201c10,000\u00d7 energy efficiency\u201d on generative workloads** \u2014 *Claimed* in Extropic\u2019s arXiv/system analysis and blog; **not** yet independently measured at useful model scales. Treat as a hypothesis to test. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- **Real hardware exists** \u2014 XTR-0 boards with X-0 chips; early external users confirm they can poke p-bits; no large-scale benchmarks released. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- **Competitor traction** \u2014 Normal Computing taped out a dedicated TC ASIC (CN101) aimed at datacenters; energy gains are also **claims** pending independent runs. \ue200cite\ue202turn10news30\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Should you be bullish?\n\n**Cautious optimism** is warranted. The physics and the mapping to probabilistic AI are coherent, and multiple teams are converging on similar ideas.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Tom's Hardware"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn8view0\ue201","start_idx":9183,"end_idx":9211,"safe_urls":["https://ar5iv.org/abs/2510.23972","https://github.com/extropic-ai/thrml"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2510.23972))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[2510.23972] An efficient probabilistic hardware architecture for diffusion-like models","url":"https://ar5iv.org/abs/2510.23972","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"GitHub - extropic-ai/thrml: Thermodynamic Hypergraphical Model Library in JAX","url":"https://github.com/extropic-ai/thrml","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"GitHub"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"ar5iv"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn14view0\ue201","start_idx":9346,"end_idx":9364,"safe_urls":["https://extropic.ai/writing/inside-x0-and-xtr-0"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Extropic](https://extropic.ai/writing/inside-x0-and-xtr-0))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Inside X0 and XTR-0 | Extropic","url":"https://extropic.ai/writing/inside-x0-and-xtr-0","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Extropic"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn16search1\ue201","start_idx":9450,"end_idx":9470,"safe_urls":["https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/CCC-Thermodynamic-Computing-Reportv3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([CRA](https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/CCC-Thermodynamic-Computing-Reportv3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Thermodynamic Computing","url":"https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/CCC-Thermodynamic-Computing-Reportv3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"29 Oct 2019 \u2014 Thermodynamic Computing.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":56},"pub_date":1755105865.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69098e6f0af8832cb3b8e7d27c4d3d1b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Elaborating on reasons thermodynamic computing is exciting now","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"112b46f4-e5f2-4955-bf85-7d89a13a47cd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"63ccc0d8-69f2-4183-8c57-6eee1013f060","turn_exchange_id":"8262dc9f-554e-4503-9c20-d4edf389c9a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"63ccc0d8-69f2-4183-8c57-6eee1013f060","children":["28d3ca7c-2cc4-4aa7-a8c8-4492733120e9"]},"28d3ca7c-2cc4-4aa7-a8c8-4492733120e9":{"id":"28d3ca7c-2cc4-4aa7-a8c8-4492733120e9","message":{"id":"28d3ca7c-2cc4-4aa7-a8c8-4492733120e9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762233970.251833,"update_time":1762233970.26189,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"open\": [{\"ref_id\": \"turn0search4\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Opening Horowitz PDF file","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"112b46f4-e5f2-4955-bf85-7d89a13a47cd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7cd3397f-3197-4112-9819-a2218fae2d48","turn_exchange_id":"8262dc9f-554e-4503-9c20-d4edf389c9a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"7cd3397f-3197-4112-9819-a2218fae2d48","children":["bee3d327-deba-48c0-ac3f-e0aac0d84425"]},"bee3d327-deba-48c0-ac3f-e0aac0d84425":{"id":"bee3d327-deba-48c0-ac3f-e0aac0d84425","message":{"id":"bee3d327-deba-48c0-ac3f-e0aac0d84425","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1762233970.3302684,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"gwern.net","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://gwern.net/doc/cs/hardware/2014-horowitz-2.pdf","title":"Computing's Energy Problem (and what we can do about it)","snippet":"Total lines: 500\n","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"gwern.net"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69098e6f0af8832cb3b8e7d27c4d3d1b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Opening Horowitz PDF file","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"112b46f4-e5f2-4955-bf85-7d89a13a47cd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"28d3ca7c-2cc4-4aa7-a8c8-4492733120e9","turn_exchange_id":"8262dc9f-554e-4503-9c20-d4edf389c9a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"28d3ca7c-2cc4-4aa7-a8c8-4492733120e9","children":["ff83d60e-6bc0-400a-bcce-b21495b6dccd"]},"ff83d60e-6bc0-400a-bcce-b21495b6dccd":{"id":"ff83d60e-6bc0-400a-bcce-b21495b6dccd","message":{"id":"ff83d60e-6bc0-400a-bcce-b21495b6dccd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762233975.248686,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Referencing energy in GPU architecture","content":"I\u2019ve confirmed the energy figures, such as \u201cDRAM access 1-2 nJ\u201d and \u201c20 pJ per bit for I/O,\u201d from Horowitz\u2019 work.

Unlike traditional NAND storage, this module integrates directly with the memory bus using daisy-chained controllers and PAM4 signaling, enabling fast, linear scalability and reduced latency for large streaming datasets. Each module includes a local controller, helping to minimize data bottlenecks and power consumption, with a power draw under 40W\u2014significantly more efficient than current Gen5 SSDs.\n\nAlthough the latency is higher than DRAM-based HBM, the bandwidth and energy efficiency make HBF ideal for AI workloads requiring high-volume data throughput rather than ultra-low latency. Kioxia's approach combines the capacity of NAND with improved speed, allowing storage to function closer to memory rather than traditional backend I/O. This may shift infrastructure paradigms in future AI datacenters. While the module is still in the prototype stage and real-world performance under AI workloads remains to be seen, it represents a pivotal movement towards high-speed, near-memory flash as a key player in compute stack architectures.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1755968420.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69098e6f0af8832cb3b8e7d27c4d3d1b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for sources on energy costs in computing","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"112b46f4-e5f2-4955-bf85-7d89a13a47cd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d96e6fa9-42e2-4457-8b0d-6cbdf9812388","turn_exchange_id":"8262dc9f-554e-4503-9c20-d4edf389c9a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d96e6fa9-42e2-4457-8b0d-6cbdf9812388","children":["63fbb027-845c-489b-af51-286dc5d536e2"]},"63fbb027-845c-489b-af51-286dc5d536e2":{"id":"63fbb027-845c-489b-af51-286dc5d536e2","message":{"id":"63fbb027-845c-489b-af51-286dc5d536e2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762233983.8921,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring thermal randomness and energy cost","content":"I need to find sources explaining that thermal randomness is \u201cfree\u201d or ephemeral, and connect it to the Landauer principle.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1755105865.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.timesofai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.timesofai.com/news/extropic-ai-chip-energy-efficiency/","title":"Extropic's Thermodynamic Chips May Solve AI's Energy ...","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 Extropic AI is developing thermodynamic chips designed to outperform GPUs by making AI processing radically more energy efficient.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.timesofai.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/IEEE.Spectrum/posts/imagine-computing-with-noise-instead-of-fighting-itthermodynamic-computing-might/1083544123817602/","title":"Imagine computing with noise instead of fighting it\u2014 ...","snippet":"19 May 2025 \u2014 Imagine computing with noise instead of fighting it\u2014thermodynamic computing might change how we approach AI and scientific challenges.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.facebook.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.verity.news","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verity.news/story/2025/startup-claims-x-energy-savings-over-gpus-with-new-chip","title":"Extropic Unveils Thermodynamic 10000x Energy Saving AI ...","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 The XTR-0 development platform consists of a central processing unit, an FPGA chip and two sockets for thermodynamic sampling units.

Total power demand is forecasted to increase from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025 and 4,283 billion kWh in 2026. Residential, commercial, and industrial electricity usage is also expected to rise, nearing or exceeding historical record levels. In terms of energy sources, natural gas is projected to decline slightly from 42% of power generation in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026, while coal's share slowly decreases and renewables rise from 23% in 2024 to 27% in 2026. Nuclear power will slightly decline from 19% to 18% over the same period.

By then, the energy used for AI processing in the U.S. could surpass that of traditional energy-intensive industries like steel and cement manufacturing. Despite concerns, the IEA suggests AI could enhance energy efficiencies, potentially offsetting its carbon footprint by optimizing electricity grids, transportation systems, and industrial operations. However, only about half of AI's energy demand might be sourced from renewable resources. Critics, including former EU energy minister Claude Turmes, argue the IEA underplays the risks, asserting that unchecked AI proliferation may reverse energy efficiency gains and reinvigorate polluting energy sources like coal. Additionally, datacentres' high water consumption raises environmental concerns. Turmes calls for stronger regulatory frameworks to manage AI's environmental impact, criticizing the IEA for leniency potentially benefiting major tech firms and U.S. political interests.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1744257618.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ai-forecast-to-fuel-doubling-in-data-centre-electricity-demand-by-2030-htd2zf7nx","title":"AI forecast to fuel doubling in data centre electricity demand by 2030","snippet":"The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global electricity consumption by data centres will more than double by 2030, with artificial intelligence (AI) expected to be the primary driver. Data centres could consume 945 terawatt-hours annually by then, almost triple the UK\u2019s 2023 usage. AI-optimized centres are projected to quadruple in electricity demand, though total data centre consumption will still represent only 3% of global electricity use. Despite concerns, the IEA believes AI's contribution to climate change may be overstated, noting emissions from data centres may rise to 300 million tonnes by 2035\u2014under 1.5% of global energy emissions\u2014while AI-driven efficiencies could reduce energy-related emissions by around 5%. Major tech companies are pursuing nuclear power deals to mitigate supply issues. However, increased pressure on electricity grids and regional disparities in power availability pose challenges. In the UK, companies advocate for zonal pricing to incentivize data centre development in high wind-energy regions like northern Scotland. The IEA emphasizes thoughtful planning and grid expansion to accommodate this rapid growth in AI and data infrastructure.","ref_id":{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1744302940.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69098e6f0af8832cb3b8e7d27c4d3d1b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for AI energy consumption and thermodynamic computing","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"112b46f4-e5f2-4955-bf85-7d89a13a47cd","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"145b8a16-19c1-467c-aaa8-f49193deeee8","turn_exchange_id":"8262dc9f-554e-4503-9c20-d4edf389c9a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"145b8a16-19c1-467c-aaa8-f49193deeee8","children":["9ab2175d-080d-427b-aa17-ecdb21afd7f6"]},"9ab2175d-080d-427b-aa17-ecdb21afd7f6":{"id":"9ab2175d-080d-427b-aa17-ecdb21afd7f6","message":{"id":"9ab2175d-080d-427b-aa17-ecdb21afd7f6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762234040.509019,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting the elaboration","content":"To support the claim \u201cAI growth is crashing into energy limits,\u201d I\u2019ll cite the IEA.

In short: it\u2019s the wires and memory hierarchy, not the multiply-adds, that dominate energy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n- **As models span more devices, the \u201ccommunication tax\u201d blows up.** Even with efficient links (NVLink/InfiniBand), all-reduce/all-to-all traffic quickly dominates large-scale training/inference. Wafer-scale studies quantify why short interconnects matter: you can get on-wafer I/O energy **~0.1 pJ/bit** versus **~1.3 pJ/bit** for NVLink\u2014an order-of-magnitude gap driven by physical distance and link circuitry. That gap is precisely the \u201cinterconnect wall.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201\n\n- **At the grid level, AI demand is surging.** The IEA\u2019s 2025 *Energy & AI* report projects data-centre electricity use to roughly **double to ~945 TWh by 2030**, with **accelerated (AI) servers** growing electricity use **~30%/yr** in the base case. That\u2019s why every joule per sample matters. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201\n\n> Takeaway: once you scale beyond a single chip, **energy is dominated by memory and interconnect traffic**, not floating-point ops. That\u2019s the wall.\n\n# 2) Why modern AI workloads make this worse\n\n- **Diffusion models are sampling-heavy.** Vanilla DDPMs needed **hundreds to ~1,000 steps**; improved training cut this to **~50 steps**, and advanced ODE solvers (DPM-Solver/++) reach **~15\u201320 steps**\u2014still *dozens* of sequential sampler evaluations. Every step pulls data and generates random numbers; inter-GPU variants add all-reduce/all-to-all traffic. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn14search3\ue202turn14search4\ue201\n\n- **Graphical models/MCMC have inherently local but iterative updates.** Gibbs/Metropolis updates resample variables from conditional distributions over and over; the work is many cheap, stochastic updates + lots of RNG + neighbor messaging\u2014not giant dense matrix multiplies. That pattern is communication-sensitive on GPUs but **maps naturally to local hardware** (short wires) if you can keep the computation near the state. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search10\ue201\n\n# 3) Why thermodynamic computing (TC) could lower **joules per sample**\n\nThink of TC chips as **sampler-native accelerators** built from stochastic elements (often called **p-bits**). Two levers matter:\n\n**A. Randomness from physics, not algorithms.**  \nTC uses inherent device noise (thermal/shot, metastability, stochastic MTJs, etc.) as an entropy source. That\u2019s the same physics used in **true RNGs**\u2014you bias the device and sample its fluctuations\u2014so you don\u2019t pay the ALU + memory overhead of software PRNGs (which also thrash state). This doesn\u2019t make entropy \u201cfree\u201d in a thermodynamic sense, but it\u2019s **hardware-native and cheap** compared with generating pseudorandom streams in general-purpose cores. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search12\ue202turn3search7\ue201\n\n**B. Keep computation *local* (short wires).**  \nP-bit networks implement energy-based models and Gibbs updates with **nearest-neighbor (or sparse) couplings**. Local updates + local communication mean very short interconnects\u2014which is exactly how you beat the energy of long wires and off-chip hops. This mirrors the whole **processing-in-memory** movement: reduce data motion to cut energy. TC just does this for **probabilistic** inference/training. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201\n\n> Put together: **entropy is on-die** and **messages stay near their variables**. That\u2019s why TC can plausibly slash **energy per sample** for diffusion/MCMC/EBM-style workloads.\n\n# 4) Important caveats (why the hype deserves scrutiny)\n\n- **Mixing still matters.** If your energy landscape is multimodal, local Gibbs updates may **mix slowly**; TC doesn\u2019t magic this away. Algorithmic tricks (tempering, learned proposals, diffusion-like schedules) are still needed, and they must be shown to work at large scale. (This is exactly what fast samplers and \u201cthermodynamic denoisers\u201d are trying to address.) \ue200cite\ue202turn14search3\ue201\n\n- **Scaling hardware is hard.** It\u2019s one thing to flip a few thousand p-bits; it\u2019s another to wire **hundreds of thousands+** with controlled couplings and low correlation. Dense connectivity causes congestion/slowdowns in Ising-like machines; practical systems rely on *sparse/local* wiring\u2014which shapes what problems you can map efficiently. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue201\n\n- **GPUs are fighting back on memory/interconnect.** HBM keeps dropping **pJ/bit**, NVLink/NVSwitch keep scaling, and wafer-scale systems push interconnect energy down too. TC has to beat *those* trajectories on real benchmarks, not just in small demos. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue202turn11view0\ue201\n\n# 5) What evidence would *really* validate TC\u2019s energy story?\n\n1) **Independent joules/sample** vs H100/MI300 on standard tasks (diffusion: FID/CLIP at fixed steps; Bayesian posterior kernels; EBM mixes)\u2014with link-level energy included. 2) **Scaling curves** showing energy stays low when you jump from ~10\u00b3 to ~10\u2075\u201310\u2076 stochastic units. 3) **RNG accounting** that shows physical noise replaces PRNG state traffic at system level. 4) **Ablations** proving that locality (short wires) is the main contributor to the energy win, not just under-clocking or cherry-picked models. (The general literature already shows memory/communication dominate energy; the test is whether TC\u2019s *local, noisy* fabric actually shifts that balance in practice.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201\n\n---\n\nIf you want a simple mental model: for one sampling step, the energy roughly splits into  \n**E \u2248 E_RNG + E_local-messages + E_local-update + E_off-chip**.  \nGPUs pay E_RNG (PRNG ops + state loads), lots of E_local-messages across long wires and caches, and sometimes E_off-chip. TC\u2019s bet is to **drive E_RNG \u2192 (very) low** by using physics, and **crush E_local-messages** by keeping wires short\u2014so **E_step** falls, and total energy falls proportionally to (steps \u00d7 E_step).

Aims to Disrupt the Data Center Bonanza","snippet":"Extropic, a startup founded by Guillaume Verdon and Trever McCourt, is introducing a revolutionary chip technology aimed at transforming AI and scientific computing. Their processors, known as thermodynamic sampling units (TSUs), handle probabilistic bits (p-bits) that model uncertainty, rather than traditional binary bits. This novel approach, inspired by thermodynamic principles and quantum computing, promises significantly higher energy efficiency\u2014potentially thousands of times more efficient than traditional CPUs and GPUs.\n\nExtropic's first working chip, the XTR-0, integrates an FPGA and two X-0 probabilistic chips and has been shared with select partners, including AI labs and weather modeling startups. One user, Johan Mathe of Atmo, confirmed the chip's unique performance in simulating complex weather systems.\n\nComplementing the hardware is TRHML, a software tool allowing developers to simulate TSU behavior on GPUs. The company plans to release a more powerful chip, the Z-1, with 250,000 p-bits, next year.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1755105865.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"github.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/extropic-ai/thrml","title":"extropic-ai/thrml: Thermodynamic Hypergraphical Model ...","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 THRML is a JAX library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models, with a focus on efficient block Gibbs sampling and ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"github.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ai.stackexchange.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/43699/batch-wise-inference-to-speed-up-muzeros-mcts","title":"Batch wise Inference to speed up Muzero's MCTS","snippet":"5 Feb 2024 \u2014 I want to speed up the self-play by running multiple MCTS's in different threads so that they pause whenever they want to query the neural network.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"ai.stackexchange.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_690a0198049c8324a0e1ae524ccce3e1","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching thermodynamic computing's potential for MCMC and AlphaZero","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"150e5722-82be-40c6-b639-69264a04cd4b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"08e375ac-6620-4f54-8ed5-454d1ec8a5a2","turn_exchange_id":"780925db-8138-493f-bfc0-78bb8a6ac513","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"08e375ac-6620-4f54-8ed5-454d1ec8a5a2","children":["0d40b847-67c4-458a-a595-7239a6f6bfe9"]},"0d40b847-67c4-458a-a595-7239a6f6bfe9":{"id":"0d40b847-67c4-458a-a595-7239a6f6bfe9","message":{"id":"0d40b847-67c4-458a-a595-7239a6f6bfe9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762263455.999287,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into MCTS bottlenecks","content":"We should find papers like \"AlphaZero Performance Analysis\" and \"MuZero scaling\" to back up the idea that network inference dominates.

Expect **order-of-magnitude** reductions in **joules/sample**; wall-clock speedups depend on mixing and memory locality of your model. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn2search3\ue201\n\n2) **Combinatorial optimization via Ising/QUBO.**  \nIf your search can be phrased as minimizing a sparse energy (Max-Cut, partitioning, ILP relaxations), the TC/p-bit route is directly applicable. Benchmarks on related \u201cIsing-machine\u201d hardware (e.g., Digital Annealer, CIM, D-Wave hybrids) show **competitive time-to-solution** on some classes, with variation across instances; TC aims to bring that style onto CMOS at lower energy. Treat any \u201c1000\u00d7\u201310 000\u00d7\u201d as **workload-dependent claims** until third-party measurement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\n---\n\n## AlphaZero/MuZero: what TC can and cannot do (without redesign)\n\n**Bottlenecks today.** In MuZero-style systems the costly parts are:  \n(a) **NN inference** at node expansions; (b) **MCTS traversal/backprop** (branchy, memory-latency bound); (c) RNG/categorical draws (minor). Multiple profiles show MCTS can dominate *if* unbatched; batching pushes load back to the NN. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n**Direct TC wins (drop-in):**  \n- Ultra-cheap **Dirichlet/Gumbel noise** and **categorical draws** (root noise, Gumbel-MuZero, temperature sampling).  \n- Potentially faster **stochastic playout heuristics** (if you still use them).  \nThese are real but typically a **small slice** of the pie.\n\n**Amdahl reality check (illustrative):** suppose 70% of time is NN inference, 30% is stochastic/MCTS bits that TC accelerates by 50\u00d7. Net speedup = 1 / (0.70 + 0.30/50) \u2248 **1.4\u00d7**. You\u2019ll feel the energy win on that 30%, but wall-clock barely moves.\n\n**Where TC *can* matter\u2014*with* redesign:**  \n- Replace parts of MCTS with **sampler-centric planning**: e.g., an **energy-based policy prior** or a **thermodynamic world model** that proposes child states/actions via block-Gibbs/DTM-style denoising, and only call the big NN intermittently for correction. That shifts compute to sampling where TC shines. (Extropic\u2019s DTM + categorical/Gaussian primitives are explicitly aimed at this regime; hardware exists in dev-kit form.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news48\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- Domains with **huge discrete action spaces** (molecules, circuits): use **GFlowNets / EBMs** for proposal and diversity, offloading the sampler to TC. Here, *most* work is sampling \u2192 **large system-level energy gains** are plausible. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search11\ue202turn2search17\ue201\n\n---\n\n## How much \u201cperformance bump\u201d is realistic?\n\nThink in **two axes**: **energy/sample** and **wall-clock**.\n\n- **Energy/sample** (best-case, sampler-dominated): TC vendors claim **10\u00b3\u201310\u2074\u00d7** vs GPU baselines for small generative/EBM demos; a second startup (Normal) claims up to **10\u00b3\u00d7**. Treat these as **claims** pending independent audits. If you architect MuZero-like agents so **\u226580\u201390%** of work is TC sampling, overall **energy** could drop **~10\u00d7** or more. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0news48\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- **Wall-clock**: hardware sampling is fast, but your loop still waits on **NN evals** and **tree memory traffic**. Without algorithmic changes: **~1.1\u20131.5\u00d7** is a sensible initial bound. With a sampler-centric planner and infrequent NN corrections: **~2\u201310\u00d7** is conceivable on some domains\u2014*if* mixing is good and host\u2013device I/O doesn\u2019t bottleneck. Evidence will have to come from benchmarks, not press releases. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Implementation blueprint (practical and staged)\n\n**Stage 0 \u2014 \u201cFree wins\u201d** (no algorithm change)  \n- Swap software RNG/softmax for **hardware categorical/Gaussian** (THRML API on the XTR-0 dev board). Wire it into your MCTS root noise (Dirichlet), Gumbel-MuZero sampling, and any stochastic rollout policy. Measure joules/op and latency. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn3search0\ue201\n\n**Stage 1 \u2014 TC-assisted tree search**  \n- Train a small **EBM prior** on top of your NN features to propose **K** promising actions by **block-Gibbs** on TC. Use those proposals to **restrict expansion** before calling the big NN; keep PUCT for backup. This trades some NN calls for many TC samples (cheap). Validate strength on Go/Chess baselines at fixed move-time. (Speculative/pipelined MCTS papers show the planner can be re-pipelined; TC fits that pipeline stage.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue201\n\n**Stage 2 \u2014 Sampler-centric planning**  \n- For MuZero-style agents, replace parts of the learned dynamics rollout with a **thermodynamic denoiser** (DTM-like) on TC to generate short-horizon futures; call the NN sparsely to re-anchor values/policies. Co-design the interface so the host GPU does batched NN, the TC board streams **hundreds\u2013thousands** of local updates per call. Extropic\u2019s roadmap mentions moving from a dev platform (**XTR-0**) toward PCIe-class integration; you\u2019ll want that before pushing scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201\n\n**Stage 3 \u2014 Combinatorial domains**  \n- For molecules, circuits, routing: use **GFlowNets/EBMs** as the primary search engine and offload **most** sampling to TC. Here you can plausibly convert TC\u2019s per-sample efficiency into **system-level** wins because sampling *is* the workload. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search11\ue201\n\n**Engineering notes**  \n- **I/O matters**: early XTR-0 is an FPGA+TSU dev board with a host link; budget for latency hiding and batch sizes. (Extropic says PCIe-class integration is on their path; today you prototype.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201  \n- **Benchmark honestly**: compare **joules/move** (planning) and **joules/sample** (MCMC) *including* host link, not just kernel time.  \n- **Mixing matters**: if your energy landscape is multi-modal, add tempering/learned proposals\u2014TC doesn\u2019t solve poor mixing by itself.\n\n---\n\n## What exists today (so you can actually try something)\n\n- **Hardware:** Extropic\u2019s **XTR-0** (FPGA + 2\u00d7 \u201cX-0\u201d probabilistic chips) seeded to partners; a larger **Z-1** (~250k p-bits) is *announced* for \u201cnext year.\u201d Normal Computing has taped out **CN101** (thermodynamic ASIC) with **up to 1000\u00d7 energy** claims on targeted workloads.

With a sampler-centric planner or EBM/GFlowNet proposals, **2\u201310\u00d7** speed/energy gains are *plausible* on some domains; with the vanilla algorithm, think **~1.1\u20131.5\u00d7**.

Their processors, known as thermodynamic sampling units (TSUs), handle probabilistic bits (p-bits) that model uncertainty, rather than traditional binary bits. This novel approach, inspired by thermodynamic principles and quantum computing, promises significantly higher energy efficiency\u2014potentially thousands of times more efficient than traditional CPUs and GPUs.\n\nExtropic's first working chip, the XTR-0, integrates an FPGA and two X-0 probabilistic chips and has been shared with select partners, including AI labs and weather modeling startups.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","attribution":"Tom's

Please comment on the accuracy and give your feedback\n\n---\n\n\r\nDavid Shapiro \u23e9\r\n@DaveShapi\r\nThermodynamic computing is here\r\n\r\nThere is a new computing paradigm emerging from the noise, and its arrival may be as significant as the dawn of deep learning or the advent of cloud virtualization. A new company, Extropic, has just launched its first thermodynamic computer, a device they call a TSU, or Thermal Sampling Unit. While the web is already filling with deep technical dives, what\u2019s more important for most of us is building a clear intuition for what this technology is, how it\u2019s fundamentally different from anything that\u2019s come before, and why it\u2019s generating so much excitement. This isn\u2019t just another chip; it\u2019s a new way to think about computation itself.\r\n\r\nSeeing is Believing: Solving Puzzles in One Shot\r\n\r\nTo understand what a TSU does, let\u2019s look at two classic, notoriously difficult computer science problems: Sudoku and the Eight Queens problem. When you or I solve a Sudoku, we use a process of sequential logic, guess-and-check, and backtracking. We make an assumption, follow its logical conclusion, and if we hit a dead end, we erase and try again. A classical computer does the same, just much faster. A TSU, however, approaches this in a completely different way. Using a TSU simulator, one can \u201cprogram\u201d the problem by first clamping the known values\u2014the clues already on the board. Then, you program in the constraints: no duplicate numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 square. With the problem thus defined, the TSU doesn\u2019t \u201csearch\u201d for a solution; it anneals one. In a single computational step, the solution simply emerges, backfilling all the empty squares correctly.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to the Eight Queens problem, a challenge to place eight queens on a chessboard so that none can attack any other. This is a complex combinatorial problem with 92 distinct solutions. A classical computer would have to iteratively search for these. A TSU, by contrast, can be programmed with the constraints (the \u201canti-affinity\u201d between queens on the same row, column, or diagonal) and then set to sample the \u201csolution space.\u201d In this context, a valid solution is one with a \u201cproblem energy\u201d of zero. The TSU\u2019s physical nature allows it to naturally find these zero-energy states. A simulation of this process shows the TSU discovering all 92 unique solutions, demonstrating its ability to not just find an answer, but to explore the entire landscape of all correct answers. This is a fundamentally new approach, one that bypasses the brute-force, iterative methods we\u2019ve relied on for decades.\r\n\r\nThe Physics of Computation: Using Noise, Not Fighting It\r\n\r\nThis new power comes from a radical design philosophy. For the last 70 years, computing has been about one thing: order. We build chips that are deterministic, logical, and precise. The great enemy has always been noise, heat, and randomness. We spend billions on cooling and error correction to eliminate these very things. Quantum computing, in many ways, is the ultimate expression of this, requiring temperatures near absolute zero to eliminate all thermal noise and achieve quantum coherence. Thermodynamic computing is the polar opposite. It doesn\u2019t fight the noise; it uses it. The TSU is built on the understanding that the natural, stochastic noise from \u201cleaky\u201d transistors\u2014the very randomness we\u2019ve tried to engineer out of existence\u2014is itself a powerful computational resource.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way: a GPU, which is central to today\u2019s AI, has to simulate noise. When a generative AI model creates a new image or sentence, it\u2019s using complex algorithms to fake randomness. The TSU doesn\u2019t need to fake it; it harnesses the actual physical randomness of thermodynamics. It is a piece of hardware that directly computes with probability. This makes it a hybrid, sitting somewhere between a purely analog computer (which might use light or sound waves to compute) and a digital GPU. It\u2019s a physical device that leverages the laws of physics itself to find solutions, rather than just using logic gates to simulate them.\r\n\r\nFrom a Lost Hiker to a Million Bouncy Balls\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best way to build intuition is with a metaphor. Imagine that solving a complex optimization problem is like trying to find the lowest point of altitude in a 100-square-mile mountainous landscape. Classical computing, using an algorithm like gradient descent, is like being a single hiker dropped into this landscape at night. You have no map or satellite view. All you have is an altimeter and the sensation of the slope under your feet. You can only take one step at a time, always walking downhill, hoping you don\u2019t get stuck in a small local valley when the true, lowest canyon is miles away.\r\n\r\nThermodynamic computing is a completely different approach. It\u2019s like having a million bouncy balls and a helicopter. You drop all million balls simultaneously across the entire 100-square-mile landscape. Then, you \u201cturn on an earthquake,\u201d shaking the entire system. The balls bounce and jostle, but as the shaking (the \u201cannealing\u201d) subsides, where do they all end up? They naturally settle into the lowest points. The balls that collect in the deepest valley represent the optimal solution. The TSU is, in essence, a physical device for dropping those million balls at once and letting the laws of thermodynamics find the lowest \u201cenergy\u201d state for you, all at the same time.\r\n\r\nBeyond Puzzles: The Real-World Impact\r\n\r\nThis is far more than just a clever way to solve brain teasers. This ability to instantly find the lowest energy state for a complex, constrained system has staggering real-world applications. One of the most immediate is protein folding. Companies like Google\u2019s DeepMind have made incredible progress with AI like AlphaFold, which predicts protein structures. But this is still a predictive model trained on existing data. A TSU could potentially solve the folding problem directly, treating the protein as a system of atomic affinities and repulsions and finding its most stable, lowest-energy configuration almost instantaneously. This could revolutionize drug discovery and materials science.\r\n\r\nAn even more profound possibility lies in nuclear fusion. One of the greatest engineering challenges in history is controlling the superheated plasma within a tokamak reactor. This requires shaping unimaginably complex magnetic containment fields in real-time to prevent the plasma from touching the reactor walls. This is a real-time optimization problem so complex it\u2019s currently beyond our capabilities. A TSU, however, could be fast enough. Its ability to compute with electricity itself, rather than abstracting the problem through layers of software, might allow it to update the magnetic fields fast enough to stabilize the fusion reaction. One could even imagine a future where thermodynamic computing elements are built directly into the tokamak\u2019s walls, allowing the reactor to physically and intelligently react to the plasma\u2019s state in real time.\r\n\r\nA \u2018GPT-2 Moment\u2019 for a New Era\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to become numb to hype, but what we are witnessing with the TSU feels different. This is what you might call a \u201cGPT-2 moment.\u201d For those who were there, GPT-2 was the first generative AI model that wasn\u2019t just a toy; it was the first time you could play with it at home and see the spark of true generative intelligence. It was the precursor that pointed directly to the GPT-3 and ChatGPT revolution that has since changed the world. This TSU has that same feel. It\u2019s the \u201cSDK\u201d for a new computing paradigm.\r\n\r\nThis technology is as different from classical computing as quantum computing is, but with a critical difference: a team of 15 built this in two years, and it runs at room temperature on your desk. Quantum computing has seen decades of work and billions in funding, and it still hasn\u2019t produced a commercially viable, scalable machine. The TSU is here now. Based on a two-decade-long career at the cutting edge of technology\u2014from seeing the obvious future of virtualization in 2007 to an early conviction in deep learning and GPT\u2014this has all the same hallmarks of a fundamental, world-changing shift. We are not just building faster calculators; we are learning to compute with the universe itself. Pay close attention to this. This is the next big thing."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"63e2d8dd-bacd-4061-bd50-0d4e2ae03fa6","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"c5f19457-4060-498a-8aa0-430c73357ac7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"380c432d-5a27-404e-9250-e32c787d9e0a","children":["60598552-be05-45ad-9615-c9997eec2fde"]},"60598552-be05-45ad-9615-c9997eec2fde":{"id":"60598552-be05-45ad-9615-c9997eec2fde","message":{"id":"60598552-be05-45ad-9615-c9997eec2fde","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762272389.4903462,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"63e2d8dd-bacd-4061-bd50-0d4e2ae03fa6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7b2aeeb2-338a-46cd-ad6c-77b882945e6f","turn_exchange_id":"c5f19457-4060-498a-8aa0-430c73357ac7","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7b2aeeb2-338a-46cd-ad6c-77b882945e6f","children":["0f4f0b63-fe2b-4092-8637-de6c6c8fd07f"]},"0f4f0b63-fe2b-4092-8637-de6c6c8fd07f":{"id":"0f4f0b63-fe2b-4092-8637-de6c6c8fd07f","message":{"id":"0f4f0b63-fe2b-4092-8637-de6c6c8fd07f","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762272389.5107753,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"63e2d8dd-bacd-4061-bd50-0d4e2ae03fa6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"60598552-be05-45ad-9615-c9997eec2fde","turn_exchange_id":"c5f19457-4060-498a-8aa0-430c73357ac7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"60598552-be05-45ad-9615-c9997eec2fde","children":["1a146c6e-4db1-442e-a874-61b963f1e36d"]},"1a146c6e-4db1-442e-a874-61b963f1e36d":{"id":"1a146c6e-4db1-442e-a874-61b963f1e36d","message":{"id":"1a146c6e-4db1-442e-a874-61b963f1e36d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762272392.036286,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating claims and sources","content":"I\u2019m looking into some claims about tech developments.

Unlike traditional CPUs and GPUs, CN101 leverages natural thermodynamic processes such as randomness, fluctuation, and energy dissipation to address the escalating energy demands of AI and scientific computing. This chip is optimized for large-scale linear algebra and stochastic sampling, including tasks like Bayesian inference.\n\nCEO Faris Sbahi sees thermodynamic computing as essential for overcoming the current energy limitations of AI, which is struggling to scale under existing architectures. The company\u2019s roadmap includes the CN201 chip, aimed at medium-scale generative AI by next year, and the CN301 chip, expected to deliver major performance improvements for large-scale models within two years. Silicon Engineering Lead Zach Belateche emphasized that CN101 marks the fundamental step in real-world validation of thermodynamic computing, offering a new pathway for powering future AI systems.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":1755711240.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"deeplp.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://deeplp.com/f/thermodynamic-computing---a-new-paradigm?blogcategory=AI+Developments","title":"Thermodynamic Computing - A New Paradigm","snippet":"19 Jul 2025 \u2014 A radical new paradigm, thermodynamic computing, proposes an elegant and profound solution: instead of fighting physics and noise, we should ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"deeplp.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techspot.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techspot.com/news/109082-normal-computing-tapes-out-world-first-thermodynamic-chip.html","title":"Normal Computing tapes out the world's first ...","snippet":"15 Aug 2025 \u2014 CN101 signals shift toward smarter, energy-efficient computing.

This ASIC marks a departure from traditional silicon approaches, leveraging thermodynamic and physical principles \u2014 such as noise, stochasticity, and nondeterminism \u2014 to achieve computational efficiencies conventional chips cannot. Unlike standard electronics that suppress noise, thermodynamic chips use it to enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in tasks like AI training and scientific computing.\n\nCN101 operates by initializing components in a semi-random state and computing results by reaching equilibrium within the system \u2014 a method suited for probabilistic applications rather than deterministic tasks like web browsing. The chip is optimized for linear algebra, matrix operations, and probabilistic computations, potentially offering up to 1000x energy efficiency compared to standard methods.\n\nNormal Computing envisions future AI servers combining CPUs, GPUs, thermodynamic, probabilistic, and quantum chips to optimally match solutions to problems. Their roadmap includes expanded CN chip releases in 2026 and 2028 to support more advanced tasks like photo and video diffusion modeling. This innovation positions thermodynamic chips as a potential breakthrough in alternative computing technologies alongside silicon photonics and quantum chips.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1755105865.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"news.ycombinator.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45750995","title":"Extropic is building thermodynamic computing hardware","snippet":"6 days ago \u2014 This hardware outputs randomness with controllable distributions, potentially extremely complex ones, many orders of magnitude more efficiently ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"news.ycombinator.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reddit.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/1i98iy6/the_first_reversible_computer_will_be_released/","title":"The first reversible computer will be released this year ...","snippet":"Reversible computing is neither an attempt to game thermodynamics nor a scam.

That\u2019s consistent with Extropic\u2019s docs and arXiv paper. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n- **Why now.** The pitch\u2014AI hitting an **energy/interconnect wall** and sampling-heavy workloads proliferating\u2014is a fair motivation, and Extropic has publicly shown an **XTR-0** dev platform (FPGA + two tiny \u201cX-0\u201d chips), a JAX library (**THRML**), and a plan for a larger **Z-1 (~250k p-bits)**. Independent coverage broadly matches this. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news45\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn11search1\ue201\n\n# Where it\u2019s overstated or technically off\n- **\u201cOne-shot\u201d Sudoku / Eight Queens**  \n  The claim that a TSU \u201canneals a solution in a single computational step\u201d (and enumerates all 92 Eight-Queens solutions in one go) is **misleading**. Annealing and Gibbs sampling are **iterative stochastic processes** with **temperature/schedule** and **mixing time**; practical solvers sample repeatedly and may still get stuck in local modes. Sudoku (generalized) is **NP-complete**; Eight Queens does indeed have **92 solutions**, but finding (or uniformly sampling) all solutions requires **multiple draws/runs**, not a single step. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search12\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n- **\u201cUses noise instead of faking it\u201d \u21d2 huge speedups**  \n  Yes, TSUs harness physical noise, but **RNG isn\u2019t the bottleneck** in today\u2019s diffusion/transformer pipelines\u2014**matmul/attention and CFG passes dominate** inference cost. So the \u201cGPU must fake randomness\u201d framing overstates the wall-clock upside (though it may still help **energy per sample**). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search19\ue201\n- **\u201cAs different from classical computing as quantum\u201d**  \n  No. TSUs are **classical, room-temperature, all-transistor** probabilistic hardware.

Extropic\u2019s own paper emphasizes **all-transistor RNG/samplers** orchestrating **Gibbs** on sparse EBMs. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n- **Protein folding \u201calmost instantaneously\u201d**  \n  Treat with skepticism. Many formalizations of protein folding/design are **NP-hard/NP-complete**, and while sampling accelerators can help **search**, they don\u2019t repeal worst-case complexity.

So a thermodynamic sampler (e.g., Extropic\u2019s TSU) doesn\u2019t help JEPA\u2019s core pretraining loop much. It *could* help the **planner / inference** pieces in LeCun\u2019s broader blueprint (where he *does* invoke energy minimization and search), or for JEPA-style models that introduce **latent sampling** for multi-hypothesis prediction. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n### What JEPA is (and isn\u2019t)\n- **JEPA/I-JEPA**: learns by predicting *representations* of masked regions from a context representation; explicitly **non-generative** and trained without negatives. No MCMC, no diffusion steps, no partition functions. Inference is feed-forward. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **V-JEPA / V-JEPA-2**: the same idea for video; some variants explore **latent variables** to capture future uncertainty, but training/inference remain primarily deterministic prediction in latent space. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search21\ue201  \n- **EBM connection**: LeCun\u2019s program frames lots of models under the **energy-based** lens, and his **H-JEPA** notes explicitly tie hierarchical JEPA to **latent-variable EBMs**. But vanilla JEPA does **not** do energy-based *sampling* during training or inference. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n### Where thermodynamic computing (TC) could help\n- **Planner / configurator in LeCun\u2019s architecture**: In *A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence*, he proposes modules that **search/minimize costs/energies** over latent states and actions\u2014there, fast physical **sampling / annealing** (what TC accelerates) could be useful. Think proposal generation, multi-hypothesis rollouts, or energy-guided action selection. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- **JEPA-adjacent models with stochastic latents**: If you extend JEPA to *sample* multiple plausible targets/trajectories (rather than regress a single prediction), TC could accelerate those **sampling** or **Gibbs/annealing** inner loops while the main networks still run on GPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n### Practical takeaway\n- **Direct, drop-in benefit to I-JEPA/V-JEPA pretraining?** Minimal.
