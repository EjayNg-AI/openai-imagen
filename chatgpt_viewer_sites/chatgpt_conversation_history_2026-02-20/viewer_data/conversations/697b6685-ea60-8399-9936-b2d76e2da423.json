I am working at a tuition center as a teacher. Technically, I am not an employee. An acquaintance of mine (let's call him Y) and I joined forces with a good friend of Y's (let's call him S) a few year's back to work in S's tuition setup.\nWe rented a place together and jointly paid the rent.\nIn that sense we are more partners, but we do not have a share S's company nor are we entitled to any of the company's profits. We are employees cosplaying as partners.\nAll our income whilst working with S is commissioned based, determined by our own student count.\nRepeated burnout, disillusionment with S's business practices, have made me decide to leave now.\nS and I are on good terms in spite of my private disenfranchisement. I have made an effort to keep the peace with him in spite of disliking him. That is now at a breaking point. I want out.\nS has explicitly told new, traditional employees (those who sign actual formal employment contracts, unlike Y and I) under him that non-poaching of students is a must-have rule.\nPrivately, he has previously mentioned that if a resigning teacher wants to take a couple of students away to tutor on his own, outside of the company, he is willing to accept that. This is provided the teacher is upfront and transparent with him. Note that this applies to students taught by the resigning tutor, not students taught by other tutors (that would be egregious poaching).\nEven for tutors in the past who left on acrimonious terms, he did not pursue any action even when he found out that they had asked students under their charge to leave with them.\nThis is not generosity, but merely being pragmatic. These students were taught by the former teacher to begin with. Taking action against the teacher? Hardly something likely to be fruitful. The students left with the resigning teacher of their own accord. Going to court over such an issue would be ridiculous.\nNow my situation. I want to take as many students with me as I can, to another tuition center. The other tuition center will likely be able to take me in only in May/June. By no means immediate. In the meantime I need to play my cards right.\nI have my existing good rapport with him in my favor. But if he finds out that I will soon be \"of no value\" to him, he has shown in the past that he can change his attitude very quickly. His behavior is uncertain. Maybe he can handle it maturely with me, given our rapport. Maybe he will not. By no means is he predicatable.\nWhen other teachers left, no matter on friendly or on acrimonious terms, he has always asked the leaving teacher to immediately transfer his students to other teachers.\nI do not want to be unethical. The truth here is that I need to be pragmatic myself. Transpareny and rapport will go a long way, but I need to bear in mind that he is fundamentally concerned with self-interest.\nHelp me navigate. These are not easy issues. Let's think this through together."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"e26af8db-d1f1-4939-bbb0-917315947e9f","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"dae4824a-5fd3-4779-a2f7-010995fdbe91","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"56f8c226-930c-40ba-a5c0-c1793e011d80","children":["956a5e80-c8b7-4ea6-8384-e6a4d1c1a91b"]},"956a5e80-c8b7-4ea6-8384-e6a4d1c1a91b":{"id":"956a5e80-c8b7-4ea6-8384-e6a4d1c1a91b","message":{"id":"956a5e80-c8b7-4ea6-8384-e6a4d1c1a91b","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769694857.2239192,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"e26af8db-d1f1-4939-bbb0-917315947e9f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"2b115dc7-73ee-43d9-b697-95d877362e3d","turn_exchange_id":"dae4824a-5fd3-4779-a2f7-010995fdbe91","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2b115dc7-73ee-43d9-b697-95d877362e3d","children":["87155957-776c-4462-afa1-0e493587dc2d"]},"87155957-776c-4462-afa1-0e493587dc2d":{"id":"87155957-776c-4462-afa1-0e493587dc2d","message":{"id":"87155957-776c-4462-afa1-0e493587dc2d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769694857.4331145,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[],"safe_urls":[],"request_id":"e26af8db-d1f1-4939-bbb0-917315947e9f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"956a5e80-c8b7-4ea6-8384-e6a4d1c1a91b","turn_exchange_id":"dae4824a-5fd3-4779-a2f7-010995fdbe91","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"956a5e80-c8b7-4ea6-8384-e6a4d1c1a91b","children":["7d3e74fe-d5ac-41bc-ae04-4bdb115ffcbf"]},"7d3e74fe-d5ac-41bc-ae04-4bdb115ffcbf":{"id":"7d3e74fe-d5ac-41bc-ae04-4bdb115ffcbf","message":{"id":"7d3e74fe-d5ac-41bc-ae04-4bdb115ffcbf","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769694858.648502,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Providing guidance on leaving a tuition center","content":"The user is asking for advice about leaving a tuition center and taking students with them \u2014 a situation with potential ethical and legal implications.

The low-drama, high-yield strategy is **choice architecture**: make sure parents *know you\u2019re leaving* and make it *easy* for them to choose you **without you using centre data or applying pressure**.\n\nBelow is a practical playbook.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Guardrails (so you don\u2019t accidentally hand S ammunition)\n\n### A. While you\u2019re still teaching there, assume you owe *some* duty of loyalty\nEven without a formal employment contract, courts can recognise implied duties (and agency-style \u201cintegrity/honesty\u201d wording can sometimes bite). A key principle in Singapore employment law is: **during the relationship, there\u2019s a duty of fidelity; after it ends, post-termination restraints must stand on their own as \u201crestraint of trade\u201d clauses**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n**Translation:** Don\u2019t do anything that looks like \u201ccompeting while still inside the shop\u201d.\n\n### B. Post-exit restrictions are often weak unless narrow and justified\nIn Singapore, restrictive covenants (non-compete / non-solicitation) are generally **prima facie unenforceable** unless they protect a legitimate proprietary interest and are reasonable in scope. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \nYou may still face threats/bluffs, but you want to deny S any *clean* factual narrative like \u201che took our client list and solicited everyone while still engaged\u201d.\n\n### C. PDPA is a real landmine in tuition\nParents\u2019 phone numbers/emails + student info are **personal data**. Using a centre\u2019s customer list for your own onward marketing can trigger Personal Data Protection Act issues (consent/purpose limitations). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n**Practical rule:** don\u2019t export lists, don\u2019t screenshot databases/chats, don\u2019t forward contact spreadsheets to yourself.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The objective way to \u201ctake many students\u201d without being sleazy\nYou don\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d students. **Parents choose**. Your job is to:\n- avoid blindsiding them,\n- avoid pressure,\n- give them a clear way to opt in to follow you.\n\nThis is both **ethical** and **strategically strong**, because the parents who value you will self-select.\n\n---\n\n## 3) A 3-phase plan that fits your May/June constraint\n\n### Phase 1 (now): reduce risk + preserve future upside\n- **Stop accepting new students immediately.** (If you take new intakes now, you create moral and reputational debt.)\n- **Do not hint to parents you\u2019re leaving yet** *unless you\u2019re prepared for S to cut you off immediately*.\n- **Prepare your \u201cbridge\u201d option**: if the new centre is only May/June, decide whether you can (a) go independent temporarily, or (b) hold out longer with S.  \n  If your burnout is severe, a temporary independent setup is often cleaner than lingering resentfully.\n\n### Phase 2 (the resignation conversation): set terms *before* he panics\nYour single most important move is to **present S with a face-saving, self-interest-friendly narrative**:\n\n- You want continuity for students and minimal churn for him.\n- You\u2019ll help handover notes/admin.\n- You won\u2019t touch anyone else\u2019s students.\n- But for *your* students, the correct principle is: **parents decide**.\n\nIf you go in with \u201cI want to take as many students as I can\u201d, you trigger defensive behavior. If you go in with \u201cI want an orderly transition; parents may request continuity with me and I want to handle that cleanly\u201d, you give him room to stay mature.\n\n### Phase 3 (parent communication): opt-in, factual, non-pressuring\nIdeally: you inform S first, then parents **same day** (so he can\u2019t spin it as \u201che secretly worked behind my back\u201d).\n\nIf S insists \u201cimmediate transfer, zero contact\u201d, you still keep clean hands by **not using centre data**, but you can:\n- respond to parents who contact you (especially if they already have your number),\n- let parents know *in-person after class* **only after you\u2019ve resigned** (brief, factual, no selling),\n- avoid mass messaging.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Scripts you can actually use\n\n### Script to S (calm, pragmatic, hard to attack)\n> \u201cS, I want to let you know I\u2019m planning to step away. I\u2019m not looking for drama, and I want a smooth transition for the students and for you.  \n>  \n> My proposal is: I continue teaching my current students up to **[date]**, I don\u2019t take any new intakes, and I\u2019ll provide proper handover notes/admin support for anyone who stays with the centre.  \n>  \n> Some parents may ask to continue with me after I leave. I won\u2019t approach students outside my own roster, I won\u2019t use any centre materials or data, and I won\u2019t say anything negative about the centre. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to block parents from choosing continuity if they request it.  \n>  \n> I\u2019d like us to align on a simple communication so parents aren\u2019t caught off guard.\u201d\n\nThis frames you as reasonable and gives him an off-ramp: agree and save face.\n\n### Script to parents (low-pressure, opt-in)\n> \u201cHi [Parent\u2019s name], I wanted to share that I\u2019ll be leaving [Centre] on/around **[date]**. The centre will arrange continuity for classes.  \n>  \n> If you\u2019d like to explore continuing lessons with me after I leave, you can message me directly at **[your number/email]** after **[date]** and I\u2019ll share options. No pressure at all \u2014 please choose what\u2019s best for [Child\u2019s name].\u201d\n\nNotice what\u2019s missing: no price pitch, no \u201ccome with me\u201d, no attack on S.\n\n---\n\n## 5) What if S reacts badly (common failure modes + what you do)\n\n### If he demands immediate transfer *and* tells you not to contact parents\n- Don\u2019t argue. Say: \u201cUnderstood. Can you confirm in writing my last teaching date and what you\u2019d like parents to be told?\u201d\n- Keep everything professional and written.\n- **Do not mass message** using centre records.\n- If parents contact you independently, you can respond neutrally.\n\n### If he threatens \u201cpoaching rules\u201d despite you not signing a contract\nYour response should be boring:\n- \u201cI will respect confidentiality and won\u2019t solicit students outside my own roster. Parents will decide what they want.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll calm down if you don\u2019t escalate.\n\n### If he starts smearing you to parents/staff\nDo not retaliate. One neutral line only:\n- \u201cI\u2019m leaving for personal reasons; I\u2019m grateful for the time here; I wish the centre well.\u201d\n\nRetaliation is where defamation/reputation spirals start.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Two blunt realities (worth stating explicitly)\n\n1) **Your goal (\u201cas many students as possible\u201d) and your ethical constraint (\u201cI don\u2019t want to be unethical\u201d) conflict if you interpret \u201cmaximising\u201d as active persuasion.**  \n   The best ethical-maximising approach is: *inform + opt-in + no pressure + excellent teaching right up to exit*.\n\n2) **\u201cHe won\u2019t sue; it\u2019d be ridiculous\u201d is not a safe assumption.**  \n   People sometimes threaten legal action just to scare you, even when enforcement is weak. Your defense is to be *clean on data, clean on timing, clean on communications*. Restraint clauses are often hard to enforce unless narrow and justified, but you don\u2019t want to fund the fight. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 7) The one thing I\u2019d do immediately (before anything else)\nMake a private checklist and stick to it:\n\n- \u2705 No new students accepted from today  \n- \u2705 No copying/exporting any parent/student lists (PDPA risk) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n- \u2705 Decide your exit date window (earliest date you can tolerate vs best strategic date)  \n- \u2705 Decide your bridge plan (independent vs wait)  \n- \u2705 Prepare your S-script and parent-script  \n- \u2705 Keep written records of key messages\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me just **two facts**\u2014(i) whether you\u2019ve signed *anything at all* with S (even a \u201cteacher agreement\u201d / WhatsApp policy text), and (ii) whose name(s) are on the lease\u2014then I can tighten this into a concrete timeline with the least-risk sequencing for your exact situation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search16\ue201","start_idx":1159,"end_idx":1193,"safe_urls":["https://journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg/Journals/SAL-Practitioner/Employment-Law/ctl/eFirstSALPDFJournalView/mid/615/ArticleId/1960/Citation/JournalsOnlinePDF","https://journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg/Journals/SAL-Practitioner/Employment-Law/ctl/eFirstSALPDFJournalView/mid/615/ArticleId/1960/Citation/JournalsOnlinePDF?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.globalcompliancenews.com/2021/06/13/singapore-integrity-honesty-and-non-solicitation-obligations-in-agency-agreements-and-employment-contracts28052021/","https://www.globalcompliancenews.com/2021/06/13/singapore-integrity-honesty-and-non-solicitation-obligations-in-agency-agreements-and-employment-contracts28052021/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg](https://journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg/Journals/SAL-Practitioner/Employment-Law/ctl/eFirstSALPDFJournalView/mid/615/ArticleId/1960/Citation/JournalsOnlinePDF?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN AN EMPLOYMENT ...","url":"https://journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg/Journals/SAL-Practitioner/Employment-Law/ctl/eFirstSALPDFJournalView/mid/615/ArticleId/1960/Citation/JournalsOnlinePDF?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1716864225.0,"snippet":"30 May 2024 \u2014 Once the contract comes to an end, however, that duty of fidelity or good faith disappears.

Singapore courts do recognise implied duties (eg, not misusing confidential info) in employment-like relationships, but the usual battleground is *documents/lists/data*, not \u201ca teacher left and parents followed\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n2) **The Kovan premises is ending anyway (May/June)** \u2192 there\u2019s a natural, externally forced transition point. That lets you frame your exit around continuity for students rather than \u201cI\u2019m competing with you\u201d.\n\nSo your strategy should be: **be squeaky-clean on data + be disciplined on timing + let parents *opt in* without pressure**.\n\n---\n\n## 1) The two real risks you must actively neutralise\n\n### Risk A: \u201cHe used our customer list / confidential info\u201d\nEven without a written NDA, ex-staff getting sued typically hinges on **retaining company documents / key customer lists / contact lists / pricing sheets**, etc. Courts have dealt with \u201ckey customer list\u201d style disputes and misuse of confidential information. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\n**Rules to follow (non-negotiable):**\n- Don\u2019t export / screenshot / forward any parent contact lists from the centre.\n- Don\u2019t use centre WhatsApp broadcast lists for your own notice.\n- Don\u2019t send parent info to the new centre unless the *parent* provides it to you for that purpose.\n- Keep all comms factual; don\u2019t say anything defamatory.\n\n(Also, parent contact details are personal data; \u201crepurposing\u201d them is where Personal Data Protection Act exposure can start. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201)\n\n### Risk B: Rental liability blowback\nYou *did* sign a rent cost-sharing / liability document, but you don\u2019t have a copy. That means: **don\u2019t assume** what you owe (or for how long) if you stop paying or leave early.\n\n**Action:** get the document. Not as a \u201clegal fight\u201d move\u2014purely as \u201cwe need to settle move-out / deposit / final month rent cleanly\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2) What to do now (Jan\u2013Feb): position yourself for a clean, high-yield exit\n\n### A. Freeze expansion\n- Stop taking new students now.\n- Don\u2019t hint anything to parents yet unless you\u2019re prepared for S to force immediate handover.\n\n### B. Quietly prep the \u201cif S cuts access immediately\u201d plan\nBecause S\u2019s default behaviour is \u201ctransfer students immediately\u201d, you need a contingency:\n- If you get cut off in March/April, can you do **temporary online lessons** or **home tutoring** for a defined period until May/June?\n- If not, accept that \u201cmaximising students\u201d may mean timing your resignation closer to closure, so parents move with you at the same moment they\u2019re forced to make decisions anyway.\n\n### C. Start a paper trail (boring but powerful)\nUse WhatsApp/email confirmations on:\n- rent contributions you\u2019ve made,\n- what is owed to whom,\n- any agreement about deposit division,\n- and later, your last teaching date.\n\nIf things sour, the person with calm written records wins.\n\n---\n\n## 3) The best high-yield play given the eviction: \u201cExit at the relocation fault-line\u201d\nIf your goal is \u201cas many students as possible\u201d, the eviction gives you a non-hostile narrative:\n\n> **Kovan is ending; everyone must choose a continuity plan anyway.**\n\nThat is the moment parents are psychologically ready to switch teachers/centres without feeling like they\u2019re \u201cbetraying\u201d anyone.\n\n### Recommended timing\n- **Don\u2019t formally announce your departure now** (too early; gives S time to reassign your roster).\n- Aim to tell S **~6\u20138 weeks before your intended last teaching date**, *when you can state a concrete plan* (eg \u201cI will teach through end-April; I have an arrangement starting May/June\u201d). This reduces his panic response.\n\n---\n\n## 4) The conversation with S: make it hard for him to justify a scorched-earth reaction\nYour objectives in that talk:\n- You are cooperative on move-out.\n- You are not touching other tutors\u2019 students.\n- You are not using centre data.\n- But you will not mislead parents; if they ask for continuity with you, you\u2019ll handle it cleanly.\n\nA line that often works in self-interest terms:\n- \u201cIf parents feel blindsided, the centre loses trust and loses them anyway. A calm, transparent message keeps more families in the ecosystem\u2014whether they stay or follow me.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s pragmatic, he\u2019ll see the logic.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Parent communication that maximises opt-in while staying ethical\nYour \u201cconversion\u201d mechanism must be **opt-in, low pressure**.\n\n### Best case (cooperative S): one joint announcement\nIdeal is the centre announcing Kovan closure/relocation, and separately stating you\u2019re leaving after X date.\n\n### If S refuses: do it only to *your* students, and keep it minimal\n- In-person after class (not broadcast lists).\n- Or to parents who already contact you directly on your personal number.\n\nKeep it factual:\n- \u201cI\u2019m leaving around X; Kovan is closing; the centre will arrange continuity; if you want to explore continuing with me from May/June, message me directly after X.\u201d\n\nThis avoids the \u201che messaged everyone using our list\u201d narrative.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Financial settlement: don\u2019t let rent/deposit become his leverage over you\nBecause S is on the lease, he may be stressed and may try to weaponise \u201cyou owe rent / you caused losses\u201d.\n\n**Protect yourself by proposing a clean settlement early:**\n- clarify how remaining rent is split until the last day,\n- clarify deposit refund split,\n- clarify who pays any reinstatement/cleaning costs,\n- and put it in writing.\n\nDo **not** tie this explicitly to student choices (that looks like quid pro quo). Just keep both tracks clean: \u201crent settlement\u201d and \u201cteaching exit\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Red lines (stuff that turns a manageable exit into a mess)\n- Mass messaging parents using centre channels/lists.\n- \u201cSpecial discount if you leave the centre\u201d type offers.\n- Saying or implying the centre is collapsing / untrustworthy (stick to the fact: premises ending).\n- Taking any \u201cstudent list\u201d or \u201ccontacts spreadsheet\u201d with you.\n- Recruiting students taught by other tutors.\n\nIf you avoid these, S\u2019s threats (if any) are mostly bluster, and your reputation stays intact. (Restrictive covenants are already hard to enforce even *with* contracts; without one, the main hook is confidence/data misuse. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201)\n\n---\n\n## The one concrete next step I\u2019d do this week\nAsk (politely, neutrally) for a copy of the rent-splitting agreement **specifically because of the eviction**:\n\n> \u201cSince we\u2019re moving out by May/June, can you send me the signed rent-splitting document so I can reconcile contributions and we can settle remaining rent/deposit cleanly?\u201d\n\nThis reads as operational, not adversarial\u2014and it prevents nasty surprises.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you craft **two versions** of the S-conversation:\n- Version A: cooperative \u201clet\u2019s plan the transition together\u201d\n- Version B: defensive \u201cI\u2019m leaving, here are my boundaries\u201d  \n\u2026and a parent message that is maximally opt-in while minimising \u201csolicitation\u201d optics."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":467,"end_idx":512,"safe_urls":["https://www.cnplaw.com/beyond-the-four-walls-of-the-employment-contract-good-faith-fidelity-and-fiduciary-duties-cnpupdate/?print-posts=pdf","https://www.cnplaw.com/beyond-the-four-walls-of-the-employment-contract-good-faith-fidelity-and-fiduciary-duties-cnpupdate/?print-posts=pdf&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2018_sghc_129","https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2018_sghc_129?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2022_SGHC_128","https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2022_SGHC_128?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([CNP
