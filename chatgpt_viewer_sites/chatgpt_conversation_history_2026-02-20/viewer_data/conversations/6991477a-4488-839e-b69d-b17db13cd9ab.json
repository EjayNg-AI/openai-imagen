I'll keep the same style and difficulty. I'll also include multi-part questions, and ensure questions are numbered with answers at the end, but no \"Why?\" or explanatory notes, per the user\u2019s request.\n\n**Adjusting questions to only include numerical answers**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is clear: I need to ensure questions result in only numeric answers. That means avoiding things like \u201cOption A\u201d or \u201cOption B\u201d for value-for-money questions. Instead, I should ask questions like \u201cFind the cost per kg to the nearest cent,\u201d which will give a numeric result, as required.\n\n**Adjusting questions to maintain style while ensuring numeric answers**\n\nTo align with the user\u2019s request, I\u2019ll adjust questions like \u201cFind the difference in unit cost\u201d to ensure numeric answers only. For reasoning checks, I might ask for both estimated and actual values numerically, but avoid phrases like \u201creasonable.\u201d I\u2019ll focus on numerical answers\u2014keeping estimated values and actual values, as needed, all numeric.\n\n**Ensuring numeric answers while preserving style**\n\nTo stay true to the user\u2019s request for numerical answers, I'll focus on asking for actual values and possibly estimated values, both of which will remain numeric. I can avoid non-numeric terms like \"reasonable,\" but still preserve the style by using estimation for comparison. I need to ensure that intervals are clearly expressed as numeric ranges, rather than labels.\n\n**Ensuring numeric answers while keeping estimation style**\n\nTo meet the \"numerical answers\" requirement, I'll focus on giving actual and estimated values, both numeric. I'll avoid using non-numeric terms like \"reasonable,\" but include a comparison for estimation. I\u2019ll express inequalities and numeric intervals properly without including non-numeric answers like \"reasonable\" or \"Option A.\"\n\n**Planning the question set and answer structure**\n\nI need to create 40 new questions, making sure to split the total across the topics: 18 for 3.1, 12 for 3.2, and 10 for 3.3. I'll ensure the questions cover key areas like rounding, significant figures, estimation, etc. Each question's answer will be numeric. The user wants a citation included at the bottom, and since I can't create files, the answers will be provided in text. The questions will number and follow the source structure.\n\n**Creating Section 3.1 Questions on Rounding & Significant Figures**\n\nFor Section 3.1, I'll make 18 questions covering significant figures and rounding. I'll design questions like determining significant figures, rounding to given decimal places, and finding the smallest/largest possible values. Some problems will focus on ranges, others on identifying significant digits in given measurements, all with numeric answers.\n\n**Creating Section 3.2 Questions on Approximation**\n\nFor Section 3.2, I'll create 12 questions focusing on approximation and rounding. These will cover scenarios like rounding to nearest 5 cents, calculating maximum occupancy, working with money and tickets, and solving for areas and side lengths. Answers will be numeric, and I'll ensure the rounding aspects are clear and practical.\n\n**Designing Section 3.3 Estimation Questions**\n\nFor Section 3.3 on estimation, I'll create 10 questions focused on computing actual vs. estimated values, currency conversions, and estimating quantities like the number of items. I'll ensure that all answers are numeric, and I'll incorporate practical estimation techniques and rounding where appropriate for things like products, division, and percentages.\n\n**Designing and organizing questions for accuracy**\n\nI\u2019ll craft 40 questions, ensuring accuracy with Python calculations, rounding, and formatting in line with the original document\u2019s style. Sections will have numbered questions starting from 1 within each section, though I may use overall numbering to keep things clearer. I'll maintain the British style of \"Round off\" and \"Correct to,\" and I\u2019ll do my best to replicate the look and pedagogy of the original.\n\n**Determining significant figures and rounding**\n\nLet's work through significant figures and rounding:\n\n(a) 0.004070 has 4 significant figures.  \n(b) 25000 rounded to the nearest 10 has 4 significant figures.  \n(c) 25000 rounded to the nearest 1000 has 2 significant figures.  \n(d) 6.0300 has 5 significant figures.  \n\nFor the second set:\n\n(a) 0.0001200 has 4 significant figures.  \n(b) 12.00 has 4 significant figures.  \n(c) 4800 rounded to nearest 100 has 2 significant figures.  \n(d) 4800 rounded to nearest 10 has 3 significant figures.  \n\nFor rounding:\n\n(a) 0.005049 to 2 s.f. = 0.0050.  \n(b) 72651 to 3 s.f. = 72700.  \n(c) 19.96 to 3 s.f. = 20.0.\n\n**Calculating significant figures and rounding values**\n\nFor rounding numbers:\n\n- 19.96 to 3 s.f becomes 20.0, as 20.0 has 3 significant figures.\n- 0.089995 rounds to 4 significant figures as 0.09000, since trailing zeros after the decimal point are significant.\n\nFor other rounding tasks:\n\n- 74.3956 rounds to 2 decimals = 74.40, 1 decimal = 74.4, weakest unit rounding to nearest whole = 74, nearest 10 = 70.\n- 0.98765 rounds to 3 decimals = 0.988, 2 decimals = 0.99, 1 decimal = 1.0, nearest whole number = 1.\n  \nWhen working with values like 0.0720 and 53.0, the respective ranges based on their significant figures are derived appropriately.\n\n**Rounding and significant figures analysis**\n\n- For rounding, numbers between 471500 and 472499 round to 472000, and numbers starting from 472500 round up to 473000.\n- For 0.099949, rounded to:\n   - 2 s.f becomes 0.10\n   - 3 s.f becomes 0.0999\n   - 4 s.f becomes 0.09995\n- For the number 6.2X4, X must be 3 to make it round to 6.23 at 3 significant figures.\n- Lastly, for 87X2 rounding to 8700 at 2 s.f, X must be between 0-4 to avoid rounding up.\n\n**Ensuring uniqueness in number rounding**\n\nFor question 12, rounding 87X2 to 8700 requires finding an X that ensures divisibility by 9. After calculating, X=1 fits, as the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. I modified the question to guarantee a unique answer, ensuring it holds for the correct rounding and divisibility conditions.\n\nFor subsequent questions, I used similar reasoning to clarify significant figures. The answers showed reasonable precision for each scenario.\n\n**Rounding and calculations for various scenarios**\n\nFor rounding questions, I worked through various examples involving amounts like 728.5, 0.4455, and 12.350, ensuring correct rounding procedures and significant figures.\n\nFor the new set of problems, I created scenarios like calculating the greatest number of items that can be bought with a set amount of money, rounding to the nearest multiple, and measuring or computing areas and perimeters with a focus on accuracy and rounding decisions.\n\n**Finalizing problem set adjustments for 3.2 and 3.3**\n\nI\u2019ve decided on the final set of 3.2 questions, focusing on rounding calculations related to purchases, buses, and rounding percentages, while maintaining a vote percentages question for variety. I also need to include estimation tasks in 3.3, making sure all answers are numeric. For example, I'll ask for estimations in multiplication problems, using numeric answers to determine reasonableness rather than making it non-numeric.\n\n**Planning 3.3 Estimation Problems and Key Answers**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on crafting estimation problems with numeric answers, as the user requested. For each problem, I\u2019ll ask for estimated values, actual values, and differences as needed. This will include tasks such as basic multiplication and division estimates, currency conversion, and values for money. I\u2019ll calculate everything carefully and ensure precise rounding.\n\n**Computing and verifying Section 3.1 answers**\n\nI\u2019ll work on the Section 3.1 answers, carefully checking rounding and formatting for significant figures and decimal places. I could compute manually, but it\u2019s better to create functions to handle rounding and range boundaries automatically to ensure accuracy. I'll verify everything to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Computing and verifying Q3 values**\n\nI think it\u2019s better to compute the numeric values first, then decide how to represent them properly. For example, part c of Q3: 19.96 rounds to 3 significant figures as 20.0, which looks good. I\u2019ll go ahead and verify Q3 to ensure everything checks out.\n\n**Addressing rounding and formatting**\n\nAh, for rounding to show 2 significant figures, 0.005 should be displayed as 0.0050, and 0.09 should be 0.09000 for consistency. For 0.09 with 4 s.f., it will be 0.09000, but the actual value remains 0.09. I\u2019ll handle formatting. Now, let\u2019s compute Q4 and check Q10 rounding: 0.099949.\n\n**Computing Section 3.2**\n\nI\u2019ll start with the square area: for 157 cm\u00b2, the side length is the square root of 157. Then, I'll compute the circle radius area, vote percentages, and garden calculations. Let's go ahead and run some quick computations for these, ensuring everything matches and is properly detailed.\n\n**Computing circle values**\n\nFor the square, I rounded the side to 12.5 and perimeter to 50.1, which seems good. Now, for the circle: given a circumference of 75 m, I can calculate the radius as 75 divided by 2\u03c0. Then, I'll compute the area using the formula \u03c0r\u00b2. Let's get those values.\n\n**Verifying roundings and percentages**\n\nI calculated the radius as 11.9 (rounded from 11.936) and found the area to be 448 m\u00b2 after rounding 447.623 to 3 significant figures. Since 447 rounds up to 448, it\u2019s correct. Now, I\u2019ll compute vote percentages based on the total of 259, rounding each to 1 decimal point. Let\u2019s start.\n\n**Testing vote percentage rounding**\n\nFor the votes 121, 94, and 86, the total is 301. I\u2019ll compute the rounded percentages: 121/301 is about 40.2%, 94/301 is about 31.2%, and 86/301 is about 28.6%. These should sum to exactly 100% when rounded, but I\u2019m curious if there is any rounding mismatch happening.\n\n**Finding appropriate vote numbers**\n\nI need three candidates with a total of 301, and the rounded percentages should sum to 99.9 or 100.1. I can try numbers like 124, 89, and 88 or similar, avoiding extremes like 50. Aiming for more moderate values will help create a specific rounding mismatch, as advised in the document.\n\n**Adjusting values for a sum near 100.1**\n\nI'm considering values like 159, or combinations like 101, 100, and 100 to get percentages around 33.6 each, aiming for a sum close to 100.1. Let's try finding values that fit that sum, while also keeping the numbers balanced and realistic for the calculations.\n\n**Selecting more balanced numbers for the sum**\n\nThe combination of 61, 89, and 151 works out with percentages of 20.3, 29.6, and 50.2, totaling 100.1, which isn't too off. But 61 might feel a bit small. Let's try numbers like 118, 93, and 90, with a total of 301, and check if the percentages sum properly.\n\n**Designing the question setup**\n\nThe previous set of votes (80, 86, 135) summed to 301 and yielded percentages of 26.6%, 28.6%, and 44.9%, giving a total of 100.1, which works well. Now, focusing on Section 3.3, I\u2019ll calculate the correct answer\u2014802 x 24 equals 19,248. But for variety, we might want to introduce a mistake, so 18,924 might serve better for that.\n\n**Designing a problem with calculator errors**\n\nI should create problems where the calculator display contains a typo or small mistake. For example, when asking the user to estimate or compute, I can ask for both the estimated value and the actual value. For one problem, the calculator might display 18,924 for 802 \u00d7 24\u2014let's compute the difference (324). For others, such as 246 \u00f7 52, the approximation of 4.9 will be compared to the precise 4.730769, showing a difference of 0.17. For a third problem, I\u2019ll pick an estimate like 7200 \u00f7 120 = 60.\n\n**Designing estimation problems**\n\nI'll create several estimation problems. For example, for 7380 \u00f7 123, I\u2019ll ask them to estimate without a calculator, with an approximate result of 60. I'll also use simpler approximations like 800 \u00d7 0.5 = 400 for a second problem, and in currency conversion, I\u2019ll round $58 at a 1.35 rate to estimate $81. Each problem will involve simple arithmetic, ensuring clarity in the method.\n\n**Designing estimation problems with approximate answers**\n\nFor currency conversions, I'll estimate S$78 for 58*1.35 and round to the nearest dollar. Similarly, for Euro conversions, I'll estimate S$50 for 34*1.46. For value comparisons, I\u2019ll show price per kilogram, and for counting beans and coins, I'll estimate totals. Lastly, for percentages, I\u2019ll calculate the ratio and round to one decimal place.\n\n**Maintaining numeric answers and preserving style**\n\nI'll use only numeric answers, including percentages with the percent sign, as the user requested. Answers from sections like value for money, reasoning, or estimating will be in numeric form (e.g., 1 for \"reasonable\", 2 for \"better value\"), sticking to the styling of the original questions while ensuring the answers stay numeric, as per user preferences.\n\n**Adjusting questions and maintaining numeric answers**\n\nTo preserve style, it's fine to use numeric codes for reasonableness checks, such as \"1\" or \"0\", for answers. In question 3.3-1, I'll ask if the calculator display is reasonable and have them answer with a code. For estimation, I'll keep everything numeric, ensuring no explanation is needed, as the user requested questions with just numeric answers.\n\n**Revising question numbers and ensuring new values**\n\nI need to make sure all the numbers in the questions are new and not repeated from previous exercises. For example, I realized that 0.004070 is used in the document, so I\u2019ll swap it for something like 0.005060. Similarly, I\u2019ll change 0.099949 to 0.079995 to keep things fresh.\n\n**Deciding on new values and rounding rules**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to round and choosing fresh numbers. For instance, 0.049994 rounds nicely to 2 s.f. as 0.050, and to 3 s.f. as 0.0500. While this works, I'm mindful not to repeat past numbers like 0.01995 in the doc. I\u2019ll choose 0.049994 for new questions, and ensure good rounding consistency.\n\n**Finalizing number formatting and choosing new values**\n\nI need to ensure that numbers like 0.05 for 2 s.f. are formatted as 0.050, and 0.0500 for 3 s.f. I\u2019ll use 0.04999 for 4 s.f. since it\u2019s not in the docs. 0.005060 works for Q1 now. I\u2019ve also checked for duplicates, finding that 472000 is fine to use as it doesn\u2019t appear in the doc.\n\n**Creating new values and checking for duplicates**\n\nI've updated values to avoid duplication. For example, we changed square areas from 157 to 178,264, and purchase costs from $20 with $2.45 to new values. I also ensured new numbers for buses, packs, cartons, occupancy, and load. There was some overlap in exchange rates, but adjustments were made.\n\n**Reviewing currency conversions and estimates**\n\nFor currency conversions, I\u2019ve decided to use consistent rates, like 1.35 for both US$32.45 and US$58. Even though they might feel repetitive, the approximations are still valid. For Section 3.3, I\u2019ll adjust calculations to include reasonableness checks. For example, using estimations in Question 3.3-1, I'll confirm the answer is reasonable.\n\n**Estimating and checking calculations in 3.3**\n\nFor questions in Section 3.3, I'm estimating and providing rounded answers. For example, in 3.3-2, estimating 246 \u00f7 52 as 250 \u00f7 50 gives a reasonable check, leading to a final value of 4.73. Similarly, I've estimated prices and rounded appropriately for questions about backpack and phone case conversions.\n\n**Completing calculations and formatting properly**\n\nI need to compute answers for different sections, like finding costs per kg, estimating beans, and coins, and checking ratios. For formatting, I'll make sure to follow the appropriate guidelines: using spaces for thousands separators, showing trailing zeros for decimals, and handling significant figures like 0.0050 correctly.\n\n**Clarifying rounding and formatting rules**\n\nI\u2019m carefully rounding numbers to the appropriate significant figures (s.f.), deciding on things like whether to include spaces for thousands and how many decimal places are needed. For example, 0.049994 rounds to 0.050 for 2 s.f., 0.0500 for 3 s.f., and stays at 0.04999 for 4 s.f.\n\n**Rounding and calculation review**\n\nFor rounding, I am carefully considering the specified decimal places. For example, 1.86 tonnes rounds down to 1.8 tonnes, and when calculating the side length of the square, I rounded 12.529 cm to 12.5 cm (to 3 significant figures) and checked the perimeter accordingly.\n\n**Verification of calculations and estimations**\n\nI'm going to carefully review calculations like the diameter and area of the circle, rounding to the indicated precision (e.g., 3 significant figures). For the population, rounding to 1 significant figure gives the range from 850,000 to 949,999. I'll also check estimates like \"800\u00d720 = 16,000\" to ensure they align appropriately.\n\n**Handling currency rounding**\n\nTo answer the exchange rate question, I\u2019ll follow the method of rounding to the nearest dollar, as indicated by the examples. For instance, for US$58 at an exchange rate of 1.35, I\u2019ll get 78.3, which rounds to 78. Similarly, for \u20ac28 at 1.46, it gives 41 when rounded.\n\n**Ensuring consistency in question format**\n\nI\u2019ll make sure the 40 questions are phrased clearly but consistently, following the same style. Each question will be similar in structure, using precise language like \"State the number of significant figures\" or \"Round off to the number of significant figures.\" I'll remember to keep notation consistent, use units, and avoid unnecessary explanations or examples.\n\n**Providing questions and answers, following instructions carefully**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on providing just the questions and numerical answers, following the format prescribed. Everything will be concise\u2014no extra explanations. Estimation answers will use the \u201c\u2248\u201d sign, reasonableness will be given numerically (0/1), and inequalities/ranges will follow numeric formats. The citations will be included at the end, as instructed.
