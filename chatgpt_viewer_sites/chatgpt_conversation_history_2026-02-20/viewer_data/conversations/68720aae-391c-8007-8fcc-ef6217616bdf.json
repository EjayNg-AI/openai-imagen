It is the bridge that lets one turn abstractly defined functors\u2014often given by universal properties\u2014into honest morphism sets out of a single object, enabling constructions such as adjoints, twists, and localisations.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Historical Context & Intuition\n* **Classical origin (1962).**  Brown\u2019s original theorem was stated for the stable homotopy category of CW complexes, showing that any reduced co-homology theory is represented by a spectrum.  \n* **Triangulated generalisation (Verdier \u2192 Neeman).**  Verdier\u2019s derived categories and the localisation machinery of the 1970s suggested a wider scope.  In the 1990s Neeman formulated and proved modern versions for *compactly generated* triangulated categories, eventually refining them to \u201cwell-generated\u201d ones.\n\nIntuitively, compact objects play the role of finite CW complexes in Brown\u2019s original proof: they detect maps and give a set of *test objects* whose behaviour controls the whole category.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Setting & Notation\n* \\(\\mathcal T\\) is a triangulated category with suspensions \\(\\Sigma\\) and distinguished triangles.  \n* It admits arbitrary (set-indexed) coproducts.  \n* **Compacts.**  \\(x\\in\\mathcal T\\) is *compact* if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal T}(x,\\,\\coprod_i y_i)\\cong \\coprod_i\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal T}(x,y_i)\\).  \n* **Compact generation.**  A set \\(\\mathcal G\\subset\\mathcal T^{c}\\) of compacts *generates* if the smallest localising subcategory containing \\(\\mathcal G\\) equals \\(\\mathcal T\\).  We then say \\(\\mathcal T\\) is *compactly generated*.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Two Theorems\n\n### 3.1  Covariant (Homological) Version  \nLet \\(\\mathcal T\\) be compactly generated.  A functor  \n\\[\nF\\colon \\mathcal T^{\\mathrm{op}}\\to \\mathbf{Ab}\n\\]\nis **homological** (takes triangles to long exact sequences) and sends *coproducts* in \\(\\mathcal T\\) to *products* in \\(\\mathbf{Ab}\\).  \n\n> **Brown Representability (Neeman, 1996).**  \n> Under those two conditions, \\(F\\) is *representable*: \\(\\exists X\\in\\mathcal T\\) with a natural isomorphism  \n> \\[\n> F(-)\\;\\cong\\;\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal T}(-,X).\n> \\]\n\n### 3.2  Contravariant (Co-homological) Version  \nDually, if \\(\\mathcal T\\) has *products* and is *perfectly co-compactly generated*, every contravariant functor that is co-homological and sends products to products is representable by an object of \\(\\mathcal T\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Sketch of the Proof (Covariant Case)\n\n1. **Restricted Yoneda.**  Consider the category of additive functors \\(\\mathcal A=\\mathbf{Add}(\\mathcal T^{c,\\mathrm{op}},\\mathbf{Ab})\\).  Yoneda embeds \\(\\mathcal T\\) fully faithfully in \\(\\mathcal A\\) by \\(Y\\colon x\\mapsto\\operatorname{Hom}(-,x)\\).\n2. **Exactness & filtration.**  Homological functors satisfying coproduct-product condition correspond to *exact*, *filtered-colimit-preserving* objects in \\(\\mathcal A\\).\n3. **Freyd\u2019s adjoint functor theorem.**  Using completeness of \\(\\mathcal A\\) and solution-set conditions provided by compact generation, one constructs a left adjoint \\(L\\) to the inclusion \\(Y(\\mathcal T)\\hookrightarrow\\mathcal A\\).\n4. **Representability.**  Apply \\(L\\) to \\(F\\), yielding \\(L(F)\\in\\mathcal T\\) with \\(F\\cong Y(LF)=\\operatorname{Hom}(-,LF)\\).\n\nThe delicacy lies in verifying the solution-set condition\u2014compact generators give the smallness needed.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Typical Examples\n\n| Category \\(\\mathcal T\\)                         | Generators                                          | Brown representability? | Notes |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------|\n| **Stable homotopy category** \\( \\operatorname{SH}\\) | Spheres \\(S^n\\) (finite CW)                         | \u2714\ufe0e (classical Brown)    | Gives Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane spectra, etc. |\n| **Derived category** \\(D(R)\\) of a ring \\(R\\)   | \\(R\\) viewed as complex concentrated in degree 0    | \u2714\ufe0e                      | Leads to existence of \\(\\operatorname{RHom}\\) adjoints. |\n| **\\(D_{\\text{qc}}(X)\\)** for scheme \\(X\\)       | Perfect complexes when \\(X\\) is quasi-compact & sep.| \u2714\ufe0e (Neeman)             | Key for Grothendieck duality. |\n| **\\(K(\\mathcal A)\\)** for many abelian \\(\\mathcal A\\) | Not compactly generated unless \\(\\mathcal A\\) Grothendieck | \u2716\ufe0e generally            | Failure pinpoints need for coproducts detection. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Consequences & Applications\n\n### 6.1  Existence of Adjoints  \nIf \\(F\\colon\\mathcal T\\to\\mathcal S\\) preserves coproducts and \\(\\mathcal S\\) is compactly generated, \\(F\\) has a *right adjoint* \\(G\\) (representability applied to \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal S}(F(-),y)\\)).\n\n### 6.2  t-Structures and Hearts  \nRepresentability ensures that truncation functors and co-homologies determined by a t-structure are representable; crucial in constructing derived categories of sheaves.\n\n### 6.3  Bousfield Localisation  \nGiven a set of maps \\(S\\), localisation functors \\(L_S\\) exist because the kernel of \\(L_S\\) is defined by homological conditions; BRT gives an actual object representing the localisation.\n\n### 6.4  Phantom Maps & Nilpotence  \nIn homotopy theory, BRT implies that co-homological phantom maps out of compact objects vanish, feeding into Nilpotence/Thick Subcategory Theorems (Devinatz\u2013Hopkins\u2013Smith).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Limitations & Counter-Examples\n* **Non-compactly generated categories.**  The homotopy category of chain complexes \\(K(\\mathbf{Ab})\\) fails Brown representability: there exist homological functors preserving coproducts that are not representable (Benson\u2013Bridges examples).  \n* **Set-theoretic size issues.**  Without smallness hypotheses (well-generated vs. locally presentable), solution-set fails.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Related Strengthenings\n\n| Author | Statement |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **Neeman (2001).** | Brown representability holds for any *well-generated* triangulated category (uses inaccessible cardinals). |\n| **Krause (2000s).** | *Pure-derived* versions; links to locally finitely presented additive categories. |\n| **Lurie (Higher Alg).** | \\((\\infty,1)\\)-categorical analogue: presentable stable \\(\\infty\\)-categories are precisely those admitting Brown representability. |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Dual Brown Representability & Grothendieck Duality\nOn the *other* side, if \\(\\mathcal T\\) has products and is compactly **co**-generated, *contravariant* functors sending products to products are representable.  For derived categories of schemes, this is the engine behind existence of *Serre\u2013Grothendieck dualizing complexes* and right adjoints to derived push-forwards.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Open Directions & Research Frontiers\n\n| Theme | Question |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Exotic Generators.** | Can one classify triangulated categories that fail Brown precisely in terms of their generator size? |\n| **Tensor-Triangulated Geometry.** | How does Brown representability interact with Balmer\u2019s spectrum and classification of thick ideals? |\n| **Motivic & Equivariant Worlds.** | Extending compact generation and Brown representability to motivic homotopy categories over general bases, or to equivariant spectra for large compact Lie groups. |\n| **\u221e-categorical Enhancements.** | Relating Neeman\u2019s set-theoretic conditions to presentability in the \\(\\infty\\)-categorical sense, clarifying when the triangulated shadow suffices. |\n| **Non-stable Enhancements.** | Analogues for *derivators* and *stable derivators*, understanding representability beyond triangulated structure. |\n\n---\n\n## 11.

Its validity hinges on having enough compact generators (or their duals).  In modern homotopy-theoretic and derived-geometric practice, BRT is the foundational tool ensuring adjoints, localisations, and dualities exist\u2014while its failures illuminate the boundaries of what triangulated categories can do."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"614741d7-9557-49fe-b704-e0a9ef5b34c0","request_id":"95deba5febfea071-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"614741d7-9557-49fe-b704-e0a9ef5b34c0","children":["c077d5f2-5bdf-4fae-b4fa-78b3fea93543"]},"c077d5f2-5bdf-4fae-b4fa-78b3fea93543":{"id":"c077d5f2-5bdf-4fae-b4fa-78b3fea93543","message":{"id":"c077d5f2-5bdf-4fae-b4fa-78b3fea93543","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752304831.993,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Does there exist an equivalent theorem at the level of model categories and their localizations?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95dec7579e9d9c1a-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9a99582d-b437-41c4-8f33-e7ece54b158f","children":["765d2545-6f72-4d31-abe1-a92a75da838c"]},"765d2545-6f72-4d31-abe1-a92a75da838c":{"id":"765d2545-6f72-4d31-abe1-a92a75da838c","message":{"id":"765d2545-6f72-4d31-abe1-a92a75da838c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752304845.441325,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering Brown Representability at Model Category Level","content":"The user\u2019s question leads me to explore analogues of Brown representability in model categories and their localizations.

The property even survives any left Bousfield localisation of such a model structure.  In the \u221e-categorical upgrade this is automatic for every *presentable stable* \u221e-category.\n\nBelow is a detailed map of the landscape, the precise hypotheses, why they are needed, how the proof works, and what breaks down outside those hypotheses.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  From triangulated to model categories \u2014 what has to change?\n\n| Aspect | Triangulated set-up | Model-categorical replacement |\n|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Ambient structure | Triangulated category \\(\\mathcal T\\) with coproducts | Complete & cocomplete **model category** \\(\\mathcal M\\) |\n| \u201cCompact\u201d objects | Objects whose Hom preserves coproducts | **Homotopy compact** objects of \\(\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathcal M)\\) |\n| Smallness condition | \\(\\mathcal T\\) is *compactly / well generated* | \\(\\mathcal M\\) is **combinatorial** (locally presentable + cofibrantly generated) and **stable** |\n| Represented functors | \\(\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathcal T}(-,X)\\) | \\([-,X]_{\\mathcal M} := \\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathcal M)(-,X)\\) |\n\nA *stable* model category already guarantees that \\(\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathcal M)\\) is triangulated; making it **combinatorial** supplies the smallness/solution-set conditions needed to run Freyd-style arguments.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The main theorem (Rosick\u00fd, Raptis, Dugger \u2026)\n\n> **Brown representability for stable combinatorial model categories.**  \n> Let \\(\\mathcal M\\) be **stable**, **left-proper**, and **combinatorial**.  \n> Then every functor  \n> \\[\n> F : \\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathcal M)^{\\mathrm{op}}\\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\mathbf{Ab}\n> \\]\n> that  \n> 1. is **homological** (sends distinguished triangles to long exact sequences), and  \n> 2. takes **(small) homotopy coproducts to products**  \n> is representable, i.e. \\(F \\cong [\\,-\\,,\\,X]\\) for some \\(X\\in \\mathcal M\\).  \n> The dual statement holds for contravariant/product-preserving functors when \\(\\mathcal M\\) is also right-proper.\n\n*Proof skeleton.*  \nRosick\u00fd showed that for any combinatorial stable \\(\\mathcal M\\) the homotopy category is **well generated** \u2014 a weakening of compact generation sufficient for Neeman\u2019s triangulated Brown theorem \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201.  Plugging that into Neeman\u2019s machinery yields representability.  Raptis\u2019 notes distil the argument into a purely model-categorical proof and record it as **Theorem 5.1** \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  A model-categorical adjoint functor theorem  \n\nBecause representability characterises left adjoints, Raptis immediately obtains:\n\n> **Homotopical adjoint functor theorem (Theorem 5.3).**  \n> If \\(F:\\mathcal M\\!\\to\\!\\mathcal N\\) preserves weak equivalences and \\(\\mathcal M\\) is stable+combinatorial, then \\(\\mathrm{Ho}(F)\\) has a right adjoint **iff** it preserves homotopy coproducts and homotopy push-outs \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201.\n\nThis is the Brown theorem \u201cup-stairs\u201d in Quillen language: it tells you exactly when a derived functor is part of a Quillen adjunction.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Behaviour under Bousfield localisation  \n\nLeft Bousfield localisation at a set \\(S\\) of maps keeps all three crucial properties:\n\n* left properness,  \n* combinatoriality, and  \n* stability (if \\(\\mathcal M\\) was stable).  \n\nHence \\(L_S\\mathcal M\\) again satisfies Brown representability (Raptis Theorem 5.5 and the paragraph that follows) \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201.\n\n**Practical upshot.**  Whenever you localise spectra, chain complexes, motivic spectra, equivariant spectra, \u2026 by inverting a set of morphisms, you do **not** lose the adjoint-existence/representability machinery.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Relation to \u221e-categories  \n\nDugger, Barwick, Gepner\u2013Haugseng\u2013Nikolaus and Lurie show that a stable combinatorial model category presents a **presentable stable (\u221e,1)-category**.  \nLurie\u2019s Higher Algebra, Thm 1.4.4.1, proves Brown representability for *every* presentable stable \u221e-category \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201, thereby subsuming the model-categorical statement.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  What if the hypotheses fail?\n\n| Missing ingredient | Typical counter-example | What goes wrong |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| Stability | Ordinary (pointed) model category of spaces | \\(\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathcal M)\\) not triangulated, homology functors need not be representable |\n| Combinatoriality (local presentability) | \\(K(\\mathbf{Ab})\\) with projective model structure | Functor fails solution-set condition; Brown fails \ue200cite\ue202turn5search5\ue201 |\n| Enough compact generators | Some huge derived categories of Grothendieck rings | Natural transformations exist that do not come from maps (failure of Adams representability) |\n\nSo the hypotheses are close to optimal: each one kills a classical obstruction.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Consequences and applications\n\n1. **Function-object existence** \u2013 if \\(\\mathcal M\\) is symmetric-monoidal and stable combinatorial, the internal Hom is representable; hence mapping spectra exist without extra axioms.  \n2. **Automatic right adjoints** \u2013 any homotopy-colimit preserving functor out of such an \\(\\mathcal M\\) has a right derived adjoint (crucial for Grothendieck duality, smashing localisations, etc.).  \n3. **Localisation theory** \u2013 the telescope conjecture, smashing vs. finite localisations, and the study of Bousfield lattices all exploit Brown representability to move between functors and objects.  \n4. **Enrichments** \u2013 Dugger\u2019s spectral enrichment theorem uses combinatoriality to build endomorphism ring-spectra functorially; Brown guarantees these enrichments behave well under localisation.\n\n---\n\n## 8.

Two mechanisms make this rigorous:\n\n| Mechanism | Reason cofibrant generation can be dropped |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Well-generated \u21d2 Brown.**  Neeman\u2019s theorem says every well-generated triangulated category satisfies Brown representability, with no reference to models \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201. So if you can prove *Ho(M)* is well-generated by any other route, Brown follows. |\n| **Quillen invariance.**  \u201cSatisfies Brown\u2019\u2019 is preserved under Quillen equivalence \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201.  Hence a *non-cofibrantly generated* model category inherits Brown representability as soon as it is Quillen equivalent to some stable combinatorial one. |\n\n---\n\n### 3  Examples and counter-examples  \n\n| Model category | Cofibrantly generated? | Brown representability? | Explanation |\n|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| **Str\u00f8m** model structure on based spaces | **No** (small object argument fails) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 | **Yes** | Quillen equivalent to Quillen\u2019s (combinatorial) model of spaces, so inherits Brown by invariance. |\n| **Hurewicz** model structure on chain complexes of abelian groups | **No** (not combinatorial) | **Fails** | *Ho* = *K(Ab)* is **not** well-generated; Benson\u2013Bridges construct homological functors that are not representable. |\n| Any **left Bousfield localisation** of a combinatorial stable model category | May lose cofibrant generation, but still Brown | Brown follows from the combinatorial model via localisation theorem \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201. |\n\nTake-away: **Cofibrant generation is not logically necessary**, but without it there is no automatic guarantee\u2014one must supply (i) a Quillen equivalence to a combinatorial model, or (ii) an independent proof that *Ho(M)* is well-generated.\n\n---\n\n### 4  What we actually need and open terrain  \n\n1. **Local presentability** without cofibrant generation might suffice.  \n   *Suppose* a stable model structure sits on a locally presentable category *and* admits functorial (co)fibrant replacement accessible in cardinality.  Rosick\u00fd conjectures that this should still force *Ho(M)* to be well-generated; the general case is open.  \n\n2. **Non-presentable underlying categories.**  \n   There are stable model categories (e.g. certain pro-spectra) whose underlying category is **not** locally presentable and not known to admit a combinatorial replacement.  Whether Brown holds there is an active question.\n\n3. **\u221e-categorical viewpoint.**  \n   Lurie proves that every **presentable stable \u221e-category** satisfies Brown representability automatically \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.  Presentability is the \u221e-categorical analogue of \u201clocally presentable\u201d, again independent of cofibrant generation.\n\n---\n\n### 5  Practical checklist  \n\nWhen you face a new stable model category **M** and want Brown representability:\n\n| If \u2026 | Then \u2026 |\n|------|--------|\n| **M is combinatorial** | You are done (Rosick\u00fd\u2013Raptis). |\n| **M is Quillen equivalent to some combinatorial N** | You are done; transfer the property. |\n| **Ho(M)** is proven well-generated by other means | You are done (Neeman). |\n| None of the above | Cofibrant generation is not formally required, but you must still find a route to well-generatedness; without it Brown may fail. |\n\n---\n\n### 6  Bottom line  \n\n*Being cofibrantly generated is a **workhorse** assumption\u2014vastly convenient because it packages the set-theoretic smallness that Brown\u2019s proof needs.  But it is **not a mathematical necessity**.  What matters is the existence of enough compact (or \u03bb-compact) objects in the homotopy category, and cofibrant generation is just one robust way\u2014though not the only way\u2014to get them.*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":821,"end_idx":840,"safe_urls":["https://www.math.muni.cz/~rosicky/papers/brown4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Math Muni](https://www.math.muni.cz/~rosicky/papers/brown4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Generalized Brown representability in homotopy category - Math MUNI","url":"https://www.math.muni.cz/~rosicky/papers/brown4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1259280000.0,"snippet":"JIR\u00cd ROSICK\u00dd\u2217.
