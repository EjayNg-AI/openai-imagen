Happy to do this with you.\r\n\r\nSAM ALTMAN: Excited to do it again.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Now, the last two months or so, there have been so many deals involving OpenAI, and I\u2019m not even talking about the globetrotting. A lot of them are local, or there\u2019s new product features such as Pulse. Presumably, you were productive, to begin with. How is it that you managed to up your productivity to get all this done?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one single takeaway other than I think people almost never allocate their time as well as they think they do. As you have more demands and more opportunities, you find ways to continue to be more efficient. We\u2019ve been able to hire and promote great people, and I delegate a lot to them and get them to take stuff on. That is the only sustainable way I know how to do it.\r\n\r\nI do try to make sure we increasingly, as what we need to do comes into focus\u200a\u2014\u200aand there\u2019s, as you mentioned, a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built out right now\u200a\u2014\u200aI do try to make sure I understand what the core thing for us to do is. It has, in some sense, simplified, and it\u2019s very clear what we need to do. That\u2019s been helpful. I don\u2019t really know. I guess another thing that\u2019s happened is more of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate.\r\n\r\nOn hiring hardware people\r\nCOWEN: You\u2019re doing much more with hardware or matters that are hardware-adjacent. How is hiring or delegating to a good hardware person different from hiring good AI people, which is what you started off doing?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: You mean consumer devices or chips?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Both.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: One thing that\u2019s different is that cycle times are much longer. The capital is more intense. The cost of screen up is higher, so I like to spend more time getting to know the people before saying, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re just going to do this, and I\u2019ll trust that it\u2019ll work out.\u201d Otherwise the theory is the same. You try to find good, effective, fast-moving people. Get clear on what the goal is and just let them go do it.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: I visited Nvidia earlier this year. They were great. They were great to me. They\u2019re super smart, but it just felt so different from walking the floor of OpenAI. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been to Nvidia. People read Twitter less. At least on the surface, they\u2019re less weird. What is that intangible difference in the hardware world that one has to grasp to do well in it?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Look, I don\u2019t know if this is going to turn out to be a good sign or a bad sign, but our chip team feels more like the OpenAI research team than a chip company. I think it might work out phenomenally well.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You\u2019re extending the model\u200a\u2014\r\n\r\nALTMAN: We are.\r\n\r\nCOWEN:\u200a\u2014\u200aof your previous hires to hardware.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: With some risk, but we are.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: There\u2019s this fellow on Twitter. His name is roon. He\u2019s become quite well known. What is it that makes roon special to you?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: He\u2019s like a very lateral thinker. You can start down one path and jump somewhere completely else, but keep going down, stay on the same trajectory, but in some very different context that\u2019s unusual. He\u2019s great at phrasing observations in an interesting, useful, whatever way, and that makes him fun and quite useful to talk to. I don\u2019t know. He brings together a lot of skills that don\u2019t often exist in one person\u2019s head.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: How does that shape what you have him work on? You see this about him, and then you think, \u201cAh, roon should do X.\u201d\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I very rarely get to have anybody work on anything. One thing about researchers is they\u2019re going to work on what they\u2019re going to work on, and that\u2019s that.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Someone put an essay online, and it said, in all the time they worked at OpenAI, they hardly ever sent or received an email, that so many things were done over Slack. Why is that? What\u2019s your model of why email is bad and Slack is good for OpenAI?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I\u2019ll agree, email is bad. I don\u2019t know if Slack is good. I suspect it\u2019s not. I think email is very bad. The threshold to make something better than email is not high, and I think Slack is better than email. We have a lot of things going on at the same time, as you observed, and we have to do things extremely quickly. It\u2019s definitely a very fast-moving organization. There are positives about Slack, but there\u2019s also, I dread the first hour of the morning, the last hour before I go to bed, where I\u2019m just dealing with this explosion of Slack, and I think it does create a lot of fake work.\r\n\r\nI suspect there is something new to build that is going to replace a lot of the current office, productivity suite, whatever you think of docs, slides, email, Slack, whatever, that will be the AI-driven version of all of these things, not where you tack on the horrible\u200a\u2014\u200ayou accidentally click the wrong place and it tries to write a whole document for you or summarize some thread or whatever, but the actual version of you are trusting your AI agent and my AI agent to work most stuff out and escalate to us when necessary. I think there is probably finally a good solution for someone to make within reach.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: How far are you from having that internally? Maybe not a product for the whole world, that it\u2019s in every way tested, but that you would use it within OpenAI?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Very far, but I suspect just because we haven\u2019t made any effort to try, not because the models are that far away.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Since talent, time, human capital is so valuable within your company, why shouldn\u2019t that be a priority?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Probably we should do it, but people get stuck in their own ways of doing things, and a lot of stuff is going very well right now, so there\u2019s a lot of activation energy for a big new thing.\r\n\r\nOn what GPT-6 will enable\r\nCOWEN: What is it about GPT-6 that makes that special to you?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: If GPT-3 was the first moment where you saw a glimmer of something that felt like the spiritual Turing test getting passed, GPT-5 is the first moment where you see a glimmer of AI doing new science. It\u2019s very tiny things, but here and there someone\u2019s posting like, \u201cOh, it figured this thing out,\u201d or \u201cOh, it came up with this new idea,\u201d or \u201cOh, it was a useful collaborator on this paper.\u201d There is a chance that GPT-6 will be a GPT-3 to 4-like leap that happened for Turing test-like stuff for science, where 5 has these tiny glimmers and 6 can really do it.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Let\u2019s say I run a science lab, and I know GPT-6 is coming. What should I be doing now to prepare for that?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: It\u2019s always a very hard question. Even if you know this thing is coming, if you adapt your\u200a\u2014\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Let\u2019s say I even had it now, right? What exactly would I do the next morning?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I guess the first thing you would do is just type in the current research questions you\u2019re struggling with, and maybe it\u2019ll say, \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d or \u201cRun this experiment,\u201d or \u201cGo do this other thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nCOWEN: If I\u2019m thinking about restructuring an entire organization to have GPT-6 or 7 or whatever at the center of it, what is it I should be doing organizationally, rather than just having all my top people use it as add-ons to their current stock of knowledge?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I\u2019ve thought about this more for the context of companies than scientists, just because I understand that better. I think it\u2019s a very important question. Right now, I have met some orgs that are really saying, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to adopt AI and let AI do this.\u201d I\u2019m very interested in this, because shame on me if OpenAI is not the first big company run by an AI CEO, right?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Just parts of it. Not the whole thing.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: No, the whole thing.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: That\u2019s very ambitious. Just the finance department, whatever.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Well, but eventually it should get to the whole thing, right? So we can use this and then try to work backwards from that. I find this a very interesting thought experiment of what would have to happen for an AI CEO to be able to do a much better job of running OpenAI than me, which clearly will happen someday. How can we accelerate that? What\u2019s in the way of that? I have found that to be a super useful thought experiment for how we design our org over time and what the other pieces and roadblocks will be. I assume someone running a science lab should try to think the same way, and they\u2019ll come to different conclusions.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: How far off do you think it is that just, say, one division of OpenAI is 85 percent run by AIs?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Any single division?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Not a tiny, insignificant division, mostly run by the AIs.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Some small single-digit number of years, not very far. When do you think I can be like, \u201cOkay, Mr. AI CEO, you take over\u201d?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: CEO is tricky because the public role of a CEO, as you know, becomes more and more important.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Let\u2019s say if I can pretend to be a politician, which is not my natural strength, an AI can do it, too. Let\u2019s say I stay involved for the public-facing whatever. Just actually making the good decisions, figuring out what to do.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: I think you\u2019ll have billion-dollar companies run by two or three people with AIs, I don\u2019t know, two and a half years. I used to think one year, but maybe I\u2019ve put it off a bit. I\u2019m not more pessimistic about the AI. Maybe I\u2019m more pessimistic about the humans. What\u2019s your forecast?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I agree on all of those counts. I think the AI can do it sooner than that. I think this is a good thing for society and a good thing for the future, not a bad one. People have a great deal higher trust in other people over an AI, even if they shouldn\u2019t, even if that\u2019s irrational. The AI doctor is better, but you want the human, whatever. I think it may take much longer for society to get really comfortable with this and for people in the organization to get really comfortable with this. On the actual decision-making for most things, maybe the AI is pretty good pretty soon.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You\u2019re hiring a lot of smart people. Do you ask yourself, \u201cWhat are the markers of how AI-resistant this very smart person will be?\u201d Do you have an implicit mental test for that, or you just hire smart people and hope it\u2019s all going to work out later?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: No, I do ask questions about that.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: People will just lie, right? They know they\u2019re talking to OpenAI. What do you actually look for in them?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: A big one is how they use AI today. The people who still are like, \u201cOh, yes, I\u2019d use it for better Google search and nothing else,\u201d that\u2019s not necessarily a disqualifier, but that\u2019s like a yellow flag. People who are seriously considering what their day-to-day is going to look like in three years, that\u2019s a green flag. A lot of people aren\u2019t. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, yes, probably it\u2019s going to be really smart.\u201d\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you think scientific labs might get GPT-6 this year?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Not this year.\r\n\r\nOn government backstops for AI companies\r\nCOWEN: Not this year. Here\u2019s a very difficult question. As you know, both you and I were fans of nuclear power, but we also know, the insurance for nuclear power plants is provided by the government. The plants might be quite safe, but people worry. They\u2019re Nervous Nellies. There\u2019s a lot of parties involved. The federal government does the insurance. Do you worry that the future holds the same for AI companies, or the Feds are your insurer, and how do you plan for that? Again, even if AI is pretty safe, as with nuclear power, people are Nervous Nellies. How will you insure everything?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: At some level, when something gets sufficiently huge, whether or not they are on paper, the federal government is kind of the insurer of last resort, as we\u2019ve seen in various financial crises and insurance companies screwing things up. I guess, given the magnitude of what I expect AI economic impact to look like, I do think the government ends up as the insurer of last resort, but I think I mean that in a different way than you mean that, and I don\u2019t expect them to actually be writing the policies in the way that maybe they do for nuclear.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: There\u2019s a big difference between the government being the insurer of last resort and the insurer of first resort. Last resort\u2019s inevitable, but I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll become the insurer of first resort, and that I don\u2019t want.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t want that either. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what will happen.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: What we\u2019re seeing with Intel, lithium, rare earths is, the government is becoming an equity holder. Again, not of last resort, sort of second or third resort. I don\u2019t mean this as a comment about the Trump administration. I think this is something we might be seeing in any case or see in the future after Trump is gone. How do you plan for OpenAI, knowing that\u2019s now a thing on the table in the American economy?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Look, there are all these ways where you can imagine that I put almost no probability mass onto the world where no one has any meaning in the post-AGI world because the AI is doing everything. I think we\u2019re really great at finding new things to do, new games to play, new ways to be useful to each other, to compete, to get fulfilled, whatever, but I do put a significant probability that the social contract has to change significantly.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what that will look like. Can I see the government getting more involved there and thus having some strong opinions about AI companies? I can totally see that. We don\u2019t live our lives that way. We just try to work with capitalism as it currently exists. I believe that that should be done by the companies and not the government, although we\u2019ll partner with the government and try to be a good collaborator. I don\u2019t want them writing our insurance policies.\r\n\r\nOn monetizing AI services\r\nCOWEN: Now, I did a trip through France and Spain this summer with my wife. Every hotel we booked, other than the first one, well, we found it through GPT-5. We didn\u2019t book it through GPT. Almost every meal we ate, right? You didn\u2019t get a dime for this. I\u2019m telling my wife, \u201cWell, this just seems wrong,\u201d right? What is the new world going to look like soon enough? How will that work?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: To zoom out even before the answer, one of the unusual things we noticed a while ago, and this was when it was a worse problem, ChatGPT would consistently be reported as a user\u2019s most trusted technology product from a big tech company. We don\u2019t really think of ourselves as a big tech company, but I guess we are now.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s very odd on the surface because AI is the thing that hallucinates, AI is the thing with all the errors, and this was when that was much more of a problem. There is a question of why. Ads on a Google search are dependent on Google doing badly. If it was giving you the best answer, there\u2019d be no reason ever to buy an ad above it. You\u2019re like, \u201cThat thing is not quite aligned with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nChatGPT, maybe it gives you the best answer, maybe it doesn\u2019t, but you\u2019re paying it, or hopefully, all are paying it, and it\u2019s at least trying to give you the best answer. That has led to people having a deep and pretty trusting relationship with ChatGPT. You ask ChatGPT for the best hotel, not Google or something else. If ChatGPT were accepting payment to put a worse hotel above a better hotel, that\u2019s probably catastrophic for your relationship with ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if ChatGPT shows you it\u2019s guessed the best hotel, whatever that is, and then if you book it with one click, takes the same cut that it would take from any other hotel, and there\u2019s nothing that influenced it, but there\u2019s some sort of transaction fee, I think that\u2019s probably okay. With our recent commerce thing, that\u2019s the spirit of what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019ll do that for travel at some point.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: I\u2019m not worried about the payola issue, but let me tell you my worry, and that is there may be a tight cap on the commission you can charge, because we\u2019re now in a world, say where there\u2019s agents, and someone finds the best hotel through GPT-7 or whatever, and then they just talk to their computer or their pendant, and they go to some stupider service, but the stupider service is an agent that books very cheaply, and they only really have to pay OpenAI a commission equal to what the stupidest service will charge.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: One thing I believe in general related to this is that margins are going to go dramatically down on most goods and services, including things like hotel bookings. I\u2019m happy about that. I think there\u2019s a lot of taxes that just suck for the economy, and getting those down should be great all around. I think that most companies like OpenAI will make more money at a lower margin.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you worry about the discrepancy between the fixed upfront cost of making yours the smartest model compared to the very cheap cost of all the competing agent has to do is book it for someone, and how do you use the commissions to pay for making the model smarter, in essence?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I think the way to monetize the world\u2019s smartest model is certainly not hotel booking.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: But you want to do it, nonetheless.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: No. I want to discover new science and figure out a way to monetize that that you can only do with the smartest model. There is a question of, many people have asked, \u201cShould OpenAI do ChatGPT at all? Why don\u2019t you just go build AGI? Why don\u2019t you go discover a cure for every disease, nuclear fusion, cheap rockets, the whole thing, and just license that technology?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is not an unfair question because I believe that is the stuff that we will do that will be most important and make the most money eventually, but my story, my most likely story about how this works, how the world gets dramatically better, is we put a really great superintelligence in the hands of everybody. We make it super easy to use. It\u2019s nicely integrated. We make you beautiful devices.\r\n\r\nWe connect it to all your services. It gets to know you over your life. It does all the stuff for you. We invest in infrastructure and chips, and energy, and the whole thing to make it super abundant and super cheap. Then you all figure out how the world gets way better. Maybe some people will only ever book hotels and not do anything else, but a lot of people will figure out they can do more and more stuff and create new companies and ideas and art and whatever.\r\n\r\nMaybe ChatGPT and hotel booking and whatever else is not the best way we can make money. In fact, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s not. I do think it\u2019s a very important thing to do for the world. I\u2019m happy for OpenAI to do some things that are not the economic-maxing thing.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Now, you have a deal in the works with Walmart that people can use GPT, ask it questions, \u201cWhat should I buy at Walmart?\u201d and then they can buy it at Walmart, and you and Walmart have some arrangement. Do you think Amazon will fold and join that, or are they going to fight back and try to do their own thing?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I have no idea. If I were them, I would fight back.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You would fight back?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I think so. Yes.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Ads. How important a revenue source will ads be for OpenAI?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Again, there\u2019s a kind of ad that I think would be really bad, like the one we talked about. There are kinds of ads that I think would be very good or pretty good to do. I expect it\u2019s something we\u2019ll try at some point. I do not think it is our biggest revenue opportunity.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: What will the ad look like on the page?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I have no idea. You asked a question about productivity earlier. I\u2019m really good about not doing the things I don\u2019t want to do.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: That\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to do?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: We have the world expert thinking about our product strategy. I used to do that. I used to spend a lot of time thinking about product. Now she\u2019s much better at it than me. I have other things to think about. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll figure it out.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Whether or not you agree with it, what is the best this-is-not-a-bubble argument. Is it just the insatiable demand for compute?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: There\u2019s a lot of arguments I\u2019m tempted to give, but I think the intellectually most interesting one is we have no idea how much past human-level intelligence can go and what you can do with it as it does. There\u2019s all the arguments that everyone has made. The one I would like to see people talk about much more is \u201cHow are you even supposed to think about vastly superhuman intelligence and the economic impacts of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nOn AI\u2019s future understanding of intangibles\r\nCOWEN: Now, OpenAI is in talks with Saudi Arabia, with UAE. Let\u2019s take the most optimistic scenario for how all that goes. What is it that top OpenAI management needs to know or understand about those countries, and how is it you learn it?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Well, it would depend on what we were doing with them. Putting data centers in a country or taking investment from a country or deploying commercial services would be very different than a set of other collaborations we could imagine. But generally speaking, to put data centers in a country, what we need to understand is who\u2019s going to run it. We don\u2019t operate our own data centers, but Microsoft or Oracle, or somebody else.\r\n\r\nWhat workload are we going to put there? What model weights are we going to put there? What are the security guarantees going to look like? We do want to build data centers around the world, with lots of countries, but for this question, which is the main thing we deal with other countries for, those are the kinds of questions. If we were, which we don\u2019t have current plans, if we were developing a custom model for some country, we\u2019d have a whole bunch more questions.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: They have different legal codes, different expectations from a deal. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s in a bad way. It\u2019s just quite different, right? You do the Jared Kushner thing? \u201cHere\u2019s the 25 books I read?\u201d You sit down and you ask GPT-6 how to understand this culture, or you bring in three experts?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: We bring in experts.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You bring in experts.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: We talk to the US government a lot. We bring in experts. Again, if we\u2019re building a data center that a very trusted partner is going to operate, we know what the workload is, and it\u2019s being built like a US embassy or US military base, we have a very different set of questions than if we were doing other things, which we have not yet decided to do, and we\u2019d bring in more experts for.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Those are quite intangible forms of knowledge, often. How good do you think GPT-6 is at teaching you those things, or you still need the human experts to come in? Because you could just ask your own model, right?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t think GPT-6 will have those intangibles. It might surprise us, but that\u2019d be very unexpected if I was like, \u201cOh, don\u2019t need to talk to experts anymore.\u201d\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you have an evaluation for that in the works?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Actually, for something very close to that, we do. I don\u2019t want to pre-announce it. That class of stuff, yes, we do have an evaluation.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You do?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes. How good will GPT-6 be at poetry?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: How good do you think GPT-5 is at poetry?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Not that good. It\u2019s not what I want it for, so that\u2019s not a complaint. My guess is, in a year, you\u2019ll have some model that can write a poem as good as the median Pablo Neruda poem, but not the best.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I was going to say, I don\u2019t want to say GPT, whether it\u2019s 6 or 7, but I think we will get to something where you will say, \u201cThis is not a long way to the very best, but this is like a real poet\u2019s okay poem.\u201d\r\n\r\nCOWEN: In my view, there\u2019s a big gap between a Neruda poem that\u2019s a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 and one that\u2019s a 10. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever reach the 10. I think you\u2019ll reach the 8.8 within a few years.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I think we will reach the 10, and you won\u2019t care.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Who won\u2019t care?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: You won\u2019t care.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: I\u2019ll care. I promise.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: You\u2019ll care in terms of the technological accomplishment, but in terms of the great pieces of art and emotion and whatever else produced by humanity, you care a lot about the person or that a person produced it. It\u2019s definitely something for an AI to write a 10 on its technical merits.\r\n\r\nMy classic example of this is, the greatest chess players don\u2019t really care that AI is hugely better than them at chess. It doesn\u2019t demotivate them to play. They don\u2019t really care that they are. They really care about beating the other human, and they really get obsessed with that dude sitting across from them. The fact that the AI is better, they don\u2019t care. Watching two AIs play each other, not that fun for that long.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Let me tell you my worry about reaching the 10. Evaluations rely a lot on these rubrics. The rubrics will become good enough to produce very good poems, but maybe there\u2019s something about the 10 poem that stands outside the rubric. If you\u2019re just training on rubrics, rubrics, rubrics, it might in a way be counterproductive for reaching the 10.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Evals can rely on a lot of things, including when you call upon the 10 and when you don\u2019t.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Sure.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: You can read a bunch in the process and provide some real-time signal.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Say we have no human poets today writing 10s, and we\u2019re asking those same people to judge and grade the GPTs. I\u2019m worried. Again, I think it will be fine. To me, we\u2019re talking about a 9, not a 10. You don\u2019t have William Wordsworth working for OpenAI.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: This gets to a very interesting thing, which is, let\u2019s say you can\u2019t write a 10, but you can decide when something is a 10. That might be all that we need.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Maybe humanity only decides collectively what\u2019s a 10, and there\u2019s something a little mysterious and history-laden about that process.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Okay, but still, we can do it. Now, maybe our decision is not very good because it is history-related and it does drift over time, and some things we all agree are great, the next generation decides they\u2019re not, whatever, but if whatever process humanity has to determine what poem is a 10, you could imagine that providing some sort of signal to an AI. Now that, again, if you know it\u2019s an AI, maybe you don\u2019t care. We see this phenomenon with AI art, but yes.\r\n\r\nOn chip-building\r\nCOWEN: To the extent you end up building your own chips, what\u2019s the hardest part of that?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Man, that\u2019s a hard thing all around.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: That\u2019s the hardest.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: There\u2019s no easy part of that.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, no easy part of that. Well, Jonathan Ross said it\u2019s just keeping up with what is new.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: No, I\u2019ll tell you why. People talk a lot about the recursive self-improvement loop for AI research, where AI can help researchers, maybe today, write code faster, eventually do automated research, and this thing is well understood, very much discussed. Very little discussed or relatively little discussed are the hardware implications of this: robots that can build other robots, data centers that can build other data centers, chips that can design their own next generation. There\u2019s many hard parts, but maybe a lot of them can get much easier. Maybe the problem of chip design will turn out to be a very good problem for previous generations of chips.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: The stupidest question possible: Why don\u2019t we just make more GPUs?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Because we need to make more electrons.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: What\u2019s stopping that? What\u2019s the ultimate binding constraint?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: We\u2019re working on it really hard.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: If you could have more of one thing to have more compute, what would the one thing be?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Electrons.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Electrons. Just energy. What\u2019s the most likely short-term solution for that?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Short-term, natural gas.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Easing, not full solution, but easing of the constraint.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Short-term, natural gas.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: In the American South?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Or wherever. Long-term, it will be dominated, I believe, by fusion and by solar. I don\u2019t know what ratio, but I would say those are the two winners.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You\u2019re still bullish on fusion?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Very much, and solar.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you worry that, as long as it\u2019s called nuclear power, even if it works\u200a\u2014\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Did I say the word nuclear?\r\n\r\n[laughter]\r\n\r\nCOWEN: No, you didn\u2019t, but other people will. That people just won\u2019t want it, getting back to the irrationality point in the insurance?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: You\u2019re the economist, not me, but I think there is some price point at a given level of safety where the demand for this will be overwhelming. If this is the same price as natural gas, maybe it\u2019s unfortunately hard. If it\u2019s one-tenth the price, I think we could agree it would happen very fast. I don\u2019t know what the cut point is between.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you ever worry there\u2019s some scenario where, ultimately, superintelligence doesn\u2019t need that much compute, and in some funny way, by investing in compute, you\u2019re betting against progress over a 30-year time horizon?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: The related thing, in the same way that people always want more energy if it\u2019s cheaper, I think people will always want more compute if it\u2019s cheaper. Even if you can make incredibly smart models with much less compute, which I\u2019m sure you can, the desire to consume in all sorts of new ways and do more stuff with more abundant intelligence, I\u2019ll take that bet every day. The related thing I worry about is that there is a huge phase shift on how we do compute, and we\u2019re all chasing a dead-end paradigm. That would be bad.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: What would that look like?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t know. We all switch to optical compute, like full-on optical compute or something.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: And just have to spend a lot of money all over again?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes. Well, not on all of it. The energy is the energy, but yes, on everything else.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Now, I love Pulse. Why don\u2019t I hear more about Pulse, or do you think there is a lot of chatter out there?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: People love Pulse, but it is only available to our Pro users right now, which is not that many. Also, we\u2019re not giving much per day to users. We will change both of those things. I suspect when we roll it out to Plus, you will hear about it a lot more, but people do love it. It gets great reviews.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: What do you use Pulse for?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: There are only two things in my life right now. There\u2019s my family and work. Clearly, this is what I talk to ChatGPT about because I get a lot of stuff about that. I get the odd \u201cNew hypercar came out\u201d or \u201cHere\u2019s a great hiking trail\u201d or whatever, but it\u2019s mostly those two things. It\u2019s great for both of those.\r\n\r\nOn Sam\u2019s outlook on health, alien life, and conspiracy theories\r\nCOWEN: I\u2019d just like to do a brief interlude on your broader view of the world and just see how I should think about how you think. People in California, they have a lot of views on their own health, some of which to me sound nutty. What do you think is your nuttiest view about your own health? That you\u2019re going to live forever, that the seed oils are bad, or what is it, or do you not have any?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: When I was less busy, I was more disciplined on health-related stuff. I didn\u2019t have crazy views, but I was like, I kind of ate healthy. I didn\u2019t drink that much. I worked out a lot. I tried a few things here and there. I once ended up in a hospital for trying semaglutide before it was cool, that kind of stuff. I now do basically nothing.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You just live family life.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I eat junk food. I don\u2019t exercise enough. It\u2019s like a pretty bad situation. I\u2019m feeling bullied into taking this more seriously again.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, but why eat junk food? It doesn\u2019t taste good.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: It does taste good.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Compared to good sushi? You could afford good sushi. Someone will bring it to you. A robot will bring it.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Sometimes late at night, you just really want that chocolate chip cookie at 11:30 at night, or at least I do.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes. Do you think there\u2019s any kind of alien life on the moons of Saturn? Because I do. That\u2019s one of my nutty views.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I have no opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: No opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, that\u2019s a way of passing the test. What do you think about UAPs? Do you think there\u2019s a thing?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I think something\u2019s going on there. I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You think something is going on there.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Again, I have an opinion that there is something that I would like an explanation for. I kind of doubt it\u2019s little green men. I extremely doubt it\u2019s little green men, but I think someone\u2019s got something.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: How many conspiracy theories do you believe in? Because I believe in close to zero, at least in the United States. They may be true for Pakistani military coups, but I think mostly they\u2019re just false.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Like true conspiracy theory, not just an unpopular belief?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Correct.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I have one of those X-Files shirts, like \u201cI want to believe.\u201d I still have one of those shirts from when I was in high school. I want to believe in conspiracy. I\u2019m predisposed to believe in conspiracy theories, and I believe in either zero or very few.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, I\u2019m the opposite of that. I don\u2019t want to believe, and I believe in very few. Like maybe the White Sox fixed the World Series way back when, right?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes, stuff like that, I don\u2019t quite count that. Like a true massive global government cover-up, that requires a level of competence to people I just rarely ascribe.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Now, some number of years ago, this was before even GPT-4, I asked you if you were directing a fund of money to revitalize St. Louis, which is where you grew up, how would you invest the money? Now it\u2019s a quite different world from when I asked you last time. If I ask you again to revitalize St. Louis, how would you spend the money? Say it\u2019s a billion dollars, which is not actually transformational, but it\u2019s enough that it\u2019s some real money.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: A billion dollars, and I\u2019m willing to go spend personal time on it?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You have free time. The universe grants you free time. You don\u2019t take time away from anything else you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re in charge.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: This is not a deeply incisive answer because I think this is not a generally replicatable thing, but unique to me, what I could do. I think I would try to go start a Y Combinator-like thing in St. Louis and get a ton of startup founders focused on AI to move there and start a bunch of companies.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: That\u2019s a pretty similar answer to last time.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I didn\u2019t remember what I said last time, so that\u2019s a good sign.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You said the same thing, but you didn\u2019t mention AI. AI to me seems quite clustered where we are in the Bay Area. Is trying to get AI into St. Louis the right way to do that? Isn\u2019t that, in a way, working at cross-purposes?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: This is why I said it\u2019d be like a \u201cunique to me\u201d thing. I think I could do it. Maybe that\u2019s hopelessly naive.\r\n\r\nOn regulating AI agents\r\nCOWEN: Yes. Should it be legal to just release an AI agent into the wild, unowned, untraceable? Do we need some other AI agent to go out there and tackle it down, or is there minimum capitalization? How do you think about that problem?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I think it\u2019s a question of thresholds. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d advocate that most systems should have any oversight or regulation or legal questions or whatever, but if we have an agent that is capable with serious probability of massively self-replicating over the internet and sweeping all the money out of bank accounts or whatever, you would then say, \u201cOkay, maybe that one needs some oversight.\u201d I think it\u2019s a question of where you draw the threshold for where it should not be.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Say it\u2019s hiring the cloud computing from a semi-rogue nation, so you can\u2019t just turn it off. What actually should we do, or will we be able to do? Just try to ring-fence it somehow, identify it, surveil it, put sanctions on the country that\u2019s sponsoring it?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: What do we do for people that do that today?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Well, there are a lot of cyberattacks that come from North Korea, and I think we can\u2019t do that much about them, right?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t know what the right answer is yet, but my naive take is we should try to solve this problem urgently for people using rogue internet resources, and AI will just be a worse version of that problem.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: It will have better defense, also.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: For sure.\r\n\r\nOn new ways to interface with AI\r\nCOWEN: Yes. Now, if I think about social media and AI, here\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve noticed in my own work. I\u2019m so, so keen to read the answers to my own queries to GPT-5, but when people send me the answers to their queries, I\u2019m bored. I don\u2019t blame them. I know it\u2019s super useful for them, but that makes me a little skeptical about blending social media and AI. Am I missing something, or would you try to talk me out of that somehow?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: No, I\u2019ve had the same observation. I don\u2019t want to read your GPT-5 queries, either.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, but they\u2019re great for me.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I\u2019m sure, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to read mine, but they\u2019re great for me. ChatGPT, I think, is very much like a single-player experience. I don\u2019t think that means there\u2019s not some interesting, new kind of social product to build. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure there is, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the \u201cShare your ChatGPT queries.\u201d\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Videos or any sense of what that would look like?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: That one\u2019s doing well. People, clearly, they love making their own, but they also like watching other people\u2019s AI-generated videos. No, I think none of this stuff is the really interesting kind of things you can imagine when you and I and everybody else have really great personal AI agents that can do stuff on our behalf. There\u2019s probably entirely new social dynamics to think about.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Just the physical form of ChatGPT on my screen or on my smartphone, is that more or less going to stay the same, but the thing will be better, or 13 years from now, it will physically just be an entirely different beast? Because I can talk to it now. Now it does video. Is it just a better version, or somehow it morphs?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: We are going to try to make you a new kind of computer with a completely new kind of interface that is meant for AI, which I think wants something completely different than the computing paradigm we\u2019ve been using for the last 50 years that we\u2019re currently stuck in. AI is a crazy change to the possibility space. A lot of the basic assumptions of how you use a computer and the fact that you should even be having an operating system or opening a window, or sending a query at all, are now called into question.\r\n\r\nI realize that the track record of people saying they\u2019re going to invent a new kind of computer is very bad. If there\u2019s one person that you should bet on to do it, I think Jony Ive is a credible, maybe the best bet you could take. We\u2019ll see if it works. I\u2019m very excited to try.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Haven\u2019t you already been surprised, how robust it is that people love typing text into boxes? This sort of shocks me in the bigger picture. People are still texting all the time. It\u2019s one of the most robust forms of internet anything. Maybe that will just stick forever, and it\u2019s a sign of our own limitations. How do we get past that?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Texting, command lines, search queries, that\u2019s my favorite interface.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You like it, I like it. Maybe we\u2019re just going to keep it.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Well, a lot of people use it. People love to text. People like ChatGPT. I remember when we were thinking about the interface for ChatGPT, I was very set that this was something people would be familiar with and want to use. I think I grew up as a child of the internet with a lot of conviction that that was the right kind of internet. Texting was my life as a teenager.\r\n\r\nOn how normies will learn to use AI\r\nCOWEN: If you have some kind of ideal arrangement, partnership with an institution of higher education, say, within two to three years, what does that look like? You get to write the whole thing.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I suspect that the whole model should change, but I don\u2019t know what to. I think the ideal partnership would look like we try 20 different experiments. We see what leads to the best results. I\u2019ve been watching these AI schools pop up with great interest. It seems like a lot of them with very different approaches are all showing positive results. I think the first few years of the ideal partnership would look like we run 20 wildly different experiments.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Sometimes I have the fear that these institutions don\u2019t have enough internal reputational strength or credibility to make any major change, forget about AI, and that to do a partnership with an institution like that is maybe intrinsically frustrating, and for the next 10 years, the actual model is privatized AI use on the side by faculty, by students, by labs, and in a sense there is no partnership other than actually just marketing your product to these people. Do you ever think that might be true?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes, and it wouldn\u2019t super upset me if that\u2019s what happens.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes. What do you think will happen to the returns to a college degree? Not Harvard, not Stanford, but like a quite good state school, five, 10 years out.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: What\u2019s the historical rate of decline of the value of that?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Recently, it\u2019s gone down, though for a long time it was going up quite a bit.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes, I mean the last decade.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Oh, gone down. I don\u2019t know how much.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I would guess that it goes down at a slightly higher rate than the last decade, but it does not collapse to zero as fast as it should.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Then it\u2019s the returns to doing what other than learning AI that go up? Like being on the college football team or what?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I don\u2019t think the massive returns will accrue to doing AI for a small set of people, but I think the returns to using AI super well will be surprisingly widely distributed. I think the most important thing AI will do is discover new science for all of us, and a lot of people will benefit from that, and people will start companies or get jobs doing that. I\u2019m not a believer that that is the only thing that eventually makes money.\r\n\r\nI think people will just use AI for all sorts of new kinds of jobs or to do existing jobs better. Maybe the starkest example of this in 2025 is the day-to-day of how the average programmer in Silicon Valley did their workflow at the beginning of this year versus the end of this year. Extremely different. Extremely different. You don\u2019t really have to know how to program AI to do that, but you can get more done, and you probably have much more value, and the world is going to get much more software. I think we\u2019ll see things like that for a surprising number of industries.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Say five years out, there\u2019s a so-called normie person. They\u2019re not a specialist. They want to learn how to use AI much better. What will they actually do that will give them a high return to acquiring that skill?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: To learn how to use AI specifically?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes. Not program, not the inner guts, just actually in their job.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I\u2019m smiling because I remember when I was a kid and Google came out there, I had a job teaching older people how to use Google, and it felt like I just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. It was like, \u201cYou type the thing in, and it does this.\u201d A thing that I\u2019m hopeful about for AI is that, I think one of the reasons ChatGPT has grown so fast, is it is so easy to learn how to use it and get real value out of it.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: We don\u2019t need startups to do that?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: To teach people how to use AI?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: To teach people, yes. There is such a startup, or what\u2019s the institution? My school will teach me, that\u2019s hard to believe.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: 10% of the world will use ChatGPT this week didn\u2019t exist three years ago. I suspect a year from now, maybe 30% of people will use ChatGPT that week. People, once they start using it, do find more and more sophisticated things to use it for. This is not a top-of-mind problem for me. I think I believe in human creativity and adoption of new things over some period of number of years.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: You might just want to support or invest in the startups that will do this because if you\u2019re bullish on AI, presumably you\u2019re bullish on those startups, and it will help your business in turn. It seems odd not to have a theory of how we\u2019re all going to learn to use AI better. You can go to dog trainer school, and they teach you how to train a dog.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Okay. Maybe I have a blind spot here, and I promise I\u2019ll go think about this more. If you ask ChatGPT, \u201cTeach me how to use you\u201d\u200a\u2014\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, maybe that\u2019s it.\r\n\r\nALTMAN:\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s pretty good.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes, so maybe you\u2019re the school.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Maybe.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes. Let\u2019s say when your kids are old enough that they\u2019re grown, they can go out on their own. In that future world, which is not so far off, do you think you\u2019ll still be reading books, or you\u2019ll just be interacting with your AI?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Books have survived a lot of other technological change. I think there is something deep about the format of a book that has persisted. It\u2019s very mindy, whatever the current word for that is. I suspect that there will be a new way to interact with a cluster of ideas that is better than a book for most things. I don\u2019t think books will be gone, but I would bet they\u2019re a smaller percentage of how people learn a new or interact with a new idea.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: What\u2019s the cultural habit you have that you think will change the most? Like, \u201cOh, I won\u2019t watch movies anymore, I\u2019ll create my own,\u201d or whatever, for you? AI will obliterate what you did when you were 23.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: This is boring, but I think the way I work, where I\u2019m doing emails and calls and meetings and writing documents and dealing with Slack, that I expect to change hugely, and that has become a real, and I have a cultural habit and a rhythm of my workday at this point. Spending time with my family, spending time in nature, eating food, my interactions with my friends, that\u2019s stuff I expect to change, almost not at all, at least not for a very long time.\r\n\r\nOn AI\u2019s effect on the price of housing and healthcare\r\nCOWEN: Do you think San Francisco will remain the center for AI? Putting aside China issues, I just mean for the so-called West.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes, I think that\u2019s the default.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: It\u2019s the default. You think the city is just absolutely making a comeback? It looks much nicer to me. It seems nicer. Am I deluded?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I love the city. I love the whole Bay Area. I particularly love the city, but I love the Bay Area. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a fair person to ask because I so want it to be making a comeback and to remain the place. I think so, I hope so, but very biased.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: AI will improve many things very quickly, but what\u2019s the time horizon for it making rents or home prices cheaper? That seems like a tough one. Not the fault of AI, but land is land, and there\u2019s a lot of legal restrictions.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Yes, I was going to push back on the land is land. There are a lot of other problems that I don\u2019t think AI can solve anytime soon. There could be these very strange second-order effects where home prices get much cheaper, but sadly, I don\u2019t think AI has a direct attack on solving anytime soon.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Food prices?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I would bet down.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: In the short run, energy might be a bit more expensive. How long does it take for food prices to go down?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: If they\u2019re not down in a decade, I\u2019d be very disappointed.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: If we think of healthcare, my sense is we\u2019re going to spend a lot more on healthcare. We\u2019ll get a lot for it because there\u2019ll be new inventions, but a lot of the world will feel more expensive because rent won\u2019t be cheaper. Food, I\u2019m not sure about. Healthcare, you\u2019ll live to age 98, but you\u2019ll have to spend a lot more. You\u2019ll just be alive more while you\u2019re spending, right? Are people just going to think of AI as this very expensive thing, or will it be thought of as a very cheap thing that makes life more affordable?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I would bet we spend less on healthcare. I bet there are a lot of diseases that we can just cure or come up with a very cheap treatment for that right now. We have nothing but expensive chronic stuff that doesn\u2019t even work that well. I would bet healthcare gets cheaper.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Through pharmaceuticals, devices?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Through pharmaceuticals and devices, and even delivery of actual healthcare services. Look, housing is the one to me that just looks super hard. There will be other categories of things that we want to get more expensive, and of course, those will\u200a\u2014\u200astatus goods or whatever. I would take the healthcare goes down a bit.\r\n\r\nOn reexamining freedom of speech\r\nCOWEN: With all the blizzard of new ideas coming, patent law, copyright law, those are based on earlier technologies and earlier models of how the world would work. Do we need to reexamine or change those radically for an AI-drenched world, or we can just keep what we have and modify it a bit?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I really have no idea.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: I\u2019m a big free speech advocate, but I can imagine the world saying, \u201cWell, with all this AI-driven content, we need to reexamine the First Amendment.\u201d Do you have a view on that?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Without thinking much, I put out a tweet recently about how we\u2019re going to be allowing more freedom of expression in ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: This is the famous erotica tweet. It\u2019s funny what people get upset about.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: It is funny what animates people.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Because all you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re not going to stop people, right?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Well, we used to not a long time\u200a\u2014\u200awell, that\u2019s not totally fair. We\u2019re going to allow more than we did in the past. A very important principle to me is that we treat our adult users like adults and that people have a very high degree of privacy with their AI, which we need legal change for, and also that people have very broad bounds of how they\u2019re able to use it. To me, this should be one of the easiest things to agree on by most people in the tech industry or even most people in the US government.\r\n\r\nI kind of dashed this tweet off and closed my computer, and it didn\u2019t even hit my mind that it was going to be, really, a firestorm. It was that we made a decision, which I also think was a fair one, over the summer, that because there were new problems, and that particularly because we wanted to protect teenage users, we were going to heavily restrict ChatGPT, which is also always a very unpopular thing to do, and along with the rolling out of age-gating and some of these mental health mitigations, we were going to bring back and in some cases increase freedom of use for adults.\r\n\r\nI was like, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell people that\u2019s coming because the first model update is shipping soon, but this should be a nonissue.\u201d Boy, did I get that one wrong. I think maybe it\u2019s just, people don\u2019t believe in freedom of expression as much as they say they do.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: That was my opinion, yes.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Everyone thinks, \u201cOkay, my own freedom of expression, I can handle it. I need it. My ideas are all right, but yours\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\nCOWEN: For greater privacy rights, is it subpoena power that needs to be changed, or something else in addition?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Subpoena power. Well, let me just say, I believe that we should apply as much protection as when you talk to your doctor, your human doctor or your human lawyer, as you do when you talk to your AI doctor or AI lawyer.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Right now, we don\u2019t have that.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Correct.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you think there\u2019s enough trust in America today for people to trust the AI companies the way we sort of trust doctors, lawyers, and therapists?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: By revealed preference, yes.\r\n\r\nOn humanity\u2019s persuadability\r\nCOWEN: Yes, by how many people talk to AI. LLM psychosis, everyone on Twitter today is saying it\u2019s a thing. How much a thing is it?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: A very tiny thing, but not a zero thing, which is why we pissed off the whole user base, or most of the user base, by putting a bunch of restrictions in place. The \u201ctreat adult users like adults\u201d includes an asterisk, which is \u201ctreat adults of sound mind like adults.\u201d Society decides that we treat adults that are having a psychiatric crisis differently than other adults.\r\n\r\nThis is one of these things that you learn as you go, but when we saw, the kind of like put ChatGPT into role-playing mode, or pretend like it\u2019s writing a book, and have it encourage someone in delusional thoughts, 99 point some big number percentage of adults, totally fine with that, some tiny percentage of people, also, if they talk to another person who encourages delusion, it\u2019s bad.\r\n\r\nWe made a bunch of changes, which are in conflict with the freedom of expression policy. Now that we have those mental health mitigations in place, we\u2019ll again allow some of that stuff in creative mode, role-playing mode, writing mode, whatever, of ChatGPT. The thing I worry about is not that there will be a few basis points of people that are close to losing grips with reality, and we can trigger a psychotic break, and we can get that right.\r\n\r\nThe thing I worry about more\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s funny, the things that stick in your mind. Someone said to me once, \u201cNever ever let yourself believe that propaganda doesn\u2019t work on you. They just haven\u2019t found the right thing for you yet.\u201d Again, I have no doubt that we can\u2019t address the clear cases of people near a psychotic break. For all of the talk about AI safety, I would divide most AI thinkers into these two camps of \u201cOkay, it\u2019s the bad guy uses AI to cause a lot of harm,\u201d or it\u2019s, \u201cthe AI itself is misaligned, wakes up, whatever, intentionally takes over the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s this other category, third category, that gets very little talk, that I think is much scarier and more interesting, which is the AI models accidentally take over the world. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re going to induce psychosis in you, but if you have the whole world talking to this one model, it\u2019s not with any intentionality, but just as it learns from the world in this continually coevolving process, it just subtly convinces you of something. No intention, it just does. It learned that somehow. That\u2019s not as theatrical as chatbot psychosis, obviously, but I do think about that a lot.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Maybe I\u2019m not good enough, but as a professor, I find people pretty hard to persuade, actually. I worry about this less than many of my AI-related friends do.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I hope you\u2019re right.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Yes. Last question, on matters where you can speak publicly. At the margin, if you could call in an expert to help you resolve a question in your mind of substance, what would that question be?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: I have an answer to this ready to go, but only because I got asked to\u200a\u2014\u200awell, maybe I\u2019ll tell the story right after. This is like I take this spiritually, not literally. There will come a moment where the superintelligence is built. It is safety-tested. It is ready to go. We\u2019ll still be able to supervise it, but it\u2019s going to do just vastly incredible things. It\u2019s going to be self-improving. It\u2019s going to launch the probes of the stars, whatever. You get the opportunity to type in the prompt before you say okay. The question is, what should you type in?\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Do you have a tentative answer now?\r\n\r\nALTMAN: No, I don\u2019t. The reason that I had that ready to go in mind is, someone was going to see the Dalai Lama and said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask any question about AI you want.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat a great opportunity.\u201d I thought really hard about it and that was my question.\r\n\r\nCOWEN: Sam Altman, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nALTMAN: Thank you."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"message_source":null,"request_id":"af99633b-8206-42cd-ab92-f86c7e5bd836","selected_github_repos":[],"selected_sources":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"15778bdf-fee8-4c3c-b707-0b19a182d3ba","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"954012e5-4ce0-42a1-a9a8-0ef0f6c7034d","children":["c6225646-c314-4259-a7f0-38a405b817ac"]},"c6225646-c314-4259-a7f0-38a405b817ac":{"id":"c6225646-c314-4259-a7f0-38a405b817ac","message":{"id":"c6225646-c314-4259-a7f0-38a405b817ac","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762399460.0578592,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"8e45e41b-f2ac-4af4-9310-4af552504831","request_id":"af99633b-8206-42cd-ab92-f86c7e5bd836","thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"15778bdf-fee8-4c3c-b707-0b19a182d3ba","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8e45e41b-f2ac-4af4-9310-4af552504831","children":["099c933a-4068-41a0-b026-5d52a91336e7"]},"099c933a-4068-41a0-b026-5d52a91336e7":{"id":"099c933a-4068-41a0-b026-5d52a91336e7","message":{"id":"099c933a-4068-41a0-b026-5d52a91336e7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762399460.5285246,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"c6225646-c314-4259-a7f0-38a405b817ac","request_id":"af99633b-8206-42cd-ab92-f86c7e5bd836","thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"15778bdf-fee8-4c3c-b707-0b19a182d3ba","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c6225646-c314-4259-a7f0-38a405b817ac","children":["6d4f2b9c-6101-4cae-a146-f3af8ec03213"]},"6d4f2b9c-6101-4cae-a146-f3af8ec03213":{"id":"6d4f2b9c-6101-4cae-a146-f3af8ec03213","message":{"id":"6d4f2b9c-6101-4cae-a146-f3af8ec03213","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762399462.342943,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing interview for E-Jay","content":"I need to focus on E-Jay's interests (AI, math, research, chip building, etc.) and tailor my analysis to those.

He hints at recursive improvement loops for hardware (chips designing chips, robots building robots).\n\n4) **Trust as product strategy.** Monetization via transactions without payola; more freedom for adult use with targeted guardrails; deep worry about *accidental* persuasion (system-level drift) more than theatrical takeovers.\n\nIt\u2019s coherent, ambitious, and internally consistent: agents \u2192 science \u2192 products \u2192 infrastructure and back. It also underplays several practical frictions (see \u201cPushback\u201d).\n\n# What will most excite you (and why)\nGiven your research/programming bent and taste for forward-leaning, technically grounded projects:\n\n1) **Agent-run micro-orgs (real ops, not demos).**  \n   - *Why you\u2019ll care:* This is the cleanest way to pressure-test reasoning, planning, and tool-use at scale. It\u2019s also where *evaluation* matters more than raw benchmark scores.  \n   - *What to do:* Stand up a \u201cdivision in a box\u201d (support, outreach, billing, analytics) with strict KPIs and audit trails. Treat it as a systems-theory problem: policies, memory, tool rights, rollback, and safety gates.\n\n2) **Model-assisted discovery for math/ML (\u201cLab-in-the-loop\u201d).**  \n   - *Why:* Altman expects GPT-6 to move from collaborator\u2192co-discoverer. Your edge is turning that into a reproducible pipeline: conjecture generation, counterexample search, proof-sketching, and literature synthesis with explicit uncertainty.  \n   - *What to do:* Build an \u201cactive research loop\u201d where agents propose lines, generate synthetic lemmas/counterexamples, run proof checkers (Lean/Isabelle), and maintain a *versioned* research notebook with reward signals (novelty, falsifiability, and downstream citations).\n\n3) **Recursive hardware feedback loops.**  \n   - *Why:* The idea that chips design next-gen chips (and DCs build DCs) is under-explored outside a few labs. It\u2019s an ideal \u201cclosed-loop optimization\u201d playground.  \n   - *What to do:* Start with EDA-adjacent tasks (floorplanning heuristics, layout hotspot prediction, RTL lint/repair) where open corpora exist, then measure wall-clock and energy savings per iteration. Tie to a simple fab-constraints simulator.\n\n4) **Energy-aware AI roadmaps.**  \n   - *Why:* \u201cElectrons are the constraint\u201d aligns with your macro/infra interest. There\u2019s real alpha in *energy-constrained* capability planning versus na\u00efve parameter scaling.  \n   - *What to do:* Build a compute\u2013energy budgeter: map training/inference plans to site power, PUE, grid mix, and marginal cost; include scenarios for small fusion pilots and aggressive solar + storage. Use it to choose model sizes, quantization, and caching strategies.\n\n5) **Evaluating \u201cintangibles\u201d and persuasion drift.**  \n   - *Why:* He admits GPT-6 won\u2019t internalize soft cultural knowledge well and worries about system-level persuasion without intent. That\u2019s an open research lane.  \n   - *What to do:* Design *longitudinal* evals that detect distributional drift in beliefs, not just answers\u2014e.g., panel-based opinion dynamics, randomized framing, and memory-anchored prompts. Add \u201cnormative variance tests\u201d that deliberately mix expert subcultures.\n\n6) **New interface primitives (beyond chat).**  \n   - *Why:* The \u201cnew computer\u201d claim (Jony Ive collab) suggests declarative, goal-first UX with agents negotiating on your behalf.  \n   - *What to do:* Prototype a **goal compiler**: you state constraints/objectives; the system renders a live plan with agents attached to each edge (APIs, emails, git ops). Grade it by *time saved per objective* and *error recovery latency*, not message quality.\n\n7) **Trust-preserving commerce patterns.**  \n   - *Why:* You care about product integrity and incentives. A transparent, flat transaction fee with no ranking bias is the only defensible monetization for agentic recommenders.  \n   - *What to do:* Implement a reference \u201ctrust ledger\u201d that logs candidate sets, scores, filters, and post-click outcomes\u2014auditable by users\u2014then A/B test user trust and repeat usage.\n\n# Where I push back (and what to watch)\n- **Timelines for agent-run orgs:** \u201cFew years\u201d is plausible for tightly scoped, high-telemetry functions (support, collections). *General* divisional control needs robust causal models, failure containment, and legal/personnel authority. Expect pockets of success, not blanket replacement.\n\n- **GPT-6 as science engine:** We\u2019ll see real wins in *hypothesis triage*, literature refactoring, and simulation design. But \u201cnovel result generation\u201d will be bottlenecked by (i) dataset quality for frontier domains, (ii) tool integration depth, and (iii) eval leakage (overfitting to rubric-style reviews). The glimmers will be inspiring; the average lab workflow will still hinge on human taste and wet/dry lab cycles.\n\n- **Accidental persuasion vs. freedom of expression:** Looser adult policies plus persistent, ubiquitous agent interactions raise aggregate-drift risk. The right mitigation isn\u2019t content throttling\u2014it\u2019s *system-level pluralism*: diversified model ensembles, user-selectable epistemic profiles, and periodic \u201cbelief checksum\u201d prompts that surface where your model *moved* you.\n\n- **Healthcare will get cheaper (net):** Drug/device discovery may accelerate, but U.S. delivery economics, regulation, and rent-seeking can swallow productivity gains. Expect *unit* costs to fall while *total* spend stays flat/up unless payment models change.\n\n- **Energy path:** Gas as a bridge is realistic, but permitting, grid interconnect queues, and transformer supply are today\u2019s blockers. Fusion timelines remain uncertain; bank on solar + storage + efficiency first.\n\n# Concrete projects you could start now\nNo permission-seeking, just do:\n\n1) **Agent Division Sandbox.** Pick one real function (e.g., inbound student lead-handling for your sites). Give agents API keys, a CRM sandbox, a payment stub, and fixed SLAs. Ship weekly reliability reports (task success, human escalations, revenue per hour).\n\n2) **Math Lab-in-the-loop.** Build a pipeline: (i) literature distiller; (ii) conjecture generator; (iii) Lean-check integration; (iv) counterexample synthesizer; (v) research notebook with \u201cnovelty/rigor\u201d scores. Publish ablations where the agent materially changes your direction.\n\n3) **Persuasion Drift Audit.** Over 8 weeks, run controlled sessions where your agent assists writing on contentious but bounded topics; track shifts in your phrasing/priors via embedding drift + human panel grading. Open-source the protocol.\n\n4) **Energy-Aware Inference.** Instrument your current model serving to log kWh per 1k tokens (or per action), test 4-bit/8-bit quantization + caching + reranking cascades, and publish a \u201ccost of reasoning\u201d curve.\n\n5) **EDA Micro-bench.** Replicate a recent ML-for-EDA task (macro placement or IR-drop hotspotting) using open datasets; measure speed/quality vs. heuristic baselines; then add an agent that chooses/parameterizes the optimizer.\n\n6) **Trust Ledger for Recommendations.** Wrap an agentic recommender with full decision transparency and a flat transaction fee. Measure user trust (survey + revealed behavior) vs. a \u201cblack-box\u201d baseline.\n\n# Bottom line\nThis is Altman at his most candid: agents will run things; science is next; energy and hardware matter more than most people are modeling; and the real safety hazard is subtle, emergent persuasion. Treat those as **research and product prompts**, not predictions to accept wholesale. If you convert even two of the above ideas into rigorous, instrumented projects, you\u2019ll be working exactly where the frontier is actually moving\u2014and you\u2019ll have hard data to update (or falsify) the claims that matter."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","finish_details":{"stop_tokens":[200002],"type":"stop"},"is_complete":true,"message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"1a23ca9a-9fd5-4963-a6e1-b7f66550ae25","request_id":"af99633b-8206-42cd-ab92-f86c7e5bd836","thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"15778bdf-fee8-4c3c-b707-0b19a182d3ba","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"1a23ca9a-9fd5-4963-a6e1-b7f66550ae25","children":["8957a5cd-0c61-47ed-82c0-27c023c278c4"]},"8957a5cd-0c61-47ed-82c0-27c023c278c4":{"id":"8957a5cd-0c61-47ed-82c0-27c023c278c4","message":{"id":"8957a5cd-0c61-47ed-82c0-27c023c278c4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762401224.778,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Explore the energy constraint further.

By then, the energy used for AI processing in the U.S. could surpass that of traditional energy-intensive industries like steel and cement manufacturing. Despite concerns, the IEA suggests AI could enhance energy efficiencies, potentially offsetting its carbon footprint by optimizing electricity grids, transportation systems, and industrial operations. However, only about half of AI's energy demand might be sourced from renewable resources. Critics, including former EU energy minister Claude Turmes, argue the IEA underplays the risks, asserting that unchecked AI proliferation may reverse energy efficiency gains and reinvigorate polluting energy sources like coal. Additionally, datacentres' high water consumption raises environmental concerns. Turmes calls for stronger regulatory frameworks to manage AI's environmental impact, criticizing the IEA for leniency potentially benefiting major tech firms and U.S. political interests.","title":"Energy demands from AI datacentres to quadruple by 2030, says report","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report"}],"type":"search_result_group"},{"domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"attribution":"www.reuters.com","pub_date":1749575345.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":51,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":0},"snippet":"According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook, U.S. electricity consumption is projected to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, driven largely by the growing demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Total power demand is forecasted to increase from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025 and 4,283 billion kWh in 2026. Residential, commercial, and industrial electricity usage is also expected to rise, nearing or exceeding historical record levels. In terms of energy sources, natural gas is projected to decline slightly from 42% of power generation in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026, while coal's share slowly decreases and renewables rise from 23% in 2024 to 27% in 2026. Nuclear power will slightly decline from 19% to 18% over the same period.

AI-optimized centres are projected to quadruple in electricity demand, though total data centre consumption will still represent only 3% of global electricity use. Despite concerns, the IEA believes AI's contribution to climate change may be overstated, noting emissions from data centres may rise to 300 million tonnes by 2035\u2014under 1.5% of global energy emissions\u2014while AI-driven efficiencies could reduce energy-related emissions by around 5%. Major tech companies are pursuing nuclear power deals to mitigate supply issues. However, increased pressure on electricity grids and regional disparities in power availability pose challenges. In the UK, companies advocate for zonal pricing to incentivize data centre development in high wind-energy regions like northern Scotland. The IEA emphasizes thoughtful planning and grid expansion to accommodate this rapid growth in AI and data infrastructure.","title":"AI forecast to fuel doubling in data centre electricity demand by 2030","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ai-forecast-to-fuel-doubling-in-data-centre-electricity-demand-by-2030-htd2zf7nx"}],"type":"search_result_group"}],"thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"f5f150ee-cb93-4373-8465-0ad496c91a62","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"423005c4-d700-463d-881b-c09afd1e2861","children":["a401e246-b1d4-4b35-baed-f3599b6a2d1c"]},"a401e246-b1d4-4b35-baed-f3599b6a2d1c":{"id":"a401e246-b1d4-4b35-baed-f3599b6a2d1c","message":{"id":"a401e246-b1d4-4b35-baed-f3599b6a2d1c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762401249.05468,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing energy and data center topics","content":"I have initial sources for data center demand and transformer shortages, plus info on fission topics like Vogtle, NRC approvals, and TerraPower.

El metano, un gas de efecto invernadero poderoso, es responsable de la mitad del calentamiento global ya experimentado. Desde 2006, las emisiones de metano han aumentado y seguir\u00e1n creciendo durante el resto de la d\u00e9cada de 2020 a menos que se tomen medidas para reducir esta contaminaci\u00f3n. El estudio se\u00f1ala que, a pesar de la atenci\u00f3n mundial en el di\u00f3xido de carbono, poco se ha hecho para abordar las emisiones de metano, que tiene un poder de calentamiento 80 veces mayor que el CO2 en los primeros 20 a\u00f1os de su liberaci\u00f3n en la atm\u00f3sfera. Las emisiones de metano provienen principalmente de la perforaci\u00f3n y procesamiento de petr\u00f3leo, gas y carb\u00f3n, as\u00ed como de la ganader\u00eda y la producci\u00f3n de arroz.

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 30% of temperature increases, is primarily leaked from coal mines and oil and gas wells. The US, China, and Russia are the largest methane emitters from fossil fuel extraction. The IEA's report suggests that $170 billion is required to cut global methane emissions by 75%, with $100 billion needed in the oil and gas sector and $70 billion in coal. Despite some countries' efforts, current methane emissions remain high. Improved monitoring, such as satellite technology, could help address leaks more effectively. The upcoming Cop29 UN climate summit in Azerbaijan may serve as a platform for stronger actions on methane reduction. Reducing methane emissions is crucial for slowing near-term global warming and preventing catastrophic climate change.","title":"Fossil fuel firms must plug methane leaks to meet climate targets, warns watchdog","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/13/fossil-fuel-firms-must-plug-methane-leaks-to-meet-climate-targets-warns-watchdog"},{"attribution":"www.theguardian.com","pub_date":1728043205.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":26,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":1},"snippet":"A recent study reveals that liquefied natural gas (LNG) is 33% worse for the environment, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, than coal over a 20-year period, debunking claims by the fossil-fuel industry that LNG is a cleaner alternative.

The release of this paper has incited both support from environmental scientists and resistance from the fossil fuel industry, facing intense scrutiny and political disputes. The findings challenge the previously held notion that LNG could serve as a \"bridge\" to a cleaner energy future, emphasizing the need to prioritize renewable energy sources instead.","title":"Exported gas produces far worse emissions than coal, major study finds","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/exported-liquefied-natural-gas-coal-study"},{"attribution":"www.theguardian.com","pub_date":1728945398.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":21,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":2},"snippet":"New evidence has surfaced suggesting that Australian liquified natural gas (LNG) exports may be more damaging to the climate than coal. Despite industry claims that gas is essential for transitioning to net zero emissions by displacing coal and reducing greenhouse gases, a study published in the journal Energy Science and Engineering indicates that total emissions from LNG are 33% higher than coal over a 20-year period. This is primarily due to methane leaks during extraction, transportation, and processing stages. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with significant short-term warming effects. Critics argue that the rationale for expanding Australia's LNG industry lacks substantiating data and call for a reassessment of fossil fuel policies. While some domestic use of gas will continue, especially for electricity backup and certain industrial processes, a broader discussion on the climate impacts and the future of fossil fuel exports is urgently needed. The study highlights the necessity of moving away from both gas and coal to mitigate climate change effectively.","title":"New evidence says gas exports damage the climate even more than coal.

Banks have invested heavily in these projects, exacerbating climate change concerns. The report identifies 8 new LNG export terminals and 99 new import terminals completed over the past two years, increasing global capacities significantly, with many more under development. Methane leaks from these new terminals could result in an estimated 10 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, undermining the goals of the Paris Agreement. The International Energy Agency also warned that the LNG market's oversupply could lead to lower fossil fuel prices, possibly deterring investments in renewable energy. Despite major banks committing to \"net zero\" targets, they lack specific policies on financing LNG projects, perpetuating future climate risks.","title":"'Climate bomb' warning over $200bn wave of new gas projects","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/05/climate-bomb-warning-over-200bn-wave-of-new-gas-projects"}],"type":"search_result_group"}],"thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"f5f150ee-cb93-4373-8465-0ad496c91a62","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"73338a1d-2eb5-43f6-b180-d81f9e4bd218","children":["403a7f3d-098b-4cce-80f7-163817419543"]},"403a7f3d-098b-4cce-80f7-163817419543":{"id":"403a7f3d-098b-4cce-80f7-163817419543","message":{"id":"403a7f3d-098b-4cce-80f7-163817419543","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762401262.392274,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing sources and fission critique","content":"I\u2019ll use reliable sources like IEA, EIA, NERC, and EPA for junior power demand, reliability, and methane emissions.

Overwhelmed by clean energy project requests, PJM and other regional operators like MISO and SPP have faced prolonged delays, averaging 40 months for grid connection studies. With over 2,600 GW of renewable projects awaiting connection by the end of 2023\u2014more than double the U.S.'s current capacity\u2014delays have increased risks and costs, causing some projects to be canceled. Since 2023, PJM has processed 140 GW of applications using automation and aims to reduce approval times to 1\u20132 years by 2026. New FERC rules encourage a 'first ready, first served' approach, requiring milestones and deposits to decrease speculative proposals. MISO and SPP also deploy advanced software for efficiency, with MISO reducing a connection study process from 686 days to just ten. SPP has cleared three years\u2019 worth of backlogs in one year and plans to introduce fixed upfront fees to enhance developer forecasting. Google, through multiple AI divisions, aims to support faster, more confident grid decision-making, highlighting the role of digital transformation in bolstering U.S. energy transition efforts.","title":"Google brings AI to grid teams slashing US connection times","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/google-brings-ai-grid-teams-slashing-us-connection-times-2025-05-20/"},{"attribution":"www.reuters.com","pub_date":1718897907.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":21,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":4},"snippet":"The U.S. is experiencing a surge in clean power projects, driven by increased electricity demand and incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. This has created significant pressure on regional grid authorities, with power capacity in grid connection queues increasing by 27% in 2023. Solar and energy storage make up 81% of these applications. The West non-ISO region, particularly Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and California's CAISO, has the highest volume of pending projects. Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) aim to alleviate grid congestion by studying project clusters and eliminating speculative projects. However, grid backlogs and long approval times are delaying new connections and increasing costs. The Biden administration's measures and new FERC rules are expected to ease these issues over the next few years, promoting faster and more efficient grid connections. Additionally, proactive transmission planning is emerging, with grid operators preparing for long-term electricity needs and reducing future connection delays.","title":"Western US embraces grid reforms but solar queues will linger","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/western-us-embraces-grid-reforms-solar-queues-will-linger-2024-06-20/"},{"attribution":"www.reuters.com","pub_date":1760980371.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":24,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":4},"snippet":"As U.S. electricity demand grows, particularly due to the rise in data centers, new manufacturing facilities, and electrification, grid investments are accelerating. According to Wood Mackenzie, investments in transmission and distribution grids are set to increase by 23% between 2025 and 2030, following a 27% rise from 2020 to 2025. Aging infrastructure and extreme weather further necessitate urgent upgrades, with over 30% of transmission assets past their useful life. Private investors, including private equity firms, are contributing to this shift, drawn by regulated returns and opportunities in merchant projects.\n\nData centers alone could consume up to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2030. This surge is prompting grid operators like CAISO and utilities such as PG&E to pivot funding toward accommodating growing demand rather than just expanding renewable generation. For instance, PG&E plans to invest $73 billion by 2030 to handle 10 GW of new data center load. Federal support under the Biden administration through infrastructure laws and tax incentives has strengthened grid resilience, though Trump\u2019s policies aim to streamline permitting, potentially favoring fossil fuel infrastructure. Overall, long-term planning and regional investment are essential to modernizing the grid and meeting booming demand.","title":"US grid investors focus on demand hotspots in planning shift","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-grid-investors-focus-demand-hotspots-planning-shift--reeii-2025-10-20/"}],"type":"search_result_group"}],"thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"f5f150ee-cb93-4373-8465-0ad496c91a62","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"be093c94-17f1-43a6-a0ad-22e5307475a8","children":["5d81af1b-5143-4eb2-8751-9a63c54dbd8d"]},"5d81af1b-5143-4eb2-8751-9a63c54dbd8d":{"id":"5d81af1b-5143-4eb2-8751-9a63c54dbd8d","message":{"id":"5d81af1b-5143-4eb2-8751-9a63c54dbd8d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762401271.90487,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into fusion updates","content":"I\u2019ll include the latest on fusion developments, such as LLL\u2019s NIF ignition and private companies like Helion.

This funding will accelerate the development of Helion's advanced fusion reactor, which seeks to create carbon-free electricity without producing long-lasting radioactive waste. Helion's unique approach captures fusion energy directly through electromagnetic induction rather than using the traditional method of heating water into steam to turn a turbine. The company, which currently employs 450 people, plans to start manufacturing its own capacitors in-house, creating approximately 100 new jobs. This will streamline the production process of their fusion machines, which currently rely on 6,000 capacitors and 50,000 thyristors from external suppliers. Additional investors in the funding round include Lightspeed Venture Partners, a major university endowment fund, as well as existing investors such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Mithril Capital, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, and steel producer Nucor. Helion also has an agreement with Microsoft to provide power starting in 2028.","title":"Helion raises $425 mln from SoftBank's venture arm, hits $5.4 bln valuation","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/helion-raises-425-mln-softbanks-venture-arm-hits-54-bln-valuation-2025-01-28/"}],"type":"search_result_group"},{"domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"attribution":"www.ft.com","pub_date":1756398539.854,"ref_id":{"ref_index":37,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":5},"snippet":"Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a leading nuclear fusion developer, has raised approximately $900 million in its latest funding round from investors including Nvidia\u2019s venture arm NVentures, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Counterpoint Global, and a consortium led by Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co. This brings CFS\u2019s total funding to nearly $3 billion since its spinout from MIT in 2018. The funds will support the completion of its Sparc fusion demonstration machine and the development of the world\u2019s first large-scale fusion power plant in Virginia, a key location due to its concentration of data centers. CFS also signed a commercial agreement to supply 200 megawatts of electricity to Google, positioning it at the forefront of commercial fusion efforts. The surge in investment comes amid rising energy demand driven by AI, with U.S. data center energy needs projected to more than double by 2035. Despite strong investor interest and technological progress, experts caution that producing net-positive energy from fusion remains a significant hurdle due to the extreme conditions required, casting doubt on its economic viability.","title":"Nuclear fusion developer raises almost $900mn in new funding","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/56e46e48-a0ff-4432-8a78-c5335556c24f"}],"type":"search_result_group"},{"domain":"time.com","entries":[{"attribution":"time.com","pub_date":1704729592.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":40,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":5},"snippet":"On December 5, 2022, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California, achieved a groundbreaking milestone in nuclear fusion, with a fusion experiment generating more energy than it consumed. Using 192 lasers, the experiment produced 3.15 megajoules of energy from 2.05 megajoules of input, showcasing a potential path to sustainable, clean energy. This success reignited global interest and sparked optimism in the fusion energy sector.\n\nDespite this breakthrough, scientists acknowledge that significant challenges remain. NIF's current setup is not designed for energy production, and notable improvements in energy output and efficiency are still necessary. Subsequent experiments have sought to replicate and exceed the December 2022 results, with varying levels of success, leading to both triumphs and frustrations.\n\nThe core mission of NIF, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, involves supporting nuclear weapons research rather than energy development. Nonetheless, the progress made in fusion ignition has broad implications for future energy applications. The journey continues as researchers refine techniques and aim for even greater energy yields, emphasizing the need for persistent innovation and realism about the path to commercial fusion power.","title":"Inside the Nuclear Fusion Facility That Changed the World","type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/6344755/nuclear-fusion-nif/"}],"type":"search_result_group"}],"thinking_effort":"extended","timestamp_":"absolute","turn_exchange_id":"f5f150ee-cb93-4373-8465-0ad496c91a62","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ec36c865-c0f3-40b7-b003-4389a4b3e8de","children":["6318e91f-5c69-49a6-ae10-b6ed6259779f"]},"6318e91f-5c69-49a6-ae10-b6ed6259779f":{"id":"6318e91f-5c69-49a6-ae10-b6ed6259779f","message":{"id":"6318e91f-5c69-49a6-ae10-b6ed6259779f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762401277.975939,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into solar scaling","content":"I\u2019ll include information on solar power scaling, focusing on IEA\u2019s 2024-2025 renewable growth predictions, including solar LCOE (levelized cost of energy) declines.

Despite this achievement, the growth is insufficient to meet the COP28 climate summit's 2023 target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 to help limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. REN21 projects a shortfall of 6.2 terawatts, exceeding all renewables currently in place. Solar photovoltaic (PV) led the expansion, accounting for 81% of new capacity, driven by a rise in rooftop installations in developing countries and falling technology costs. Solar PV remains the only renewable technology on track to meet its contribution to the capacity target.\n\nHowever, recent setbacks include policy reversals in countries like the U.S., which exited the Paris Agreement, and New Zealand, which lifted its ban on offshore oil and gas exploration. Additionally, trade restrictions and reduced investments by oil companies and banks have hindered progress. REN21 Executive Director Rana Adib emphasized that record deployment is not enough without coherent policies, coordinated planning, and robust infrastructure to support a lasting transition to renewable energy.","title":"Record renewables capacity falls short of global target, REN21 says","type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/record-renewables-capacity-falls-short-global-target-ren21-says-2025-06-24/"}],"type":"search_result_group"},{"domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"attribution":"apnews.com","pub_date":1742979636.0,"ref_id":{"ref_index":22,"ref_type":"news","turn_index":6},"snippet":"In 2024, the installation of renewable energy worldwide reached a new record, with 92.5% of new electricity coming from clean sources like solar and wind.

Holtec, which initially acquired the site for decommissioning, now plans to relaunch it as the first U.S. commercial reactor to restart after shutdown, citing increased energy demand from AI and data centers.\n\nThe 800-megawatt plant would supply enough carbon-free electricity to power over 800,000 households, contributing to grid reliability. Holtec also intends to install two small modular reactors (SMRs) based on current light water reactor technology at the site. In partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, Holtec has broader plans to develop 10 gigawatts of SMRs across North America by the 2030s, starting with Palisades.

Despite the push to revitalize the plant, it must still pass inspections and gain approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Palisades plant, located by Lake Michigan, was originally owned by CMS Energy before being sold to Entergy in 2007 and shut down in 2022.

Here\u2019s the energy constraint as it actually looks, and what it implies for AI-scale compute.\n\n# What\u2019s binding now (and why \u201celectrons\u201d really are the constraint)\n- **Load is surging** from data centers (AI especially). The IEA projects data-center electricity demand to more than double by 2030 (~945 TWh), with AI-optimized centers quadrupling their use; EIA sees U.S. power consumption at record highs in 2025\u201326 largely due to data centers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0news51\ue201  \n- **Grid plumbing is the bottleneck** as much as generation: multi-year interconnection queues (2.6 TW+ in U.S. queues), long lead times for HV transformers, and summer reliability margins that can flip with normal outage rates. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search14\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n## Short-term: Gas as the \u201cfastest knob\u201d (with caveats)\n- Why it\u2019s used: fast permitting, dispatchability, and existing gas turbines that can be spun up to meet campus-scale loads. EIA still sees gas dominating U.S. generation near-term even as its share nudges down. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue201  \n- The climate catch is **methane**: leak rates and LNG liquefaction/shipping can erase the \u201ccleaner-than-coal\u201d claim on 20-year warming horizons. The IEA\u2019s methane tracker finds energy-sector methane significantly under-reported; EPA\u2019s 2024\u201325 rules tighten LDAR, but effectiveness depends on enforcement and actual leak rates. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- On LNG specifically, literature disagrees: Howarth (2024) finds LNG ~33% worse than coal on GWP20; DOE/NETL frameworks often find LNG better than coal depending on assumptions. Treat LNG emissions as **scenario-sensitive** and location-specific. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search17\ue201\n\n## The \u201cskip\u201d: Fission today vs Fusion tomorrow\nAltman leans solar+fusion long-term. That\u2019s visionary, but **fission is the only firm, carbon-free scale resource available now** and it\u2019s already moving to serve AI loads.\n\n- **New large fission exists:** Vogtle Unit 4 entered commercial service in 2024 (AP1000), finishing the only large U.S. build of the decade. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Life-extension & restarts are real:** The U.S. is restarting Palisades (first ever U.S. restart from decommissioning) with federal loan support and PPAs; NRC approvals progressed mid-2025 and fuel was delivered Oct-2025. \ue200cite\ue202turn7news21\ue202turn7search2\ue202turn7search12\ue201  \n- **Hyperscaler nuclear PPAs:** Microsoft\u2013Constellation (restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1/\u201cCrane Clean Energy Center\u201d), Amazon\u2013Talen (Susquehanna), Meta\u2013Constellation (Clinton) show a direct line from AI demand to nuclear supply.

This is likely *why* he skipped it in a sound-bite; it\u2019s not that it\u2019s irrelevant\u2014it\u2019s that it\u2019s **not instantly elastic** to AI\u2019s near-term power appetite. The grid constraints above make that explicit. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search5\ue202turn4search0\ue201\n\n## Fusion: inspirational, not bankable (yet)\n- Physics progress is real: NIF set new ignition records in 2024\u201325; CFS SPARC construction is underway; Helion broke ground and maintains a 2028 PPA target with Microsoft. But none of this is dispatchable commercial power you can plan a 2027\u20132030 campus around. Treat fusion as **R&D-adjacent optionality**, not the backbone of a five-year capacity plan. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn5search3\ue201\n\n## Solar\u2019s role (and its limit without wires)\n- PV is scaling fastest and cheapest on LCOE terms; record global additions in 2024 with sustained growth through 2030. But without transmission and multi-hour storage, PV can\u2019t *alone* anchor 24/7 AI loads. Expect PV+BESS to cover a growing **fraction** of inference time-shifts (night shifting via storage is still costly beyond 4\u20138 h). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search2\ue202turn6search3\ue201\n\n# Practical implications for AI/compute planners (what I\u2019d actually do)\n1) **Near-term (0\u20133 yrs):**  \n   - Lock **firm, carbon-free blocks** via nuclear PPAs (uprates, restarts, life-extensions) where grid topology works; backfill ramping with contracted gas under stringent methane controls and LDAR covenants. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search1\ue202turn7news21\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n   - Site new load where **transformer and interconnect capacity** is actually available; model lead times explicitly. If not, co-locate next to existing nuclear/hydro with spare export capacity. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search5\ue201  \n   - Deploy **PV+BESS** behind-the-meter for peak-shaving and to time-shift inference, not as sole baseload. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search3\ue201\n\n2) **Mid-term (3\u20137 yrs):**  \n   - Treat **SMRs** and **advanced reactors** as pipeline options, but don\u2019t assume first-of-a-kind schedules; demand escrowed milestones and regulatory step downs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n   - Aggressively pursue **grid-enhancing tech** and interconnection reforms (cluster studies, \u201cfirst-ready, first-served\u201d) in host ISOs; this is often faster than greenfield generation. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news20\ue201\n\n3) **Long-term (7\u201315 yrs):**  \n   - Keep **fusion** as out-year optionality (PPAs with go/no-go cliffs). If it slips, you still have a fission-plus-renewables spine. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue201\n\n# My bottom line on Altman\u2019s framing\n- **Gas \u201cfor now,\u201d fusion \u201clater\u201d** misses the **present availability of fission** as the only scalable, carbon-free firm supply that hyperscalers are already contracting\u2014despite its headaches. If you want electrons for AI that don\u2019t blow up emissions inventories, **fission + PV/BESS + wires** is the practical stack this decade. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news30\ue202turn7search1\ue201  \n- The real constraint isn\u2019t just kWh\u2014it\u2019s **deliverable, firm capacity at the right node**.

This initiative is part of the former Biden administration's efforts to promote nuclear energy for its nearly emissions-free power, addressing climate change and rising electricity demands from AI, electric vehicles, and digital currencies. The disbursement follows the first loan of approximately $38 million in January. The Palisades reactor, closed by Entergy in 2022 after over 50 years of operation, is expected to be reopened by Holtec in late 2025, pending permits from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The approvals allow Holtec to load fuel, but further licensing and regulatory reviews are still needed before the plant can resume full operations. Holtec, which initially acquired the site for decommissioning, now plans to relaunch it as the first U.S. commercial reactor to restart after shutdown, citing increased energy demand from AI and data centers.\n\nThe 800-megawatt plant would supply enough carbon-free electricity to power over 800,000 households, contributing to grid reliability. Holtec also intends to install two small modular reactors (SMRs) based on current light water reactor technology at the site. In partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, Holtec has broader plans to develop 10 gigawatts of SMRs across North America by the 2030s, starting with Palisades.
