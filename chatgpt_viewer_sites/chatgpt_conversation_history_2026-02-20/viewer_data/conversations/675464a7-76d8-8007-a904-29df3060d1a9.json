One common way to avoid that warning is to use `.loc` explicitly.

If the warning still appears, consider verifying that `df` is not already a slice of another DataFrame. In that case, you can create a copy first:\n\n```python\ndf = df.copy()  # Make a copy to avoid chained indexing\ndf.loc[:, column] = df.loc[:, column].str.replace(\" \", \"\", regex=False)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `assign`:\n\n```python\ndf = df.assign(**{column: df[column].str.replace(\" \", \"\", regex=False)})\n```\n\nThis approach also safely returns a modified DataFrame without triggering `SettingWithCopyWarning`."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"c56a06e1-ef23-4746-982e-8121009392b9","request_id":"8ee56cb5ce1f3ff4-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c56a06e1-ef23-4746-982e-8121009392b9","children":[]}}}
