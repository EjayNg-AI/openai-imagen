In this view, the correlations observed in quantum experiments between entangled particles do not reflect any nonlocal influence but are instead a consequence of this prior determination of all events. This means that the seemingly random choices made in these experiments are not truly free but are determined by factors that were set in motion earlier in the history of the universe.\n\nCritics of superdeterminism argue that it undermines the concept of free will and makes scientific experimentation problematic, as the outcomes of experiments would be pre-determined rather than influenced by independent variable manipulation. Its supporters, however, see it as a potential resolution to the challenges posed by quantum entanglements and Bell's inequalities without needing to invoke nonlocality or other extraordinary measures."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"6df112f6-20e4-40ea-b189-bac0f7cc3a22","request_id":"88227e3ee9729c7a-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6df112f6-20e4-40ea-b189-bac0f7cc3a22","children":[]}}}
