Consequently, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approval ratings have plummeted, with a majority of Israelis wishing for his resignation post-war. Despite Netanyahu's historically strong political grip, his party, Likud, has seen a drastic decrease in support, and alternatives like Benny Gantz have gained popularity. Speaking with political scientist Dahlia Scheindlin, trends suggest Israel\u2019s political rightward drift is unlikely to reverse soon. While some observers hope the crisis might prompt a reconsideration of Israel's stance on the Palestinian conflict, Scheindlin cautions that the public may instead support even more stringent security measures. Despite this political bleakness, there is a slight indication that the extreme right has not gained additional support post-crisis, indicating some potential, albeit limited, political flexibility.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1702065110.796,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686fdfbfeb1c80078c14512d0297f69c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"6438a4af-ad4f-40e4-8a68-c01f161a23fe","request_id":"95d12d8e98c425fd-SEA","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6438a4af-ad4f-40e4-8a68-c01f161a23fe","children":["d5d70dc8-f76b-4d71-a9dd-b16e92c52712"]},"d5d70dc8-f76b-4d71-a9dd-b16e92c52712":{"id":"d5d70dc8-f76b-4d71-a9dd-b16e92c52712","message":{"id":"d5d70dc8-f76b-4d71-a9dd-b16e92c52712","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752162249.431812,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering sources for Singapore\u2019s stance on Gaza","content":"I\u2019ll pull information from various sources, such as MFA Singapore for official government statements and look for local activism, petitions, and public donations regarding the Gaza conflict.

Domestically, however, sympathy for the Palestinians\u2014especially among Malay-Muslims\u2014runs far ahead of the government\u2019s guarded tone, creating periodic friction that the authorities manage through legal controls on public assembly, hate-speech laws and inter-faith outreach.  Internationally, Singapore tries to reassure Muslim-majority neighbours that its policy is principled rather than pro-Israel, while preserving vital defence and technology links with Israel.  \n\n---\n\n## 1  Government Position  \n\n| Pillar | Illustrative actions & statements | Direction of travel |\n|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Humanitarian ceasefire & rule of law** | MFA calls (20 May 2025) for \u201cimmediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d and unimpeded aid, coupled with demand that Hamas release hostages \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 | Tone has grown sharper since late-2023 as Gaza civilian toll climbed. |\n| **Two-state solution & eventual recognition** | MFA (17 Apr 2025) reiterated intent to recognise Palestine \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d once conditions allow \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201; reiterated in Parliament, 7 Feb 2025 \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201 | Signals more public support for Palestinian statehood while keeping flexibility. |\n| **Consistent pro-UN multilateralism** | Voted **yes** in UNGA on 27 Oct 2023 humanitarian-truce resolution; MFA later defended vote despite text\u2019s omissions \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search6\ue201 | Pattern of voting aligns with Singapore\u2019s \u201crules-based order\u201d narrative. |\n| **Visible outreach** | FM Vivian Balakrishnan toured Ramallah (Mar 2024), accompanying third tranche of Singapore aid to Gaza\u2014viewed by analysts as \u201cvisible gesture\u201d that Singapore is \u201cmore vocal on excessiveness of Israel\u2019s behaviour\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue201 | Outreach helps blunt criticism from Muslim neighbours while maintaining Israeli ties. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  Cabinet consistently frames the conflict through a legal-humanitarian lens, avoids siding with either belligerent, but has in practice edged closer to open criticism of Israeli tactics since 2024 without abandoning its security partnership with Israel. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2  Domestic Public Sentiment  \n\n### 2.1  Grass-roots sympathy for Gaza  \n\n* **Fund-raising:**  Muslim charities quickly mobilised; the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation\u2019s 2024 campaign raised **S$2.5 million** within weeks \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201.  \n* **Petitions & boycotts:**  An online petition (June 2025) seeking a ban on Israeli arms firms at the 2026 Singapore Airshow gained >2,600 signatures in its first day \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue201.  \n* **Street activism:**  Activist Gilbert Goh received a stern police warning for 17 alleged Public Order Act breaches linked to Gaza-solidarity events at Speakers\u2019 Corner in 2023-25 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\n\n### 2.2  Counter-currents and official concern  \n\n* **Hate-speech vigilance:**  In Oct 2023 alone the police recorded eight anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim incidents; Ministers highlighted need to \u201cprotect the local Jewish community\u201d and deter Islamophobia \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search5\ue201.  \n* **Public-opinion data:**  The Israel-Hamas war ranked as the **top geopolitical worry** among Singapore respondents in the 2024 ISEAS \u201cState of Southeast Asia\u201d survey, ahead of the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait disputes \ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue201.  \n\n**Interpretation:**  Sympathy for Palestinians is mainstream\u2014especially among Malays but also many non-Muslims who view Gaza through a humanitarian lens.  At the same time, most citizens accept Singapore\u2019s long-standing bans on large demonstrations and hate speech; open confrontation with the state remains limited to tightly-policed Speaker\u2019s Corner events and online petitions.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Risk of Government\u2013Citizen Divergence  \n\n| Issue | Likelihood | Potential impact | Mitigating factors |\n|-------|------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Policy legitimacy gap** \u2013 perception that government is \u201csoft on Israel\u201d | Moderate during spikes of Gaza violence | Erosion of trust among younger Muslims; social-media polarisation | Regular parliamentary updates; visible aid deliveries; promise of future Palestinian recognition |\n| **Inter-faith tension & hate speech** | Low-to-moderate; past incidents small-scale | Could strain Chinese\u2013Malay relations and unsettle 2,500-strong Jewish community | Strict Sedition Act & POHA enforcement; strong religious-leader networks; public education campaigns |\n| **Foreign-policy criticism by neighbours** | Moderate, tied to Malaysia & Indonesia domestic politics | Diplomatic pressure; economic boycotts unlikely but rhetorical censure possible | Singapore\u2019s humanitarian aid, Balakrishnan\u2019s Ramallah visit, consistent UN voting reassure neighbours |\n\nOverall, the managed-pluralism model\u2014legal curbs plus proactive inter-religious dialogue\u2014has so far contained fissures.  The bigger test would come if Israel undertakes a major new offensive or if Singapore deepens security cooperation with Israel in a way that gains public visibility.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Regional and International Optics  \n\n* **ASEAN divergence:**  October 2023 ASEAN chair\u2019s statement noted the *varied* national positions on Gaza, illustrating that Singapore sits between pro-Palestinian Malaysia/Indonesia and U.S. allies like the Philippines \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.  \n* **Neighbour sensitivities:**  Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta routinely use strong pro-Palestinian rhetoric; Singapore\u2019s expanded aid flights to Egypt/Jordan and Ramallah visit have been read by regional analysts as balancing moves to avoid being cast as Israel-leaning.  \n* **Great-power triangulation:**  By anchoring its stance in UN votes and humanitarian law, Singapore shields itself from U.S.\u2013China rivalry narratives and maintains access to Israeli defence tech while minimising reputational cost in the Muslim world.\n\n---\n\n## 5  Forward-Looking Assessment  \n\n1. **Domestic cohesion:**  Likely to hold unless a severe Gaza escalation coincides with inflammatory local rhetoric.  The sedition/enhanced-harassment legal framework gives authorities tools to act swiftly, but perceptions of selective enforcement could backfire; transparent criteria are essential.  \n2. **Policy calibration:**  A carefully-timed formal recognition of Palestine\u2014once meaningful peace talks resume\u2014would satisfy many citizens and neighbours without jeopardising Israeli ties.  Singapore has already signalled this possibility.  \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n3. **Soft-power dividends:**  Expanding scholarship slots for Palestinian civil servants (through the Enhanced Technical Assistance Package) and spotlighting Singapore\u2019s humanitarian expertise can reinforce the narrative that the city-state is principled rather than partisan.  \n4. **Watch-points:**  \n   * Surge in online antisemitism or Islamophobia during future Gaza flare-ups.  \n   * Pressure campaigns (e.g., Airshow boycott drives) that could force visible policy decisions.  \n   * Evolving U.S. or Chinese positions that might complicate Singapore\u2019s \u201crules-based order\u201d framing.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion  \n\nSingapore\u2019s Gaza policy walks a tightrope between moral principle, realpolitik and domestic pluralism.  The state\u2019s incremental shift toward a more explicitly pro-humanitarian and pro-Palestinian-rights rhetoric since 2023 keeps it broadly aligned with public sentiment and regional expectations, while its continued security and economic engagement with Israel serves core national interests.  The main challenge is not an immediate social rift but managing the optics\u2014both at home and abroad\u2014of that delicate balance as the Gaza crisis grinds on."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":1064,"end_idx":1083,"safe_urls":["https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/05/Spokespersons-comments-gaza-20-may-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Home](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/05/Spokespersons-comments-gaza-20-may-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"MFA Spokesperson's Comments on Gaza, 20 May 2025","url":"https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/05/Spokespersons-comments-gaza-20-may-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747699200.0,"snippet":"Singapore calls for the immediate full resumption of humanitarian aid for the Palestinian civilians in Gaza and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Home"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201","start_idx":1314,"end_idx":1333,"safe_urls":["https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/04/MFA-Spokesperson-Comments-on-the-Issue-of-Recognition-of-Palestinian-State-April-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Home](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/04/MFA-Spokesperson-Comments-on-the-Issue-of-Recognition-of-Palestinian-State-April-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"MFA Spokesperson's Comments in Response to Media Queries on ...","url":"https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/04/MFA-Spokesperson-Comments-on-the-Issue-of-Recognition-of-Palestinian-State-April-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The MFA Spokesperson said: \u201cSingapore has consistently supported the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland based on a negotiated two state solution.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Home"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":1372,"end_idx":1389,"safe_urls":["https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/02/20250207-Comments-on-Gaza"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Home](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2025/02/20250207-Comments-on-Gaza))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore -

Since late May 2025, over 400 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured near GHF\u2019s distribution centers due to Israeli forces firing on overcrowded civilians. Unlike standard humanitarian practices, GHF\u2019s distribution lacked recipient registration, sufficient sites, or coordination, resulting in chaotic scenes. Witnesses and experts criticized the system for routing desperate civilians close to military positions, triggering panic and violence. Despite warnings from the UN and aid organizations, the program went ahead with inadequate crowd management and security protocols handled by American private contractors and the Israeli military.

The Israeli ministry of defence and 11 of its contractors, including prominent firms like Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and Elbit Systems, attended the event. Despite the conflict in Gaza, there was notable interest in Israel's defence products, including missiles, spy gear, and aerial drones. Representatives from Israeli defence companies declined to comment on the Gaza war and the performance of their weapons. The conflict, which began after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, resulting in over 1,200 deaths and hostages, and Israel's subsequent military offensive in Gaza, was not a topic of discussion at the airshow. The war drew international criticism, but at the event, Israeli defence firms experienced ongoing interest from potential buyers.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1708661828.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686fdfbfeb1c80078c14512d0297f69c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"479ea733-4ff0-46b8-a155-552f310689e0","request_id":"95d137bd78e825fd-SEA","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"479ea733-4ff0-46b8-a155-552f310689e0","children":["86ed37cd-9df3-400e-bd9f-e8e540e6f46e"]},"86ed37cd-9df3-400e-bd9f-e8e540e6f46e":{"id":"86ed37cd-9df3-400e-bd9f-e8e540e6f46e","message":{"id":"86ed37cd-9df3-400e-bd9f-e8e540e6f46e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752162718.857121,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring Pro-Israel Sentiment","content":"I\u2019ve found sources showing Israeli defense firms at the Singapore Airshow and reports of the government rejecting protest applications.

Since late May 2025, over 400 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured near GHF\u2019s distribution centers due to Israeli forces firing on overcrowded civilians. Unlike standard humanitarian practices, GHF\u2019s distribution lacked recipient registration, sufficient sites, or coordination, resulting in chaotic scenes. Witnesses and experts criticized the system for routing desperate civilians close to military positions, triggering panic and violence. Despite warnings from the UN and aid organizations, the program went ahead with inadequate crowd management and security protocols handled by American private contractors and the Israeli military. The Israeli Defense Forces claimed to use \"warning shots\" against perceived threats approaching military areas, but video evidence and eyewitness reports suggest direct firing at crowds. GHF denies culpability, asserting centers are not involved in the violence, while UN officials refuse to cooperate with programs channeling civilians into militarized zones.

Ex-President Halimah Yacob\u2019s outspoken advocacy sits at the sharper end of that spectrum but, so far, her claims about GHF and aid access have *not* been proven false; they mirror ongoing UN criticisms.  The larger challenge lies in preventing online passions from spilling into sectarian friction at home or diplomatic costs abroad, a balancing act the state continues to manage through tight assembly laws, inter-faith outreach and calibrated foreign-policy signalling."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201","start_idx":723,"end_idx":742,"safe_urls":["https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/05/11/the-link-between-pofma-isa-and-all-of-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Online Citizen](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/05/11/the-link-between-pofma-isa-and-all-of-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The link between POFMA, ISA, and all of us - The Online Citizen","url":"https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/05/11/the-link-between-pofma-isa-and-all-of-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1557532800.0,"snippet":"The Rhetoric: \u201cLaws to curb fake news target false statements of facts, not opinions2.\u201d [box type=\u201dshadow\u201d align=\u201d\u201d class=\u201d\u201d width=\u201d\u201d].
