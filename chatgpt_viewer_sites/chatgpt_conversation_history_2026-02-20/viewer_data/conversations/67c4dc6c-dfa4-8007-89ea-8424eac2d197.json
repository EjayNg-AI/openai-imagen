UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and President Zelensky of Ukraine led the discussions, proposing a one-month truce to allow for de-escalation. Macron emphasized the need for increased European defense spending and flexibility in EU fiscal rules. Other leaders, including Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Dutch PM Dick Schoof, echoed the necessity of strengthening Ukraine militarily and economically weakening Russia.\n\nThe importance of transatlantic relations was highlighted, with European leaders in agreement on the need for a robust defense strategy that aligns with the US. However, tension between the US and European approaches to the conflict was evident, especially after a contentious meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky. Discussions at the summit included a unified European response, potential troop deployments for peacekeeping, and increased defense spending to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security.\n\nThe summit aimed to solidify a plan to end the conflict, with the UK, France, and other European nations working closely with the US. Economic support for Ukraine and targeted sanctions on Russia were also focal points, aiming to bring an enduring resolution to the ongoing war.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":2071,"end_idx":2072,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Latest: Britain's Starmer says Europe must take responsibility for defending itself","url":"https://apnews.com/article/7ce3c65b90b9618d9877372514e90c77","pub_date":1740907403.0,"snippet":"Ukraine supporters rally outside 10 Downing Street  A crowd of thousands rallied in support of Ukraine outside the British prime minister's residence.

Vice-President JD Vance also criticized Zelenskyy for being antagonistic. Despite the acrimonious encounter, Zelenskyy expressed hope that the relationship could be salvaged, but warned that Ukraine could not easily compromise with Russia. The fallout from the meeting has put US military support for Ukraine in jeopardy, with the Trump administration considering ending ongoing military aid.
