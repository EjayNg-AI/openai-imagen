David Shapiro here. Today's podcast is a little bit shooting from the hip, and it was inspired because I get sent articles, blog posts, tweets, and messages all the time from people trying to wrap their heads around post-labor economics. This is not a criticism; it's complex, and it's great that people are engaging. However, there is one frequent gap, a common misunderstanding of one of the core concessions of post-labor economics. Just as a quick recap, the reason it's called post-labor economics is because labor, as we understand it, is going away as the central mechanism of distribution of wealth. Labor today is one of the primary ways wealth is reallocated across society. You have a labor market with job seekers and employers, employees and employers\u2014people hiring and people looking\u2014and in this market you try to optimize your market value. This is applying free-market economics to the labor side of the economy rather than just goods and services. The idea is that it's a self-sorting machine: due to rational self-interest, you try to make more money at your next job than you make at this job. That's how the whole thing works.\r\n\r\nThe Individual Perspective and Why Growth Sectors Won\u2019t Save Us\r\nHowever, in the future, as artificial intelligence and robotics are on the rise, you will not be getting jobs. We're already seeing people getting laid off because of anticipation of automation, and sometimes it's actual automation. From an individual perspective, this is terrifying. On an individual level, it's like, wow, you're saying that I have no agency and no authority and there's nothing I can do. And that is my belief: in the long run, over the next 10 to 15 years, there is pretty much jack diddly squat that anyone on an individual level can do to change this.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons is you might say, \"What about jobs being created or jobs flowing to new areas?\" And there are growth areas. For sure there are insane growth areas\u2014the attention economy, the influencer market, the meaning economy. These things are growing, but they are not growing fast enough to absorb all of the labor refugees. In fact, depending on how you slice and dice the data, they're growing at about a third of the rate, a fifth of the rate, or a tenth of the rate of what they would need to be to absorb all of the developers and HR people that are going to get laid off. The math is straightforward: if this trend continues, then within about 50 years pretty much all jobs are going to be gone. I mean all jobs, but the bulk of the layoffs are going to happen before 2040. People don't like it when you say, \"There\u2019s nothing you can do to ensure that you have a job.\" This is one of the core concessions of post-labor economics, and it's one reason I've had a hard time running communities around this. People have their anxiety and they're like, \"Dave, tell me what to do.\" And I'm like, \"There's literally nothing you can do.\" They don't like that, so people don't sign up for the communities where I tell them there's nothing you can do\u2014you\u2019re up the creek without a paddle in the long run. We have to have collective action.\r\n\r\nThe Limits of Personal Monetization: Data, Attention, and Winners-Take-All\r\nWhen people start to dig into this, they say, \"What if we look at supply and demand from a different perspective? What if we look at labor supply versus labor demand? What if we look at consumer demand, and what is the actual economic unit of a person?\" This is the core trap: people try to look at it as an individual problem. You say, \"What can we do as an individual?\" I get sent a comment or a blog post where someone tries to wrap their head around, \"All right, there's nothing we can do individually to secure future employment, but what if there are other ways we can seek rent?\" They're like, \"What about our data?\" And it's like, your data is only worth about $300 a year\u2014sorry. Even if you create a data union and you double that or triple that or even multiply it by 10x\u2014which you're not going to, by the way\u2014that\u2019s only $3,000 a year, which anywhere in the Western world is like two months of rent at most. That's not going to cover your bills. That's not a replacement for wages from labor.\r\n\r\nOne of the reactions people have is, \"What do we have that we can monetize? What do we have that we can parlay into more economic power?\" The point is\u2014that\u2019s the point of post-labor\u2014there isn't. You can't. There are no options. It's a fundamentally different paradigm. We're looking at a fundamentally different distribution system, a fundamentally different reallocation method of allocating wealth across the world. Predistribution and redistribution are the two paradigms moving forward.\r\n\r\nIt is existentially terrifying when you first come to terms with the fact that AI and robotics are on the rise. The labor supply is going to get swamped: robots are going to be better, faster, cheaper, safer than humans; AI is going to be better, faster, cheaper, safer than humans. There aren't going to be any skills left that humans have that are valuable, at least in bulk. There will be a few edge cases here and there, but not everyone's going to be a PhD in rocket science. Not everyone's going to be a star comedian or whatever else. You might say, \"What if we all become influencers?\" By the way, I capture like 50,000 hours of attention per month, and that amortizes only to about $2,000 a month. When you add the math, not everyone can capture 50,000 hours of attention per month. I'm not banking on that lasting forever because as more and more people join the space, I get less and less time and attention. It's ruthless competition. Even if you're a star in the attention economy, the attention economy is winners take most. The top 1 percentile takes more than 90% of the attention. So that's dead on arrival as well.\r\n\r\nWhy Only Systemic Solutions Can Work\r\nThis leaves us with the only solution being a massive systemic solution. It is a nationwide or planet-wide fundamental refactoring of the capitalist fabric of how society works. That means the problem is way harder, because if you want to sit there and try to create a data union or a consumer co-op or whatever, it's not going to work. Let's follow one of these threads. The idea I was just sent that inspired this was someone proposing a consumer cooperative. Yes, this is something I propose a little bit in my forthcoming book and in my blog posts: if we consumers band together and create cooperatives, that can get us a little bit more off the top. We can purchase to own. But if you don't have wages from labor\u2014labor income\u2014then you don't have any income, which means you don't have purchasing power, which means you have no consumption power. It's a self-referential paradox. I don't fault anyone for getting stuck in this existential death spiral because on an individual level there is no solution. That's all there is to it.\r\n\r\nSo then you say, \"What are the systemic solutions?\" The systemic solutions are big and messy and unsure. They're being piloted all over the world in bits and pieces, but nothing so far has been put together that is compelling enough to say, \"This will result in $60,000 a year of income per household or more,\" unless you literally take from the rich and give to the poor. Then you might say, \"What about tax burdens? What about tax flight?\" And you don't want to be wholly dependent on the government, which I agree with. Are we going to raise the top marginal tax rate back up to 75% or 90% just to keep the economy going? That's not efficient. That flies in the face of pretty much all market orthodoxy. The reason we have a labor market is because it's an efficiency-seeking superorganism. The reason we have a free-market economy around goods and services is because it's efficiency-seeking. Yes, I know it doesn't apply to everything like health care and utility scale. That's fine. But by and large, free-market economics, when applied to labor markets and other kinds of markets, tends to be self-sorting.\r\n\r\nThe whole point though is that the labor market is going to implode, because rather than hiring humans, companies are going to hire robots and AIs. Even if they subcontract out to someone else who owns the data center or who owns the robot, that's all going to be B2B transactions. That's not going to be B2C or hiring a human\u2014that\u2019s going to be B2B. But then, of course, if your customers ultimately don't have money, your businesses are going to implode. It's an existential threat to literally everyone. Nobody wins if the labor market collapses before we have a viable alternative or a viable replacement or substitution\u2014however you want to look at it. We need to transition to something else.\r\n\r\nIndividual Exceptions Don\u2019t Scale\r\nThere is nothing you can do on an individual basis. If you happen to be a great comedian or musician, go all in on that. Or if you're great at arts and crafts and you can set up an Etsy store that creates unique enough stuff that you can make a living, go for that. But not everyone will be able to do that because if literally everyone on your street is doing the same thing, you're probably not going to outcompete them. That's the name of the game. Yes, there will be some work going around, some demand for meaning and experience and attention, but that's winners take all. That's not a long-term solution for everyone.\r\n\r\nI don't want to spend my mental time and energy trying to soothe the anxiety of individuals. Yes, that sucks. I'm worried about it too. I'm right there with you. My YouTube channel has been slowly deflating because I'm not willing to do what it takes to keep up with the big guys who are systematizing and making everything a business. My YouTube channel is just an outlet for my research. I happen to be very lucky that it blew up, but I'm not trying to make a living from that. I'm trying to find other stuff to do.\r\n\r\nUBI, Funding, and the Scale Problem\r\nThe final point is that we need systemic-level solutions. Not even at the city level, not at the state or province\u2014we need to start implementing some of these solutions at the national level. Universal basic income is one of the first kind of successful models. It hasn't been implemented at a national level. The biggest implementation, at least in terms of getting money in hand, is at the state level with the Alaska Permanent Fund. That's not to say there aren't nations out there that have sovereign wealth funds that fund the government and therefore people effectively get services, but that money never touches their bank account. That's not money they're allowed to spend as they see fit. That's still distorting the market. That's the government saying, \"We own the sovereign wealth fund and we're going to be the ones to decide how to spend that money, not you.\"\r\n\r\nWe don't have any examples of national-level UBI. We have plenty of examples of city-level or county-level UBI being piloted. But then the question becomes, how do you fund it? If one city or one county starts taxing very heavily to sponsor that, guess what? All the businesses and all the millionaires and all the billionaires go somewhere else. They go to another zip code. That's why some of these things really need to happen at a national level. Of course, the moment you talk about that, you have the classical conservatives who are like, \"No, this is manglement. The government can't do anything; they're just going to make it worse.\" That is historically well-defended. Central management of the economy or a centrally planned economy is not good. At the same time, we don't have another viable alternative yet.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I propose in all of my work is coming up with more market-based solutions because that is the ideal outcome. However, when you try to look at Modern Monetary Theory or labor theory of value, or the value of money, you might ask, \"What's the fundamental value of a human?\" Labor is the fundamental value of a human right now, as far as the economy is concerned, and there are a lot of reasons that labor is a unique superpower.\r\n\r\nLabor\u2019s Unique Powers and Why They\u2019re Disappearing\r\nLabor is really important because, one, it's non-perishable\u2014meaning you can't just store labor in a jar on the shelf. You have to pay someone in real time for their labor. The only exception there is intellectual property, where someone puts in labor to create some piece of information that is valuable and then maintains property rights to that. If you can patent a lot of stuff and live off the royalties of patents, or write a good book or some music, that's different\u2014but the numbers there don't really add up for most people.\r\n\r\nLabor is perishable; it's also inalienable. You cannot separate labor from a body. As long as you can refuse labor, you have some power. You have some skin in the game. But not too long from now, labor strikes aren't going to mean anything. It'll be like, \"Okay, great. Strike all you want. We're just going to have a robot come in and replace you, or an AI agent come in and replace you, and you're never getting that job back.\" The refusability or inalienability is another superpower of labor, and historically that has been one of the best ways for non-voting citizens, or even voting citizens, to coercively extract concessions from the state and from capitalists. However, all of those levers are going away. I don't fault people for finding that existentially terrifying. That is the point. That is why I realized that post-labor economics is required. It's not just a matter of distributing wealth because, as many of you have pointed out, the moment you don't have any leverage is the moment you lose all power at the negotiating table. You have no chips left other than to say, \"I'm a human and I deserve to live.\" And it's like, \"Okay, what are you going to give us in exchange for food and housing?\" The answer is, \"I don't have anything that's valuable anymore.\"\r\n\r\nRethinking Human Value and Ownership in an Automated Economy\r\nThis means we need a fundamentally different theory of human value. We need a fundamentally different approach to the state's relationship to citizens and voters and humans in general. You might say, \"The obvious solution is we all have intrinsic value,\" which is a great philosophical stance. But how do you make policy around that? You say, \"Everyone deserves food and everyone deserves education and power.\" Great. How are you going to pay for it?\r\n\r\nWhen push comes to shove, most people are generally prosocial. They would say, \"Yes, in an ideal world, we can feed and clothe everyone, and healthcare is free and education is free for all, and everyone has a nice place to live,\" and so on. That's a wonderful sentiment, but then you have the cold hard numbers of how you're going to pay for that in a nation with over 300 million people here in America, or over a billion people in India, and on a planet with over 8 billion people total. That's a lot of humans to take care of. If there is no market-based way of allocating wealth\u2014or even generating wealth\u2014if the vast majority of wealth creation is going to be done in data centers and by robotic hands, then unless you own that data center and unless you own that robot, you're going to miss out on it.\r\n\r\nThat speaks to one direction: why don't we socialize the ownership of data centers? Why don't we socialize the ownership of robots? You can do that, but the more decision makers you have, the harder decisions become. Is that really the most efficient way? I don't think it is. What if you just tax the data centers? What if you just tax the robots? Again, that's great, but that still sets up the government as the middleman. As I have established\u2014and plenty of other people believe\u2014market-based solutions are optimal. But the government is going to have to do something here.\r\n\r\nYou might say, \"The free market will sort itself out because if businesses don't have consumers, businesses cease to exist anyway. It's rational self-interest for businesses to just give people money directly.\" Some will. There are already cooperatives, collectives, and employee-owned corporations that do profit-sharing models. Maybe that will become the standard. But every time I run the numbers, the numbers are not good enough to say, \"Yes, that is a neat and tidy solution that will pay for everyone's bills and this will clearly work.\"\r\n\r\nThe Default Path: Technofeudalism, Rent, and Collapsing Demand\r\nThe memes out there are like, \"I'm about to be a member of the permanent underclass.\" That's the cyberpunk future, the high-tech low-life of techno-feudalism, and \"you will own nothing and be happy.\" That is the default path. I make no excuses, no sugarcoating, no rose-colored lenses around this. As of right now, the default path is you will own nothing and be happy\u2014a rentier economy with everyone rent-seeking. But if everything's going to be a subscription model and you don't have any money, who's going to be able to pay for the subscriptions? That's what rent is: rent is a subscription to your house and everything else. Without consumer demand\u2014your ability to pay for goods and services\u2014that collapses too.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm painting here is the economic equivalent of P Doom. The good news is that this is playing out in very slow motion. That can be good and bad. It's slow motion, meaning we have time to adapt. There's lots of information and data; the numbers back it up, kind of like climate change. Climate change is a slow-motion disaster. But the bad news, just like with climate change, is that it's so slow-motion that people can get lazy about it. They can forget about it. They can convince themselves that as things are right now is how things will always be, and it'll be fine forever. That's the double-edged sword of a slow-motion catastrophe. Normalcy bias. Our brains are calibrated to think locally and geometrically. If something doesn't change visibly on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, you kind of don't notice it. This is something that's going to play out over the next 5 to 15 years, and that's fast enough that it could be very dangerous and catastrophic, but it's also slow enough that you're not really going to notice it. You kind of get boiled-frog syndrome.\r\n\r\nEvidence, Consensus, and What Still Must Be Solved\r\nAs someone who is one of the most vocal opponents of \"AI catastrophe, ASI is going to kill everyone,\" you might say, \"Dave, you're falling into the same exact reasoning chains. I've got impeccable, flawless reasoning chains and my Bayesian priors say this is what's going to happen.\" The difference is that I look for evidence\u2014real evidence out there in the data\u2014to say this is what's happening. Everyone from CEOs to the Chairman of the Fed, they're all saying the same things. Even the Pope has written tweets about how technology can have these impacts. There's growing consensus, and there are hard data and numbers to show that this is the direction things are going with reference to post-labor economics. Even people who disagree with the magnitude or speed generally agree directionally that this is the way things are going. It's just a question of how fast and how hard it's going to happen. That still means we need to solve the same problems: how do we predistribute and redistribute wealth in a future where labor is no longer the primary mechanism?\r\n\r\nConclusion: No Individual Solutions\u2014This Is a Collective Problem\r\nThis rant, screed, whatever diatribe, might be leaving you a little caught out in the cold. I'm not going to be able to give you all of the solution in just 23 or 24 minutes, however long this is ultimately going to be. The point is that this is a major oversight, a gap in understanding that a lot of people have. It's good that people are engaging.

Where his case overreaches is the speed/totality of displacement, the claim that *individual agency is effectively zero*, and the presumption that only national-level redistribution can work. The path that actually matters is (1) how fast embodied automation diffuses across laggard sectors, (2) whether new **complementary** tasks and demand materialize, and (3) whether we build *predistribution*\u2014broad capital claims on the AI economy\u2014before displacement outpaces policy.\n\n---\n\n## What he gets right\n1. **If labor isn\u2019t needed to produce most output, wage income fails as a distribution system.** That\u2019s a coherent diagnosis. When factor income tilts to capital, household demand must be backstopped by transfers, equity, or dividends\u2014or firms\u2019 profits evaporate with their customers.\n\n2. **Heavy-tail markets won\u2019t save everyone.** Data monetization is trivially small at the household level; creator/attention markets are power-law and saturate as AI floods supply. He\u2019s right that \u201cbecome an influencer\u201d is not a macro solution.\n\n3. **B2B automation breaks the wage\u2013consumption flywheel.** If profit accrues in data centers and robot fleets, value creation and household purchasing power decouple\u2014unless households own claims on those assets.\n\n4. **Systemic fixes are unavoidable.** Some mix of UBI/EITC-like transfers, social wealth funds, generalized profit-sharing, or an \u201cAI dividend\u201d is necessary if displacement is large.\n\n---\n\n## Where the argument needs sharpening\n\n### 1) **Pace and scope of displacement**\n- **All jobs gone in ~50 years** is a modeling choice, not a foregone conclusion. It assumes:\n  - *High* substitution elasticity between \u201cAI capital\u201d and human labor (\u03c3 > 1) **economy-wide**,  \n  - Rapid diffusion of *embodied* robotics into messy, low-digitization sectors (construction, care, hospitality, small-firm services), and  \n  - Minimal creation of new complementary tasks or demand.\n- Reality check: software automation diffuses fast; physical automation is constrained by hardware cost curves, reliability, integration, safety regulation, and energy. Many sectors are adoption-laggards. This doesn\u2019t refute his direction; it stretches his *timelines*.\n\n### 2) **\u201cIndividual agency = ~0\u201d is too strong**\n- At the *macro* level, policy must change\u2014agreed. But at the *micro* level, people can still reposition toward:\n  - **AI-complementary roles** (owning workflows, judgement under ambiguity, compliance, systems integration, relationship-dense services),  \n  - **Capital claims** on the AI stack (broad market funds tilted to AI infrastructure; community/employee ownership; profit-sharing),  \n  - **Scarce embodied bottlenecks** (energy, power electronics, high-reliability ops, last-meter installation/maintenance).  \n  None of this rescues *everyone*; it refutes \u201cthere is literally nothing you can do.\u201d\n\n### 3) **Demand and price feedbacks are underplayed**\n- Automation often **cuts prices**, expanding quantity demanded. Whether labor demand ultimately falls depends on:\n  - Productivity growth vs. price elasticity of demand,  \n  - How savings recycle (investment booms, new products, new services), and  \n  - How much of the surplus reaches households (via wages, transfers, or ownership).  \n  If policy channels surplus to households, consumption stabilizes and displacement is slower.\n\n### 4) **\u201cOnly national solutions\u201d is unnecessary exclusivity**\n- Yes, tax competition is real. But *predistribution* can be built below the national level:\n  - **Regional social-wealth funds** seeded by data-center/energy rents;  \n  - **Mandatory profit-sharing** thresholds for firms above a size/automation index;  \n  - **Portable benefits** and **negative income tax** expansions administered by the center but funded partly by VAT/compute-usage fees;  \n  - **Public procurement standards** (automation impact disclosures + required worker dividends) that scale without new tax bases.\n\n### 5) **Robot/compute taxes vs. neutral bases**\n- Direct \u201crobot taxes\u201d can mis-target (what counts as a robot?) and deter productivity upgrades. More robust:\n  - **Broad consumption VAT** with per-capita rebates (progressive in practice),  \n  - **Land/energy grid rents** (automation needs power and real estate),  \n  - **Source-based cash-flow or excess-profit taxes** tied to supernormal returns in hyper-concentrated markets,  \n  - **Compute/AI service excises** that are base-broad and hard to evade, earmarked to a social fund.\n\n---\n\n## A simple way to see the knife-edge\n\nLet the automatable share of tasks reach 50% by 2040, with 70% adoption. If each automated task yields a 30% unit-cost drop and average demand elasticity is 0.8, then output in affected sectors rises ~24% (= 0.3\u00d70.8). Labor hours fall by roughly 50%\u00d770%\u00d7(1\u22120.24) \u2248 **26%** in those sectors. If those sectors are half the economy, aggregate labor demand drops ~13% **unless**:\n- New tasks appear (systems oversight, safety, integration),\n- Surplus is recycled into new consumption/investment, or\n- Transfers/ownership channel income back to households.\n\nShapiro\u2019s dire outcome happens when all three channels underperform *simultaneously*.\n\n---\n\n## What would *falsify* Shapiro\u2019s trajectory?\n- **Labor share stabilizes** (or rises) despite rapid AI gains.\n- **Household real incomes** continue rising with broad consumption growth without major transfer expansions.\n- **Large new employment basins** emerge in embodied services (aging, climate adaptation, retrofits) faster than automation penetrates them.\n- **Policy-driven capital sharing** scales (national or regional AI dividends, social wealth funds) and maintains demand.\n\n## What would *confirm* it?\n- **Sustained drop in labor share** alongside **concentrated excess profits** in AI/compute platforms and **weak price pass-through** to consumers.\n- **Job churn turns into net job loss** in routine-cognitive and middle-skill services without offsetting new occupations.\n- **Energy and compute capacity** scale fast enough that embodied automation saturates the physical economy (construction, logistics, care) this decade.\n\n---\n\n## A more constructive policy stack (predistribution \u2192 redistribution)\n\n1. **AI Dividend / Social Wealth Fund (predistribution)**\n   - Funded by a mix of consumption VAT + compute/AI service excise + land/grid rents tied to data-center/equipment footprints.\n   - Pay **universal per-capita dividends**; ramp with automation intensity metrics.\n\n2. **Mandatory broad-based profit-sharing**\n   - For firms above thresholds of revenue and automation ratio (self-reported and audited), allocate **X% of value-added** to workers/citizens (cash or equity).\n\n3. **Portable benefits & negative income tax**\n   - Expand EITC-style transfers; make healthcare/retirement *employment-agnostic* to reduce the \u201cjob as benefits\u201d bind.\n\n4. **Competition & IP policy**\n   - Prevent lock-in that would turn AI rents into permanent monopoly tolls; time-limit model/IP exclusivity; support open standards to push surplus to users.\n\n5. **Public procurement levers**\n   - Require **Automation Impact Statements** and **worker dividend plans** for vendors; this scales quickly without new tax law.\n\n6. **Energy & infrastructure acceleration**\n   - Automation is energy-bound; de-bottleneck clean generation and grid. If energy is abundant, prices fall and real incomes rise even with more capital intensity.\n\n---\n\n## Practical hedges at the individual level (even if they don\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d the macro)\n- **Own claims on the AI economy** (broad, low-fee equity exposure; infra/energy tilts; employee ownership where possible).\n- **Move toward AI-complementary work**: systems integration, governance, high-stakes judgement, embodied services with relationship density.\n- **Accumulate scarce *non-automatable* assets**: local reputation, trust networks, permits/licenses in constrained domains, and\u2014where feasible\u2014land.\n\nThese are not panaceas; they materially change *individual* trajectories against Shapiro\u2019s \u201c0 agency\u201d claim.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\nShapiro is right about the *direction*: if we keep today\u2019s institutions and AI keeps compounding, wages alone won\u2019t distribute enough income. But \u201call jobs gone by ~2075 and nothing useful individuals can do\u201d rests on aggressive assumptions about substitution, diffusion in the physical economy, and policy failure. The decisive variable isn\u2019t whether we adopt AI; it\u2019s **who owns the capital and how quickly we wire automatic household claims into the AI production stack**. Build predistribution now, and redistribution becomes a stabilizer\u2014not a last-ditch rescue."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"e3637c9f-6c7d-4973-be91-cd02b7595202","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"6dce813a-6c33-465d-b9f9-1621fd70a129","turn_exchange_id":"1489bfc2-9dac-46ff-859f-cc843f015cf7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"6dce813a-6c33-465d-b9f9-1621fd70a129","children":[]}}}
