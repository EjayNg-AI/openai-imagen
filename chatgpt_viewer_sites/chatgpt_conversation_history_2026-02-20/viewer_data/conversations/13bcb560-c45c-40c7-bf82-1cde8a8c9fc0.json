Here's a detailed comparison:\n\n### Invasive Breast Cancer\n\n**Definition**: Invasive breast cancer is when cancer cells have spread from the original ducts or lobules into surrounding breast tissue. This means the cancer cells have broken through the initial layers of breast tissue where they started and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body, including lymph nodes and distant organs.\n\n**Types**:\n1. **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)**: The most common type of breast cancer. It begins in the milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue.\n2. **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**: Starts in the lobules (milk-producing glands) and spreads to nearby tissues.\n\n**Symptoms**: Symptoms can include a lump in the breast, changes in breast shape, skin dimpling, nipple discharge, or pain.\n\n**Treatment**: Often involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy, depending on the stage and specific characteristics of the cancer.\n\n### Non-Invasive Breast Cancer\n\n**Definition**: Non-invasive breast cancer, also known as in situ cancer, is when cancer cells remain confined to the ducts or lobules where they originated and have not spread to surrounding breast tissue. This type of cancer is considered the earliest form of breast cancer.\n\n**Types**:\n1. **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)**: The most common type of non-invasive breast cancer. It starts in the milk ducts and has not spread beyond the duct walls.\n2. **Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)**: Although not a true cancer, LCIS is a marker for an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in either breast in the future. It starts in the lobules.\n\n**Symptoms**: Often, non-invasive cancers like DCIS do not cause symptoms and are usually detected through mammograms.\n\n**Treatment**: Treatment for DCIS typically involves surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), often followed by radiation therapy. Hormone therapy may be considered if the cancer cells are hormone receptor-positive.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- **Spread**: Invasive cancers spread beyond the original tissue, while non-invasive cancers are confined to their place of origin.\n- **Potential Risk**: Invasive cancers have a higher potential to spread to lymph nodes and other organs, whereas non-invasive cancers do not spread beyond the initial site.\n- **Detection**: Non-invasive cancers are often detected early through screening methods like mammograms, while invasive cancers may be detected due to symptoms or more advanced imaging techniques.\n- **Treatment Approach**: Invasive cancers usually require more aggressive and comprehensive treatment strategies compared to non-invasive cancers.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan and for the prognosis of the patient."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"6ddbd056-6ab5-4ef9-8daa-d149e21b3daf","request_id":"895b6c734d514900-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6ddbd056-6ab5-4ef9-8daa-d149e21b3daf","children":[]}}}
