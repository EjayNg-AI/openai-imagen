Here\u2019s how you can do it step-by-step:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Set Up Git**\nEnsure Git is installed in your WSL distribution:\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\nCheck the version to confirm installation:\n```bash\ngit --version\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Configure Git**\nSet up your name and email for Git:\n```bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your-email@example.com\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Choose an Authentication Method**\nGitHub offers two primary ways to authenticate: **SSH keys** or **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**.  \n\n#### **Option A: Set Up SSH Authentication**\n1. **Generate an SSH Key**:\n   ```bash\n   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your-email@example.com\"\n   ```\n   Press Enter to accept the default file location, and optionally set a passphrase for added security.\n\n2. **Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:\n   Start the SSH agent and add the key:\n   ```bash\n   eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n   ```\n\n3. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**:\n   Copy the key to your clipboard:\n   ```bash\n   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n   ```\n   Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and click \"New SSH Key.\" Paste your public key.\n\n4. **Test the Connection**:\n   Test the SSH connection to GitHub:\n   ```bash\n   ssh -T git@github.com\n   ```\n   You should see a success message.\n\n5. **Clone or Push Using SSH**:\n   Use the SSH URL when cloning or setting a remote:\n   ```bash\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git\n   git push -u origin main\n   ```\n\n#### **Option B: Set Up Personal Access Token (HTTPS)**\n1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:\n   - Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n   - Click \"Generate new token (classic)\".\n   - Choose the scopes you need (e.g., `repo` for repository access).\n   - Save the token somewhere safe; you won\u2019t be able to see it again.\n\n2. **Use HTTPS with the Token**:\n   When pushing or cloning, Git will prompt for your GitHub username and token. Use the token instead of your password.\n\n3. **Cache Your Credentials**:\n   To avoid entering the token repeatedly, enable credential caching:\n   ```bash\n   git config --global credential.helper cache\n   ```\n   Alternatively, for persistent storage:\n   ```bash\n   git config --global credential.helper store\n   ```\n\n   Then, provide the token when prompted during the first push.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Verify Your Setup**\nTo confirm everything is set up properly:\n- Check your Git configuration:\n  ```bash\n  git config --list\n  ```\n- Test a simple clone, commit, and push workflow to ensure authentication works.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to push your GitHub repository successfully from WSL with secure authentication."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"5f3acbc5-1f9f-4087-901b-2e97de2407fd","request_id":"8f8d53f2bb4e6592-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5f3acbc5-1f9f-4087-901b-2e97de2407fd","children":["aaa2b302-b8aa-456b-b722-f7323c588f08"]},"aaa2b302-b8aa-456b-b722-f7323c588f08":{"id":"aaa2b302-b8aa-456b-b722-f7323c588f08","message":{"id":"aaa2b302-b8aa-456b-b722-f7323c588f08","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1735344957.158207,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["would the key contain my email address?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8f8d5bdc2a5f6592-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e9568d65-0cc9-4498-bff5-ab55f70e83eb","children":["fa661d37-feb2-48e2-a14d-f88a9a5f7c34"]},"fa661d37-feb2-48e2-a14d-f88a9a5f7c34":{"id":"fa661d37-feb2-48e2-a14d-f88a9a5f7c34","message":{"id":"fa661d37-feb2-48e2-a14d-f88a9a5f7c34","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1735344967.355723,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes, the **public SSH key** contains your email address if you include it during key generation.

It is part of SSH's security model to verify the identity of the server. Here's how to handle it:\n\n---\n\n### **Why Does This Happen?**\n- SSH maintains a list of known hosts in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. If a server is not in this file, SSH warns you to ensure the server is authentic.\n- GitHub's ED25519 public key fingerprint is being presented for you to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **What You Should Do**\n1. **Verify GitHub\u2019s Fingerprint**:\n   Check GitHub's official documentation for their SSH host key fingerprints:  \n   [GitHub SSH Key Fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints)\n\n   For the ED25519 fingerprint, as of now, it should match:\n   ```\n   SHA256:ppVZ5SY4wY1RLwh6np1lQGzZXRnLIjVdAeqg/Bt9EUA\n   ```\n\n2. **Proceed if Verified**:\n   If the fingerprint matches what is listed in GitHub's documentation, you can safely type `yes` and press Enter. This will add GitHub\u2019s key to your `known_hosts` file.\n\n3. **What Happens After?**:\n   Once you confirm, the fingerprint will be stored in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. Future connections to `github.com` will no longer prompt this message unless the host key changes (which would be a potential security concern).\n\n---\n\n### **If the Fingerprint Does Not Match**\n- If the fingerprint shown does **not** match GitHub's documented fingerprints:\n  - Do **not** proceed.\n  - Double-check your network or DNS settings to ensure you're connecting to the correct `github.com`.\n  - Consider reaching out to GitHub support for further clarification.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Example Workflow**\n1. You see the message:\n   ```\n   The authenticity of host 'github.com (20.205.243.166)' can't be established.\n   ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:ppVZ5SY4wY1RLwh6np1lQGzZXRnLIjVdAeqg/Bt9EUA.\n   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\n   ```\n\n2. Verify the fingerprint matches GitHub\u2019s official documentation.\n3. Type `yes` and press Enter.\n4. The output should confirm the addition:\n   ```\n   Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.\n   ```\n\nYou are now securely connected to GitHub, and no further prompts will occur for this host."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa26b0a-2235-4579-983b-e9bff8eaf7a7","request_id":"8f8d60b72da66592-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa26b0a-2235-4579-983b-e9bff8eaf7a7","children":["aaa23ebc-9090-4cca-bbf8-9972f152b1ae"]},"aaa23ebc-9090-4cca-bbf8-9972f152b1ae":{"id":"aaa23ebc-9090-4cca-bbf8-9972f152b1ae","message":{"id":"aaa23ebc-9090-4cca-bbf8-9972f152b1ae","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1735345259.141631,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Upon entering `yes`, WSL outputted: You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8f8d633b5cd66592-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0982296d-d4e9-4110-b321-275def2179ad","children":["38411897-143a-4b38-a9ce-6ef5a37c9a7c"]},"38411897-143a-4b38-a9ce-6ef5a37c9a7c":{"id":"38411897-143a-4b38-a9ce-6ef5a37c9a7c","message":{"id":"38411897-143a-4b38-a9ce-6ef5a37c9a7c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1735345267.587065,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The message:\n\n```\nYou've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n```\n\nis **normal and expected behavior** when testing an SSH connection to GitHub.

Ensure your SSH agent is running:\n   ```bash\n   eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n   ```\n\n2. Confirm your SSH key is associated with your GitHub account:\n   - Check GitHub settings: [SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).\n   - Verify the key matches your local public key:\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n     ```\n\n3. If the prompt is still for HTTPS, double-check that the repository URL has been updated to SSH.\n\nThese steps should resolve the issue and ensure smooth authentication using SSH."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa26716-7903-4606-8a19-d06898b7369a","request_id":"8f8d65532f346592-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa26716-7903-4606-8a19-d06898b7369a","children":["aaa218d0-4b13-411f-8c0c-b2233cc427aa"]},"aaa218d0-4b13-411f-8c0c-b2233cc427aa":{"id":"aaa218d0-4b13-411f-8c0c-b2233cc427aa","message":{"id":"aaa218d0-4b13-411f-8c0c-b2233cc427aa","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1735345773.725626,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I am trying to use a personal access token, but I am still prompted for my password instead of my token"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8f8d6fcc2a6c6592-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8067d999-59b8-4e58-8b2a-3fe2f36d2e42","children":["ab276a2c-2089-477d-9506-eedf3372ee07"]},"ab276a2c-2089-477d-9506-eedf3372ee07":{"id":"ab276a2c-2089-477d-9506-eedf3372ee07","message":{"id":"ab276a2c-2089-477d-9506-eedf3372ee07","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1735345790.945202,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If you're using a Personal Access Token (PAT) but are still prompted for your password instead of your token, it usually means Git is not recognizing the updated credential method. This can happen if Git is still attempting to use cached credentials or if the URL is incorrectly set.\n\nHere\u2019s how to resolve this issue:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Ensure You're Using the Correct HTTPS URL**\nWhen using a PAT, the repository URL should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://github.com/username/repository.git\n```\n\nTo confirm the remote URL is correct:\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nIf it's incorrect (e.g., using SSH or an outdated URL), update it:\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repository.git\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use Your PAT Instead of Your Password**\nWhen Git prompts for your username and password:\n1. Use your **GitHub username** as the username.\n2. Enter your **Personal Access Token** as the password.\n\nIf this works, the issue may have been temporary, but you can make this automatic (see Step 4).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Clear Cached Credentials**\nGit might be using cached credentials that are outdated. Clear them with:\n\n```bash\ngit credential-cache exit\n```\n\nOr manually remove credentials from the cache or credential store. For example, if you're on WSL, clear the credentials stored by the credential helper:\n```bash\ngit credential-cache exit\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Store the PAT for Future Use**\nIf you don\u2019t want to enter the PAT every time, configure Git to store it:\n\n#### **Option A: Use Credential Helper**\nSet up Git\u2019s credential helper to cache your credentials:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global credential.helper cache\n```\n\nThis will store the token in memory for a limited time (default: 15 minutes).\n\nIf you want persistent storage:\n```bash\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n```\n\nThe next time you are prompted, Git will save the token and use it automatically in the future.\n\n#### **Option B: Manually Add the Token**\nYou can embed the token directly into the remote URL (not recommended for security reasons):\n```plaintext\nhttps://<token>@github.com/username/repository.git\n```\n\nFor example:\n```plaintext\nhttps://ghp_yourgeneratedtoken@github.com/username/repository.git\n```\n\nSet this URL in your remote configuration:\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin https://ghp_yourgeneratedtoken@github.com/username/repository.git\n```\n\n---\n\n### **5. Verify Credential Storage**\nIf you're using `credential.helper store`, ensure the credentials are saved correctly:\n1. Check the `.git-credentials` file in your home directory:\n   ```bash\n   cat ~/.git-credentials\n   ```\n   It should include the URL with your token.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Check Git Version**\nOlder versions of Git might not handle PATs properly. Ensure you're using an up-to-date version of Git in WSL:\n\n```bash\ngit --version\n```\n\nIf it\u2019s outdated, update Git:\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Testing**\nOnce configured, try pushing again:\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nYou should no longer be prompted for your password, and your token should work seamlessly. If the problem persists, let me know for further troubleshooting!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa218d0-4b13-411f-8c0c-b2233cc427aa","request_id":"8f8d6fcc2a6c6592-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa218d0-4b13-411f-8c0c-b2233cc427aa","children":[]}}}
