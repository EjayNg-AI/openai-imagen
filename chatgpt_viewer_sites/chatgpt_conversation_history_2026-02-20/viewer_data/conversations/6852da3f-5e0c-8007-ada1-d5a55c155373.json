Touted as the largest AI infrastructure project in history, this venture aims to create over 100,000 jobs in the US over four years. The announcement boosted Oracle and SoftBank's stock prices. The project emphasizes the critical role of the US in leading technology developments and aims to accelerate advancements in AI.\n\nTrump's administration has policies that impact the AI sector, including revoking Biden's executive order on AI transparency, appointing a new AI and cryptocurrency czar, and addressing export restrictions on semiconductors needed for AI development. These policies could further strengthen the US's geopolitical position against China in AI advancements.\n\nAI infrastructure's growth depends not only on technology and talent acquisition but also on energy production to power data centers. Trump's energy policies focus on supporting fossil fuel production to meet AI's high energy demands, diverging from Biden's climate-centric approach.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1737502301.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/openai-is-phasing-out-its-work-with-scale-ai-after-meta-deal","title":"OpenAI Is Phasing Out Scale AI Work Following Startup's Meta Deal","snippet":"OpenAI is phasing out the work it does with data-labeling startup Scale AI, cutting ties with the company days after Meta Platforms Inc.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750256688.955917,"attribution":"www.bloomberg.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-16/scale-ai-s-alexandr-wang-brings-meta-his-extensive-competitor-knowledge","title":"Scale AI\u2019s Wang Brings to Meta Knowledge of What Everyone Else is Doing","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750173692.197838,"attribution":"www.bloomberg.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.webpronews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.webpronews.com/google-may-cut-ties-with-scale-ai-over-metas-investment/","title":"Google May Cut Ties with Scale AI Over Meta\u2019s Investment","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750173692.197838,"attribution":"www.webpronews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investing.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-phases-out-scale-ai-work-after-metas-investment-deal--bloomberg-93CH-4101608","title":"OpenAI phases out Scale AI work after Meta's investment deal","snippet":"Investing.com -- OpenAI is ending its relationship with data-labeling startup Scale AI following Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750257829.555599,"attribution":"www.investing.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techinasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techinasia.com/news/openai-to-keep-scale-ai-ties-after-metas-14-8b-deal","title":"OpenAI to keep Scale AI ties after Meta's $14.8b deal -

Initially, $100 billion will be deployed to build data centers and electricity generation facilities in Texas. Key figures such as Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI, and Larry Ellison of Oracle joined Trump in inaugurating the project. This initiative aims to advance AI development and includes data center construction for enhancing digital health records and creating customized vaccines. President Trump believes this investment illustrates confidence in America's potential under his leadership, predicting a \"golden age.\" \n\nDespite Trump's administration spearheading this announcement, planning for the project began during President Biden's tenure. Other partners in the initiative include Microsoft, MGX, Arm, and NVIDIA. Regulatory challenges for AI remain, especially after Trump reversed Biden\u2019s 2023 order related to AI safety.

Despite the approval, the CMA noted Microsoft's significant influence over OpenAI's policies and advised that the partnership is not without potential competition concerns.

relationship with Scale AI has shifted significantly in recent months due to strategic changes in the AI landscape:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Historical Ties  \n- Scale AI has been a **data\u2011labeling vendor** for OpenAI\u2014one of several used to process annotated data for training models \ue200cite\ue202turn0search51\ue202turn0search7\ue201.  \n- Scale counts other major clients like Google, Microsoft, and multiple enterprises, but OpenAI\u2019s volume has been relatively smaller \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search51\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Recent Shifts  \n- **Meta acquired a 49% stake** in Scale AI for approximately $14\u201314.8\u202fbillion (reports range) and hired Scale\u2019s CEO, Alexandr Wang, into its \u201csuperintelligence\u201d division \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search51\ue201.  \n- Following the deal, several clients\u2014including Google, Microsoft, and reportedly OpenAI\u2014**eased off from using Scale**, mainly due to concerns about Meta\u2019s influence \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Current Status  \n- According to Bloomberg, OpenAI **is phasing out** its partnership with Scale AI, a process that had begun even before the Meta investment \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201.  \n- However, OpenAI\u2019s CFO clarified that while their dependence is shrinking, OpenAI **will continue working with Scale AI as one of many data vendors**, not terminating ties entirely

was a small but real OpenAI vendor for labeled data. |\n| **Present shift** | Scaling back the relationship\u2014Meta\u2019s entry accelerated this. |\n| **Future outlook**| OpenAI still retains a limited, diversified relationship with Scale alongside other providers. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Take  \n- The **primary driver** of this shift is Meta\u2019s equity claim and leadership movement into Scale, prompting OpenAI and other clients to reassess neutrality and data alignment.  \n- OpenAI is **not fully severing ties**, but continues to diversify its data sources with other partners,
