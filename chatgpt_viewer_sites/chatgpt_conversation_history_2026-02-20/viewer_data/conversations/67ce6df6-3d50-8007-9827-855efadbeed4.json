It offers various health benefits, such as improving heart health by reducing triglyceride levels, balancing blood lipids, reducing inflammation, and promoting bone health. The high omega-3 content has shown to positively impact cardiovascular conditions, although more targeted research is required. Cod liver oil also aids athletes in muscle recovery through its anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nFor bone health, it may help improve bone mineral strength, particularly in women assigned at birth as they age, though more studies are needed. Cod liver oil is available in various forms like capsules and skin ointments. Dosage typically ranges from 5-10 mL daily for a limited period, and it's recommended to consult a healthcare provider before starting the supplement.\n\nSafety considerations include choosing third-party tested products to avoid harmful contaminants and being cautious of potential drug interactions, particularly with anticoagulants and medications high in vitamin D. Overconsumption can lead to side effects like nausea and excessively high nutrient levels, which may exacerbate health issues. Overall, while beneficial, cod liver oil should be taken with medical advice.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1081,"end_idx":1082,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Health Benefits of Cod Liver Oil","url":"https://www.health.com/cod-liver-oil-benefits-8696413","pub_date":1724760000.0,"snippet":"Cod liver oil is a popular supplement from Atlantic cod fish.

It offers various health benefits, such as improving heart health by reducing triglyceride levels, balancing blood lipids, reducing inflammation, and promoting bone health. The high omega-3 content has shown to positively impact cardiovascular conditions, although more targeted research is required. Cod liver oil also aids athletes in muscle recovery through its anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nFor bone health, it may help improve bone mineral strength, particularly in women assigned at birth as they age, though more studies are needed. Cod liver oil is available in various forms like capsules and skin ointments. Dosage typically ranges from 5-10 mL daily for a limited period, and it's recommended to consult a healthcare provider before starting the supplement.\n\nSafety considerations include choosing third-party tested products to avoid harmful contaminants and being cautious of potential drug interactions, particularly with anticoagulants and medications high in vitamin D. Overconsumption can lead to side effects like nausea and excessively high nutrient levels, which may exacerbate health issues.

Since the body cannot produce significant amounts independently, it is crucial to incorporate omega-3-rich foods into the diet. The top 10 foods high in omega-3 include salmon, chia seeds, flaxseeds, walnuts, sardines, hemp seeds, mackerel, cod liver oil, spinach, and soybeans. Different forms of omega-3s such as EPA, DHA, and ALA vary in their sources, with animal-based foods generally containing higher concentrations of EPA and DHA, while plant-based foods are rich in ALA. These fatty acids promote cardiovascular health, enhance brain function, and help manage conditions such as elevated blood sugar and depression. While omega-3 supplements can aid in meeting dietary requirements, they may pose risks like increased bleeding and atrial fibrillation if taken in high doses. Therefore, obtaining omega-3s through food is often preferred, with gradual dietary adjustments recommended.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1605,"end_idx":1606,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"\ue203","start_idx":1608,"end_idx":1609,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"By implementing these measures, you can effectively reduce the potential risks associated with cod liver oil consumption while still benefiting from its nutritional properties.","start_idx":1609,"end_idx":1785,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"By implementing these measures, you can effectively reduce the potential risks associated with cod liver oil consumption while still benefiting from its nutritional properties.","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"1606-0","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":1785,"end_idx":1786,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1786,"end_idx":1787,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":1787,"end_idx":1787,"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Fish oil -
