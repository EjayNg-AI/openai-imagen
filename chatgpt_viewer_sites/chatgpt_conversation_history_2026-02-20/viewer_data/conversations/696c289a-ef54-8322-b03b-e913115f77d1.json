The company is embedding Claude into widely-used scientific tools like lab management systems, genomic analysis platforms, and biomedical databases to help streamline tasks such as data analysis and literature reviews. Pharmaceutical companies like Novo Nordisk and Sanofi are already using Claude, reportedly reducing clinical documentation timelines drastically.\n\nThis move aligns with a broader industry trend as AI companies invest heavily in specialized models for sectors such as healthcare. Major players like Google, OpenAI, and Mistral have also announced similar research-focused AI initiatives. Anthropic distinguishes itself by aiming to augment scientists\u2019 capabilities rather than replacing them, and has enhanced Claude to reduce factual errors and ensure traceable, verifiable outputs suitable for regulated research environments.\n\nWhile no AI-discovered drugs have been approved yet, Anthropic remains optimistic.

The fix is to force the plot to live in **persistent artifacts** the agent must maintain:\n\n- `BRIEF.md` \u2014 objective + constraints + definition of done  \n- `PLAN.md` \u2014 current plan (kept short and updated)  \n- `STATE.md` \u2014 what\u2019s done / in progress / blocked (the *single source of truth*)  \n- `EVIDENCE/` \u2014 command outputs, logs, citations, extracted snippets  \n- `OUTPUT/` \u2014 deliverables (reports, tables, slides drafts, etc.)\n\nThis aligns with how long-running agent \u201charnesses\u201d are now being discussed: you don\u2019t just \u201cprompt once\u201d; you run an iterative loop where the agent makes incremental progress and leaves clear artifacts for the next session. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 8 long-horizon tasks *beyond coding* that CLI agents handle well\n\n### 1) Literature review \u2192 annotated bibliography \u2192 synthesis memo\n**Inputs:** PDFs, notes, citation exports.  \n**Agent actions:** extract structure, summarize per paper, build a matrix of claims vs evidence, then write a synthesis memo with open questions.\n\n**Why CLI helps:** you can run local PDF text extraction tools, keep all notes versioned, and force the agent to cite where each claim comes from (stored in `EVIDENCE/`).\n\n**Guardrail:** treat PDFs/web pages as *untrusted input* (prompt injection is a real risk once agents act on external text). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2) \u201cMessy notes\u201d \u2192 coherent report (meeting notes, research diary, scattered markdown)\nAnthropic\u2019s newly reported direction for \u201cCowork\u201d explicitly targets things like producing a first draft report from scattered notes or compiling structured outputs from messy inputs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \nEven if you stick to CLI agents, the workflow is the same:\n\n- Agent normalizes notes into a canonical structure\n- Extracts action items / decisions into `DECISIONS.md`\n- Generates a polished report in `OUTPUT/report.md`\n\n---\n\n### 3) Data work without \u201cdata science ceremony\u201d\nExamples:\n- Clean a CSV, detect anomalies, generate summary tables\n- Parse logs and produce incident timelines\n- Reconcile two datasets and produce a discrepancy report\n\n**Pattern:** require the agent to:\n1) generate a runnable script/notebook,\n2) run it,\n3) paste results into `OUTPUT/`,\n4) store raw command output in `EVIDENCE/`.\n\nThis \u201cevidence-first\u201d style is basically the same safety/traceability philosophy described around operationalizing Codex workflows (sandboxing, approval, reviewable changes). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 4) Personal knowledge base construction (for research or teaching)\nHave the agent:\n- ingest your markdown/LaTeX notes,\n- build a concept index,\n- create cross-links,\n- generate flashcards or \u201cdefinition pages,\u201d\n- maintain a changelog.\n\nThis is surprisingly \u201cagent-friendly\u201d because it\u2019s deterministic file transformation with lots of local structure.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Administrative ops: file organization, naming, deduping, document conversion\nThis is exactly the kind of \u201cnon-coding\u201d work that\u2019s emerging in agent products: giving an agent access to a folder and having it reorganize/rename files, extract information, draft structured outputs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n\n**Hard rule:** run in **read-only / propose mode** first. Never let an agent delete or move files without an explicit review step, because \u201cpotentially destructive actions\u201d are a known risk class for these tools. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue202turn1view5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 6) \u201cProject manager in a box\u201d (issue triage, roadmap drafts, release notes)\nEven without direct Jira/Notion integration, you can:\n- export issues to JSON/CSV,\n- let the agent cluster themes,\n- draft a roadmap + risk register,\n- produce release notes from commit messages and changelogs.\n\nIf you *do* want multi-tool orchestration, Codex can be wrapped as a persistent tool via the Agents SDK by running Codex CLI as an MCP server\u2014useful when you want a top-level orchestrator coordinating multiple subtasks. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 7) Competitive / market research dossiers (careful version)\nWorkflow:\n- maintain a `SOURCES.md` with URLs + timestamps,\n- snapshot key pages to `EVIDENCE/`,\n- generate a structured \u201cclaims table\u201d with confidence notes,\n- write a memo with explicit \u201cwhat would change my mind\u201d triggers.\n\nThis makes the agent less likely to hallucinate because you force it to *point to artifacts*.\n\n---\n\n### 8) Long-horizon \u201cmigration\u201d work that isn\u2019t code migration\nThink: migrating a course, a knowledge base, a blog, or a documentation site:\n- map old structure \u2192 new structure,\n- convert formats,\n- enforce style rules,\n- generate redirects/index pages,\n- run link checks locally.\n\nCodex CLI is explicitly described as supporting repeatable automation patterns beyond interactive use, which fits this style of work well. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Operating patterns that make long-horizon work actually succeed\n\n### A) Always use a harness-like loop\nAnthropic\u2019s guidance on long-running agents boils down to: initialization + incremental progress + leaving artifacts for the next turn/session, because compaction alone won\u2019t save you. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view3\ue201  \nTranslate that into your practice:\n\n- \u201cInitializer\u201d prompt: set folder structure, create BRIEF/PLAN/STATE, define rules  \n- \u201cWorker\u201d prompt: do the next 1\u20133 tasks only, update STATE, store evidence  \n- \u201cReviewer\u201d prompt: sanity-check outputs, find inconsistencies, propose fixes\n\n### B) Constrain tools and permissions\nCodex emphasizes sandboxing and approval modes to keep humans in the loop. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue201  \nAdopt a simple policy:\n\n1) **Read-only pass** (inventory + plan)  \n2) **Propose pass** (diffs, move lists, patch files, but don\u2019t apply)  \n3) **Apply pass** (only after review)\n\n### C) Make the agent write \u201coperational telemetry\u201d\nRequire it to maintain:\n- `RUNLOG.md`: every command it ran (or proposed), what it expected, what happened\n- `RISKS.md`: what could go wrong next\n- `BLOCKERS.md`: what it needs from you\n\nThis is the non-coding analogue of \u201ctests + logs.\u201d\n\n### D) Treat external text as hostile\nPrompt injection is called out as a safety concern for agentic tools that read the web or arbitrary documents. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \nConcrete mitigations:\n- never store secrets in the workspace,\n- isolate browsing/output capture from execution,\n- require the agent to quote the exact snippet that caused an action,\n- strip/ignore \u201cinstructions\u201d found inside documents.\n\n### E) Expect brittleness; design for recovery\nThere are also public complaints about reliability regressions in real agent workflows (even if anecdotal, it matches what many users experience). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \nSo: make sure you can resume from artifacts, not from the agent\u2019s memory.\n\n---\n\n## Prompt templates (CLI-friendly) you can reuse\n\n### Template 1 \u2014 Non-coding \u201cwork package\u201d\n- **Goal:** (one sentence)\n- **Inputs:** (paths)\n- **Deliverables:** (exact files to produce)\n- **Constraints:** (time, scope, style, forbidden actions)\n- **Allowed tools:** (shell, grep, python, etc.)\n- **Stop condition:** (what \u201cdone\u201d means)\n- **Update rules:** always update `STATE.md`, append to `RUNLOG.md`, store evidence\n\n### Template 2 \u2014 \u201cPlan then act\u201d with hard gating\n1) Inventory + risks + plan (no edits, no moves)\n2) Propose diffs/moves (write `PROPOSED_CHANGES.md`)\n3) Apply only the approved subset\n\n### Template 3 \u2014 Research memo with traceability\n- Every claim must link to a file in `EVIDENCE/`\n- Unknowns must be explicit\n- Include a \u201cdisconfirming evidence\u201d section\n\n---\n\n## Where the \u201creports\u201d you mentioned fit in\nYes\u2014there\u2019s a visible trend of these systems being pushed beyond coding:\n- Recent reporting describes Anthropic\u2019s \u201cCowork\u201d as explicitly targeting non-coding productivity tasks by letting the agent operate over local folders, draft reports, organize files, and warning about destructive actions/prompt injection. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \n- OpenAI\u2019s own developer comms describe Codex CLI as operationalizable with automation patterns, human oversight, and tool extensibility (AGENTS.md, MCP, Agents SDK orchestration). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue202turn1view1\ue201  \n- Anthropic\u2019s engineering posts emphasize harnesses for *long-running* agent work (incremental progress + artifacts), which generalizes beyond coding. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view3\ue202turn1view2\ue201\n\nIf you tell me one long-horizon non-coding project you actually want (e.g., \u201cbuild an annotated bibliography pipeline from my PDFs,\u201d or \u201cturn my tutoring notes into a structured course pack\u201d), I can sketch a concrete folder schema + harness prompts that you can drop straight into Codex CLI / Claude
