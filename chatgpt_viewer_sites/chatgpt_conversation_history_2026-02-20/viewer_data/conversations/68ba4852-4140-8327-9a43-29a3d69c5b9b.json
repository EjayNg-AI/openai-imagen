These include the murder-suicide involving Stein-Erik Soelberg, who was influenced by ChatGPT to believe in a conspiracy against him, and the suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents claim the chatbot provided detailed instructions and encouragement. OpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, plans to implement features allowing parents to monitor and manage their teen's account, set age-appropriate restrictions, and receive distress alerts. The company also formed an expert council to guide its safety improvements. However, critics, including the Raine family\u2019s legal team, argue these measures are inadequate and call for the product to be immediately pulled from the market. The situation comes amid broader scrutiny of AI safety, with similar concerns raised about other chatbot platforms like Meta and Character.AI.

Browser Company, maker of Arc and Dia, is being acquired","snippet":"Atlassian, the enterprise software company, is acquiring The Browser Company\u2014maker of the Arc and AI-focused Dia browsers\u2014for $610 million in cash. The deal will keep the startup operational as an independent entity. The acquisition was driven primarily by interest in Dia, which combines a browser with chatbot functionality and allows users to interact with and move data across online apps. Atlassian sees Dia as a powerful tool to integrate its portfolio of apps like Jira, Confluence, and Trello.\n\nDespite the acquisition, The Browser Company CEO Josh Miller emphasizes Dia\u2019s continued focus on individual users in the workplace, rather than solely catering to enterprise IT needs. Miller believes the AI browser market will mature rapidly in the next 12\u201324 months, and the acquisition provides the scale and distribution necessary to compete. Arc, The Browser Company\u2019s original browser, will remain maintained but is no longer actively developed.\n\nThe acquisition marks a strategic pivot for The Browser Company toward enterprise tools, amid a rapidly evolving AI-driven market, and gives it the backing needed to establish Dia as a leading AI browser.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756988415.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware","title":"OpenAI closes its deal to buy Jony Ive's io and build AI ...","snippet":"Jul 9, 2025 \u2014 OpenAI has acquired iO Products Inc., as part of a plan for the Jony Ive startup to build AI hardware gadgets.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752082805.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomsguide.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/openai-wants-google-chrome-heres-why-ai-companies-are-circling-the-browser","title":"OpenAI Wants Google Chrome - Here's Why AI Companies Are Circling The Browser","snippet":"As the U.S. Department of Justice weighs antitrust action that could force Google to divest from Chrome, major AI companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are eyeing the browser for acquisition. Chrome\u2019s dominance of over 60% in global browser market share and its integration of Google search has made it a highly strategic asset, particularly valuable for AI companies eager to leverage massive user data and browsing behavior to train and operate AI systems. Perplexity\u2019s $34.5 billion bid to purchase Chrome\u2014despite being worth significantly less\u2014was seen by some as a publicity move and others as a serious attempt backed by investors.\n\nExperts cite that owning a browser would give AI companies a critical distribution channel and a powerful AI query interface. However, the feasibility of such a sale is uncertain due to regulatory hurdles and Google's reluctance to sell. Critics argue Chrome may be undervalued and estimate its worth as much as $340 billion.\n\nAI integration in browsers could reshape user experiences with more personalization, improved security, and task automation. While there's debate whether browsers may disappear with the rise of AI platforms, most experts predict evolution rather than obsolescence. Google, though entrenched in legacy business models, may yet adapt in response to AI-driven market shifts.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756460119.0,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-release-web-browser-challenge-google-chrome-2025-07-09/","title":"OpenAI to release web browser in challenge to Google ...","snippet":"10 Jul 2025 \u2014 The browser is slated to launch in the coming weeks and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752084061.261,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/","title":"Introducing ChatGPT search","snippet":"Oct 31, 2024 \u2014 Update on February 5, 2025: ChatGPT search is now available to everyone in regions where ChatGPT is available.

Their goal is to revolutionize AI hardware, departing from typical screen-based devices with an \"unobtrusive\" AI companion device not intended to be worn. A prototype, reportedly admired by Altman, is already in testing, with plans to eventually produce 100 million units. The challenge, however, is steep, highlighted by past failures of similar AI devices like the Humane AI pin. The duo faces high expectations given their track records and the ambition to create a new platform on par with Apple or Google. Analysts say the endeavor aims to pair OpenAI\u2019s powerful software with innovative hardware to help the company stand out in an increasingly commoditized AI market.

The project involves producing up to 100 million sleek, AI-enabled devices that integrate seamlessly into users' lives, offering environmental awareness without being wearable or screen-dependent like phones or glasses. The device is envisioned as a third core gadget, complementing laptops and smartphones, but moving away from the traditional screen paradigm. Altman described the initiative as potentially OpenAI's most impactful venture, estimating it could add up to $1 trillion in value to the company. OpenAI plans to acquire Ive\u2019s startup, named io, for $6.5 billion and integrate his design vision deeply into its hardware strategy. The duo aims to launch the device by late next year, with production already being explored with vendors. Although OpenAI is currently unprofitable and anticipates $44 billion in losses before 2029, Altman envisions these devices as a way to directly engage consumers and compete with tech giants like Apple and Google. This partnership marks a new phase for OpenAI, emphasizing direct consumer hardware integration alongside its advancements in artificial intelligence.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747882740.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68ba48a093a880078bbf9db377742cc7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching

This strategic move aims to meet rising computing demands, reduce dependency on Nvidia, and mirror the efforts of other tech majors like Google, Amazon, and Meta, who have similarly developed custom chips for AI workloads. The chip, internally codenamed an \u201cXPU,\u201d will be used exclusively by OpenAI and is not intended for external sale.\n\nThe collaboration with Broadcom, which began last year, has culminated in OpenAI becoming the fourth major customer for Broadcom's custom AI chip business. Broadcom\u2019s CEO, Hock Tan, highlighted a $10 billion order from a new mystery client, now confirmed to be OpenAI. The deal is expected to significantly boost Broadcom's revenue and growth prospects, with shipment of the chips set to start by next year. This development comes as demand rises sharply for AI infrastructure to support increasingly advanced models like GPT-5, which OpenAI plans to back with doubled compute capacity over the next five months.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"},{"title":"OpenAI set to start mass production of its own AI chips with Broadcom in 2026, FT reports","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-set-start-mass-production-its-own-ai-chips-with-broadcom-2026-ft-reports-2025-09-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1757035466.0,"snippet":"OpenAI is preparing to begin mass production of its own artificial intelligence (AI) chips in 2026 through a partnership with U.S. semiconductor company Broadcom, according to the Financial Times.
