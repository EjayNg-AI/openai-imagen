I\u2019ll split the era into (i) the inflationary phase itself and (ii) its end (\u201creheating\u201d), because the answers differ sharply across that boundary.\n\n# 1) Size / expansion\n- **During inflation:** The scale factor grows **quasi-exponentially**, \\(a(t)\\propto e^{Ht}\\) with nearly constant Hubble rate \\(H\\). The expansion is often quoted in **\\(N\\!\\sim\\!50\\text{\u2013}60\\)** e-folds (minimum needed to solve the horizon/flatness/monopole problems). The **comoving Hubble radius** \\((aH)^{-1}\\) **shrinks**, so scales that were microscopic are stretched outside the horizon.\n- **At the end (reheating):** Exponential growth stops; the Universe transitions to the standard **radiation-dominated** expansion \\(a(t)\\propto t^{1/2}\\). Modes that left the horizon during inflation later **re-enter** and seed structure.\n\n# 2) Temperature / energetics\n- **During inflation:** There is **no hot plasma**; the energy density is dominated by (approximately) constant **vacuum energy** of a slowly rolling field (the \u201cinflaton\u201d), giving an almost de Sitter spacetime. The conventional thermodynamic temperature of matter is effectively **near zero** (extreme **supercooling**). (One can associate a **Gibbons\u2013Hawking horizon temperature** \\(T_{\\rm dS}=H/2\\pi\\), but that is not a thermal bath of particles.)\n- **At reheating:** The inflaton\u2019s energy is **dumped into particles**, rapidly producing a hot, thermalized plasma. The resulting **reheating temperature** \\(T_{\\rm reh}\\) is model-dependent (plausibly anywhere from \\(\\sim10^9\\) to \\(\\sim10^{15}\\) GeV in many scenarios). From here, the Universe follows the **hot Big Bang** thermal history.\n\n# 3) Forces of nature / symmetries\n- **During inflation (no thermal bath):**\n  - **Thermal symmetry restoration doesn\u2019t operate** because the plasma is absent. Gauge/Higgs expectations are set by their potentials and Hubble-scale dynamics, not by temperature.\n  - If inflation occurs near a grand-unified (GUT) scale, any pre-existing **topological defects (e.g., monopoles)** are exponentially **diluted**\u2014one of inflation\u2019s classic wins.\n- **After reheating as the Universe cools:**\n  - At very high \\(T\\), symmetries expected to be **restored** (model-dependent). As \\(T\\) falls:\n    - **Electroweak symmetry** breaks at \\(T\\!\\sim\\!100\\text{\u2013}160\\) GeV, giving masses to \\(W,Z\\) and fermions.\n    - **QCD confinement/chiral breaking** occurs near \\(T\\!\\sim\\!150\\text{\u2013}200\\) MeV.\n  - Any GUT-scale breaking (if such a group exists) would have happened earlier; inflation typically ensures relics from it don\u2019t overclose the Universe.\n\n# 4) Particles and fields\n- **During inflation:**\n  - Any pre-existing **particle number densities dilute** like \\(a^{-3}\\) (or faster), becoming negligible.\n  - **Quantum fluctuations** of the inflaton and the metric are stretched super-horizon and become **classical curvature perturbations** with an almost scale-invariant spectrum (and potentially **primordial gravitational waves**, depending on the inflationary energy scale).\n  - Conformally coupled fields (e.g., photons in standard EM) are **not efficiently produced** by expansion; scalars and gravitons are the main actors.\n- **At reheating / preheating:**\n  - The inflaton **decays** (perturbatively) or transfers energy via **parametric resonance** (\u201cpreheating\u201d), explosively creating particles.\n  - The system **thermalizes** to \\(T_{\\rm reh}\\). From here follow **baryogenesis/leptogenesis** (CP-violating, out-of-equilibrium processes), potential **dark-matter production** (thermal or non-thermal), neutrino decoupling, BBN, etc., in the standard sequence.\n\n---\n\n## Key takeaways and open issues\n- **Geometry:** Inflation makes space **flat and homogeneous** on large scales and sets the initial conditions for structure.\n- **Thermal story:** Inflation itself is **cold**; the **heat** of the Big Bang is **created at reheating**.\n- **Forces:** Thermal **unification/restoration** is a **post-inflation** story as the hot plasma cools; inflation **erases unwanted relics** from earlier symmetry breaking.\n- **Particles:** The primordial perturbations are **frozen quantum fluctuations**; everything else is **repopulated** at reheating.\n\n**Still unknown:** the exact inflaton sector, its potential, the **energy scale** of inflation (constrained but not fixed), and the detailed **mechanism of reheating** and **baryogenesis**. Detecting **primordial B-mode polarization** would directly probe the inflationary energy scale and dynamics."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"977b9724499481b6-SEA","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"8bdea58b-dad2-43ad-9c65-c635ceadb42d","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"8bdea58b-dad2-43ad-9c65-c635ceadb42d","children":["9f40a310-b603-4cf3-922b-77ffbaa08082"]},"9f40a310-b603-4cf3-922b-77ffbaa08082":{"id":"9f40a310-b603-4cf3-922b-77ffbaa08082","message":{"id":"9f40a310-b603-4cf3-922b-77ffbaa08082","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756633712.476,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what was the size of the universe just before and just after inflation?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"977b9ce1bdef81b6-SEA","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a2df1cdb-3c10-42e6-8dc4-9254538312f2","children":["2abd81d3-0031-43c0-b677-e576a4c632ed"]},"2abd81d3-0031-43c0-b677-e576a4c632ed":{"id":"2abd81d3-0031-43c0-b677-e576a4c632ed","message":{"id":"2abd81d3-0031-43c0-b677-e576a4c632ed","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756633713.211145,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"977b9ce1bdef81b6-SEA","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"9f40a310-b603-4cf3-922b-77ffbaa08082","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9f40a310-b603-4cf3-922b-77ffbaa08082","children":["57f4865a-25cb-441b-b29e-25f320275fd8"]},"57f4865a-25cb-441b-b29e-25f320275fd8":{"id":"57f4865a-25cb-441b-b29e-25f320275fd8","message":{"id":"57f4865a-25cb-441b-b29e-25f320275fd8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756633713.980696,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Explaining universe size before and after inflation","content":"The size of the universe just before and after inflation is tricky to define.

Using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at Kitt Peak National Observatory, which observes 5,000 galaxies simultaneously, the team tracked cosmic structure growth. Einstein\u2019s theory, which connects space, time, and gravity, was validated against how gravity influences cosmic phenomena. The study, led by University of Michigan's Dragan Huterer, explored the universe's expansion, initially postulated as accelerated by dark energy. DESI's observations of nearly 6 million galaxies indicated a cosmic structure produced by gravitational pull. Additionally, DESI suggested a dynamic nature for dark energy, differing from its previously assumed constancy, potentially altering future cosmic expansion. This study reinforces the standard model of cosmology, integrating general relativity, while proposing dark energy\u2019s variation, marking significant progress since 1998's discovery of cosmic acceleration. The research, involving over 900 scientists globally, was published on arXiv ahead of peer review.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1732065501.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/science/evidence-mounts-that-universes-dark-energy-is-changing-over-time-2025-03-19/","title":"Evidence mounts that universe's dark energy is changing over time","snippet":"Newly analyzed data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggests that the universe's dark energy, responsible for its accelerated expansion, may be weakening over time. This conclusion stems from observations of nearly 15 million galaxies and quasars collected over three years at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Traditionally, dark energy was thought to remain constant, but findings now suggest it might be evolving. This discovery challenges the standard model of the universe, dating back to the Big Bang roughly 13.8 billion years ago. Researchers from NOIRLab and University of Pittsburgh highlighted the significant implication these results have on our understanding of cosmic expansion and the future of the universe. The new data, alongside other astrophysical measurements, indicates that the expansion of the universe, previously believed to accelerate indefinitely, may eventually decelerate. The revelation, considered a pivotal moment since the 1998 discovery of cosmic acceleration, was shared at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1742421776.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/19/dark-energy-mysterious-cosmic-force-weakening-universe-expansion","title":"Dark energy: mysterious cosmic force appears to be weakening, say scientists","snippet":"Recent observations suggest that dark energy, the mysterious force driving the expansion of the universe, may be weakening. If confirmed, this finding by the dark energy spectroscopic instrument (Desi) team at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona challenges the current understanding and theories regarding the universe's expansion. The weakening of dark energy indicates that the expansion rate is still accelerating but at a reduced pace, introducing the possibility of a future \"big crunch\" scenario rather than the \"big freeze.\" These insights were announced at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit. Desi's data, creating the most detailed universe map to date, shows that dark energy's strength peaked when the universe was around 70% of its current age and has weakened by about 10%. Despite uncertainty and ongoing debates, some scientists see this as a pivotal shift toward a new understanding of dark energy, encouraging further exploration and questioning of established cosmological models.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1742421607.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b4a0a8e94080078b2f6d9972c49dca","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing recent cosmological constraints on vacuum energy density","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"977ee2bf2a6c3e29-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"8decc1f1-1d3b-44cb-89f2-b42f3a499d5e","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8decc1f1-1d3b-44cb-89f2-b42f3a499d5e","children":["8d582e60-fea4-485b-8355-4d403dcda5a4"]},"8d582e60-fea4-485b-8355-4d403dcda5a4":{"id":"8d582e60-fea4-485b-8355-4d403dcda5a4","message":{"id":"8d582e60-fea4-485b-8355-4d403dcda5a4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756668082.58415,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Dark energy and caution in interpretation","content":"It\u2019s important to approach news articles carefully, as they can sometimes sensationalize findings.

energy density was dominated by (nearly) constant **potential energy of the inflaton field**, which behaves like a vacuum energy (pressure \\(p\\simeq-\\rho\\)).

Explaining why the observed vacuum energy is so small compared with QFT expectations is the **cosmological constant problem**.
