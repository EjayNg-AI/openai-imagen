Sam Altman. I will just say Sam is now three for three and joining us to share his thoughts at the three AI events that we've had, which we really appreciate. So I just want to say thank you for being here. This was our first office. That's...\r\n**Sam Altman:** Right. Oh, that's right. Say that again. Yeah, this was, this was our first office.\r\n**Host:** So it's nice to be back. Let's go back to the first office here. He started in 2016.\r\n**Sam Altman:** 2016.\r\n**Host:** We just had Jensen here who said that he delivered the first GGX1 system over here. He did. Yeah. It's amazing how small that thing looks now. Oh. Versus what? Well, the current boxes are still...\r\n**Sam Altman:** Huge. But yeah, it was a fun throwback. How heavy was it? That was still when you could kind of like lift one yourself.\r\n**Host:** He said it was about 70 lbs.\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah, I mean, it was heavy, but you could carry it. So, um...\r\n**Host:** Did you imagine that you'd be here today in 2016?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Uh, no. It was like, uh, we were sitting over there and there were, you know, 14 of us or something and you were hacking on this new system. I mean, even that was like a, we were sitting around like looking at whiteboards trying to talk about what we should do. Like this was a... it's almost impossible to sort of overstate how much we were like a research lab with no, with, with a very strong belief and direction and conviction, but no real kind of like action plan. I mean, not only was like the idea of a company or a product sort of unimaginable, the spec, like LLMs as an idea were still very far off. And so trying to play video games...\r\n**Host:** Trying to play video games? Are you still trying to play video games now?\r\n**Sam Altman:** We're pretty good at that.\r\n**Host:** Um, all right. So, um, it took you another six years for the first consumer product to come out, which is ChatGPT. Along the way, how did you sort of think about milestones to get something to that level?\r\n**Sam Altman:** As like an accident of history, the, the, uh, the first consumer product was not ChatGPT. That's right. It was DALL-E. Um, the first product was, uh, the API. So we had built, you know, we kind of went through a few different things. We, we were, we had a, a few directions that we really wanted to bet on. Eventually, as I mentioned, we said, \"Well, we got to build a system to see if it's working and we're not just writing research papers. So we're going to see if we can, you know, play a video game. Well, we're going to see if we can do a robot hand. We're going to see if we can do a few other things.\" And at some point in there, uh, one person and then initially and then eventually a team got excited about trying to do unsupervised learning and to build language models. And that led to GPT-1 and then GPT-2 and, and, and by the time of GBT-3, we both thought we had something that was kind of cool, but we couldn't figure out what to do with it. Um, and also we realized we needed a lot more money to keep scaling. You know, we had done GBD-3, we wanted to go to GPT-4. We were heading into the world of billion-dollar models. It's like hard to do those as a pure science experiment unless you're like a particle accelerator or something. Um, even then it's hard. So we started thinking, okay, we, we both need to figure out how this can become a business that can sustain the investment that it requires. And also like we have a sense that this is heading towards something actually useful. And we had put GPT-2 out as model weights and not that much had happened. Um, one of the things that I had just observed about, uh, companies, products in general, is if you do an API, it usually works somehow on the upside. This was like true across many, many YC companies. And also that if you make something much easier to use, there's usually a huge benefit to that. So we're like, well, it's kind of hard to run these models, they're getting big. We'll go write some software, do a really good job of running them. And, and also we'll then rather than build a product, 'cause we couldn't figure out what to build, um, we will hope that somebody else finds something to build. And so I forget exactly when, but maybe it was like June of 2020, um, we put out GPT-3 in the API and the world didn't care, but sort of Silicon Valley did. They're like, \"Oh, this is kind of cool. This is pointing at something.\" And there was this weird thing where like we got almost no attention from most of the world. And some startup founders, uh, were like, \"Oh, this is really cool.\" Or like, I mean, some of them are like, this is AGI. Um, the only people that built real businesses with the GPT-3 API that I can remember were these company, a few companies that did like copyrighting as a service. That was kind of the only thing GPT-3 was over the economic threshold on. Um, but one thing we did notice, which eventually led to ChatGPT, is even though people couldn't build a lot of great businesses with the GPT-3 API, people loved to talk to it in the playground. And it was terrible at chat. We had not at that point figured out how to do RHF to make it easy to chat with, but people loved to do it anyway. And in some sense, that was the kind of only killer use other than copyrighting of the API product that led us to eventually build ChatGPT. By the time ChatGPT 3.5 came out, there were maybe like eight categories instead of one category where you could build a business with the API. Um, but, but our conviction that like people just want to talk to the model had gotten really strong. So we had done DALL-E and DALL-E was doing okay, but we knew we kind of wanted to build, especially along with, um, the fine-tuning we were able to do, we knew we wanted to build this model, this product to let you talk to the model. And it launched in 2022 or something. Uh, I think, yeah, about six years when the first...\r\n**Host:** November 30th, 2022. Yeah. So there was a lot of work leading up to that. And 2022 launched. Today, it has over 500 million people who talk to it on a weekly basis. Yeah. All right. All right. So, um, by the way, uh, get ready for some audience questions because that's what, that was Sam's request. Um, you've been here for three, every single one of the ascents, as Pat mentioned. And there's been some, lots of ups and downs, but seems like the last six months, he's just been shipping, shipping, shipping. We shipped a lot of thought stuff and it's amazing to see the product velocity, the shipping velocity continue to increase. So this is like multi-sort of part question. How have you gotten a large company to like increase product velocity over time?\r\n**Sam Altman:** I, I, I think a mistake that a lot of companies make is they get big and they don't do any, they don't do more things. So they just like get bigger because you're supposed to get bigger and they still ship the same amount of product. And that's when like the molasses really takes hold. I, I like, I am a big believer that you want everyone to be busy. You want teams to be small. You want like to do a lot of things relative to the number of people you have. Otherwise you just have like 40 people in every meeting and huge fights over who gets like what tiny part of the product. Um, there, there was that, there was this like old observation of business that like a, a, a good executive is a busy executive because you don't people like muddling around. Um, but I, I think it's like a good, I, you know, at our company and many other companies, like researchers, engineers, product people, they drive almost all the value and you want those people to be busy and high impact. So if you're going to grow, you better do a lot more things. Otherwise you kind of just have a lot of people sitting in your room fighting or meeting or talking about whatever. Um, so we try to have, you know, relatively small numbers of people with huge amounts of responsibility. Um, and the way to make that work is to do a lot of things. And also like we have to do a lot of things. Like that the, to go kind of, I think, I think we, we really do now have an opportunity to go build one of these important internet platforms. Um, but to do that, like if we really are going to be people's like personalized AI that they use across many different services and, you know, over their life and across all of these different, all these different like kind of main categories and all the smaller ones that we need to, uh, figure out how to enable, then that's just a lot of stuff to go build.\r\n**Host:** Anything you're particularly proud of that you've launched in the last six months?\r\n**Sam Altman:** I mean, the models are so good now. Like they, they still have areas to get better, of course, and we're working on that fast. But like, I think at this point, ChatGPT is a very good product because the model's very good. I mean, there's other stuff that matters too, but the, I am like, I'm amazed that one model can do so many things so well.\r\n**Host:** You're building small models and large models. You're doing a lot of things as you said. So how do this audience stay out of, uh, your ways and not be roadkill?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Um, I mean, like, I, I, I think the way to model us is we want to build, we want to be people's like core AI subscription and way to use that thing. Some of that will be like what you do inside of ChatGPT. Um, we'll have a couple of other kind of like really key parts of that subscription. But mostly we will hopefully build this smarter and smarter model. We'll have these surfaces like future devices, future things that are sort of similar to operating systems, whatever. Um, and then, you know, we want, we have not yet figured out exactly, I think, what the sort of API or SDK or whatever you want to call it is to like really be our platform. But we will. It may take us a few tries, but we will. Um, and I hope that that enables like just an unbelievable amount of wealth creation in the world and other people to build onto that. But yeah, we're going to go for like the core AI subscription and the model and then, um, the kind of core services and there will be a ton of other stuff to build.\r\n**Host:** Okay. So don't be the core AI subscription, but you can do everything else.\r\n**Sam Altman:** We're going to try. I mean, if you can make a better core AI subscription offering than us, go ahead. That'd be great.\r\n**Host:** Okay. Um, it's rumored that you're raising $40 billion or something like that at $340 billion valuation. It's rumored that it's... I don't know if I think we announced it. We're...\r\n**Sam Altman:** Okay, well, if I just want to make sure that you announced it.\r\n**Host:** Um, what's the, what's your scale of ambition from there, from here?\r\n**Sam Altman:** We're going to like try to make great models and ship good products and there's no master plan beyond that. Like, we're going to, I, I, I think like, sure. No, I, I, I, I mean, there's, I see plenty of OpenAI people in the audience. They can vouch for that. Like, we don't, we don't sit there and have like, I, I am a big believer that you can kind of like do the things in front of you, but if you like try to work backwards from like kind of we have this crazy complex thing, um, that doesn't usually work as well. Like the, the, we, we know that we need tons of AI infrastructure. Like we know we need to go build out massive amounts of like AI factory volume. Um, we know that we need to keep making models better. We know that we need to like build a great top of the stack, like kind of consumer product and all the pieces that go into that. But we pride ourselves on being like nimble and adjusting tactics as the world adjusts. And so the products, um, you know, the products that we're going to build next year, we're probably not even thinking about right now. And we believe we can build, uh, a set of products that people really, really love. Um, and we have like unwavering confidence in that. And we believe we can build great models. I, I've actually never felt more optimistic about our research road map than I do right now. Um, what's on the research road map? Really smart models. Um, but, but in terms of like the steps in front of us, we kind of take those one or two at a time.\r\n**Host:** So you believe in working forwards, not necessarily working backwards. I have heard some people talk about these brilliant strategies of how they're, this is where they're going to go and they're going to work backwards and, you know, this is take over the world and this is the thing before that and this is that and this is that and this is that and this is that and here's where we are today. I have never seen those people like really massively succeed. Got it. Who, who has a question? There's a mic coming your way, being thrown.\r\n**Audience Member 1:** Um, what do you think the larger companies are getting wrong about transforming their organizations to be more AI native in terms of both using the tooling as well as producing products? It's been, you know, it's smaller companies are clearly just beating the crap out of, out of larger ones when it comes to innovation here.\r\n**Sam Altman:** I, I think this basically happens every major tech revolution. Um, there's nothing to me surprising about it. The thing that they're getting wrong is the same thing they always get wrong, which is like people get incredibly stuck in their ways. Organizations get incredibly stuck in their ways. If things are changing a lot every quarter or two and you have like an information security council that meets once a year to decide what applications you're going to allow and what it means to like put data into a system, like it, it's just, it's so painful to watch what happens here. But like, you know, this is, this is creative destruction. This is why startups win. This is like how the industry moves forward. Um, I am, I'd say I feel like disappointed but not surprised at the rate that big companies are willing to do this. Um, they will, my kind of prediction would be that there's another like couple of years of fighting, pretending like this isn't going to reshape everything and then there's like a capitulation and a last minute scramble and it's sort of too late and in general startups just sort of like blow past people doing it the old way. Um, I mean, this happens to people too. Like watching, watching like a, you know, someone who started, maybe you like talk to an average 20-year-old and watch how they use ChatGPT and then you go talk to like an average 35-year-old and how they, they use it or some other service and like the difference is unbelievable. It reminds me of like, you know, when the smartphone came out and like every kid was able to use it super well and older people just like took like three years to figure out how to do basic stuff. And then of course people integrate, but, but the, the sort of like generational divide on AI tools right now is crazy and I think companies are just another symptom of that.\r\n**Host:** Anybody else have a question? Just to follow up on that, um, what are the cool use cases that you're seeing young people using with ChatGPT that might surprise us?\r\n**Sam Altman:** They really do use it like an operating system. Um, they have like complex ways to set it up to connect it to like a bunch of files and they have like fairly complex prompts memorized in their head or like, you know, in something where they paste in and out. And, um, the, I mean, that stuff I think is all cool and impressive. And there's this other thing where like they don't really make life decisions without asking like ChatGPT what they should do. Um, and it has like the full context on every person in their life and what they've talked about and, you know, that like the memory thing has been a real change there. But, but yeah, I think gross oversimplification, but like older people use ChatGPT as a Google replacement. Maybe people in their 20s and 30s use it as like a life advisor something. And then like people in college use it as an operating system.\r\n**Host:** How do you use it inside of OpenAI?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Um, I mean, it writes a lot of our code.\r\n**Host:** How much? I don't know the number. And also when people say the number, I think is always this very dumb thing 'cause like you said, Microsoft code is 30, 20, 30% written. Measuring by lines of code is just such an insane way to like, I don't, I, I, maybe the meaningful thing I could, maybe the thing I could say is it's writing meaningful code. Like it's writing, I don't know how much, but it's like writing the, the, the parts that actually matter. That's, that's interesting. Next question. Hey Sam, mic going away. Is this okay? Hey Sam. Uh, I thought it was interesting that the answer to Alfred's question about where you guys want to go is focus mostly around consumer and being the core subscription and also most of your revenue comes from consumer subscriptions. Why keep the API in 10 years?\r\n**Sam Altman:** I really hope that all of this merges into one thing. Like you should be able to sign in with OpenAI to other services. Other services should have an incredible SDK to like take over the ChatGPT, um, UI at some point. But like to the degree that you are going to have a personalized AI that knows you, that has your information, that knows what you want to share later and, you know, has all this context on you, you'll want to be able to use that in a lot of places. Now, I agree that the current version of the API is very far off that vision, but I think we can get there.\r\n**Audience Member 2:** Uh, yeah, I maybe have a follow-up question to that one. You kind of took mine. Um, but like a lot of us who are building application layer companies, we want to like use those building blocks, those different API components, maybe the deep research API, which is not a release thing, but could be, uh, and, and build stuff with them. Like, is that going to be a priority? Like enabling that platform for us? How should we think about that?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah, I, I think I hope something in between those, that there is sort of like a new protocol on the level of HTTP for the future of the internet where things get federated and broken down into like much smaller components and agents are like constantly exposing and using different tools and authentication, payment, data transfer, it's all like built in at this level that everybody trusts everything, talk to everything. And I, I don't quite think we know what that looks like, but it's like coming out of the fog. Um, and as we get a better sense for that, again, it'll probably take us like a few iterations toward that to get there. But that's kind of where I would like to see things go.\r\n**Audience Member 3:** Hey Sam. Uh, back here. Uh, my name is Roy. I'm curious, uh, the AI would obviously do better with more input data. Is there any thought to feeding sensor data, uh, and what type of sensor data, whether it's temperature, uh, you know, things in the physical world that you could feed in that it could better understand reality?\r\n**Sam Altman:** People do that a lot. Uh, people like put that into, you know, people have whatever they build things where they just put sensor data into like an API and like an O3 API call or whatever. And for some use cases, it does work super well. Um, I'd say that the latest models seem to do a good job with this and they used to not. Uh, so we'll probably bake it in more explicitly at some point, but there's already like a lot happening there.\r\n**Audience Member 4:** Hi Sam. Uh, I was really excited to play with the voice model in the playground. And so I have two questions. The first is how important, uh, is voice to OpenAI in terms of like stack ranking for infrastructure? And can you share a little bit about how you think it'll show up in the product and ChatGPT, the core thing?\r\n**Sam Altman:** I think voice is extremely important. Honestly, we just, we have not made a good enough voice product yet. That's fine. Like it took us a while to make a good enough text model too. Um, we will crack that code eventually. And when we do, um, I think a lot of people are going to want to use voice interaction a lot more. I, I am super, when we first launched our current voice mode, the thing that was most interesting to me was it was a new stream on top of like the touch interface. And I, you could talk and be like clicking around on your phone at the same time. And I continue to think there's something amazing to do about like voice plus GUI interaction that we have not cracked. But before that, we'll just make voice really great. And when we do, I think there's a, not only is it cool with existing devices, but I, I sort of think voice will enable a totally new class of devices if you can make it feel like truly human level voice.\r\n**Audience Member 5:** Similar question. Similar question about coding. I'm curious, is coding just another vertical application or is it more central to the future of OpenAI?\r\n**Sam Altman:** That one's more central to the future of OpenAI. Um, coding I think will be how these models kind of, right now if you ask ChatGPT a response, you get text back, maybe you get an image. Um, you would like to get a whole program back. You would like, you know, custom rendered code for every response, or at least I would. Um, you would like the ability for these models to go make things happen in the world and writing code I think will be very central to how you like actuate the world and call a bunch of APIs or whatever. So I, I would say coding will be more in a central category. We'll obviously expose it through our API on our platform as well. Um, but, you know, ChatGPT should be excellent at writing code.\r\n**Host:** So we're going to move from the world of assistants to agents to basically applications all the way through.\r\n**Sam Altman:** I, I, I think it'll feel, yeah, like very continuous, but yes.\r\n**Host:** So you have conviction in the road map about smarter models, awesome. I have this mental model, there's some ingredients like more data, bigger data centers, a transformer architecture, test time compute. What's like an underrated ingredient or something that's going to be part of that mix that like maybe isn't in the mental model of most of?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Um, I mean, that's kind of the, each of those things are really hard. And, you know, obviously like the highest leverage thing is still big algorithmic breakthroughs and I think there still probably are some 10x's or 100x's left, not very many, but even one or two is a big deal. Um, but, you know, yeah, it's kind of like algorithms, data, compute, those are sort of the big ingredients.\r\n**Audience Member 6:** Uh, hi. Uh, so my question is, you run one of the best ML teams in the world. Uh, how do you balance between, uh, letting smart people like Issa chase, uh, deeply research or something else that seems exciting versus going top down and being like, we're going to build this, we're going to make it happen. We don't know if it'll work.\r\n**Sam Altman:** There are some projects that require so much coordination that there has to be a little bit of like top down quarterbacking, but I think most people try to do way too much of that. I, I, I mean, this is like, there's probably other ways to run good AI research or good research labs in general, but when we started OpenAI, we spent a lot of time trying to understand, uh, what a well-run research lab looks like. And you had to go really far back in the past. In fact, almost everyone that could like help advise us on this was dead. Um, it had been like a long time since there had been good, good research labs. And, you know, people ask us a lot like, why, why does OpenAI like repeatedly innovate and why do the other AI labs like sort of copy or why do like biolab X not do good work and biolab Y does do good work or whatever. And we sort of keep saying like, here's the principles we've observed. Here's how we learned them. Here's what we looked at in the past. And then everybody says, great, um, but I'm going to go do the other thing. We said, that's fine. Like you came to us for advice. Like you do what you want. Um, but I find it remarkable how much these few principles that we've tried to run our research lab on, which we did not invent, we shamelessly copied from other good research labs in history, um, have worked for us. And then people who have had some smart reason about why they were going to do something else, it didn't work.\r\n**Audience Member 7:** Um, it seems to me that, uh, these large models, uh, one of the really fascinating things as like a lover of knowledge about them is that they potentially embody and allow us to answer these like amazing long-standing questions in the humanities about cyclical changes and artistic, uh, interesting things or even like, uh, you know, to what extent systematic prejudice and other sorts of things are really happening in society and can we sort of detect these and I'm, uh, very subtle things which we, we could never really do more than hypothesize before. And I'm wondering whether OpenAI has a thought about or even a roadmap for working with academic researchers, say, to help unlock some of these new things we could learn for the first time in the humanities and in the social sciences.\r\n**Sam Altman:** We do. Um, yeah, I mean, it's amazing to see what people are doing there. We do have academic research programs where we partner and, you know, do some custom work, but mostly people just say like, I want access to the model or maybe I want access to the base model and I think we're really good at that. Uh, one of the kind of cool things about what we do is so much of our incentive structure is pushed towards making the models as smart and cheap and widely accessible as possible that that serves academics and the really the whole world very well. So, you know, we, we have, we do some custom partnerships, but we often find that what researchers or users really want is just for us to make the general model better across the board. Um, and so we, we try to focus, you know, kind of 90% of our thrust vector on that.\r\n**Audience Member 8:** I'm curious how you're thinking about customization. So you mentioned the federated like sign in with OpenAI, bringing your memories, your context. I'm just curious if you think customization and like these different post-training on like application specific things is a band-aid for or trying to make the core models better and how you're thinking about that.\r\n**Sam Altman:** I mean, in some sense, I think the like platonic ideal state is, uh, a very tiny reasoning model with a trillion tokens of context that you put your whole life into. The model never retrains. The weights never customize. But that thing can like reason across your whole context and do it efficiently. And every conversation you've ever had in your life, every book you've ever read, every email you've ever read, um, every, everything you've ever looked at is in there, plus connected all your data from other sources. And, you know, your life just keeps appending to the context and your company just does the same thing for all your company's data. Um, we can't get there today. Uh, but, but I, I think of kind of like anything else as a, a compromise off that platonic ideal and that is how I would eventually, I hope we do customization.\r\n**Host:** One last question in the back. Hi Sam, thanks for your time. Where do you think most of the value creation will come from in the next 12 months? Would it be maybe advanced memory capabilities or maybe security or protocols that allow agents to do more stuff and interact with the real world?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Um, I mean, in some sense, the value will continue to come from really three things, like building out more infrastructure, smarter models and building the kind of scaffolding to integrate this stuff into society. And if you push on those, I think the rest will sort itself out. Um, at, at a higher level of detail, I kind of think 2025 will be a year of sort of agents doing work. Coding in particular, I would expect to be a dominant category. I think there'll be a few others too. Um, next year is a year where I would expect more like, uh, sort of AI discovering new stuff and maybe we have AIs make some very large scientific discoveries or assist humans in doing that. And, you know, I'm, I am kind of a believer that most of the sort of real sustainable economic growth in human history comes from once you've like kind of spread out and colonized the earth, most of it comes from just better scientific knowledge and, and then implementing that for the world. And then '27, I, I would guess is the year where like that all moves from the sort of intellectual realm to the physical world and robots go from a curiosity to like a serious economic creator of value. But that was like an off the top of my head kind of guess right now.\r\n**Host:** Can I close with a few quick questions? Great. One of which is, um, chat, uh, GPT-5. Is that going to be just all smarter than all of us here?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Um, I mean, if you think you're like way smarter than O3, then maybe you have a little bit of a ways to go, but O3 is already pretty smart.\r\n**Host:** Um, two personal questions. Last time you were here, you had just come off a blip with OpenAI. Uh, given some perspective now and distance, you got any advice for founders here about resilience, endurance, strength?\r\n**Sam Altman:** Um, it gets easier over time. I think like you will face a lot of adversity in your journey as a founder and the, the kind of challenges get harder and higher stakes, but the emotional toll gets easier as you kind of go through more bad things. So it's, uh, you know, in some sense, like it does it, yeah, even though like abstractly the challenges get bigger and harder, the your ability to deal with them, the sort of resilience you build up gets easier like with each one you, you kind of go through. Um, and then I like, I, I think the, the hardest thing about the big challenges that come as a founder is not the moment when they happen. Uh, like a lot of things go wrong in the history of a company. Um, in the acute thing, you can kind of like, you know, you get a lot of support, you can function, a lot of adrenaline, like that's, you know, you're kind of like, even the really big stuff, like your company runs out of money and fails, like a lot of people will come and support you. Um, and you kind of get through it and go on to the new thing. The thing that I think is harder to sort of manage your own psychology through is the sort of like fallout after. Um, and I think if there's, you know, people focus a lot about how to work in that one moment during the crisis. And the really valuable thing to learn is how you like pick up the pieces. There's much less talk about that. I think there's, I've never actually found something good to point founders to to go read about, you know, not how you deal with the real crisis on day zero or day one or day two, but on day 60 as you're just trying to like rebuild after it. Um, and that's, that's the area that I think you can like practice and get better at.\r\n**Host:** Thank you, Sam. Yeah, you're officially still on paternity leave, I know. So thank you for coming in and speaking with us. Appreciate it. Thank you."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"caterpillar_selected_sources":["web"],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"93ef2aad9b34fdf9-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3df25ef9-9215-462a-9c79-d551ea5efe25","children":["c4a993c6-a234-486c-8013-224d13d9dcb6"]},"c4a993c6-a234-486c-8013-224d13d9dcb6":{"id":"c4a993c6-a234-486c-8013-224d13d9dcb6","message":{"id":"c4a993c6-a234-486c-8013-224d13d9dcb6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747107977.504797,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9b14e6c0-9306-4af2-8ca3-d41a12dd2634","request_id":"93ef2aad9b34fdf9-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9b14e6c0-9306-4af2-8ca3-d41a12dd2634","children":["7e0d6847-5b4f-40c5-8819-90e894553969"]},"7e0d6847-5b4f-40c5-8819-90e894553969":{"id":"7e0d6847-5b4f-40c5-8819-90e894553969","message":{"id":"7e0d6847-5b4f-40c5-8819-90e894553969","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747107977.504953,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Breaking down YouTube transcript analysis","content":"The user's request for a deep dive into a YouTube transcript, focused on an interview with Sam Altman, suggests I'll need to provide insights, themes, strategic analysis, critiques, and forward-looking implications.

Originally, CEO Sam Altman proposed converting OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation with the nonprofit parent relinquishing control. Critics, including Musk\u2014who has filed a lawsuit contesting the move\u2014argued the change violated OpenAI\u2019s founding mission to develop AI for humanity's benefit. A group of former employees also filed a legal brief supporting Musk\u2019s claims. Responding to these concerns, OpenAI announced that its nonprofit parent would retain control while still restructuring to raise capital. This decision allows continued oversight while enabling investment, including a proposed $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank at a $300 billion valuation. OpenAI\u2019s board chairman, Bret Taylor, noted the revised structure remains close to the current one, preserving mission integrity while satisfying investors.

For writing, Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in the free tier, while ChatGPT 4.5 leads the paid category, especially for creative writing, despite AI's tendency toward overwritten, predictable prose. Elon Musk's Grok 3 was highlighted for its unique social profiling feature on social media, though it was later reduced in scope. In terms of conversational quality, Claude 3.5 Sonnet from Anthropic and GPT 4.5 stand out, though the latter is costly and slow. The article also reflects on the ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art and stresses effective prompting strategies to enhance output across platforms. While the author finds that no AI can yet replicate high-quality human journalism, ChatGPT currently offers the best overall performance and value.

The host (not explicitly named but evidently a returning organiser) invites CEO **Sam Altman** for a free-form Q-and-A.  Altman reflects on OpenAI\u2019s eight-year arc\u2014from a 14-person pure-research lab that could barely lift NVIDIA\u2019s first DGX-1 box to a platform serving **\u2248500 million weekly users** of ChatGPT and (reportedly) preparing a **$40 billion raise at a $340 billion valuation**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 2  Chronological Walk-through of Key Points  \n\n| Phase | Altman\u2019s Highlights | Strategic Subtext |\n|-------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| **2016\u201318:  \u201cLab phase\u201d** | *No plan beyond \u201cdo hard research\u201d*; early robotics & game-playing experiments. | Classic \u201cmoon-shot\u201d research funding model\u2014low burn, high freedom. |\n| **2019\u201320:  Early LLMs (GPT-1 \u2192 3)** | Unsupervised language modelling becomes internal skunk-works; GPT-2 weights public; GPT-3 API (mid-2020) gains *niche* uptake (copy-writing). | Realises billion-dollar compute bills require revenue; API monetisation born. |\n| **2021\u201322:  First consumer launches** | DALL-E precedes ChatGPT; Chat playground reveals *chatting* is the sticky use-case. ChatGPT 3.5 ships **30 Nov 2022**. | Discovery-led productisation: observe user behaviour first, build product later. |\n| **2023\u201324:  Scaling era** | Model quality leaps (GPT-4 family, then **o3** models). Organisation grows but keeps teams small, multiple products in flight. | \u201cBusy people, small teams\u201d mantra meant to stave off Big-Company inertia. |\n| **2025:  Platform ambition** | Goal is a *\u201ccore AI subscription\u201d* spanning ChatGPT, future devices, SDK-level extensibility. | Positioning to own the OS-layer of AI while inviting a start-up ecosystem on top. |\n\n---\n\n### 3  Thematic Analysis  \n\n| Theme | Altman\u2019s View | Implications & Tensions |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| **Product Velocity** | Growth must be matched by *more* projects; otherwise \u201cmolasses\u201d sets in. | Works while talent density is high; risk of quality drift as head-count scales. |\n| **Monetisation & Capital** | Infrastructure needs justify ever-larger raises (*$40 B round in progress*). | SoftBank-style mega-rounds can fund compute, but inflate expectations and regulatory scrutiny. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue201 |\n| **Platform vs. Ecosystem** | OpenAI will own \u201ccore subscription\u201d; SDK/API will emerge after iterations. | Start-ups must avoid direct overlap; coopetition dynamics similar to iOS/App Store circa 2010. |\n| **Voice & Multimodal** | Voice remains \u201cnot good enough\u201d\u2014but critical; envisages voice-plus-GUI UX and new device classes. | Echoes the iPhone moment: once latency, emotion and context are solved, hardware form-factors will change. |\n| **Coding Centrality** | Coding is *central*, not vertical; models should return runnable programs, act on the world. | Signals deeper pivot toward *agents* and program synthesis (cf. o3\u2019s code benchmarks). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201 |\n| **Customisation & Memory** | Platonic ideal: tiny reasoning core + **trillion-token** context that never retrains, only appends. | Points to context-window research, streaming personal data, and new privacy architectures. |\n| **Adoption Gap** | Start-ups and under-30s treat ChatGPT as OS / life advisor; enterprises move glacially. | Classic Innovator\u2019s Dilemma; window for SaaS insurgents before incumbents capitulate. |\n| **Road-map Timeline** | 2025 \u2192 agentic coding; 2026 \u2192 AI-aided scientific discovery; 2027 \u2192 robots deliver physical-world value. | Ambitious but offers a three-year horizon for investors & partners to align resources. |\n\n---\n\n### 4  Strategic Critique  \n\n1. **Core-Subscription Moat**  \n   *Strength*: recurring revenue + data fly-wheel.  \n   *Weakness*: If Apple, Google or a rival open platform bundles an equally strong model at OS level, OpenAI\u2019s direct-to-consumer channel could be squeezed.\n\n2. **\u201cWork Forwards, Not Backwards\u201d**  \n   Altman disdains grand master-plans. Agile opportunism served OpenAI during exploratory phases, but raising $40 B for giga-scale fabs implies long lead-time, supply-chain and policy commitments that *do* require backward planning.\n\n3. **Capital Intensity vs. Mission**  \n   The non-profit parent still owns the mission, but successive mega-rounds bring powerful investors whose exit horizons may clash with safety pacing or open research ideals.\n\n4. **Compute Bottleneck**  \n   Even with rumored SoftBank money, GPU shortages and grid-level power constraints could derail the timeline. Government partnerships or custom silicon (e.g., \u201cStargate\u201d) may become existential.\n\n5. **Enterprise Slow-Adopt Thesis**  \n   Altman forecasts a \u201clast-minute scramble\u201d. Historically, enterprises eventually *do* catch up\u2014sometimes by buying the insurgents. OpenAI\u2019s pending SDK must balance ease-of-integration with protecting its subscription moat.\n\n6. **Voice as Frontier**  \n   Apple, Google and dedicated voice-first start-ups hold UX patents and hardware ecosystems. OpenAI\u2019s success will hinge on cross-platform neutrality or a flagship hardware partner.\n\n---\n\n### 5  Opportunities for Stakeholders  \n\n| Stakeholder | Near-Term Bets (6-18 mo) | Mid-Term Bets (18-36 mo) |\n|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Start-ups** | Niche agent workflows (coding co-pilots for verticals, meeting-note\u2192action executors); wrappers around ChatGPT memory API. | Full agent-as-a-service businesses that orchestrate multiple tools; human-in-the-loop oversight layers. |\n| **Enterprises** | Pilot *internal* o3 models on proprietary data; create fast-track infosec approvals to avoid the \u201cyearly council\u201d trap. | Build unified context stores so future trillion-token windows can ingest historical corporate knowledge seamlessly. |\n| **Academia** | Exploit lower-cost o3/o4-mini access for large-scale humanities corpora; probe algorithmic bias cyclicality. | Partner on sensor-fusion multimodal research (voice, IoT, robotics) aligned with Altman\u2019s 2027 robot horizon. |\n| **Policy-makers** | Monitor capital concentration & energy use; craft compute-tiered safety regimes referenced in UK\u2019s 2025 AI Safety Report. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201 | Incentivise green AI fabs and open-weights disclosure checks as models cross new autonomy thresholds. |\n\n---\n\n### 6  Open Questions  \n\n1. **Will OpenAI\u2019s SDK look more like iOS (curated, high take-rate) or HTTP (open, commoditised)?**  \n2. **Can voice achieve \u201ctruly human-level\u201d realism without violating deep-fake or privacy regulations?**  \n3. **How will trillion-token contexts be stored, encrypted, and queried in real time?**  \n4. **What happens if the expected 10\u00d7 algorithmic break-through doesn\u2019t arrive and scaling laws plateau sooner than forecast?**  \n5. **Can enterprise lag be shortened by regulatory pressure (e.g., audit trails for AI-generated code in critical infra)?**  \n\n---\n\n### 7  Take-aways for E-Jay  \n\n* **Platform Strategy Matters**: Given your own AI-for-education projects, avoid direct competition with the \u201ccore subscription.\u201d Instead, create *domain-specialised agents* that rely on ChatGPT for reasoning but add proprietary data, workflow hooks, or regulatory compliance layers.  \n* **Coding Agents Are Prime Real-Estate**: Altman\u2019s emphasis on code as the actuator implies outsized demand for *secure code-generation and test frameworks*. Your mathematics + full-stack background is a competitive edge here.  \n* **Voice-Enhanced Learning Tools**: Keep an eye on OpenAI\u2019s next voice release\u2014immersive verbal tutoring could disrupt current text-based chatbot pedagogy in your tuition business.  \n* **Prepare for Context Expansion**: Start organising curricular and student-interaction data in structured stores; when multi-million-token windows arrive, you\u2019ll be ready to feed them rich context without retro-fitting.  \n\n---\n\n*Overall, the transcript reveals an OpenAI that is simultaneously opportunistic and massively capital-intensive, banking on sustained algorithmic gains and a platform-subscription moat.  For builders, the safe ground is to innovate on top of, *not against*, that core\u2014and to move faster than the incumbents who are still convening annual committees to approve AI pilots.*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":513,"end_idx":532,"safe_urls":["https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/openai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-raise-40b-at-a-340b-valuation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/openai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-raise-40b-at-a-340b-valuation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI said to be in talks to raise $40B at a $340B valuation","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/openai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-raise-40b-at-a-340b-valuation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1738195200.0,"snippet":"OpenAI is in talks to secure up to $40 billion in a funding round that would value the startup at $340 billion.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"TechCrunch"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue201","start_idx":2360,"end_idx":2378,"safe_urls":["https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/openai-rows-back-on-for-profit-plan-after-backlash-t6cj83whl?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/openai-rows-back-on-for-profit-plan-after-backlash-t6cj83whl?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI rows back on for-profit plan after backlash","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/openai-rows-back-on-for-profit-plan-after-backlash-t6cj83whl?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746511724.0,"snippet":"OpenAI has reversed its plan to transition to a fully for-profit model following backlash from former employees, civic leaders, and tech figures including Elon Musk.

A group of former employees also filed a legal brief supporting Musk\u2019s claims. Responding to these concerns, OpenAI announced that its nonprofit parent would retain control while still restructuring to raise capital. This decision allows continued oversight while enabling investment, including a proposed $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank at a $300 billion valuation.

It\u2019s the *primary interface* through which future models will **act on the world**, orchestrating APIs, databases, and devices. |\n| **Product direction** | He wants ChatGPT to \u201cbe excellent at writing code,\u201d eventually sending back *runnable* artefacts rather than static text. | The chat window evolves into a **live REPL**: every answer can be accompanied by compilable / executable code, blurring the line between assistant and autonomous software agent. |\n| **Infrastructure & tooling** | Internally \u201cit writes the parts that actually matter.\u201d Externally, a forthcoming SDK will let others \u201ctake over the ChatGPT UI.\u201d | Expect deeper hooks: secure sandboxes, agent frameworks, and policy layers so third-party apps can **delegate entire job-steps** (ETL, test automation, content pipelines) to GPT-powered code. |\n| **Economics & timeline** | Altman forecasts 2025 as \u201ca year of agents doing work\u2014**coding in particular** will be a dominant category.\u201d | Near-term value creation will concentrate on tools that replace or super-charge software-engineering labour: refactoring, integration glue, small-model edge deployment, etc. |\n| **Research implications** | Coding is the natural way for models to \u201cmake things happen.\u201d  Future milestones (tool-use, reasoning, robotics) all depend on reliable program synthesis and execution. | Breakthroughs in **long-horizon planning** or **safety via self-verification** are easier to test in the deterministic world of code than in free-form natural language. |\n\n### Why \u201ccoding centrality\u201d emerged as a dominant theme\n\n1. **Actuation over conversation**  \n   Language alone can *describe* a solution; code can **instantiate** it.  By pushing the model to emit programs, OpenAI converts cognitive output into immediately testable, value-producing actions.\n\n2. **Bridge to agents**  \n   Agents need a control language. Code is universal, sandboxable, and auditable\u2014ideal for letting models chain tools, call APIs, or drive robots while keeping human oversight straightforward.\n\n3. **Fly-wheel for model improvement**  \n   Every code snippet run provides a pass/fail signal.  That high-quality feedback loop accelerates reinforcement learning and self-correction far more efficiently than human-graded prose.\n\n4. **Barrier to incumbents**  \n   Cloud vendors and big-tech search rely on natural-language interfaces.  Owning the **code-generation layer** lets OpenAI stake out a moat where reliability, execution security, and developer mind-share matter more than pure token-prediction scale.\n\n### Actionable take-aways for you (E-Jay)\n\n* **Leverage coding agents early** \u2013 Your maths-plus-full-stack skill-set is perfect for building niche \u201cauto-tutor\u201d pipelines: ingestion of problem sets \u279c auto-generated worked solutions \u279c export to LaTeX/HTML.  \n* **Prepare for workflow orchestration** \u2013 Start modularising your education software (clear API endpoints, idempotent scripts).  GPT-style agents will soon stitch these together without manual glue-code.  \n* **Invest in verification layers** \u2013 As AI writes more of the \u201cmeaningful parts,\u201d demand for *formal checks, test harnesses and static analysis* will spike.  That\u2019s a defensible product space aligned with your mathematical rigour.  \n\nIn short, Altman\u2019s repeated emphasis makes coding not just another capability but the *keystone* through which smarter models will transition from impressive chat to world-changing utility."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"043d9376-660f-4bd7-83b2-78be900a174b","request_id":"93ef3288dfdffdf9-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"043d9376-660f-4bd7-83b2-78be900a174b","children":[]}}}
