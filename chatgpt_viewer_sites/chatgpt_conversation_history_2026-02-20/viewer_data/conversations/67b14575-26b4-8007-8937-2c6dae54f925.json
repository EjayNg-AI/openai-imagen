The goal is to preserve all content \u2013 including the database, plugins (e.g. All in One SEO), themes, and settings \u2013 during the move. Given a modest site size (~100MB) and no requirement for zero downtime, the process is straightforward. Below is a comprehensive guide covering manual migration steps, automated migration tools (with step-by-step usage), final checks, and a comparison of methods.\n\n## Manual Migration Method\n\nManual migration involves moving the WordPress files and database yourself. This gives you full control over the process. The high-level steps are: **export the site data from cPanel**, **transfer it to the Plesk server**, **import the data into Plesk**, and **configure WordPress on the new host**. All plugin data (e.g. All in One SEO settings) and theme settings are stored in the files/database, so they will migrate along with the site.\n\n### 1. Export WordPress Files and Database from cPanel\n\n- **Backup WordPress Files:** On the cPanel VPS, locate your WordPress installation (typically in the `public_html` folder for your domain). You can compress the entire WordPress folder (containing `wp-content`, `wp-admin`, `wp-includes`, and other files) into a ZIP using cPanel\u2019s File Manager or download files via FTP. Make sure to include all files, especially the `wp-content` folder where your plugins, themes, and uploads reside.  \n- **Export the Database:** Through cPanel, export your WordPress MySQL database. You can use **phpMyAdmin** (accessible in cPanel) to **export** the database as an SQL file. Alternatively, use cPanel\u2019s Backup tool to download a database backup. Ensure the SQL file contains all tables of your WordPress database.\n\n### 2. Transfer Files to the Plesk Server\n\n- **Set Up Domain in Plesk:** On the Plesk dedicated server, add the domain or create a new subscription for your site if not already done. This will provision a web root (typically the `httpdocs` directory for the domain in Plesk).  \n- **Upload WordPress Files:** Transfer the WordPress ZIP (or the extracted files) to the Plesk server. You can use FTP/SFTP with the Plesk account or use the Plesk **File Manager**. In Plesk, navigate to the domain\u2019s root folder (usually `httpdocs`) and upload the WordPress files there\u30101\u2020L395-L402\u3011. After uploading, ensure the directory structure is the same as on the old server (you should see `wp-content`, `wp-admin`, `wp-includes` inside `httpdocs`). \n\n### 3. Import the Database into Plesk\u2019s MySQL\n\n- **Create a New Database:** In Plesk, go to **Websites & Domains > Databases** (or a similar section). Create a new database for the WordPress site. For convenience, you can use the same database name, username, and password that your site had on cPanel \u2013 Plesk allows you to specify these when creating the database\u30102\u2020L419-L427\u3011. (You can find the old DB name/user in the `wp-config.php` from the backup if unsure.) If you choose different credentials, you will need to update `wp-config.php` accordingly in the next step.  \n- **Import the SQL file:** After creating the database in Plesk, use **Import Dump** (via Plesk\u2019s database management or phpMyAdmin in Plesk) to import the SQL backup of your WordPress database\u30102\u2020L428-L436\u3011. This will recreate all tables and data (posts, users, plugin settings, etc.) on the new server.\n\n### 4. Configure WordPress on the New Server\n\n- **Update wp-config.php:** Edit the `wp-config.php` file in the `httpdocs` folder on Plesk to ensure the database settings match the new database. Update the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and (if different) `DB_HOST` (usually `localhost` on Plesk) values to the ones you set up in Plesk\u30102\u2020L419-L427\u3011. Save the file.  \n- **Check File Permissions:** Ensure that file permissions are correct on the new server. Typically, directories should be `755` and files `644` on Linux hosts\u301030\u2020L5-L12\u3011. Plesk usually sets correct ownership automatically, but if you uploaded via FTP, verify that the files are owned by the Plesk subscription user to avoid permission issues.  \n- **Domain and URL Settings:** If you are keeping the **same domain name**, you usually don\u2019t need to change any site URL settings \u2013 the URLs in the database will still reference your domain. (The All in One SEO plugin data will also carry over seamlessly since the domain hasn\u2019t changed.) If the domain **is changing**, you\u2019d need to update the WordPress Address/Site Address in the database or wp-admin and perform a search-and-replace for the old URL in the database. But in a same-domain scenario, this step can be skipped.  \n- **Additional Configurations:** If your site had an SSL certificate, you should install a matching SSL on the new server (Plesk can obtain a Let\u2019s Encrypt certificate for your domain or you can install your existing cert) so that HTTPS continues to work. Also ensure any custom DNS records or email settings for the domain are configured in Plesk if needed (though email could be migrated separately).\n\n### 5. (Optional) Register the WordPress Installation in Plesk\n\nPlesk has a WordPress Toolkit. Although not strictly necessary, it\u2019s a good idea to have Plesk recognize the new WordPress instance. In Plesk, go to **WordPress** (Toolkit) and scan for installations. Plesk will detect the files and import the install into its management interface\u30102\u2020L433-L441\u3011. This helps in managing updates and settings via Plesk and confirms the files are correctly placed.\n\n## Automated Migration Tools\n\nSeveral tools can simplify the migration process by automating file transfer, database import, and configuration. These include Plesk\u2019s built-in migrator as well as popular WordPress migration plugins. Below is a review of available tools and how to use them:\n\n### Plesk Migrator (Automated cPanel to Plesk Transfer)\n\nPlesk provides a **Migrator extension** that can transfer accounts from a cPanel server to a Plesk server automatically. This is useful if you have root access (or at least cPanel account credentials) and want to migrate the entire hosting account (files, databases, emails, etc.). For a WordPress site, Plesk Migrator will copy all website files and the database for you. \n\n**How to use Plesk Migrator:**  \n1. **Install Plesk Migrator:** Log in to your Plesk server, go to **Extensions** > **Plesk Migrator** (under Server Tools), and install it if not already present\u30103\u2020L377-L385\u3011.  \n2. **Start a New Migration:** Open the Plesk Migrator extension (usually under Extensions > My Extensions). Click **\u201cStart a New Migration.\u201d**  \n3. **Enter cPanel Server Details:** Choose the panel type as **cPanel**. Enter the source server\u2019s IP address, SSH port (22 by default), and the **root** username and password for the cPanel server (or you can use the cPanel account credentials if you don\u2019t have root)\u30103\u2020L381-L388\u3011. This allows Plesk to remotely access the source server.  \n4. **Select Data to Migrate:** The migrator will fetch a list of accounts/domains on the cPanel server. Select the specific cPanel account or domain corresponding to your WordPress site. You can usually migrate the whole account which includes the web files, databases, and mail.  \n5. **Run the Migration:** Proceed with the migration wizard. Plesk will copy over the website files and databases to the new server automatically\u30103\u2020L381-L388\u3011. (It can also recreate mail accounts, but if you only care about the website, the web content and DB are key.) The tool will preserve the WordPress files, database contents, and configurations from cPanel.  \n6. **Post-Migration:** Once complete, Plesk will report the migration status. Your WordPress site should now be present under the domain in Plesk. Double-check that the files are in `httpdocs` and the database is imported. Plesk Migrator typically also updates the `wp-config.php` for you. Review the site via the Plesk provided preview URL or hosts file (see testing section below) to ensure it\u2019s working.\n\n**Note:** Plesk Migrator is very convenient for a direct cPanel-to-Plesk move. It automates what you would do manually, and can save time and reduce errors\u301016\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Ensure you have enough disk space on both servers and that firewall/SSH settings allow the two servers to communicate during migration. This method is ideal if you want to migrate **everything** (multiple sites or email data) in one go. If you only want the WordPress site and prefer plugin-based approaches, consider the following WordPress-specific tools:\n\n### All-in-One WP Migration Plugin\n\n**All-in-One WP Migration** is a popular WordPress plugin that exports your entire site (content, media, plugins, themes, and the database) into a single file, which can then be imported on the new server. It\u2019s known for its simplicity and reliability for small to medium sites. The free version supports exports and imports up to 512MB by default, which is well above a 100MB site.\n\n- **Exporting the Site:** Install the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin on your WordPress site (from the Plugins menu). In the WordPress dashboard, go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Export**. Choose **Export to File** (you can also export directly to a cloud storage with extensions, but a file download is simplest). The plugin will generate a `.wpress` file which contains your entire site\u2019s data\u301024\u2020L78-L84\u3011. Download this file to your local computer. *(This file includes your uploads, plugins, themes, and the database. Note that All-in-One WP Migration exports the site **contents and database**, but not the WordPress core files themselves\u301011\u2020L1-L8\u3011.)*  \n- **Preparing the New Server:** On the Plesk server, make sure WordPress is installed for your site. You can use Plesk\u2019s WordPress Toolkit to install a fresh WordPress instance on the domain (or do a manual WP install). The version of WordPress should ideally match or be close to the source version. Install the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin on this new WordPress (just as you did on the source).  \n- **Importing the Site:** In the new WordPress dashboard, go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Import**. Upload the `.wpress` file you downloaded. The plugin will upload and then replace the new site\u2019s database and files with the content from the file. After import, it will prompt you to save permalinks. The plugin handles all the find-and-replace for the website URLs if the domain is unchanged, so your site should be ready to go once import finishes.  \n- **Finalize:** After import, log in to the WordPress admin on Plesk (using the same credentials from the old site, which were migrated). Go to **Settings > Permalinks** and just click Save (to regenerate .htaccess if needed). Verify that all plugins (including All in One SEO and others) and content are present. All-in-One WP Migration moves plugin settings and content as part of the database migration, so SEO meta data and settings will be intact.\n\n*Pros:* Extremely easy (few clicks) and good for non-technical users. No need to manually deal with databases or FTP.  \n*Cons:* Requires installing WordPress and the plugin on the destination. The free version has an upload size limit (which can be extended via extensions or by tricks like splitting, but 100MB is fine). Also, you cannot selectively exclude content \u2013 it\u2019s an all-in-one package.\n\n### Duplicator Plugin\n\n**Duplicator** is another powerful migration plugin that creates a packaged backup of your site which can be used to re-deploy the site on a new server. It generates two files: an archive (ZIP) of your site\u2019s files **and** database, and an `installer.php` script. \n\n- **Create a Duplicator Package (Backup):** Install and activate **Duplicator** on your source WordPress site. In wp-admin, go to **Duplicator > Packages** and click **\u201cCreate New\u201d**. The plugin will scan your site and then let you build a package. Once the build is complete, download the package ZIP file and the `installer.php` file to your computer\u301018\u2020L308-L317\u3011\u301018\u2020L323-L332\u3011. This package contains all your site\u2019s content: \u201cthe WordPress database, core files, active themes, and plugins are all easily portable\u201d in one zip\u301016\u2020L49-L57\u3011. \n- **Prepare the Destination:** Unlike All-in-One, you **do not need to pre-install WordPress** on the new server with Duplicator. Ensure the domain is set up in Plesk and an empty web root (`httpdocs`) is ready. Also create a new MySQL database in Plesk for this site (and note the database name, user, password). You can do this via Plesk\u2019s Databases section similar to the manual method.  \n- **Upload Package to Plesk:** Transfer the Duplicator package ZIP and the `installer.php` to the `httpdocs` directory on the Plesk server. You can use FTP or Plesk\u2019s File Manager to upload these files. They should reside in the web root (for example, `httpdocs/installer.php` and the zip file alongside it).  \n- **Run the Installer:** In a browser, navigate to `http://your-domain.com/installer.php` (using the domain that is now pointing to Plesk, or use the server IP/hosts file if DNS isn\u2019t switched yet). This will launch Duplicator\u2019s installation wizard\u301020\u2020L368-L376\u3011. Follow the steps: you\u2019ll be prompted to enter the new database credentials (DB name, user, password that you set up in Plesk; host is usually localhost)\u301020\u2020L369-L377\u3011. Duplicator will test the connection to ensure it can communicate with the database. Then continue to run the deployment, which will import the database and extract all files into the web root\u301020\u2020L371-L379\u3011. It will also update the site URL if needed (in this case, if the domain is the same, old and new URL will be identical and no changes are needed)\u301020\u2020L379-L387\u3011.  \n- **Finalize:** Duplicator will prompt you to update any settings and remove the installer files. After it\u2019s done, you should have a fully functional copy of your site on the Plesk server. Login to wp-admin (same credentials as before) and check that everything looks correct. As always, saving the Permalinks settings once is a good idea after migration. \n\nDuplicator essentially performs a manual migration for you but with an automated installer, and **it even installs WordPress core files** as part of the process. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to install WordPress on your new host first. Duplicator does this for you\u201d\u301020\u2020L361-L370\u3011. This plugin is very reliable and can handle serialized data replacements. *One benefit* is that it can handle migrating the site even if the domain changes, and it\u2019s also useful for creating staging copies. *For a 100MB site, the process will be quick.* (Larger sites might require Duplicator Pro for easier handling of big packages.)\n\n### Migrate Guru Plugin\n\n**Migrate Guru** is a specialized migration plugin by BlogVault, designed to handle migrations through an automated process with minimal effort from the user. It\u2019s particularly known for being able to migrate large sites (up to 200 GB) by offloading the heavy lifting to their servers, thus avoiding timeouts on your own host. It supports a wide range of hosting environments (5000+ hosts) and is free.\n\n- **Source Setup:** Install **Migrate Guru** on the source WordPress site (the cPanel VPS site). There\u2019s no need to install it on the destination site as a permanent plugin, but you *do* need a WordPress instance running on the destination or at least the ability to provide FTP/SSH details. (Migrate Guru\u2019s documentation suggests having WordPress on the destination, but it can also deploy to an empty directory via FTP).  \n- **Start Migration with Migrate Guru:** In the source site\u2019s wp-admin, go to **Migrate Guru** plugin. It will ask where you want to migrate the site to. You\u2019ll choose the target host or \u201cOther Hosting\u201d if your host isn\u2019t listed. For Plesk, you can typically use FTP or SFTP details of the Plesk server (host, FTP username, password, and destination directory path). Provide the destination site\u2019s info. If WordPress is already installed on Plesk, you might alternatively provide that site\u2019s WP login (for certain hosts, Migrate Guru can use the destination plugin).  \n- **One-Click Migration:** After entering the required information, click **Migrate**. Migrate Guru will copy your site to their temporary cloud storage and then move it onto the new server automatically\u301021\u2020L7-L15\u3011. It also performs an intelligent search-and-replace of URLs and handles serialized data. You\u2019ll get real-time updates and email alerts about the migration status\u301021\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301023\u2020L89-L97\u3011. Once finished, it will tell you the migration is complete.  \n- **Post-Migration:** The site should now be live on the Plesk server. Migrate Guru automatically cleans up any temporary files on its own servers after the transfer is done\u301021\u2020L17-L22\u3011. Verify the site on the new server as usual.\n\nMigrate Guru is very straightforward: essentially \u201cinstall Migrate Guru on the site you want to clone and [provide details for] the destination site, enter a few details, and click migrate\u201d\u301021\u2020L13-L16\u3011. *Pros:* No manual file or DB handling, handles large sites well, free and doesn\u2019t require staying logged in during migration. *Cons:* Requires trust in a third-party service (as your site passes through their servers), and you need to have or provide correct access info for the destination. For a 100MB site, it\u2019s likely overkill, but it ensures a smooth move with minimal chance of error.\n\n### UpdraftPlus (Backup/Restore or Migrator)\n\n**UpdraftPlus** is a top-rated WordPress backup plugin that can also be used for migrations. The free version allows you to back up your site (files and database) and restore it on another WordPress installation. There\u2019s also a premium **UpdraftPlus Migrator** add-on that streamlines direct site-to-site transfers, but you can migrate with the free version by manually moving backup files.\n\n- **Backup with UpdraftPlus:** Install **UpdraftPlus** on the source site. In wp-admin, go to **Settings > UpdraftPlus Backups**. Perform a **Backup Now**, making sure you include all components (files, database, plugins, themes, uploads). You can configure UpdraftPlus to send backups to remote storage (like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) or just create a downloadable backup stored on the server. Once the backup is complete, download all the backup files (or ensure they\u2019re in your remote storage and you have access). UpdraftPlus typically produces multiple zip files (for database, plugins, themes, uploads, etc.).  \n- **Prepare New Site:** On the Plesk server, install WordPress (if not already) and then install the UpdraftPlus plugin. You can either upload the backup files to the new server (via FTP into the `wp-content/updraft` folder) or reconnect UpdraftPlus to the same remote storage where you stored the backup.  \n- **Restore on New Site:** In the new site\u2019s WordPress dashboard, go to **Settings > UpdraftPlus**. If you placed the files in the `wp-content/updraft` folder, click **Rescan Local Folder** to have UpdraftPlus recognize them. If using remote storage, connect the plugin to that storage (e.g., log into Dropbox from UpdraftPlus settings) and click **Rescan Remote Storage**. You should see the backup set listed. Click **Restore** on the backup set and follow the prompts to restore all components (plugins, themes, uploads, others, and database)\u301029\u2020L104-L113\u3011. UpdraftPlus will import the database and files into the new site. After restoration, your site should match the old site completely.  \n- **Finalize:** Log in with your old admin credentials (migrated) and verify the site. As with other methods, check permalinks and functionality. UpdraftPlus essentially **copies the files and database** from one site to another, so all plugin settings (SEO, etc.) come along\u301029\u2020L104-L113\u3011. One extra step: In WordPress Settings, ensure the Site URL and Home URL are correct for the new domain (they should be, if the same domain, they\u2019ll be the same; if different, you might need to update them).\n\nUsing UpdraftPlus for migration is effective, especially if you already use it for backups. *Pros:* Reliable backups and restores, can use cloud storage to transfer, no separate migration script needed. *Cons:* A bit more hands-on than a dedicated migration plugin, and restoring from backups can be slightly slower. The free version requires manual steps as described (the premium migrator can do direct site-to-site transfers in \u201ca matter of minutes\u201d\u301027\u2020L25-L32\u3011). Nonetheless, for a one-time migration, the free method works well \u2013 just be patient during the backup and restore processes.\n\n## Finalization and Testing\n\nAfter migrating the site (by any method), a few final steps will ensure everything is running smoothly on the new Plesk server:\n\n- **DNS Update:** Update your domain\u2019s DNS settings to point to the new server **when you\u2019re ready to switch the site live**. This typically means changing the A record to the new server\u2019s IP address or updating nameservers if you are using the hosting provider\u2019s DNS. Since zero-downtime isn\u2019t required, you can do this at a convenient time. Keep in mind DNS propagation can take some hours (up to 24-48 hours, though often much quicker). During propagation, some visitors might still hit the old server until the change fully propagates.  \n  - *Tip:* To test the migrated site **before** switching DNS, you can use a local `hosts` file modification to point the domain to the new server\u2019s IP on your own computer\u30102\u2020L440-L448\u3011. This way you can navigate the site as if the DNS had switched, allowing you to verify everything in advance. Plesk also sometimes provides a temporary domain or preview link (like `http://<server-ip>/preview/<domain>`), but the hosts file method lets you test the actual domain.  \n- **Test Site Functionality:** Once the domain is pointing to the Plesk server, thoroughly test the website:  \n  - Browse multiple pages to ensure there are no 404 errors or missing content.  \n  - If you had any forms, search functions, or interactive features, test those.  \n  - Verify that plugins are working. For example, check that the All in One SEO plugin\u2019s meta titles/descriptions are showing up on pages as expected. These settings are stored in the database and should have come over. The plugin should already be installed (from the migration) and active; you might just need to re-enable any specific integrations or re-generate sitemaps if applicable.  \n  - If the site uses e-commerce (WooCommerce) or other dynamic features, do a test transaction (in a sandbox mode) or check that orders/customers are intact.  \n  - Check media files (images, downloads) to ensure they load properly. If any URLs in the database still pointed to the old host\u2019s URL or IP, they might appear broken \u2013 in such a case, use a search/replace tool to fix URLs. However, if the domain stayed the same, this is usually not an issue.  \n- **Permalinks and .htaccess:** If you encounter broken links for pretty URLs (permalinks), go to **Settings > Permalinks** in WP admin and click **Save**. This refreshes WordPress\u2019s rewrite rules and can regenerate the `.htaccess` file if needed. On Plesk (Linux/Apache), the `.htaccess` from cPanel should work similarly. If the Plesk server is Linux with Apache or nginx, ensure that the Plesk hosting settings have \u201cPermalink Settings/Allow override\u201d enabled (Plesk\u2019s WordPress Toolkit usually does this).  \n- **File Permissions & Ownership:** If you face issues like the site unable to upload media or write to `wp-content` (for caching plugins, etc.), double-check file permissions. As noted, standard permissions are folders `755` and files `644`, and the files should be owned by the Plesk user. Adjusting these via Plesk\u2019s File Manager or SSH (`chown/chmod`) might be necessary if something wasn\u2019t carried over correctly. This is a common issue if, for instance, files were uploaded as root or another user \u2013 WordPress may not be able to modify them. Correcting ownership to the Plesk subscription user resolves this.  \n- **Configuration Files:** Ensure any custom configurations carried over. For example, if you had custom rules in your `.htaccess` (pretty common for caching plugins or security plugins), confirm that `.htaccess` made it over and is active. Also check `wp-config.php` for any hard-coded domain or directory paths that might need an update (usually not needed unless there were custom defines).  \n- **SSL Certificate:** If you haven\u2019t already, set up SSL on the new server so that `https://yourdomain.com` works without errors. You can install the same certificate from the old server or use Let\u2019s Encrypt via Plesk. After installing, test that the site loads over HTTPS and that the certificate is valid.  \n- **Email and Other Services:** If your domain\u2019s email was hosted on the old server and you plan to use the new server for email, create the email accounts in Plesk and update MX records accordingly. (This is outside the WordPress site migration, but part of going live on the new server.)  \n- **Troubleshooting Common Issues:**  \n  - *Database connection errors:* If you see a WordPress error like \u201cError establishing a database connection,\u201d double-check the `wp-config.php` credentials on the Plesk server. This means either the DB name, user, or password is incorrect, or MySQL isn\u2019t running. Fix the credentials or create the database user as needed.  \n  - *White screen or PHP errors:* Ensure the PHP version on Plesk is compatible with your WordPress and plugins. Plesk allows per-domain PHP version selection. Match it to what you had on cPanel if possible (or upgrade if everything supports it). Enable WP_DEBUG in wp-config to see any errors if a plugin is failing.  \n  - *Broken layout or missing styles:* This could be due to missing files (check that your theme files are all present) or incorrect URL references. Inspect the page source to see if CSS/JS is loading from the correct domain. Usually, re-importing or correcting URLs fixes this. Clearing any caches (both on WordPress \u2013 e.g., plugin cache \u2013 and browser cache) can also help if you had caching in place on the old site.  \n  - *Email forms not working:* If your site sends emails (contact form notifications, etc.), ensure the new server is configured to send mail. Sometimes the old server might have had an SMTP plugin or specific PHP mail setup; replicate that on Plesk (you might need to update SMTP settings in a plugin to use new mail server credentials or use a service like SMTP).  \n  - *Testing from multiple locations:* Remember that after DNS change, some users might still hit the old server for a short while. It\u2019s often safe to keep the old site running for a day or two (perhaps put it in maintenance mode with a notice) until you\u2019re confident DNS has propagated, then shut it down.\n\nBy performing these checks, you ensure the migrated site is fully functional on the new dedicated server before announcing the move complete. Plesk\u2019s WordPress Toolkit can also perform some health checks on the installation (like checking for required modules, updates, security improvements), which is a nice bonus to run after migration.\n\n## Comparison of Migration Methods\n\nBoth manual and automated methods will get your WordPress site moved, but there are trade-offs in terms of ease, control, and risk. Here\u2019s a quick comparison to help decide which approach to use:\n\n**Manual Migration:**  \n- *Pros:* Gives you **greater control** over each component of the migration. No third-party plugins or tools doing things behind the scenes \u2013 you see exactly what\u2019s transferred. This can be reassuring for pinpointing issues. It also doesn\u2019t require installing any migration plugin (some prefer not to add plugins for one-time tasks). Manual methods are universally applicable (works in any environment) and free of charge.  \n- *Cons:* It\u2019s more **time-consuming** and requires technical knowledge of FTP, databases, and server configuration. There is a higher chance of human error \u2013 e.g., forgetting to move a file or import part of the database. If you\u2019re not experienced, troubleshooting issues can be challenging. Manual migration can involve more downtime if not planned well (though in this scenario downtime isn\u2019t critical). In short, manual migration \u201crequires more time and technical knowledge,\u201d whereas automated solutions can handle repetitive tasks and reduce errors\u301033\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301036\u2020L7-L12\u3011.\n\n**Automated Migration (Plugins/Tools):**  \n- *Pros:* **Ease of use** is the big advantage. Automated tools handle the heavy lifting \u2013 copying files, exporting/importing the database, and even doing search-and-replace for URLs or fixing serialized data. This means a much faster process with fewer steps for you. Many plugins (like those discussed: All-in-One WP Migration, Duplicator, Migrate Guru) are **free** or have free versions that handle standard migrations, so you might not need to spend anything. They are also generally reliable; for example, Duplicator \u201chandles most of the work you would otherwise need to do manually, saving time and reducing the chance of an error\u201d\u301016\u2020L49-L57\u3011. When using a host-provided tool like **Plesk Migrator**, the process is streamlined via the hosting panels and can migrate multiple sites or whole accounts in one go \u2013 useful if you have more than one site on that cPanel. Automated methods can also achieve near zero-downtime if done carefully (you can prepare the new site in the background, then just switch DNS).  \n- *Cons:* **Less control** over the details. If something goes wrong, you might have to dig into logs or rely on support/forums for that tool. Some plugins have limitations (for instance, All-in-One WP Migration free version has an import size limit of 512MB, which can be an issue for larger sites; Duplicator might require tweaks on low-memory servers to build packages). There\u2019s also a slight overhead of installing and removing migration plugins \u2013 though you can delete them after use. In rare cases, plugin migrations can fail due to environment issues (like timeouts, file size limits, etc.), which then require manual intervention anyway. With Plesk Migrator, you need admin access and there could be compatibility considerations between panel versions or needing to update the Migrator tool. Also, automated tools might not migrate every single setting of the hosting environment (for example, DNS zones, if you\u2019re migrating between hosts, often need to be updated manually even if the site content moves\u30105\u2020L297-L304\u3011).\n\n**Downtime Considerations:** In this use-case, zero downtime is not required, which simplifies things. Manual migration might involve putting the site in maintenance mode during the switch, whereas plugin methods can often copy the site while it\u2019s live and you switch over when ready (minimal downtime). If downtime isn\u2019t a concern, you can choose either method purely on convenience and comfort. For the least downtime, one of the automated methods where you prepare the new site fully before updating DNS is ideal (you can even do this manually by using the hosts file technique to set up the new site).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- If you prefer a **hands-off, straightforward** process and are moving just a single WordPress site, using a **WordPress migration plugin** like **All-in-One WP Migration** or **Duplicator** is highly recommended. These plugins are user-friendly and reliable for a site of ~100MB. For instance, with All-in-One WP Migration, you can export and import in a few clicks, which is very easy for beginners. Duplicator is also excellent if you are slightly more technical and want a full packaged backup (it\u2019s a favorite for many because it ensures everything, including WordPress core, is moved in one shot). Migrate Guru is an option if you want to just push a button and let it handle everything via an external service \u2013 especially useful if your internet connection is a bottleneck for uploading/downloading the site archive, or if you had a much larger site.  \n- If you are **comfortable with hosting panels** or have multiple sites/emails to move, the **Plesk Migrator** tool can save a lot of time by migrating the entire account from cPanel to Plesk. This is a great choice when moving a **batch of sites or a whole server**, as it preserves more than just the web content (it can bring over mailboxes, etc., and set up the domains in one go). For a single WordPress site, Plesk Migrator is perhaps more than you need, but it will certainly do the job with minimal effort (just a bit of setup to connect to the source).  \n- If you opt for **manual migration**, perhaps for learning purposes or out of necessity, double-check each step and consider using a maintenance plugin on the source site to freeze content changes during the move. Manual is a fine approach for a site this size \u2013 the 100MB of data can be moved quickly \u2013 just remember to correctly update configurations. It\u2019s free and doesn\u2019t require any additional tools, but be prepared to do thorough testing and troubleshooting of any issues as outlined above.\n\nIn summary, both methods can result in a successful migration with all content intact. Automated methods are generally **easier and less error-prone**, whereas manual migration is **more granular and gives full control**. Given that downtime is not a big concern here, you have the flexibility to choose whichever method you\u2019re most comfortable with. Just ensure to follow the steps carefully, and you\u2019ll have your WordPress site up and running on the Plesk dedicated server with all plugins (e.g. All in One SEO), themes, and settings preserved.

usually quick).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Install Fresh WordPress Site on Plesk**\n\n- Log into your new **Plesk** account.\n- Under **Websites & Domains**, select your domain.\n- Use **WordPress Toolkit** in Plesk to install a fresh copy of WordPress.\n\nThis ensures a clean, optimized, and up-to-date WordPress installation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Restore Theme to New WordPress Site**\n\n- Unzip your downloaded theme folder (`my-theme-folder.zip`).\n- Upload the theme to your new server:\n  - via Plesk File Manager or FTP/SFTP to:  \n    ```\n    /httpdocs/wp-content/themes/\n    ```\n- Log into new WordPress dashboard \u2192 **Appearance \u2192 Themes**  \n  - Activate your uploaded theme.\n\nYour theme, along with all customizations (styles, scripts, etc.), is now restored.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Import Content into New WordPress Installation**\n\n- In your new WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to:\n  - **Dashboard \u2192 Tools \u2192 Import**\n- Select **WordPress** importer:\n  - If prompted, install the importer plugin.\n  - Upload your previously exported XML file (`wordpress-content.xml`).\n- Follow the prompts:\n  - Assign posts to your user account, ensure media attachments are downloaded automatically.\n\nThis step imports your blog posts, pages, categories, and media content links.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Reinstall and Import All In One SEO Plugin Settings**\n\n- In your new WordPress admin, install the **All in One SEO plugin** fresh from:\n  - **Dashboard \u2192 Plugins \u2192 Add New**\n- After activating, navigate to:\n  - **All in One SEO \u2192 Tools \u2192 Import/Export**\n- Choose the file you previously exported (`aioseo-export.json`) and import it.\n\nAll your SEO meta tags, keywords, XML sitemap settings, and plugin configurations will be fully restored.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verify and Finalize the New Site**\n\n- Verify theme customizations and functionality.\n- Check posts, pages, media links for any broken links or images.\n- Check your SEO plugin data (meta descriptions, titles, sitemaps).\n- Re-save permalinks:\n  - **Settings \u2192 Permalinks \u2192 Save**\n\nEnsure SSL certificate installation on your new Plesk server if required.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc **Advantages of This Method:**\n- **Fresh, clean installation:** Ensures no legacy issues.\n- **Selective Data Migration:** Precisely control what gets migrated.\n- **SEO Data Preservation:** SEO settings migrate without loss.\n- **Ease of Troubleshooting:** Easier to identify and rectify any migration issues.\n\n## \ud83d\udccc **Drawbacks to Consider:**\n- Requires slightly more manual work than plugin-based automated migration.\n- DNS propagation may cause temporary downtime (not critical in your scenario).\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation:**\n\n**This is the ideal method for your scenario**, balancing a fresh setup with precise data migration and preservation of SEO.

New site is accessible via IP or temporary URL only.**\n\n- \u2705 **Import Content into New Server**:\n  - Use **WordPress importer** to load the content XML file.\n  - Import media attachments (automatically downloaded from the old server URLs).\n  - Import **All in One SEO settings** into the new installation.\n\n- \u2705 **Remove placeholder/demo content**:\n  - Delete any unwanted placeholder pages, posts, categories, and tags.\n\n- \u2705 **Verify and Test on New Server**:\n  - Check posts, pages, categories, tags, media, SEO data, theme layout, and navigation.\n  - Verify correct URLs and permalinks structure.\n  - Check and configure SSL certificates (Let\u2019s Encrypt via Plesk recommended).\n\n**Once everything looks good via IP or temporary URL, you're ready for DNS change.**\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Important Checkpoint:** Before DNS Change\n\n- Confirm the new WordPress installation is fully functional and complete.\n- Perform comprehensive testing via IP or temporary URL to ensure no major issues remain.\n- At this point, your **old site remains publicly accessible**, and you have flexibility to troubleshoot privately without visitors seeing any disruption.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: DNS Domain Name Re-pointing (The Actual Switch)**\n\n- \u2705 **DNS Record Update**:\n  - Access your domain\u2019s DNS management panel (typically at your domain registrar or DNS provider).\n  - Change the **A record** of your domain to the IP address of the new dedicated server.\n\n- **Example:**  \n  ```\n  yourdomain.com  A  New-Server-IP\n  www.yourdomain.com  CNAME  yourdomain.com\n  ```\n\n- \u2705 **Propagation**:\n  - DNS propagation typically takes **minutes to a few hours**, though sometimes up to 24 hours worldwide.  \n  - Visitors gradually switch from accessing the old server to the new one.\n\n- \u2705 **Recommended action on old site (optional)**:\n  - After DNS update, consider putting the old site into \"**maintenance mode**\" with a notice indicating a migration is in progress.\n  - This helps prevent new interactions (comments, orders, etc.) occurring on the old site during propagation.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Post DNS Switch Checks and Finalization**\n\n**Once your domain fully points to the new server (typically after a few hours):**\n\n- \u2705 **Final Tests on New Server**:\n  - Access your domain directly (no longer via IP/temporary URL).\n  - Check site navigation, posts/pages rendering, SEO data, permalinks, SSL certificate.\n  - Check search engine indexing settings in All in One SEO, ensuring no accidental blocking.\n\n- \u2705 **Re-save Permalinks** (crucial step):\n  - Go to **WordPress Admin \u2192 Settings \u2192 Permalinks \u2192 Save** to refresh URL structures.\n\n- \u2705 **Set up redirects (if URL structure changed)**:\n  - If URLs have changed substantially (unlikely here), set up proper 301 redirects to preserve SEO.\n\n- \u2705 **Monitor the Site**:\n  - Monitor traffic, SEO rankings, and functionality closely for the first few days post-migration.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc **DNS Update Placement Summary (Critical Point):**\n\n- Perform all preparation and imports **BEFORE** updating DNS.  \n- DNS re-pointing is best done **AFTER** new server content import, verification, and configuration steps are complete and successful.\n- Final checks and configuration occur immediately **AFTER** DNS has fully propagated.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n\n\u2705 **Minimal disruption**  \n\u2705 **Easier troubleshooting** (without users noticing)  \n\u2705 **Clear separation** of steps (pre-DNS and post-DNS).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea9 **Important Tips for Smooth DNS Transition:**\n\n- Lower your DNS TTL (time-to-live) **24 hours ahead** of the change (recommended value: ~300-600 seconds). This accelerates propagation.\n- DNS changes should ideally be performed during low-traffic hours.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Final Recommended Integration Sequence (Summary)**\n\n| Step                                 | Domain Points To            |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Export Content from Old Server       | Old Server \u2705                |\n| Set Up New WordPress Installation    | Old Server \u2705                |\n| Import Content & Test New Setup      | Old Server \u2705                |\n| **Change DNS to New Server IP**      | **Change from Old \u2192 New \u2705** |\n| Post-DNS Switch Verification         | New Server \u2705                |\n\nThis structured approach clearly integrates DNS re-pointing at the most logical point of your migration, reducing disruption and simplifying troubleshooting."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"297ba7c4-b04a-4f85-81a8-184d38a49dda","request_id":"922ad063b8c75037-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"297ba7c4-b04a-4f85-81a8-184d38a49dda","children":[]}}}
