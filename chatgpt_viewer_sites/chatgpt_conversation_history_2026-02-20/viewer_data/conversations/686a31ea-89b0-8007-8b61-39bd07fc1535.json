But his big bill may come at a political cost","snippet":"President Donald Trump secured passage of a major multitrillion-dollar bill centered on tax cuts, branding it the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" and pushing it through Congress with unanimous Republican support. However, the political cost may be steep. Democrats argue the legislation benefits the wealthy, while making deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, projecting 11.8 million more uninsured Americans by 2034. Trump's provisions to cut taxes on tips and overtime aim to counter this narrative, but nonpartisan analysts remain skeptical. Critics, including some Republicans, worry about a repeat of political backlash similar to what Democrats faced after passing the Affordable Care Act. Early polling shows the legislation is unpopular among independents and some Republicans. Trump's past tax cuts didn't yield electoral gains, raising concerns that this bill may hurt GOP prospects in the 2026 midterms. Despite promising not to touch Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, Trump\u2019s finalized bill notably reduces social safety net benefits, further fueling Democratic attacks. Some GOP lawmakers, like Sen. Thom Tillis and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, opposed or expressed reservations about the bill, foreseeing political fallout. Still, Trump remains defiant, dismissing opposition as partisan hatred.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751719420.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/live/donald-trump-news-updates-7-3-2025","title":"House passes Trump\u2019s signature bill, sending it to the president\u2019s desk","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751616982.095904,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cbo.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61187","title":"The Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025 to 2055","snippet":"This report presents the Congressional Budget Office's projections of what the federal budget and the economy would look like over the next 30 years.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743033600.0,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60870","title":"The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2025 to 2035","snippet":"In CBO's projections, the federal budget deficit is $1.9 trillion this year, and federal debt rises to 118 percent of GDP in 2035.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1737072000.0,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61270","title":"The Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025 to 2055","snippet":"In CBO's projections, federal debt held by the public rises in every year of the 2025\u20132055 period, reaches 156 percent of gross domestic product ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743033600.0,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61196/html","title":"Monthly Budget Review: February 2025","snippet":"Outlays for net interest on the public debt increased by $44 billion (or 12 percent) primarily because the debt was larger than it was in the first five ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tax-bill-averts-one-debt-crisis-makes-future-financial-woes-worse-2025-07-03/","title":"Trump tax bill averts one debt crisis but makes future financial woes ...","snippet":"As part of the tax package, lawmakers raised the U.S. government's $36.1 trillion borrowing limit that it was projected to hit later this summer ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751616982.095904,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aljazeera.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/when-will-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-take-effect-heres-what-comes-next","title":"When will Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 take effect?

Three key variables are expected to shape the market\u2019s trajectory: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s debt issuance strategy, the Trump administration\u2019s new tariffs, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Bessent aims to avoid increasing long-term debt issuance in the short term, favoring short-dated Treasury bills (T-bills), which could raise the share of T-bills in the market and increase the government's exposure to market rates. Meanwhile, impending tariffs ranging from 10% to 70% on imports could elevate inflation risks, potentially pushing yields higher. Although consumer price data hasn\u2019t yet shown inflation spikes, the threat remains. The Federal Reserve has so far maintained rates steady, with market analysts now looking ahead to the September meeting for potential cuts.

Currently, gold is valued at $42.22 per ounce, translating to a Fed credit of $11 billion, but revaluing it to the current market price of $2,900 per ounce could raise Fed credit significantly to $758 billion, or $523 billion at a conservative estimate of $2,000 per ounce. While this might appear as a way to reduce Treasury debt, it would not decrease the consolidated government debt, owing to the transfer of debt from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve. \n\nAdditional options include redeeming short-term Treasury bills to lengthen debt maturity or increasing buybacks of coupon securities. However, this approach would also negate ongoing efforts like quantitative tightening by infusing additional bank reserves. Ultimately, though such a proposal offers several intriguing pathways for debt management, it does not actually reduce the overall amount of government debt held by investors.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1739435231.192,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686a31f6f8c08007a58a62b60378c1d9","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"c3a80f09-0548-4941-9705-46ef968a36b2","request_id":"95adaf98eacefdf9-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c3a80f09-0548-4941-9705-46ef968a36b2","children":["caa1ca89-c8e7-4748-9ffd-b53eb8ab7a9d"]},"caa1ca89-c8e7-4748-9ffd-b53eb8ab7a9d":{"id":"caa1ca89-c8e7-4748-9ffd-b53eb8ab7a9d","message":{"id":"caa1ca89-c8e7-4748-9ffd-b53eb8ab7a9d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751790083.09007,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"","content":"I want to search for key data on net interest outlays as a share of GDP, focusing on interest rates and debt.

Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating in May, citing soaring deficits and national debt, now nearing $36 trillion. These fiscal risks, compounded by inflationary tariffs and economic uncertainty, are leading foreign investors to reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries in favor of European bonds and other alternatives like Australian and Singaporean debt. In April, foreign capital flows out of U.S. debt totaled $14.2 billion, coinciding with Trump's tariff announcements. Though the Senate debated and was expected to pass the bill soon, analysts believe widespread Treasury divestment is unlikely. Instead, a gradual diversification of foreign holdings is underway. The bill is expected to steepen the Treasury yield curve and may lead to U.S. credit default swaps trading at a premium compared to other similarly rated countries.

While the U.S. has not yet fully entered this mode, Trump's influence\u2014through pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinting at appointing a more compliant successor\u2014is shifting market expectations. Historically, fiscal dominance in other countries has led to inflation and economic instability, though its stimulative effects can last years. Market reactions show falling yields despite rising deficits, signaling belief in potential Fed leadership changes and future rate cuts. Goldman Sachs notes a future Trump-appointed Fed chair may prioritize lower rates.

The announcement coincided with Congressional debates over the Republican-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which proposes approximately $3.8 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade but is projected by nonpartisan groups to increase the federal deficit by over $2.5 trillion, potentially up to $3.3 trillion including interest. Moody\u2019s projects the deficit could rise to 9% of GDP by 2035. Despite the downgrade, Moody\u2019s maintained a \u201cstable\u201d outlook on U.S. creditworthiness, citing the economy\u2019s resilience and the global role of the U.S. dollar. The White House and Congressional leaders traded blame, with Republicans critiquing fiscal management under President Biden, and Democrats denouncing the Republican tax plan. This downgraded rating could lead to higher borrowing costs but is unlikely to radically alter market confidence due to the dollar's reserve status.

Meanwhile, impending tariffs ranging from 10% to 70% on imports could elevate inflation risks, potentially pushing yields higher.

Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating in May, citing soaring deficits and national debt, now nearing $36 trillion. These fiscal risks, compounded by inflationary tariffs and economic uncertainty, are leading foreign investors to reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries in favor of European bonds and other alternatives like Australian and Singaporean debt. In April, foreign capital flows out of U.S. debt totaled $14.2 billion, coinciding with Trump's tariff announcements. Though the Senate debated and was expected to pass the bill soon, analysts believe widespread Treasury divestment is unlikely. Instead, a gradual diversification of foreign holdings is underway. The bill is expected to steepen the Treasury yield curve and may lead to U.S. credit default swaps trading at a premium compared to other similarly rated countries. Meanwhile, stable German debt, backed by a strong debt-to-GDP ratio and increased issuance plans, is emerging as a safe haven for global capital.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5news10\ue201","start_idx":4199,"end_idx":4217,"safe_urls":["https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-federal-reserve-fiscal-dominance-1b74cd09?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-federal-reserve-fiscal-dominance-1b74cd09?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Trump's 'Fiscal Dominance' Play","url":"https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-federal-reserve-fiscal-dominance-1b74cd09?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1751707800.0,"snippet":"President Trump is pursuing an unconventional economic approach by pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, despite substantial deficit-financed tax cuts that traditionally push rates higher. This strategy aims to decouple budget deficits from interest rate increases, a concept known as \"fiscal dominance,\" where the central bank prioritizes government financing over inflation and employment targets. While the U.S. has not yet fully entered this mode, Trump's influence\u2014through pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinting at appointing a more compliant successor\u2014is shifting market expectations. Historically, fiscal dominance in other countries has led to inflation and economic instability, though its stimulative effects can last years. Market reactions show falling yields despite rising deficits, signaling belief in potential Fed leadership changes and future rate cuts. Goldman Sachs notes a future Trump-appointed Fed chair may prioritize lower rates. However, persistent low rates carry risks of inflation and undermining Fed independence, which could harm long-term economic health\u2014even if benefits appear in the short term.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"wsj.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6878,"end_idx":6878,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves","url":"https://data.imf.org/en/news/4225global%20fx%20reserves%20decreased%20by%203%20percent%20in%202024q4?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"data.imf.org"},{"title":"The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2025 to 2035","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60870?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"cbo.gov"},{"title":"Federal Debt Held by Foreign and International Investors (FDHBFIN)","url":"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFIN?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"fred.stlouisfed.org"},{"title":"CBO Releases January 2025 Budget and Economic Outlook","url":"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-releases-january-2025-budget-and-economic-outlook?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"crfb.org"},{"title":"Interest Costs on the National Debt - Peter G.

Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating in May, citing soaring deficits and national debt, now nearing $36 trillion. These fiscal risks, compounded by inflationary tariffs and economic uncertainty, are leading foreign investors to reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries in favor of European bonds and other alternatives like Australian and Singaporean debt. In April, foreign capital flows out of U.S. debt totaled $14.2 billion, coinciding with Trump's tariff announcements. Though the Senate debated and was expected to pass the bill soon, analysts believe widespread Treasury divestment is unlikely. Instead, a gradual diversification of foreign holdings is underway. The bill is expected to steepen the Treasury yield curve and may lead to U.S. credit default swaps trading at a premium compared to other similarly rated countries. Meanwhile, stable German debt, backed by a strong debt-to-GDP ratio and increased issuance plans, is emerging as a safe haven for global capital.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751275671.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/foreign-central-banks-are-shrinking-us-asset-exposure-2025-06-17/","title":"Foreign central banks are shrinking US asset exposure | Reuters","snippet":"\"This flow likely reflects official sector diversification away from dollar holdings.\" The $28.5 trillion Treasury market is deep and liquid, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750204800.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/moodys-downgrades-us-aa1-rating-2025-05-16/","title":"Moody's cuts America's pristine credit rating, citing rising debt | Reuters","snippet":"Moody's downgraded the US sovereign credit rating on Friday due to concerns about the nation's growing, $36 trillion debt pile.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747440000.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cbo.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61187","title":"The Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025 to 2055","snippet":"This report presents the Congressional Budget Office's projections of what the federal budget and the economy would look like over the next 30 years.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743033600.0,"attribution":"www.cbo.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61270","title":"The Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025 to 2055","snippet":"Total outlays grow by 3.3 percent of GDP from 2025 to 2055.

risks of funding states via casinos","snippet":"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warns of systemic vulnerabilities in the current global financial landscape, which, despite changes since the 2007\u20132009 global financial crisis (GFC), retains core fragilities. A key shift has been the transition from private-sector lending to massive public-sector borrowing, especially during and after the pandemic. The traditional banking system has given way to a network centered on global portfolio managers, with cross-border bond holdings\u2014mostly dollar-denominated U.S. Treasuries\u2014increasing significantly. These instruments are supported by short-maturity foreign exchange swaps that do not appear on balance sheets, adding to opacity and systemic risk.\n\nNon-bank financial intermediaries, such as hedge funds, play an outsized role, increasing interconnectedness and potentially amplifying market volatility through heavy leverage and minimal oversight. A large share of repo financing, vital for hedge fund operations, is supplied at zero haircut, limiting lenders\u2019 control over borrowers\u2019 risk. The BIS highlights that this tightly integrated yet loosely regulated system mimics the weaknesses of traditional banking and risks breakdowns that could require intervention by the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort. However, international coordination and U.S. leadership, which are crucial for such rescues, are increasingly uncertain amid political and economic fragmentation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751385422.544,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/0bf5bcc2-6ff1-4309-afbf-f470250a4721","title":"How the Treasury market got hooked on hedge fund leverage","snippet":"The recent turmoil in the U.S. Treasury market was inflamed by highly leveraged hedge fund strategies, particularly \"relative-value\" trades like Treasury basis and swap spread trades. These strategies rely on short-term funding and aim to capitalize on minor price discrepancies between Treasury securities and derivatives. Though they offer liquidity and help reduce government borrowing costs, they also introduce fragility into the $29 trillion market. In April 2025, concerns over inflation and erratic government policy under President Trump led to a sell-off in Treasuries, triggering unwinding of these leveraged trades. The scale of such trades\u2014totaling roughly $800 billion\u2014magnified market volatility, though more orderly than the 2020 Covid-induced crisis. Regulatory efforts to mitigate risks, such as the SEC\u2019s central clearing and dealer rules, have faced legal and political setbacks, allowing hedge fund influence to persist. With foreign investment waning and U.S. debt levels high, market stability increasingly depends on these risky strategies. Despite their role in supporting Treasury demand, experts warn they heighten susceptibility to shocks, highlighting the trade-off between leveraging hedging services and maintaining market resilience.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745553634.691,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/927aba63-eff3-44c4-a5df-a5872e988720","title":"Citadel's Ken Griffin warns against hedge fund clampdown to curb ...","snippet":"The BIS blamed a \u201cdisorderly reduction in margin leverage\u201d as a contributor to the collapse of the US Treasury market in March 2020 at the onset ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1699142400.0,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/a8348e2a-a90f-474c-baa6-8c2eb0e263c2","title":"The debt-fuelled bet on US Treasuries that's scaring regulators","snippet":"Policymakers are concerned about the huge leverage that hedge funds are employing as part of the so-called basis trade.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1695600000.0,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/huge-bond-wagers-make-some-hedge-funds-too-big-to-fail-imf-says","title":"Some Hedge Funds Too Big to Fail for Bond Market, IMF Says","snippet":"The IMF acknowledged that basis trades are helpful in providing market liquidity under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions.
