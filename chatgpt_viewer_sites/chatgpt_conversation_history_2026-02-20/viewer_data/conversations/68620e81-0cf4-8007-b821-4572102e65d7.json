Executive summary  \n\n| Aspect | Verdict |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Originality** | The idea of extra temporal dimensions is unusual but not new; earlier \u201c2\u2011time\u201d and Kaluza\u2011Klein variants are acknowledged. |\n| **Technical depth** | The manuscript offers formulas, but derivations are concise and key steps are omitted. |\n| **Consistency with established physics** | Claims of solving parity violation, family replication and quantum\u2011gravity UV divergences in one stroke are extraordinary and presently unsubstantiated. |\n| **Empirical testability** | Several numerical \u201cpredictions\u201d are quoted, yet no uncertainty propagation or experimental reach analysis is provided. |\n| **Writing quality** | Clear layout, but terminology sometimes conflates conjecture with result; citation style is adequate. |\n| **Overall** | Ambitious but presently speculative; significant gaps in derivation, consistency checks and phenomenological detail must be addressed before the work can be considered on par with peer\u2011reviewed theoretical physics. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scientific and mathematical analysis  \n\n### 2.1 Metric and causal structure  \n* The fundamental metric \\(ds^{2}=dt_{1}^{2}+dt_{2}^{2}+dt_{3}^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}\\) (Eq.\u202f1) introduces **three time\u2011like directions with positive signature**.  No proof is given that closed timelike curves (CTCs) or tachyonic instabilities are avoided; the author simply asserts \u201cmaintained causality\u201d \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 (p.\u202f5).  Standard theorems (e.g., Hawking & Ellis) show that more than one time\u2011like dimension generically admits CTCs unless elaborate constraints are imposed.  Those constraints are not derived here.  \n\n### 2.2 Field equations  \n* The Einstein\u2011like equation \\(R_{ab}=\\kappa T_{ab}\\) is written in six dimensions (Eq.\u202f5) but **no action principle is provided**, nor are the extra components of \\(R_{ab}\\) decomposed.  Without an action, one cannot check energy conditions, degrees of freedom, nor quantisation.\n\n### 2.3 Quantum sector  \n* The Fourier expansion of the wavefunction (Eq.\u202f7) assumes separability in all three times, yet **normalisation over infinite \\(t_{i}\\)** is divergent unless ad\u2011hoc damping factors are introduced.  \n* Propagator \\(G(k,\\omega)=\\bigl[k^{2}+ \\omega_{1}^{2}+ \\omega_{2}^{2}+ \\omega_{3}^{2}\\bigr]^{-1}\\) (Eq.\u202f10) looks finite in the UV, but only because the author replaces one quadratic divergence with three.  Loop integrals in 6D will still diverge worse than in 4D unless new symmetries (e.g., supersymmetry) cancel them.\n\n### 2.4 Family replication and mass formula  \n* The eigenvalue equation (Eq.\u202f14) is tantamount to a 3\u2011D Laplacian in \\(t\\)-space.  Its eigenvalues are continuous; quantisation into exactly **three discrete families** is asserted, not derived.  The exponential mass relation \\(m_{n}=m_{0}e^{-\\beta n^{\\gamma}}\\) (Eq.\u202f15) is fitted, not predicted.  \n* Numerically reproducing \\(m_{e},m_{\\mu},m_{\\tau}\\) to \u2264\u202f1\u202fppm precision (p.\u202f7\u20118) with two free parameters is not compelling; any smooth function with two tunable parameters can interpolate three numbers.\n\n### 2.5 Parity and CP violation  \n* The left\u2011handed current \\(J^{\\alpha}=\\bar\\psi\\gamma^{\\alpha}(1-\\gamma_{5})\\psi\\) (Eq.\u202f17) is standard.  Its claimed emergence from the product \\(\\gamma_{t_{1}}\\gamma_{t_{2}}\\gamma_{t_{3}}\\gamma_{x}\\) (Eq.\u202f18) is asserted, but the Clifford\u2011algebra mapping between six\u2011dimensional gamma matrices and the usual \\(\\gamma_{5}\\) is not constructed.\n\n### 2.6 Quantum\u2011gravity finiteness  \n* \u201cFinite quantum corrections\u201d are claimed (p.\u202f8\u20119) because the propagator falls as \\(|k|\\to\\infty\\).  Yet in 6D gravity the **dimensionful coupling grows**, making the theory more, not less, non\u2011renormalisable.  No explicit loop computation is shown.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Phenomenology and experimental claims  \n\n| Claim | Issue |\n|-------|-------|\n| **New resonances** at 2.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202fTeV and 4.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6\u202fTeV with \u03c3\u202f\u2248\u202f0.1\u202ffb (p.\u202f9). | Cross\u2011section quoted without specifying production channel or coupling.  Present 13.6\u202fTeV LHC limits exclude generic spin\u20111/2 or spin\u20111 states at those masses for \u03c3\u202f\u226b\u202f0.01\u202ffb. |\n| **Gravitational\u2011wave speed shift** \u0394v/c\u202f\u2248\u202f1.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2075 (p.\u202f9). | The GW170817 binary\u2011neutron\u2011star observation already bounds |\u0394v/c|\u202f<\u202f4.0\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2076, seemingly contradicting the prediction. |\n| **Dark\u2011energy equation\u2011of\u2011state deviation** w(z)=\u22121+0.05(1+z)\u00b3 (p.\u202f10). | Current Planck+BAO+SNe data constrain |w+1|\u202f<\u202f0.03 at 95\u202f% C.L. for z<1, so the proposed evolution is borderline excluded. |\n\nNo likelihood studies are offered; therefore the \u201cprecision\u201d quoted (e.g., \u00b10.3\u202f%) is not meaningful.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relation to prior art  \n\n* Two\u2011time physics (I.\u202fBars) and related Kaluza\u2011Klein models are cited, but differences are under\u2011analysed.  \n* The manuscript ignores well\u2011known **no\u2011go theorems** (Coleman\u2011Mandula, Haag\u2011\u0141opusza\u0144ski\u2011Sohnius) regarding symmetries mixing spacetime and internal degrees of freedom.  \n* Earlier multi\u2011time attempts struggled with **unitarity and ghost modes**; the present paper does not address these historic problems.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Writing and presentation  \n\n* **Figure\u202f1 (p.\u202f3)** is visually clear, but the axis labelling \u201cleft\u2011handed coordinate system\u201d conflates geometric handedness with parity violation; these are distinct concepts.  \n* Numerous definitive phrases (\u201caccurately reproduces\u201d, \u201cnaturally explains\u201d) over\u2011state what is in fact heuristic.  A more cautious tone would aid credibility.  \n* References are mostly standard, yet many vital technical papers on higher\u2011derivative gravity, Lorentz violation, GW constraints, etc., are absent.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendations for improvement  \n\n1. **Provide an action principle** in 6D, derive field equations, gauge symmetries and show absence of ghosts.  \n2. **Demonstrate causal stability**: explicitly construct the light\u2011cone structure, prove no CTCs for physically relevant solutions.  \n3. **Derive quantisation of three generations** from boundary conditions or compactification\u2014not by fiat.  \n4. **Carry out at least one explicit loop computation** to confirm UV finiteness or identify required counter\u2011terms.  \n5. **Confront existing experimental bounds** (LHC, GW170817, Planck) with quantitative \u03c7\u00b2 or likelihood fits; update or retract conflicting predictions.  \n6. Clarify whether the extra time coordinates are **compactified, infinite, or emergent**; each scenario has distinct phenomenology.  \n7. Engage peer review in a specialised journal or archive with an active theoretical\u2011physics community for detailed feedback.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Concluding assessment  \n\nThe manuscript is **thought\u2011provoking and creatively presented**, but at present it remains **speculative**.  To rise to the level of a viable candidate theory of fundamental physics, it must (i) supply rigorous derivations, (ii) reconcile with well\u2011tested data, and (iii) survive detailed peer scrutiny.  Until these hurdles are cleared, its claimed unification of quantum mechanics, gravity, particle generations and cosmology should be regarded as an interesting hypothesis rather than an established framework. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":199,"end_ix":220,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"kletetschka-2025-three-dimensional-time-a-mathematical-framework-for-fundamental-physics.pdf","id":"file-HQNfC9JfJUBBbYTTQeuFcB","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":7,"cited_message_id":"fbf1d1e6-e6e2-4f36-ac91-849fca86474a","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1664,"end_ix":1685,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"kletetschka-2025-three-dimensional-time-a-mathematical-framework-for-fundamental-physics.pdf","id":"file-HQNfC9JfJUBBbYTTQeuFcB","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":7,"cited_message_id":"fbf1d1e6-e6e2-4f36-ac91-849fca86474a","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":7288,"end_ix":7309,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"kletetschka-2025-three-dimensional-time-a-mathematical-framework-for-fundamental-physics.pdf","id":"file-HQNfC9JfJUBBbYTTQeuFcB","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":7,"cited_message_id":"fbf1d1e6-e6e2-4f36-ac91-849fca86474a","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":199,"end_idx":220,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"kletetschka-2025-three-dimensional-time-a-mathematical-framework-for-fundamental-physics.pdf","id":"file-HQNfC9JfJUBBbYTTQeuFcB","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"fbf1d1e6-e6e2-4f36-ac91-849fca86474a","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":1664,"end_idx":1685,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"kletetschka-2025-three-dimensional-time-a-mathematical-framework-for-fundamental-physics.pdf","id":"file-HQNfC9JfJUBBbYTTQeuFcB","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"fbf1d1e6-e6e2-4f36-ac91-849fca86474a","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":7288,"end_idx":7309,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"kletetschka-2025-three-dimensional-time-a-mathematical-framework-for-fundamental-physics.pdf","id":"file-HQNfC9JfJUBBbYTTQeuFcB","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"fbf1d1e6-e6e2-4f36-ac91-849fca86474a","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null}],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-pro","default_model_slug":"o3-pro","parent_id":"25465ca4-0eba-4ad2-86c9-d855c8ad22a6","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"25465ca4-0eba-4ad2-86c9-d855c8ad22a6","children":["b2ae6ab4-df75-438b-a7f5-e0fb0caac60d"]},"b2ae6ab4-df75-438b-a7f5-e0fb0caac60d":{"id":"b2ae6ab4-df75-438b-a7f5-e0fb0caac60d","message":{"id":"b2ae6ab4-df75-438b-a7f5-e0fb0caac60d","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751257646.941,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Analyze this perspective:\n\n---\n\nThink of Newton\u2019s law or Coulomb\u2019s law. The gravitational or electric force of a spherical source drops with one over R-squared. Why is that? It\u2019s quite simple: it\u2019s because force lines spread into all directions of space, and in three dimensions, those directions scale with the surface of a sphere, so R-squared. If we lived in a four-dimensional space, Newton\u2019s law would go with one over R-cubed. In fact, you can turn this around and use the spread of force lines or generally randomly moving particles to infer the dimension of space. It\u2019s called the spectral dimension. The reason you probably haven\u2019t heard about it is that it\u2019s usually the same as the normal dimension we talk about with orthogonal vectors, called the Hausdorff dimension. The advantage of the spectral dimension is that you can use it for non-integer, fractal dimensions. That\u2019s an interesting topic, but let me come back to the idea that time has three dimensions.\r\n\r\nForces don\u2019t dilute in time, so time has only one dimension, and that\u2019s the end of that story. You can, of course, make some extra assumptions that for whatever reason two of these three dimensions of time don\u2019t work like the third, but now you\u2019re just trying to sweep problems under the rug of an idea that doesn\u2019t want to work.\r\n\r\nLet us appreciate for a moment, for example, that the author normalizes the wave-function to one in space-time, with three dimensions of space, of course. Wave-functions are normalized to one in space because the probability to find particles somewhere in space must add up to one. It stays one at all times; it isn\u2019t normalized to one in time\u2014that makes no sense. Then, these bizarre \u201cconservation laws\u201d are uncontracted and therefore don\u2019t conserve anything. The author doesn\u2019t understand how Lorentz-invariance works, pulls numbers out of nowhere, thinks that the graviton propagator is a scalar, and most remarkably, claims that a six-dimensional space-time \u201cnaturally reduces to standard Minkowski spacetime when two temporal dimensions become negligible.\u201d What does it mean for a temporal dimension to become negligible, I ask you?

Therefore the observed 1\u202f\u2215\u202fR\u00b2 tells us space has three dimensions.*\n\n**Assessment**  \nThis is correct: Gauss\u2019s law for any massless, long\u2011range mediator in Euclidean space implies \\(F\\propto 1/R^{D-1}\\).  It is also true that one can *invert* the argument\u2014using random\u2011walk or diffusion processes\u2014to infer an *effective* or \u201cspectral\u201d dimension, a tool common in quantum\u2011gravity approaches such as causal dynamical triangulations.\n\n**Relevance to 3\u2011time theories**  \nThe author\u2019s framework keeps three spatial dimensions, so nothing in his metric (Eq.\u202f1) would change the 1\u202f\u2215\u202fR\u00b2 behaviour at macroscopic scales.  However, were the *time* dimensions to behave like space, one would expect pathological violations of energy conservation, not just a modified force law.  Kletetschka does not discuss this consequence.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  \u201cForces don\u2019t dilute in time\u201d\n\n**What the passage says**  \n*Because force\u2011lines spread only in space, time must be one\u2011dimensional.*\n\n**Assessment**  \nThe intuition is sound: a \u201cflux\u201d picture demands a codimension\u2011one hypersurface through which lines pass.  Time\u2019s role is to order events, not to supply extra directions for flux.  Multi\u2011time proposals must therefore **separate** the additional temporal coordinates from the causal structure of force propagation\u2014typically by compactification or by imposing constraints on allowed world\u2011lines.  Kletetschka simply asserts that \u201ccausality is preserved\u201d with no derivation (p.\u202f5) and gives no mechanism that would stop forces from leaking into \\(t_{2}\\) or \\(t_{3}\\). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Wave\u2011function normalisation\n\n**Passage\u2019s claim**  \n*Wave\u2011functions should be normalised over space, not over space\u2011time; doing the latter \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d*\n\n**Textual evidence**  \nKletetschka defines the quantum state with\n\n\\[\n\\int |\\,\\psi|^{2}\\,dt_{1}\\,dt_{2}\\,dt_{3}\\,d^{3}x = 1\\tag{Eq.\\,(8)}\n\\]\n\n(page\u202f6). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n**Assessment**  \nStandard non\u2011relativistic QM uses \\(\\int |\\,\\psi(t,\\mathbf{x})|^{2}\\,d^{3}x = 1\\) for **each** time\u202ft.  Relativistic field theory replaces this by a conserved current \\(j^{\\mu}\\).  Integrating over *all* times destroys probabilistic interpretation because probability would accumulate indefinitely.  The critic is therefore correct: Kletetschka adopts a non\u2011standard, mathematically ill\u2011defined normalisation and does not show that it reduces to the usual one\u2011time limit.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  \u201cUncontracted conservation laws\u201d\n\n**Passage\u2019s claim**  \n*The paper writes down \u201cbizarre\u201d conservation laws that, being uncontracted, do not actually conserve anything.*\n\n**Evidence**  \nEqs.\u202f(11)\u2013(13) list 36\u2011component \u201cenergy\u2011momentum\u201d and \u201ctemporal charge\u201d tensors without specifying how these quantities integrate to conserved scalars (pp.\u202f6\u20117).  Merely setting \\(\\partial_{\\mu}T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\) in six\u2011dimensions does not **by itself** produce usable conserved charges; one must identify the correct surface integrals and show finiteness.  No such derivation is provided. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n**Assessment**  \nThe criticism is justified.  Conservation laws are statements about integrals over a *Cauchy* hypersurface.  In a 3\u2011time manifold the notion of \u201cCauchy surface\u201d is itself problematic, so extra work is required.  The manuscript skips that work.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Lorentz (or Poincar\u00e9) invariance\n\n**Passage\u2019s claim**  \n*The author \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand how Lorentz invariance works.\u201d*\n\n**Assessment**  \n- The metric signature chosen is (+++\u202f\u2212\u2212\u2212) (Eq.\u202f1).  A six\u2011dimensional analogue of the Lorentz group would be SO(3,3).  \n- Yet the paper later talks about a symmetry group \\(SO(3;T)\\times SO(3;X)\\) (p.\u202f6) which is *not* isomorphic to SO(3,3).  \n- No explicit representation of the Clifford algebra Cl(3,3) is constructed; instead the manuscript inserts the usual 4\u2011D \\(\\gamma^{5}\\) by hand (Eq.\u202f18).  \n\nThese mismatches support the passage\u2019s complaint: the symmetry structure is asserted, not demonstrated. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 6.  The \u201cscalar graviton propagator\u201d\n\n**Passage\u2019s claim**  \n*Author \u201cthinks the graviton propagator is a scalar.\u201d*\n\n**Evidence**  \nEquation\u202f(10) defines\n\n\\[\nG(k,\\omega)=\\frac{1}{k^{2}+\\omega_{1}^{2}+\\omega_{2}^{2}+\\omega_{3}^{2}},\n\\]\n\nwith no tensor indices (page\u202f6).  A true graviton propagator in any dimension carries two symmetric tensor indices and must satisfy transversality conditions.  The PDF nowhere upgrades this scalar object to a rank\u20112 entity.\n\n**Assessment**  \nThe criticism is valid: treating gravity as a scalar field is inconsistent with the claimed recovery of General Relativity in any limit.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  \u201cTwo temporal dimensions become negligible\u201d\n\n**Passage\u2019s rhetorical question**  \n*What can it mean for a temporal dimension to become negligible?*\n\n**Evidence**  \nThe paper states twice that \u201cGR emerges when \\(t_{2},t_{3}\\rightarrow0\\)\u201d (pp.\u202f5\u202f&\u202f6).  No dynamical mechanism for this limit is provided\u2014e.g. no compactification scale, no suppression by potential barriers, no gauge fixing.  The phrase \u201cnegligible\u201d therefore lacks operational meaning.\n\n**Assessment**  \nThe challenge is appropriate.  Without specifying *why* observers cannot access motion along \\(t_{2}\\) and \\(t_{3}\\), the recovery of 4\u2011D physics is an assumption, not a result.\n\n---\n\n## 8.  Overall coherence of the critic\u2019s perspective\n\n| Item | Verdict |\n|------|---------|\n| Dimensional analysis of forces | Correct and germane. |\n| Probability normalisation | Correct; the paper\u2019s choice is indefensible. |\n| Conservation\u2011law critique | Justified; absence of finite charges. |\n| Lorentz\u2011invariance objection | Supported by text; group structure is inconsistent. |\n| Propagator criticism | Accurate; graviton must be tensorial. |\n| \u201cNegligible\u201d time dimensions | Legitimate conceptual gap. |\n\nThe only tenuous statement is that *all* multi\u2011time proposals \u201csweep problems under the rug.\u201d  There exist more mathematically careful two\u2011time frameworks (e.g. I.\u202fBars) that impose gauge constraints to avoid ghosts and CTCs, but those theories still face severe empirical hurdles.  Kletetschka\u2019s version does not meet even that level of rigour, so the critic\u2019s impatience is understandable and largely warranted.\n\n---\n\n## 9.  Forward\u2011looking remarks\n\n1. **If one insists on extra time dimensions**, a viable model must:\n   * Provide a Hamiltonian or BRST gauge fixing that removes pathological degrees of freedom.\n   * Show explicitly how the 4\u2011D observer sees only one \u201cphysical\u201d clock\u2014typically by a foliation or constraint surface.\n   * Supply a tensor graviton propagator and verify linearised stability.\n\n2. **Empirical falsifiability** should focus on the paper\u2019s concrete numerics (e.g. \\(\\Delta v/c\\) for gravitational waves).  The critic could strengthen her argument by pointing out existing bounds: GW170817 gives \\(|\\Delta v/c|<4\\times10^{-16}\\), already tighter than the paper\u2019s predicted \\(1.5\\times10^{-15}\\).\n\n3. **Spectral\u2011dimension tests** (diffusion on the lattice, early\u2011universe power spectra) might offer a way to *measure* any hidden temporal directions.  The author has not attempted such a calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe passage you provided is a **sound, technically informed rebuttal** to the six\u2011dimensional model.  Each substantive criticism is borne out by specific equations or omissions in the manuscript.  Until the proponents of three\u2011dimensional time can answer these points with explicit derivations and compatibility with existing data, the idea remains speculative at best.
