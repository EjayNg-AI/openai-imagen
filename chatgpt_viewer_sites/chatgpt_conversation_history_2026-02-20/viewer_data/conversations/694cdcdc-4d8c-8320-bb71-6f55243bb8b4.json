Rearrangement Inequality\n\n## Theorem (Rearrangement)\nLet \\(a_1\\le a_2\\le \\cdots \\le a_n\\) and \\(b_1\\le b_2\\le \\cdots \\le b_n\\) be real sequences. For any permutation \\(\\pi\\) of \\(\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\), define\n\\[\nS(\\pi)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\, b_{\\pi(i)}.\n\\]\nThen:\n- **Maximum:** \\(S(\\pi)\\) is maximized when \\(\\pi\\) preserves order (pairs largest with largest):\n  \\[\n  \\max_\\pi S(\\pi)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i.\n  \\]\n- **Minimum:** \\(S(\\pi)\\) is minimized when \\(\\pi\\) reverses order (pairs largest with smallest):\n  \\[\n  \\min_\\pi S(\\pi)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{n+1-i}.\n  \\]\n\n### Proof (adjacent swap / bubble-sort argument; no extra theory)\nTake any permutation \\(\\pi\\). If \\(\\pi\\) is not order-preserving, there exist indices \\(i<j\\) such that\n\\[\nb_{\\pi(i)} > b_{\\pi(j)}.\n\\]\n(That is, \\(\\pi\\) contains an inversion relative to the increasing order of \\(b\\).)\n\nConsider swapping the assignments at positions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\): define \\(\\pi'\\) by \\(\\pi'(i)=\\pi(j)\\), \\(\\pi'(j)=\\pi(i)\\), and \\(\\pi'(k)=\\pi(k)\\) otherwise. Then\n\\[\nS(\\pi')-S(\\pi)\n= a_i b_{\\pi(j)} + a_j b_{\\pi(i)} - (a_i b_{\\pi(i)} + a_j b_{\\pi(j)})\n= (a_j-a_i)(b_{\\pi(i)}-b_{\\pi(j)}).\n\\]\nBecause \\(i<j\\) implies \\(a_i\\le a_j\\), and we chose \\(b_{\\pi(i)} > b_{\\pi(j)}\\), we get\n\\[\n(a_j-a_i)(b_{\\pi(i)}-b_{\\pi(j)}) \\ge 0,\n\\]\nso \\(S(\\pi')\\ge S(\\pi)\\), with strict inequality if \\(a_i<a_j\\) and \\(b_{\\pi(i)}>b_{\\pi(j)}\\).\n\nThus, whenever \\(\\pi\\) has an inversion, swapping that inverted pair does not decrease the sum and typically increases it. Repeating this \u201cswap inversions away\u201d process finitely many times (exactly as in bubble sort) yields the increasing permutation \\(\\pi(i)=i\\), and along the way the sum never decreases. Hence \\(\\sum a_i b_i\\) is the maximum.\n\nFor the minimum, apply the same argument after replacing \\(b\\) by the reversed sequence \\((b_n,\\dots,b_1)\\): maximizing with respect to the reversed sequence is equivalent to minimizing with respect to the original.\n\n### Equality conditions (typical)\nIf both sequences are strictly increasing, then the maximizing permutation is unique (identity) and the minimizing permutation is unique (reverse). If there are ties, multiple permutations can attain the same extremum.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can add a short \u201capplications\u201d appendix showing (i) Chebyshev\u2019s sum inequality as an immediate corollary of rearrangement, and (ii) how rearrangement plus CS gives useful bounds like \\(\\sum a_i b_i \\le \\|a\\|\\|b\\|\\) with sharpness conditions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"f5662d62-3177-46c8-bda3-638996944289","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"6903724d-c377-413a-8e36-57fa92e9d7df","turn_exchange_id":"701927f8-dbf7-41da-b5cf-cc0e2ca1c712","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"6903724d-c377-413a-8e36-57fa92e9d7df","children":["fca5c471-f1c0-4391-9c43-a74a99c8623d"]},"fca5c471-f1c0-4391-9c43-a74a99c8623d":{"id":"fca5c471-f1c0-4391-9c43-a74a99c8623d","message":{"id":"fca5c471-f1c0-4391-9c43-a74a99c8623d","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766645865.151,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Please proceed with your suggestions: showing (i) Chebyshev\u2019s sum inequality as an immediate corollary of rearrangement, and (ii) how rearrangement plus CS gives useful bounds (and state sharpness conditions).

For rearrangement/Chebyshev you need the sequences **sorted** (or explicitly say \u201cafter sorting wlog\u201d). For Jensen you need \\(x_i\\in I\\) where \\(f\\) is convex/concave.\n\n- **Name the tool at the moment you use it.**  \n  Write \u201cBy Cauchy\u2013Schwarz\u2026\u201d / \u201cBy Jensen for concave \\(\\ln\\)\u2026\u201d / \u201cBy rearrangement\u2026\u201d. Examiners look for this.\n\n- **Track equality conditions separately.**  \n  Don\u2019t hand-wave \u201cequality when all equal\u201d. Prove it from the equality condition of the tool you used (CS: proportional vectors; Jensen: strict convex/concave; rearrangement: no inversions).\n\n- **Avoid \u201cobvious\u201d monotonicity steps without justification.**  \n  Inverting inequalities requires positivity. Exponentiating requires monotonicity of \\(\\exp\\). Taking square roots requires nonnegativity.\n\n---\n\n## Cauchy\u2013Schwarz (CS): key idea + common pitfalls\n\n**Key idea:** Use the quadratic\n\\[\n\\sum (x_i-ty_i)^2\\ge 0\n\\]\nand discriminant \\(\\le 0\\).\n\n**Pitfalls to avoid**\n- Forgetting to say \u201cfor all real \\(t\\)\u201d (needed for the discriminant argument).\n- Messing the discriminant algebra. Write it cleanly:\n  \\[\n  At^2-2Bt+C\\ge 0\\ \\forall t \\Rightarrow B^2\\le AC.\n  \\]\n- Equality: remember it\u2019s **linear dependence**, i.e. \\(x_i=c y_i\\) for all \\(i\\). Don\u2019t just say \u201cwhen vectors equal\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Convexity definitions: key idea + common pitfalls\n\n**Key idea:** Convex means chord above graph:\n\\[\nf((1-t)x+ty)\\le (1-t)f(x)+t f(y).\n\\]\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Confusing convex vs concave direction.  \n  Convex: \u201c\\(\\le\\)\u201d. Concave: \u201c\\(\\ge\\)\u201d.\n- Forgetting the domain must be an **interval** (for Jensen as stated).\n- If you use calculus to show convexity/concavity, explicitly state:  \n  \\(f''\\ge 0\\Rightarrow f\\) convex; \\(f''\\le 0\\Rightarrow f\\) concave (on an interval).\n\n---\n\n## Jensen (finite form): key idea + common pitfalls\n\n**Key idea:** Prove \\(n=2\\) is the definition; then induction via \u201cpeel off one weight\u201d.\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Not checking weights: \\(\\lambda_i\\ge 0\\), \\(\\sum\\lambda_i=1\\).  \n  If you use equal weights, write \\(\\lambda_i=1/n\\).\n- In the induction step: define \\(\\Lambda=1-\\lambda_n\\) and normalize correctly:\n  \\[\n  \\bar x=\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i x_i.\n  \\]\n- Concave form: either state it separately or say \u201capply convex form to \\(-f\\)\u201d.\n- Equality: if you claim \u201cstrict convex gives equality iff all \\(x_i\\) equal\u201d, say it explicitly; don\u2019t assume it.\n\n---\n\n## RMS\u2013AM\u2013GM\u2013HM: key ideas + common pitfalls\n\n### RMS \\(\\ge\\) AM\n**Key idea:** Use CS on \\((a_i)\\) and \\((1)\\):\n\\[\n(\\sum a_i)^2\\le (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum 1^2)=n\\sum a_i^2.\n\\]\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Dropping the factor \\(n\\). This is the #1 arithmetic error.\n- Taking square roots before dividing cleanly. Best: divide by \\(n^2\\) first.\n\n### AM \\(\\ge\\) GM\n**Key idea:** Jensen with concave \\(\\ln\\):\n\\[\n\\ln\\Big(\\frac1n\\sum a_i\\Big)\\ge \\frac1n\\sum \\ln a_i.\n\\]\nThen exponentiate.\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Using \\(\\ln\\) without stating \\(a_i>0\\).\n- Forgetting to exponentiate both sides correctly.\n- Writing \\(\\sum \\ln a_i = \\ln(\\sum a_i)\\) (false).

Mention this.\n\n---\n\n## Chebyshev\u2019s sum inequality: key idea + common pitfalls\n\n**Key idea:** Rearrangement says aligned pairing is maximal among all permutations. Averaging over all permutations produces the product of averages.\n\n**Must write the \u201cuniform average\u201d step cleanly:**\n\\[\n\\frac1{n!}\\sum_{\\pi} b_{\\pi(i)}=\\frac1n\\sum_{j=1}^n b_j\n\\]\nbecause each \\(b_j\\) appears equally often in position \\(i\\).\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Hand-waving \u201csymmetry\u201d without stating the counting: each value appears \\((n-1)!\\) times.\n- Forgetting the final division by \\(n\\) to get the statement in average form.\n- Equality: for \\(n\\ge 2\\), equality occurs when one sequence is constant (or more generally when the aligned sum equals the average over permutations; easiest sufficient condition: one constant). Don\u2019t overclaim uniqueness if ties exist.\n\n---\n\n## Rearrangement + CS bounds: key idea + common pitfalls\n\n**Key idea:** Rearrangement pins down which permutation maximizes \\(\\sum a_i b_{\\pi(i)}\\) under sorting; CS caps any dot product:\n\\[\n\\sum a_i b_{\\pi(i)} \\le \\|a\\|_2\\|b\\|_2.\n\\]\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Mixing up two different \u201cequality\u201d sources:\n  - Rearrangement equality depends on **ties / inversions**.\n  - CS equality depends on **proportionality** of vectors (after the chosen pairing).\n- If you claim the aligned maximum hits the CS cap, you must show **both**:\n  1) aligned is the maximizing permutation (rearrangement), and  \n  2) \\(a_i = c\\,b_i\\) for all \\(i\\) (CS equality, with \\(c\\ge 0\\) for same-order alignment).\n\n---\n\n## How to present a \u201cclean full proof\u201d (what I\u2019d grade for)\n\n- Start with a **one-sentence plan**: \u201cWe prove \\(R\\ge A\\) by CS, \\(A\\ge G\\) by Jensen on \\(\\ln\\), \\(G\\ge H\\) by the same on reciprocals.\u201d\n- Every inequality should show **exactly one named reason**.\n- Put \u201c**Equality**:\u201d at the end and list the equality conditions tool-by-tool.\n- Keep algebraic manipulations legible: don\u2019t do three transformations in one line.\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a short \u201cproof skeleton\u201d template (with blanks) for each theorem that students can fill in, which often raises proof quality dramatically."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"d13c6736-eec2-4332-9773-6a82870a2e99","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"289e6c72-8115-4aef-87e3-41ef53564d24","turn_exchange_id":"0434c161-3cdc-4b2d-8f69-0abd3422f128","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"289e6c72-8115-4aef-87e3-41ef53564d24","children":["92a61635-4e0b-4303-9cfe-cc31e5637886"]},"92a61635-4e0b-4303-9cfe-cc31e5637886":{"id":"92a61635-4e0b-4303-9cfe-cc31e5637886","message":{"id":"92a61635-4e0b-4303-9cfe-cc31e5637886","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766647275.108,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How do I use the \\vect{x} command in Latex and what library do I need"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8aada421-fd4f-40f0-a02d-532d4afd4d08","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"d448b936-63e4-4cea-8181-ab5acf2476e3","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c2f61e35-d12f-4419-9dd1-708acecbee6a","children":["7b7c3af1-2a2b-4b18-8427-11655d57de8f"]},"7b7c3af1-2a2b-4b18-8427-11655d57de8f":{"id":"7b7c3af1-2a2b-4b18-8427-11655d57de8f","message":{"id":"7b7c3af1-2a2b-4b18-8427-11655d57de8f","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766647276.4807565,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"8aada421-fd4f-40f0-a02d-532d4afd4d08","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"92a61635-4e0b-4303-9cfe-cc31e5637886","turn_exchange_id":"d448b936-63e4-4cea-8181-ab5acf2476e3","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"92a61635-4e0b-4303-9cfe-cc31e5637886","children":["553752f6-d621-4eac-89cb-d52a88fe6ef5"]},"553752f6-d621-4eac-89cb-d52a88fe6ef5":{"id":"553752f6-d621-4eac-89cb-d52a88fe6ef5","message":{"id":"553752f6-d621-4eac-89cb-d52a88fe6ef5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766647278.777769,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking up the LaTeX \\vect command source","content":"The user asked about the \\vect command in LaTeX.

We say that \\(f\\) is **continuous at \\(c\\)** if, for every \\(\\varepsilon>0\\), there exists \\(\\delta>0\\) such that whenever \\(x\\in D\\) and \\(|x-c|<\\delta\\), we have\n\\[\n|f(x)-f(c)|<\\varepsilon.\n\\]\nEquivalently, \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(c\\) iff \\(\\lim_{x\\to c} f(x)=f(c)\\) (where the limit is understood in the \\(\\varepsilon\\)\u2013\\(\\delta\\) sense). If \\(f\\) is continuous at every point of an interval, we say \\(f\\) is **continuous on** that interval. For closed intervals \\([a,b]\\), continuity at the endpoints is interpreted one-sidedly: continuity at \\(a\\) means \\(\\lim_{x\\downarrow a}f(x)=f(a)\\), and similarly at \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)\n\n**Theorem (Intermediate Value Theorem).**  \nIf \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and \\(y\\) is any real number between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\), then there exists \\(c\\in[a,b]\\) such that \\(f(c)=y\\).\n\n**Outline of proof (standard completeness argument).**  \nAssume \\(f(a)<y<f(b)\\) (the other case is symmetric). Consider the set\n\\[\nS=\\{x\\in[a,b]: f(x)\\le y\\}.\n\\]\nThis set is nonempty (since \\(a\\in S\\)) and bounded above (by \\(b\\)), so by completeness it has a supremum \\(c=\\sup S\\in[a,b]\\). The goal is to show \\(f(c)=y\\). If \\(f(c)<y\\), then by continuity at \\(c\\) one can find points \\(x>c\\) sufficiently close to \\(c\\) with \\(f(x)<y\\), which would place some \\(x>c\\) into \\(S\\), contradicting that \\(c\\) is an upper bound of \\(S\\). If \\(f(c)>y\\), continuity at \\(c\\) forces \\(f(x)>y\\) for all \\(x<c\\) sufficiently close to \\(c\\), contradicting that \\(c\\) is the least upper bound of points where \\(f(x)\\le y\\). Both contradictions force \\(f(c)=y\\), proving the theorem.\n\n**Remark (what IVT is really saying).**  \nA continuous function on an interval cannot \u201cjump over\u201d values; its image of an interval is itself an interval.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiability\n\nLet \\(f\\) be defined on an open interval containing \\(c\\). We say \\(f\\) is **differentiable at \\(c\\)** if the limit\n\\[\nf'(c)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\n\\]\nexists as a finite real number. The number \\(f'(c)\\) is the **derivative** of \\(f\\) at \\(c\\). If \\(f\\) is differentiable at every point of an interval \\(I\\), we say \\(f\\) is differentiable on \\(I\\).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiability implies continuity\n\n**Theorem.** If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(c\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(c\\).\n\n**Proof (clean and direct).**  \nAssume the derivative \\(f'(c)\\) exists. For \\(h\\neq 0\\),\n\\[\nf(c+h)-f(c)=h\\cdot \\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}.\n\\]\nAs \\(h\\to 0\\), the first factor \\(h\\to 0\\), while the second factor tends to the finite limit \\(f'(c)\\). Therefore the product tends to \\(0\\), i.e.\n\\[\n\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\bigl(f(c+h)-f(c)\\bigr)=0,\n\\]\nwhich is exactly \\(\\lim_{x\\to c} f(x)=f(c)\\). Hence \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(c\\).\n\n---\n\n### Rolle\u2019s Theorem\n\nBefore Rolle\u2019s theorem, one uses the following basic observation.\n\n**Lemma (Fermat\u2019s stationary point lemma).**  \nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(c\\in(a,b)\\) and \\(f\\) has a local maximum or local minimum at \\(c\\), then \\(f'(c)=0\\).\n\n**Outline of proof.**  \nIf \\(c\\) is a local maximum, then for small \\(h>0\\), \\(f(c+h)\\le f(c)\\), so \\(\\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\\le 0\\); for small \\(h<0\\), the same inequality flips sign after division and gives \\(\\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}\\ge 0\\). If the limit as \\(h\\to 0\\) exists, it must be both \\(\\le 0\\) and \\(\\ge 0\\), hence equal to \\(0\\). The minimum case is analogous.\n\nNow we state Rolle\u2019s theorem.\n\n**Theorem (Rolle).**  \nIf \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([a,b]\\), differentiable on \\((a,b)\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\), then there exists \\(c\\in(a,b)\\) such that\n\\[\nf'(c)=0.\n\\]\n\n**Proof (standard).**  \nBecause \\(f\\) is continuous on the compact interval \\([a,b]\\), it attains a maximum and a minimum on \\([a,b]\\) (Extreme Value Theorem). If \\(f\\) is constant, then \\(f'(x)=0\\) for all \\(x\\in(a,b)\\) and we are done. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum values cannot both occur only at the endpoints while still having \\(f(a)=f(b)\\); consequently, at least one of these extrema is achieved at some interior point \\(c\\in(a,b)\\). At that interior extremum, \\(f\\) is differentiable, so Fermat\u2019s lemma gives \\(f'(c)=0\\), proving Rolle\u2019s theorem.\n\n---\n\n### Mean Value Theorem (MVT)\n\n**Theorem (Lagrange Mean Value Theorem).**  \nIf \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable on \\((a,b)\\), then there exists \\(c\\in(a,b)\\) such that\n\\[\nf'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.\n\\]\n\n**Proof (reduce to Rolle).**  \nConsider the secant line through \\((a,f(a))\\) and \\((b,f(b))\\):\n\\[\nL(x)=f(a)+\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a).\n\\]\nDefine \\(g(x)=f(x)-L(x)\\). Then \\(g\\) is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable on \\((a,b)\\) (as a difference of such functions), and moreover\n\\[\ng(a)=f(a)-L(a)=0,\\qquad g(b)=f(b)-L(b)=0.\n\\]\nThus \\(g(a)=g(b)\\), so Rolle\u2019s theorem applies: there exists \\(c\\in(a,b)\\) with \\(g'(c)=0\\). But\n\\[\ng'(x)=f'(x)-\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a},\n\\]\nso \\(g'(c)=0\\) gives exactly\n\\[\nf'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.\n\\]\n\n**Remark (geometric meaning).**  \nSome tangent to the graph of \\(f\\) is parallel to the secant line joining \\((a,f(a))\\) and \\((b,f(b))\\).\n\n---\n\nThis chain of results is a backbone for many inequality proofs: IVT encapsulates \u201cno jumps,\u201d differentiability strengthens continuity, Rolle identifies an interior horizontal tangent when endpoints match, and MVT turns global change into a pointwise derivative statement."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5559,"end_idx":5559,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"4a9df0e2-1488-43c0-b792-5bbdb0d5c0eb","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7c610497-256e-4a50-bdf1-7236044ee7eb","turn_exchange_id":"5b449af9-0436-41e5-a8d4-c471910d6c74","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"7c610497-256e-4a50-bdf1-7236044ee7eb","children":["2431100c-00dd-483a-b8c4-39d4c5be1175"]},"2431100c-00dd-483a-b8c4-39d4c5be1175":{"id":"2431100c-00dd-483a-b8c4-39d4c5be1175","message":{"id":"2431100c-00dd-483a-b8c4-39d4c5be1175","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766659333.413,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Is the following definition and result correctly stated?

Then Jensen becomes\n\\[\nf((1-t)x_1+t x_2)\\le (1-t)f(x_1)+t f(x_2),\n\\]\nwhich is **exactly the definition of convexity**.\n\nSo Jensen is true for \\(n=2\\).\n\n#### Step 3: Inductive step\nAssume Jensen is true for \\(n-1\\) points. We prove it for \\(n\\) points.\n\nLet \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\in I\\) and \\(\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_n\\ge 0\\) with \\(\\sum\\lambda_i=1\\).\nSet\n\\[\nt:=\\lambda_n,\\qquad \\Lambda:=1-t=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i.\n\\]\n\n- If \\(\\Lambda=0\\), then \\(t=1\\) and all other \\(\\lambda_i=0\\). In that case,\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i = x_n,\\quad \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i f(x_i)=f(x_n),\n  \\]\n  so Jensen holds with equality.\n\nSo we may assume \\(\\Lambda>0\\). (This is the \u201cinteresting\u201d case.)\n\nNow define a new number \\(y\\) by averaging only the first \\(n-1\\) points:\n\\[\ny:=\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i x_i.\n\\]\nNotice two important things:\n\n1) The numbers \\(\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\Lambda}\\) for \\(i=1,\\dots,n-1\\) are all \\(\\ge 0\\), and\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\Lambda}=\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i=\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}=1.\n\\]\nSo \\(y\\) is a convex combination of \\(x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}\\), hence \\(y\\in I\\).\n\n2) The full weighted average \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\) can now be rewritten using \\(y\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\n= \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i x_i\\right)+t x_n\n= \\Lambda y + t x_n\n= (1-t)y+t x_n.\n\\]\n\nNow apply convexity of \\(f\\) to the two points \\(y\\) and \\(x_n\\):\n\\[\nf((1-t)y+t x_n)\\ \\le\\ (1-t)f(y)+t f(x_n).\n\\]\nBut \\((1-t)y+t x_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\), so this is\n\\[\nf\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\right)\\ \\le\\ \\Lambda f(y)+\\lambda_n f(x_n). \\tag{A}\n\\]\n\nNext, apply the **induction hypothesis** (Jensen for \\(n-1\\) points) to the points \\(x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}\\) with weights \\(\\lambda_i/\\Lambda\\). Since these weights sum to 1, we get:\n\\[\nf(y)= f\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\Lambda}x_i\\right)\n\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\Lambda} f(x_i).\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\Lambda>0\\):\n\\[\n\\Lambda f(y)\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i f(x_i). \\tag{B}\n\\]\n\nFinally, combine (A) and (B): from (A),\n\\[\nf\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\right)\\ \\le\\ \\Lambda f(y)+\\lambda_n f(x_n),\n\\]\nand from (B) we can replace \\(\\Lambda f(y)\\) by something \\(\\le \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i f(x_i)\\). Therefore\n\\[\nf\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\right)\n\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i f(x_i)+\\lambda_n f(x_n)\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i f(x_i).\n\\]\nThis completes the induction. Jensen holds for all \\(n\\). \u220e\n\n---\n\n## 4. Equality condition when \\(f\\) is strictly convex\n\n### Theorem (Jensen equality for strictly convex \\(f\\))\nLet \\(f\\) be strictly convex on an interval \\(I\\). Let \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\in I\\) and assume **all weights are positive**:\n\\[\n\\lambda_i>0\\quad\\text{for all }i,\\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i=1.\n\\]\nThen\n\\[\nf\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i f(x_i)\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\nx_1=x_2=\\cdots=x_n.\n\\]\n\n### Proof (again by induction, using the same decomposition)\n\n#### \u201cIf\u201d direction\nIf \\(x_1=\\cdots=x_n=x\\), then \\(\\sum \\lambda_i x_i = x\\), so both sides equal \\(f(x)\\). Equality holds.\n\n#### \u201cOnly if\u201d direction\nAssume equality holds:\n\\[\nf\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i f(x_i),\n\\]\nand we prove \\(x_1=\\cdots=x_n\\).\n\n**Base case \\(n=2\\).**  \nWith \\(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2>0\\), strict convexity says\n\\[\nf((1-t)x_1+t x_2) < (1-t)f(x_1)+t f(x_2)\\quad\\text{if }x_1\\ne x_2.\n\\]\nSo equality can happen only when \\(x_1=x_2\\). Thus the statement is true for \\(n=2\\).\n\n**Inductive step.**  \nAssume the equality statement is true for \\(n-1\\). Now consider \\(n\\) points.\n\nFix the last index for convenience and set\n\\[\nt:=\\lambda_n,\\qquad \\Lambda:=1-t=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i.\n\\]\nBecause all \\(\\lambda_i>0\\) and \\(\\sum\\lambda_i=1\\), we have \\(0<t<1\\) and \\(0<\\Lambda<1\\).\n\nDefine\n\\[\ny:=\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i x_i,\n\\qquad\nm:=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i x_i.\n\\]\nAs before,\n\\[\nm=(1-t)y+t x_n=\\Lambda y+\\lambda_n x_n.\n\\]\n\nNow repeat the two inequalities from the Jensen proof, but note where \u201cstrict\u201d can occur.\n\n1) By **strict convexity** applied to \\(y\\) and \\(x_n\\) with \\(t\\in(0,1)\\),\n\\[\nf(m)=f((1-t)y+t x_n)\\ \\le\\ (1-t)f(y)+t f(x_n),\n\\]\nand this inequality is **strict if \\(y\\ne x_n\\)**.\n\n2) By Jensen (ordinary convex Jensen) applied to \\(x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}\\) with weights \\(\\lambda_i/\\Lambda\\),\n\\[\nf(y)\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\Lambda} f(x_i).\n\\]\nMultiply by \\(\\Lambda\\):\n\\[\n(1-t)f(y)=\\Lambda f(y)\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i f(x_i).\n\\]\n\nPutting these together gives the chain\n\\[\nf(m)\n\\ \\le\\ (1-t)f(y)+t f(x_n)\n\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\lambda_i f(x_i)+\\lambda_n f(x_n)\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i f(x_i).\n\\]\n\nBut we assumed **equality at the ends**:\n\\[\nf(m)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i f(x_i).\n\\]\nA simple logic fact now applies: if \\(A\\le B\\le C\\) and \\(A=C\\), then necessarily \\(A=B=C\\). Therefore:\n\n- We must have equality in the **strict convexity** step, so \\(y=x_n\\).  \n  (Because strict convexity would make it \\(<\\) if \\(y\\ne x_n\\).)\n\n- We must also have equality in Jensen for the first \\(n-1\\) points:\n  \\[\n  f(y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\Lambda} f(x_i).\n  \\]\n  Since the weights \\(\\lambda_i/\\Lambda\\) are all positive and sum to 1, the **induction hypothesis** (for \\(n-1\\)) implies\n  \\[\n  x_1=x_2=\\cdots=x_{n-1}.\n  \\]\n  Call this common value \\(c\\). Then \\(y\\), being a weighted average of \\(x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}\\), equals \\(c\\). But we already know \\(y=x_n\\). Hence \\(x_n=c\\) too.\n\nSo \\(x_1=\\cdots=x_n\\). This completes the induction. \u220e\n\n---\n\n### Why the condition \\(\\lambda_i>0\\) matters\nIf you allow \\(\\lambda_k=0\\) for some \\(k\\), then \\(x_k\\) has no effect on either side, so equality can happen without forcing that \\(x_k\\) matches the others. That\u2019s why the clean \u201ciff all equal\u201d statement requires **all weights positive**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also add a short remark about the *non-strictly convex* case (when \\(f\\) has linear pieces): then equality can occur whenever all the \\(x_i\\) lie in a region where \\(f\\) is linear."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":8479,"end_idx":8479,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"f812092f-9a8b-4497-9d51-45390e9cc147","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"99d0f279-4bcf-4464-adc7-35a35442fd39","turn_exchange_id":"4e6012db-673f-4224-b0b5-82e89faaf6a7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"99d0f279-4bcf-4464-adc7-35a35442fd39","children":[]}}}
