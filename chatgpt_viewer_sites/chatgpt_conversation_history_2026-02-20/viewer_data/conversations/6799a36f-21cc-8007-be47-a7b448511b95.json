If your text uses the opposite convention\u2014linear in the second argument\u2014then simply swap the roles in what follows.)\n\n---\n\n### Statement of the theorem\n\n> **Riesz Representation Theorem (finite-dimensional case).**  \n> Let \\(f : V \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) be any (linear) functional on \\(V\\).  Then there exists a unique vector \\(v_f \\in V\\) such that\n> \\[\n> f(w) \\;=\\; \\langle w, v_f\\rangle\n> \\quad\\text{for all } w \\in V.\n> \\]\n\nWe will construct \\(v_f\\) explicitly using an orthonormal basis and verify the required identity.  The finite-dimensional setting makes the proof straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Key idea\n\nIn finite dimensions, every vector \\(w\\in V\\) can be written uniquely in terms of an orthonormal basis \\(\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n\\}\\).  If you know a linear functional \\(f\\) on the basis elements, you automatically know it for any \\(w\\) (by linear extension).  Conversely, you can reverse-engineer which vector \\(v_f\\) has the property \\(\\langle w, v_f\\rangle = f(w)\\) by matching coordinates in that same basis.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1. Choose an orthonormal basis\n\nChoose an orthonormal basis \\(\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n\\}\\) of \\(V\\).  By definition of being orthonormal,\n\\[\n\\langle e_i, e_j\\rangle \\;=\\; \\delta_{ij}\n\\quad\\text{(the Kronecker delta)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2. Define \\(v_f\\)\n\nWe want \\(\\langle e_i, v_f\\rangle = f(e_i)\\) for each basis vector \\(e_i\\).  This suggests defining\n\\[\nv_f \\;:=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^n f(e_i)\\,e_i.\n\\]\n\nThat is, in terms of the orthonormal basis, the \u201ccoordinates\u201d of \\(v_f\\) are precisely the values \\(f(e_i)\\).  (Because if \\(\\langle e_i, v_f\\rangle\\) should equal \\(f(e_i)\\), then in an orthonormal basis, the \\(i\\)-th coordinate of \\(v_f\\) is \\(\\langle e_i, v_f\\rangle\\).)\n\n### Step 3. Verify that \\(f(w) = \\langle w, v_f\\rangle\\)\n\nTake any \\(w \\in V\\).  Expand \\(w\\) in the same orthonormal basis:\n\\[\nw = \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \\, e_j,\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_j \\in \\mathbb{C}\\).  Since \\(f\\) is linear,\n\\[\nf(w) \\;=\\; f\\Bigl(\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j\\,e_j\\Bigr)\n\\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \\, f(e_j).\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, using the definition of \\(v_f\\) and the inner-product property,\n\\[\n\\langle w, v_f\\rangle\n\\;=\\; \\biggl\\langle \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \\, e_j,\\;\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(e_i)\\,e_i\\biggr\\rangle\n\\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{i=1}^n\n\\bigl\\langle w_j \\, e_j,\\; f(e_i)\\,e_i \\bigr\\rangle.\n\\]\nBecause the inner product is linear in the first argument (by our chosen convention) and the basis vectors are orthonormal,\n\\[\n\\langle w_j\\, e_j,\\; f(e_i)\\,e_i\\rangle\n\\;=\\; w_j \\, f(e_i)\\,\\langle e_j,\\;e_i\\rangle\n\\;=\\; w_j \\, f(e_i)\\,\\delta_{ji}\n\\;=\\; w_j \\, f(e_j)\\quad(\\text{only when }i=j).\n\\]\nHence the double sum collapses to\n\\[\n\\langle w, v_f\\rangle\n\\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j\\,f(e_j).\n\\]\nComparing this with \\(f(w) = \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j\\, f(e_j)\\), we see\n\\[\n\\langle w, v_f\\rangle \\;=\\; f(w),\n\\]\nas desired.\n\n### Step 4. Check uniqueness\n\nSuppose \\(v_f\\) and \\(u\\) are two different vectors in \\(V\\) such that\n\\[\nf(w) = \\langle w, v_f\\rangle\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\nf(w) = \\langle w, u\\rangle\n\\quad \\text{for all } w \\in V.\n\\]\nSubtracting gives\n\\[\n0 \\;=\\; f(w) - f(w) \\;=\\; \\langle w, v_f\\rangle - \\langle w, u\\rangle\n\\;=\\; \\langle w,\\; v_f - u\\rangle,\n\\]\nfor all \\(w \\in V\\).  In a non-degenerate inner product space, the only vector orthogonal to every \\(w\\) is the zero vector.  Thus\n\\[\nv_f - u = 0\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\nv_f = u.\n\\]\nHence \\(v_f\\) is unique.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPutting it all together, we have constructed a unique vector\n\\[\nv_f \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^n f(e_i)\\,e_i\n\\]\nsuch that \\(f(w) = \\langle w, v_f\\rangle\\) for all \\(w\\in V\\).

The finite-dimensional statement is really just the tip of the iceberg. Here are the main generalizations commonly called \u201cRiesz representation theorems\u201d:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Hilbert space generalization\n\n**Statement (Infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces).**  \nIf \\(H\\) is a (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) with inner product \\(\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle\\), then every bounded (continuous) linear functional \\(f \\in H'\\) is given by\n\\[\nf(w) \\;=\\; \\langle w,\\; v_f\\rangle\n\\]\nfor a unique vector \\(v_f \\in H\\). Moreover,\n\\[\n\\|f\\| \\;=\\; \\|v_f\\|,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) denotes the operator norm on functionals and the usual Hilbert-space norm on vectors.\n\nThis generalization is often called the **Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Riesz Theorem** (especially in real Hilbert spaces) or just the **Riesz Representation Theorem** in the Hilbert-space setting.\n\n**Key difference from finite dimensions:** The proof uses completeness and relies on the fact that any bounded linear functional on a Hilbert space can be described by an inner product with a specific element in that space. Conceptually, it\u2019s the same idea as in the finite-dimensional case\u2014just with infinite sums and some measure of convergence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Riesz\u2013Markov\u2013Kakutani representation theorem (Measure-theoretic version)\n\n**Statement (For positive linear functionals on \\(C(X)\\)).**  \nLet \\(X\\) be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let \\(C_0(X)\\) be the space of continuous complex-valued functions on \\(X\\) that vanish at infinity (with the supremum norm). Suppose\n\\[\n\\Lambda: C_0(X) \\;\\to\\; \\mathbb{C}\n\\]\nis a positive linear functional (meaning \\(\\Lambda(f)\\ge 0\\) whenever \\(f(x)\\ge 0\\) for all \\(x\\in X\\)). Then there is a unique **regular Borel measure** \\(\\mu\\) on \\(X\\) such that\n\\[\n\\Lambda(f) \\;=\\; \\int_X f\\,d\\mu, \n\\quad\\text{for all }f\\in C_0(X).\n\\]\nIn fact, the theorem shows even more:  \n1. \\(\\|\\Lambda\\| = \\mu(X)\\) (the total variation norm of the measure).  \n2. Every positive linear functional arises in this way from a unique regular measure.\n\nWhen \\(X\\) is compact, you can take \\(C(X)\\) instead of \\(C_0(X)\\). This result is crucial in the theory of Banach spaces, functional analysis, and probability/measure theory because it identifies the dual of \\(C_0(X)\\) with (regular) complex measures on \\(X\\).  \n\n- **\u201cRiesz Representation Theorem\u201d for measures:** Special case: On \\([a,b]\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\), a positive functional on \\(C([a,b])\\) comes from integration against a unique positive measure. This is often introduced in real analysis courses as the \u201cRiesz Representation Theorem.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3. Further variants and related results\n\n1. **Vector measures and operator-valued measures:**  \n   In more general settings, one studies functionals taking values in Banach spaces or vector lattices, leading to vector-measure representations or operator-valued measure representations.\n\n2. **Distribution theory and rigged Hilbert spaces:**  \n   In spaces of test functions (like Schwartz space \\(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\)), one has \u201crepresentation theorems\u201d identifying continuous linear functionals (distributions) with certain generalized objects. While not typically called \u201cRiesz\u201d theorems, the same spirit\u2014\u201cevery functional is given by integration against something\u201d\u2014pervades distribution theory.\n\n3. **Gelfand representation (commutative \\(C^*\\)-algebras):**  \n   Every commutative \\(C^*\\)-algebra can be seen as \\(C(X)\\) for some compact Hausdorff \\(X\\). Then any positive functional corresponds to a positive measure (this is a consequence of the more general Riesz\u2013Markov\u2013Kakutani theorem). Gelfand duality generalizes and unifies these representation ideas in the setting of \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Finite-dimensional version (the \u201coriginal\u201d statement).** Every linear functional \\(f\\) on an inner product space \\(V\\) can be written as \\(f(w)=\\langle w,v_f\\rangle\\) for a unique \\(v_f\\in V\\).\n- **Hilbert-space (infinite-dimensional) version.** Same statement but now \u201cbounded linear functionals\u201d on a Hilbert space still correspond 1-to-1 with vectors in that Hilbert space.\n- **Riesz\u2013Markov\u2013Kakutani measure-theoretic version.** Positive linear functionals on \\(C_0(X)\\) correspond to unique positive regular Borel measures on \\(X\\).\n\nEach of these results captures the same essential idea\u2014a \u201cduality\u201d between functionals and concrete objects (vectors or measures)\u2014but in progressively broader and deeper frameworks in functional analysis."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"13031377-10bd-493f-b77b-67885efc51d4","request_id":"909643da0e56a039-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"13031377-10bd-493f-b77b-67885efc51d4","children":[]}}}
