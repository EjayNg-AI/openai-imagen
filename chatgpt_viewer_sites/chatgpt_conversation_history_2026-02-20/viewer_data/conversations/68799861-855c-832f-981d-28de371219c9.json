Below is a structured breakdown of what is commonly assessed, and how:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Data Understanding and Cleaning**\n**What's tested:**\n- Ability to load and inspect raw datasets (usually CSVs or SQL dumps).\n- Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, inconsistent types, or incorrect entries.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- Identify and remove rows/columns with too many missing values.\n- Impute missing values with mean/median/mode or domain-specific logic.\n- Normalize or correct inconsistent entries (e.g., \u201cMale\u201d vs \u201cM\u201d).\n- Detect and address outliers (using z-score, IQR, etc.)\n\n**Tools expected:**\n- `pandas`, `numpy`, SQL\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n**What's tested:**\n- Your understanding of data distributions, correlations, and trends.\n- Ability to summarize and visualize the data to draw insights.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- Plot histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices.\n- Describe relationships between features and target.\n- Identify potential leakage or collinearity.\n\n**Tools expected:**\n- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Feature Engineering**\n**What's tested:**\n- Skill in creating meaningful new features or transforming raw data for modeling.\n- Understanding of categorical encoding, time-based features, text/vector features.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- One-hot encoding / label encoding / ordinal encoding\n- Normalization or standardization\n- Generating time-lag or rolling-window features\n- Dealing with date-times or text (e.g. TF-IDF, embeddings)\n\n**Tools expected:**\n- `sklearn.preprocessing`, `pandas`, sometimes `nltk`, `spaCy`, or `sentence-transformers`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Model Selection and Training**\n**What's tested:**\n- Understanding of model fitting, bias-variance tradeoff, evaluation metrics.\n- Ability to pick appropriate models for regression, classification, or clustering.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- Train and evaluate models (e.g. `RandomForestClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`, `XGBoost`)\n- Cross-validation (e.g., `GridSearchCV`)\n- Use appropriate metrics: accuracy, F1, AUC, RMSE\n- Basic feature importance interpretation\n\n**Tools expected:**\n- `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Evaluation and Validation**\n**What's tested:**\n- Robustness of the solution and ability to avoid overfitting.\n- Clear reporting of performance.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- Stratified train/test split or cross-validation\n- Report metrics on both train and test sets\n- Optionally: precision-recall tradeoff, confusion matrix\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Software Engineering & Deployment Readiness**\n**What's tested:**\n- Clean, modular, and reusable code.\n- Ability to wrap models into functions, classes, or APIs.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- Write functions for data loading, cleaning, training\n- Organize code using scripts or modules\n- Use version control (e.g., `git`)\n- Bonus: Write tests, logging, or config files\n- *Optional advanced*: Build a Flask/FastAPI endpoint or Dockerfile\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Documentation & Communication**\n**What's tested:**\n- Ability to communicate findings, methodology, and limitations.\n\n**Typical tasks:**\n- A markdown report or Jupyter notebook explaining:\n  - The dataset\n  - Cleaning decisions\n  - Modeling choices and results\n  - Next steps or limitations\n- Code comments, docstrings\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Optional: Bonus or Stretch Tasks**\n**Sometimes included:**\n- Deploy model to a REST API or cloud service (e.g., AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run)\n- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline or Docker container\n- Handle imbalanced data (e.g., SMOTE, cost-sensitive training)\n- Use of pipelines (`sklearn.pipeline`) or MLFlow for tracking\n\n---\n\n### Example Question Prompt\n> You are given a dataset of customer churn from a telecom company. Your task is to:\n> 1. Clean the dataset and handle missing or inconsistent entries.\n> 2. Perform exploratory data analysis.\n> 3. Engineer relevant features for modeling.\n> 4. Train at least two models and compare their performance.\n> 5. Wrap your model into a reusable function or class.\n> 6. Document your methodology and present your findings.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a **mock assessment task** or a **template solution outline** for practice?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"960df1abfc928342-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"1326612b-b12f-4375-9512-f165a91ce4f5","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1326612b-b12f-4375-9512-f165a91ce4f5","children":[]}}}
