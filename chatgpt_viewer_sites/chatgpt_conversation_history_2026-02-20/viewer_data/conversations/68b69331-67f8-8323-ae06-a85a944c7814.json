The system clock drifts, because it needs either:  \n1. A small coin-cell battery (CMOS/RTC battery) inside the laptop to keep time when fully powered off, or  \n2. To regularly sync with an internet time server when powered on.  \n\nIf either fails (dead CMOS battery, no network sync for a while), your clock can lag by minutes or more.\n\n---\n\n### How to Adjust the Clock\n\n**Windows 10/11**  \n1. Right-click the clock in the bottom-right corner.  \n2. Choose **Adjust date/time**.  \n3. Toggle **Set time automatically** ON (requires internet).  \n4. Click **Sync now** under *Synchronize your clock* to force an update.  \n\n**macOS**  \n1. Go to **System Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Date & Time**.  \n2. Turn on **Set time and date automatically**.  \n3. Choose Apple\u2019s or another NTP time server.  \n\nYou can also manually set the time, but syncing to a server is better.\n\n---\n\n### Will It Stay Adjusted?\n\n- **If the CMOS battery is healthy**: Yes. Even when powered off, the clock will be maintained, and periodic internet sync will keep it accurate.  \n- **If the CMOS battery is flat**: Every time the laptop is fully powered off and unplugged, the clock will drift or reset. In that case, replacing the coin-cell battery (often a CR2032 inside the laptop) is the long-term fix.  \n- **If always online**: Even with a flat CMOS battery, the clock will be corrected at boot as long as it syncs with an NTP server.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Quick check: Restart your laptop. If the time is still correct after reboot, then your CMOS battery is probably fine and it was just an old drift. If it resets or drifts badly again, the CMOS battery is likely dead and should be replaced.  \n\nWould you like me to walk you through how to check (and if needed, replace) the CMOS battery in your laptop model, or just rely on internet time sync?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"978b1120dffd9bda-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"55fa3674-1466-4937-af3d-6aad695ac06f","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"55fa3674-1466-4937-af3d-6aad695ac06f","children":[]}}}
