government announcement. The facility, with a planned capacity of up to 500 megawatts, would support advanced AI computing and be developed under Argentina\u2019s ORIGI tax break scheme implemented last year. If realized, it would rank among Argentina's largest technological and energy infrastructure undertakings. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the initiative, dubbed \"Stargate Argentina,\" as the company's first major infrastructure project in Latin America, citing the region\u2019s rich talent and potential. This development follows a surge in OpenAI\u2019s prominence, having reached an $800 million weekly ChatGPT user base and secured a $500 billion valuation after a recent secondary share sale. Earlier in the week, OpenAI also revealed new collaborations with companies like Spotify, Zillow, and Mattel at its developer conference, alongside launching new tools for application development.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1760124476.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-power-use-reach-record-highs-2025-2026-eia-says-2025-10-07/","title":"US power use to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, EIA says","snippet":"According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. power consumption is projected to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, driven by increased demand from data centers, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency operations, and a shift toward electric heating and transportation.

a sober, adversarial look at the *strategic upside* and the *risk stack* behind decade-scale AI/datacenter bets from OpenAI, Google, Apple, and xAI. I\u2019ll ground key facts with current disclosures/reports and then pressure-test the economics, execution, and tail risks.\n\n---\n\n# What\u2019s actually being built (brief factual baseline)\n\n- **OpenAI** \u2014 Reported concepts and pilots span from a ~$100B U.S. \u201cStargate\u201d supercomputer campus targeting ~2028 (with Microsoft) to new multi-site expansions and even a Latin America project (Argentina) sized at up to **$25B / ~500 MW** under consideration with Sur Energy. These are ambitious, not all FID-approved, but illustrate intended scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0news50\ue201\n\n- **Google** \u2014 Guidance and reporting indicate **extraordinary capex** acceleration largely for AI-centric data centers, servers, and networking (2024 \u2248 $52.5B; **2025 guided \u2248 $75B**), alongside in-house silicon (TPU, the **Axion** Arm CPU) to push cost/Watt and performance per dollar. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n- **Apple** \u2014 Rolling out **Private Cloud Compute (PCC)** for \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d: custom, privacy-hardened AI cloud with hardware attestation, memory-safe OS, no persistent logs; tightly coupled to on-device models. (Strategically: \u201cAI services\u201d without operating a general-purpose public cloud.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n- **xAI** \u2014 Building very large GPU clusters and a Memphis \u201cColossus 2\u201d footprint; reports suggest a trajectory to **100k+ H100** this cycle and plans to add **GB200** scale capacity by 2025/26; funding $6B in 2024 and using Oracle/AWS + reused X/Twitter space. (Exact power/GPU counts vary by source; trendline = rapid scale-up.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n- **Macro constraint** \u2014 Independent energy outlooks now expect **data-center electricity demand to ~double by 2030**; AI is the fastest-growing share. Grid connections, generation, and cooling are quickly becoming gating factors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Why these bets *could* work (core upsides)\n\n1) **Unit-economics flywheel (scale \u2192 cheaper inference \u2192 more demand):**  \n   - Owning (or co-owning) the stack (custom chips, optimized networks, compiler/runtime, model co-design) **compresses $/token** and **$/training-FLOP**, creating a pricing wedge competitors without scale can\u2019t match. Google\u2019s Axion + TPU line is explicitly about this wedge. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n2) **Moat via integrated silicon + software**  \n   - Google: TPU + Axion + fleet; Apple: PCC integrated with devices and OS security; OpenAI/Microsoft: co-designed supercomputer fabric; xAI: single-tenant monster clusters for rapid iteration of Grok. These forms of integration are hard to copy and allow for **faster model cadence and lower latency**.\n\n3) **Category-defining products**  \n   - If frontier models cross new capability thresholds (autonomous coding, agentic research, multimodal planning), the *serviceable obtainable market* expands non-linearly across cloud, ads, devices, productivity, and developer platforms.\n\n4) **Demand elasticity**  \n   - When you cut inference price and latency, **new use-cases** appear (e.g., always-on copilots, A/V synthesis at scale, device-integrated assistants). Apple\u2019s on-device + PCC split specifically lowers UX friction for mainstream users. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\n5) **Geo-industrial leverage**  \n   - Siting multi-GW campuses unlocks **long-term power PPAs**, grid upgrades, and political goodwill (jobs/tax base). OpenAI\u2019s Argentina LOI is a template for tapping new energy geographies if U.S. interconnect queues stall. (It\u2019s still early-stage risk, but directionally important.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news50\ue201\n\n---\n\n# The risk stack (what can break, and how)\n\n## A. Economics & financing\n\n- **Capex productivity risk** \u2014 If model quality **plateaus** or demand is more price-inelastic than hoped, IRR compresses. Google\u2019s step-up to ~$75B capex in 2025 raises the hurdle rate for utilization and monetization across Cloud/Ads/Workspace. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \n- **Stranded-asset risk** \u2014 Rapid **hardware obsolescence** (e.g., GB200/NVL72 leapfrogged by next nodes, or a photonics/analog discontinuity) can render a year-old cluster sub-economic for training.  \n- **Capital cycle risk** \u2014 If rates stay higher-for-longer or equity risk premia widen, decade-long megaprojects face **WACC creep** and tougher payback math.\n\n**Back-of-envelope IRR sanity check (illustrative):**  \nSuppose $10B for a 300 MW AI campus, 65% average utilization, blended margin of 25% on $/GPU-hour pricing, 7-year economic life, 20% salvage. You need **>$1.9\u20132.3B/year** gross profit to clear mid-teens IRR. Miss on utilization or price by ~20% and IRR can slip below 10% (borderline for big-tech hurdle rates).\n\n## B. Power, water, and location\n\n- **Grid interconnect delays** & **PPA execution** are now the critical path for scale. Independent outlooks show DC electricity demand more than doubling by 2030; competition with EVs and industrial electrification can crowd nodes and push **capacity prices up**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n- **Public-utility & ESG headwinds** \u2014 local pushback over water use, diesel backup, and land can slow permitting or force expensive redesigns (e.g., district cooling, reclaimed water).\n\n## C. Supply chain & technology\n\n- **GPU/accelerator concentration** \u2014 Timing mis-match between model roadmaps and silicon deliveries (e.g., H100\u2192B200/GB200) risks **under-utilized shells** or **over-provisioned power** awaiting racks. xAI\u2019s pace assumes timely multi-hundred-thousand accelerator availability plus cooling capacity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **Thermal/cooling engineering** \u2014 Dense racks (NVL72-class) push hot-aisle/cold-aisle and liquid cooling to operational edges; any reliability drag can erase margin.\n\n## D. Regulatory, legal, and geopolitical\n\n- **Export controls** (U.S.\u2013China et al.) can hit TAM, complicate global supply chains, and force **region-specific SKUs** (lower-perf chips, lower ROI).  \n- **Copyright & safety liability** \u2014 Shifts in generative AI liability (output harms, IP) can raise cost of revenue via **indemnities** and **content licensing**.  \n- **Data localization & privacy law** \u2014 Apple\u2019s PCC is designed to minimize exposure (stateless, attestable), but also constrains feature sets and enterprise controls (auditability, location guarantees), which some customers want. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search17\ue201\n\n## E. Competitive dynamics\n\n- **Model commoditization** \u2014 If open-weights (or multiple hyperscalers) converge on similar quality/latency, price wars compress margin; custom silicon moats help, but are not impregnable.  \n- **Distribution power** \u2014 Apple\u2019s device integration can *defensively* retain users at lower cloud cost/latency, but if general-purpose assistants become must-have enterprise platforms, Apple will face a \u201cnot-a-cloud\u201d strategic ceiling.\n\n## F. Demand formation & monetization\n\n- **Value capture ambiguity** \u2014 If the major value accrues to *downstream apps* (vertical SaaS, consumer experiences) rather than to general-purpose model APIs, hyperscaler IRR could depend on **bundled cross-subsidies** (ads, compute attach, devices) rather than explicit AI margins.  \n- **Agentic automation risk** \u2014 If agentic systems under-deliver in reliability/compliance (tool-use, long-horizon planning), the S-curve **defers**; utilization misses spill straight into IRR.\n\n---\n\n# Company-by-company strategic read-through\n\n**OpenAI (with Microsoft)**  \n- **Thesis:** win on *frontier capability* and *API/platform gravity*; secure multi-GW capacity (Stargate-like) to stay first to new capability plateaus.  \n- **Edge:** unparalleled model mindshare; Microsoft distribution.  \n- **Key risks:** capex control without a cloud P&L of its own; reliance on partner DC assets; policy/regulatory scrutiny; executing multi-site power agreements (e.g., Argentina LOI is promising but early). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0news50\ue201\n\n**Google**  \n- **Thesis:** win via **full-stack efficiency** (TPU, **Axion** CPU, Borg-level orchestration) and monetize across Ads, Cloud, Workspace, Android.  \n- **Edge:** in-house silicon + hyperscale fleet; sticky distribution.  \n- **Key risks:** very high **capex burden** ($75B 2025), Cloud monetization sensitivity, and execution risk that TPU/Axion cost/perf advantages must be *consistently* visible to customers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n**Apple**  \n- **Thesis:** **privacy-preserving AI** as a device feature; push as much as possible on-device; burst to **PCC** only for heavy tasks under strict guarantees; avoid general-purpose cloud exposure.  \n- **Edge:** vertical integration (silicon \u2192 OS \u2192 UX), trust, and a massive installed base.  \n- **Key risks:** narrower AI surface area vs. hyperscaler platforms; enterprise controls (audit/location) may lag some B2B needs; less leverage from selling generic AI compute. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\n**xAI**  \n- **Thesis:** concentrated **compute supremacy** to iterate Grok quickly; leverage X/Twitter data + brand to distribute; move fast with large, single-tenant clusters.  \n- **Edge:** founder-led urgency; ability to repurpose facilities and drive aggressive timelines.  \n- **Key risks:** **supply chain timing**, reliability at extreme densities, and business-model concentration (few products shouldering massive fixed cost). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Scenario analysis (12\u201336 months; probabilities = subjective)\n\n- **Base case (50%)** \u2014 Power and supply chains tighten but do not break. Google keeps capex near the guided trajectory and shows visible $/token declines; OpenAI/Microsoft land one or two flagship sites; Apple grows on-device + PCC steadily; xAI brings a very large cluster fully online by late-2025/26. Margins are **okay** (not stellar) because pricing falls roughly with cost. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n- **Bull case (25%)** \u2014 Next-gen models unlock *reliable agentic automation* in coding and back-office workflows \u2192 demand step-change; utilization stays >75% and IRR heads into mid-teens+ even at falling prices. Apple\u2019s PCC becomes a model of \u201cprivacy AI\u201d at scale; xAI\u2019s cluster density is proven reliable.\n\n- **Bear case (25%)** \u2014 Grid and permitting delays bite; power costs rise; key model gains are incremental; enterprise adoption slows on compliance and ROI proof. Capex keeps arriving faster than profitable demand, compressing IRR and triggering spend deferrals.

If realized, it would rank among Argentina's largest technological and energy infrastructure undertakings. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the initiative, dubbed \"Stargate Argentina,\" as the company's first major infrastructure project in Latin America, citing the region\u2019s rich talent and potential. This development follows a surge in OpenAI\u2019s prominence, having reached an $800 million weekly ChatGPT user base and secured a $500 billion valuation after a recent secondary share sale.
