Let me organize the answer in terms of what spectra enable, and what lies beyond their reach.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What spectra *do* give you\n\nA **spectrum** is precisely the device that packages a generalized homology and cohomology theory. More concretely:\n\n- If \\(E\\) is a spectrum, then:\n  - Its **homology theory** is\n    \\[\n    E_n(X) = \\pi_n(E \\wedge X),\n    \\]\n    defined for pointed spaces \\(X\\).\n  - Its **cohomology theory** is\n    \\[\n    E^n(X) = [X, \\Sigma^n E],\n    \\]\n    the homotopy classes of maps into suspensions of \\(E\\).\n\n- These functors satisfy the **Eilenberg\u2013Steenrod axioms** (minus the dimension axiom, so they are \u201cgeneralized\u201d theories). For instance, ordinary singular homology is represented by the Eilenberg\u2013MacLane spectrum \\(H\\mathbb{Z}\\), and topological \\(K\\)-theory is represented by the spectrum \\(KU\\).\n\n- The formalism extends beyond spaces: given a suitable category of spectra (e.g. stable \\(\\infty\\)-categories), one can define \\(E\\)-homology of objects like ring spectra, module spectra, or even more elaborate structured objects.\n\nSo: **any reduced, homotopy invariant homology/cohomology theory satisfying excision and suspension isomorphisms can be represented by a spectrum.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. What cannot be defined purely from spectra\n\nThere are important classes of homological functors that **fall outside** what spectra can capture:\n\n1. **Functors requiring extra input not encoded by spaces/spectra.**  \n   For example:\n   - Group homology \\(H_*(G;M)\\) with arbitrary \\(G\\)-modules \\(M\\). Ordinary group homology is representable via \\(BG\\) and \\(H\\mathbb{Z}\\), but the *coefficients* in a general \\(M\\) require module-theoretic data that a spectrum alone cannot encode (unless you pass to parametrized spectra or enriched setups).\n   - Bivariant theories like **KK-theory** in operator algebras: while there are spectrum-level models (e.g. for \\(K\\)-theory itself), the fully bivariant category does not come purely from a single representing spectrum, but rather from a triangulated/stable \\(\\infty\\)-categorical construction.\n\n2. **Homology theories that violate the axioms.**  \n   - The Dold\u2013Thom theorem tells us ordinary homology is representable, but \u201cunstable\u201d homological invariants that lack excision or suspension isomorphisms do not admit spectrum representation.  \n   - Examples: Nielsen fixed point theory invariants, or unstable versions of bordism, often fall outside.\n\n3. **Non-homotopy invariant functors.**  \n   - Anything that depends on the strict shape of a space, not just its homotopy type, is not representable by spectra. For example, singular chains with their raw chain complex (not up to quasi-isomorphism) cannot be encoded by a spectrum without collapsing information.\n\n4. **Enriched or bivariant generalizations.**  \n   - **Bivariant K-theory**, **bivariant cyclic homology**, and **topological Hochschild/cyclic homology (THH/TC)** can often be built from spectra, but usually via more sophisticated objects like cyclotomic spectra or spectral categories, not from a single plain spectrum.  \n   - In other words, they *use spectra*, but they are not simply \u201crepresented\u201d by a single spectrum in the homotopy category.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Boundary zone (spectral but requires enrichment)\n\nBetween \u201cdoable\u201d and \u201cnot doable\u201d is a grey zone where spectra need additional structure:\n\n- **Parametrized spectra / twisted cohomology.**  \n  Twisted \\(K\\)-theory, or more generally cohomology with local coefficients, requires parametrized spectra indexed over a base, not just a single spectrum.\n\n- **Equivariant homology theories.**  \n  These are modeled by \\(G\\)-spectra (equivariant spectra), rather than plain spectra.\n\n- **Structured ring spectra.**  \n  Many algebraic invariants (THH, TC, algebraic \\(K\\)-theory of ring spectra) are accessible only because we work with spectra endowed with ring or module structure.\n\nSo: **if you\u2019re willing to work in enriched categories of spectra (equivariant, parametrized, cyclotomic, spectral categories), many more homological functors become accessible.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- **Can be defined from spectra:** Any generalized homology/cohomology theory in the sense of Eilenberg\u2013Steenrod (minus dimension). These include ordinary homology, \\(K\\)-theory, cobordism theories, bordism theories, and all the standard stable representable theories.\n- **Cannot (without extra enrichment):** Functors that fail the axioms (not homotopy invariant, not excisive, not suspension-compatible), or that require additional data like coefficients in nontrivial modules, operator-algebraic input, or bivariant structures.\n- **Intermediate:** Parametrized, equivariant, cyclotomic, or categorical generalizations expand what spectra can encode, but they go beyond the bare \u201cspectrum = cohomology theory\u201d correspondence.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **tabulate** these categories (spectral vs. non-spectral vs. enriched-spectral) so you get a precise at-a-glance classification, or would you prefer a more **conceptual unification** that shows how the enriched spectrum machinery (like equivariant or parametrized stable homotopy theory) extends the representability theorem?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"972bf883eb944095-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"317c6560-c145-4891-b097-c04a66895409","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"317c6560-c145-4891-b097-c04a66895409","children":["930f88f4-3028-42b1-80b6-92220dcd500a"]},"930f88f4-3028-42b1-80b6-92220dcd500a":{"id":"930f88f4-3028-42b1-80b6-92220dcd500a","message":{"id":"930f88f4-3028-42b1-80b6-92220dcd500a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755799020.284,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Let's focus on topological K-Theory and algebraic K-Theory first.

This rarely creates new structure beyond what you already know about \\(E\\) itself, so authors state results for \\(E\\) and leave coefficients to formal corollaries. (ii) When you genuinely want \u201ccoefficients that vary over the space/scheme,\u201d the **right** notion is **twists/parametrized spectra** or **sheafified \\(E\\)**\u2014and those are used, but the technology and notation are heavier, so people invoke them only when they pay off (e.g. twisted \\(K\\)-theory, equivariant theories, \u00e9tale/descent statements), not as the default.\n\nBelow is a more precise breakdown.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Ordinary vs. generalized: what \u201ccoefficients\u201d buy you\n\n- **Ordinary (co)homology.** Coefficients in an abelian group \\(A\\) (or a local system) are classical and ubiquitous. Over a PID (like \\(\\mathbb Z\\)), the **UCT** collapses to short exact sequences, so \\(H_*(X;A)\\) is determined by \\(H_*(X;\\mathbb Z)\\) via \\(\\otimes\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Tor}_1\\). In practice, people work **prime-by-prime** (\\(\\mathbb F_p\\)) and **rationally** (\\(\\mathbb Q\\)) because fields simplify K\u00fcnneth/UCT, Adams/Steenrod operations, etc. Arbitrary \\(A\\) is recovered by Bocksteins and Chinese remainder; it adds bookkeeping, not new phenomena.\n\n- **Generalized theories \\(E\\).** For any spectrum \\(E\\) and abelian group \\(A\\),\n  \\[\n  E\\text{-with-}A\\text{ coeffs}\\;=\\;E\\wedge H A,\\qquad\n  0\\to \\pi_n(E)\\!\\otimes A \\to \\pi_n(E\\wedge H A)\\to \\operatorname{Tor}_1^\\mathbb Z(\\pi_{n-1}E,A)\\to 0.\n  \\]\n  So on homotopy groups, coefficients are again just **derived tensor over \\(\\mathbb Z\\)**. Unless you choose a field or \\(p\\)-adics for conceptual reasons, general \\(A\\) just multiplies cases without new structure. That\u2019s why most papers state theorems for \\(E\\) and (sometimes) record the \\(p\\)\u2013primary/rational corollaries.\n\n---\n\n# 2) \u201cCoefficients in \\(R\\)-modules\u201d are usually just base change\n\nIf you want linearity over a ring \\(R\\), the canonical move is to view \\(E\\) as an \\(HR\\)-algebra and take\n\\[\nE(-;M)\\;:=\\;E\\otimes_{HR}H_R(M),\\qquad M\\in\\mathrm{Mod}_R,\n\\]\nwith a Tor/Ext spectral sequence over \\(R\\). For **\\(K\\)-theory**, one typically writes\n\\[\nK(X;M)\\;=\\;K(X)\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z}H M,\n\\]\nor first base\u2013change \\(\\mathbb Z\\to R\\) if you really want \\(R\\)-linearity. Again: formally available, but rarely illuminating beyond the \\(p\\)\u2013primary and rational cases; hence seldom emphasized.\n\n---\n\n# 3) When \u201ccoefficients that vary\u201d are actually needed, people switch language\n\n- **Local systems / twisted theories (topology).** For generalized \\(E\\), honest \u201clocal coefficients\u201d are not arbitrary sheaves of abelian groups; they are **bundles of \\(E\\)-module spectra** classified by maps \\(X\\to BGL_1(E)\\). This is the modern formulation of **twisted cohomology** (e.g. Dixmier\u2013Douady\u2013twisted \\(K\\)-theory). It\u2019s used when it matters (T-duality, index theory with H-flux, etc.), but most problems don\u2019t need it.\n\n- **Equivariant settings.** Coefficients become **\\(G\\)-spectra** and RO(\\(G\\))-gradings. This is standard in equivariant \\(K\\)-theory and homotopy theory\u2014again deployed when symmetry matters, not by default.\n\n- **Sheaf\u2010theoretic geometry.** In algebraic geometry one rarely says \u201c\\(K\\)-theory with coefficients in a sheaf.\u201d Instead one **sheafifies \\(K\\)** itself (presheaf of spectra \\(U\\mapsto K(U)\\) on Zariski/Nisnevich/\u00e9tale sites), proves **descent/localization**, and studies the resulting **\\(K\\)-sheaves** \\(U\\mapsto \\pi_n K(U)\\). This is exactly the content of Gersten sequences, coniveau/Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequences, and motivic filtrations. So the *sheaf* lives on the **output**, not the input \u201ccoefficients.\u201d\n\n- **Motivic and cyclotomic companions.** The meaningful \u201cextra structure\u201d usually comes from functorial maps of spectra (Chern characters \\(K\\to HP\\), cyclotomic traces \\(K\\to TC\\)), not from inserting exotic coefficients.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Practical and conceptual reasons authors don\u2019t carry general coefficients\n\n1. **No new invariants.** Over \\(\\mathbb Z\\) (global dimension \\(1\\)), coefficients add only \\(\\otimes\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Tor}_1\\). Stating every theorem with an arbitrary \\(A\\) clutters notation without changing content.\n\n2. **Computational pipeline is prime/rational.** Adams/Serre/AHSS, Steenrod operations, \\(p\\)\u2013complete nilpotence, and the global \u201cchromatic\u201d picture all run prime\u2010by\u2010prime; rationally, Chern characters linearize many theories. Arbitrary \\(A\\) doesn\u2019t mesh with these tools.\n\n3. **Multiplicative and orientation data.** Many theorems exploit \\(E_\\infty\\) structures, orientations, Thom isomorphisms, power operations. These interact cleanly with field/\\(p\\)-adic coefficients; carrying a general \\(A\\) often obscures the multiplicative story.\n\n4. **Right notion for variation is twisting or sheafifying \\(E\\), not ad hoc coefficients.** When geometry forces varying coefficients, the modern fix is parametrized spectra or descent for presheaves of spectra\u2014not \u201c\\(E\\) with coefficients in a sheaf.\u201d\n\n5. **K-theory already captures the \\(R\\)\u2013linearity you want.** For rings/schemes, changing scalars is expressed by \\(K(\\mathrm{Perf}(-))\\) and its behavior under base change; \u201ccoefficients in an \\(R\\)-module\u201d adds little compared with working \\(p\\)-adically or rationally.\n\n---\n\n# 5) When you *should* depart from \\(\\mathbb Z\\), \\(\\mathbb F_p\\), or \\(\\mathbb Q\\)\n\n- **\\(p\\)-adic detail:** use \\(E\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z}H\\mathbb Z_p\\) (coefficients) or \\(p\\)-**completion/localization** (a different, homotopy\u2013theoretic operation).  \n- **Twists/local systems:** when \\(\\pi_1\\)\u2013actions or gerbes matter (twisted \\(K\\)-theory, index problems on nontrivial bundles).  \n- **Descent / geometric topology:** sheafify \\(E\\) on a site and use its spectral sequences (Gersten, coniveau).  \n- **Equivariance:** pass to genuine \\(G\\)\u2013spectra and RO(\\(G\\))\u2013graded theories.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nIt\u2019s not that \u201ccoefficients\u201d beyond \\(\\mathbb Z\\), \\(\\mathbb F_p\\), \\(\\mathbb Q\\) don\u2019t exist\u2014they\u2019re completely formal via \\(E\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z}H(\\text{coeffs})\\).

Then\n\\[\nH_1(S^1;R)\\cong \\mathbb Z\\otimes R\\cong R,\\quad\nH_0(S^1;R)\\cong R,\n\\]\nand all \\(\\operatorname{Tor}\\) terms vanish since \\(R\\) is flat over \\(\\mathbb Z\\). No new geometry\u2014just base change.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Topological \\(K\\)-theory with \\(R\\)-module coefficients\n\nTake \\(E=KU\\). Define \\(KU_R:=KU\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z} HR\\) (an \\(HR\\)-algebra). For \\(M\\in\\mathrm{Mod}_R\\),\n\\[\nKU^*(-;M)\\;:=\\;(KU_R\\otimes_{HR} H_R(M))^*(-).\n\\]\n\n**Example (two-sphere, \\(R=\\mathbb Z/6\\), \\(M=R\\)).**  \nBott periodicity gives \\(KU^0(S^2)\\cong \\mathbb Z\\oplus\\mathbb Z\\), \\(KU^{-1}(S^2)=0\\). Then\n\\[\nKU^0(S^2;R)\\cong (\\mathbb Z\\oplus\\mathbb Z)\\otimes R\\cong R\\oplus R,\\qquad\nKU^{-1}(S^2;R)\\cong \\operatorname{Tor}_1^\\mathbb Z(0,R)=0.\n\\]\nAll we did was extend scalars \\(\\mathbb Z\\to R\\).\n\n**Example (torsion shows up via \\(\\operatorname{Tor}\\): \\(KO\\) at \\(2\\)).**  \n\\(KO^0(\\ast)\\cong\\mathbb Z,\\ KO^{-1}(\\ast)\\cong\\mathbb Z/2\\). With \\(R=\\mathbb Z/2\\), \\(M=R\\):\n\\[\n0\\to KO^0(\\ast)\\otimes R\\cong \\mathbb Z/2\n\\to KO^0(\\ast;R)\n\\to \\operatorname{Tor}_1^\\mathbb Z\\big(KO^{1}(\\ast),R\\big)\n\\cong \\operatorname{Tor}_1^\\mathbb Z(\\mathbb Z/2,\\mathbb Z/2)\\cong \\mathbb Z/2\n\\to 0,\n\\]\nso \\(KO^0(\\ast; \\mathbb Z/2)\\cong \\mathbb Z/2\\oplus\\mathbb Z/2\\) (noncanonically split). Again: pure base change explains the extra summand.\n\n**Example (\\(p\\)-adic coefficients vs \\(p\\)-completion).**  \nCoefficients in \\(\\mathbb Z_p\\) are \\(KU\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z}H\\mathbb Z_p\\); on homotopy \\(\\pi_*(KU; \\mathbb Z_p)=\\pi_*(KU)\\otimes \\mathbb Z_p\\) (flat base change). This is **not** Bousfield \\(p\\)-completion of \\(KU\\); it\u2019s literally extension of scalars along \\(H\\mathbb Z\\to H\\mathbb Z_p\\).\n\n---\n\n# 3) Algebraic \\(K\\)-theory: coefficients are still base change\n\nLet \\(K(X)\\) be the (connective or nonconnective) \\(K\\)-theory spectrum of a ring, scheme, or small stable \\(\\infty\\)-category \\(X\\). For \\(R\\) and \\(M\\in \\mathrm{Mod}_R\\),\n\\[\nK_n(X;M)\\;:=\\;\\pi_n\\!\\big(K(X)\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z} HM\\big).\n\\]\n\n**Example (finite fields, \\(R=\\mathbb Z/n\\)).**  \nQuillen: \\(K_{2i-1}(\\mathbb F_q)\\cong \\mathbb Z/(q^i-1)\\), \\(K_{2i}=0\\).\nThen\n\\[\nK_{2i-1}(\\mathbb F_q; \\mathbb Z/n)\\cong \\big(\\mathbb Z/(q^i-1)\\big)\\otimes \\mathbb Z/n\n\\cong \\mathbb Z/\\gcd(q^i-1,n),\n\\]\n\\[\nK_{2i}(\\mathbb F_q; \\mathbb Z/n)\\cong \\operatorname{Tor}_1^\\mathbb Z\\!\\big(\\mathbb Z/(q^i-1),\\mathbb Z/n\\big)\n\\cong \\mathbb Z/\\gcd(q^i-1,n).\n\\]\nNo new theorems\u2014just apply \\((\\mathrm{UCT}_{\\mathbb Z})\\) to the base groups.\n\n**Example (rational coefficients).**  \nFor any \\(X\\), \\(K_n(X;\\mathbb Q)\\cong K_n(X)\\otimes \\mathbb Q\\) (flat). For smooth \\(X/\\mathbb Q\\), the rational Chern character identifies \\(K(X)\\otimes\\mathbb Q\\) with periodic cyclic homology\u2014again, a statement after base change to \\(H\\mathbb Q\\).\n\n**Example (\\(p\\)-adic coefficients).**  \n\\(K_n(X;\\mathbb Z_p)\\cong K_n(X)\\otimes \\mathbb Z_p\\). This extracts precisely the \\(p\\)-primary information by scalar extension; it\u2019s distinct from the \\(p\\)-complete spectrum \\(K(X)^{\\wedge}_p\\) (a homotopy limit construction).\n\n---\n\n# 4) Why this is genuinely \u201cthe same thing\u201d categorically\n\n- The functor \\(H_R:\\mathrm{Mod}_R\\to \\mathrm{Mod}_{HR}\\) is exact and colimit-preserving.  \n- Extension of scalars \\(E\\mapsto E\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z}HR\\) upgrades \\(E\\) to an \\(HR\\)-algebra \\(E_R\\).  \n- Coefficients are then **just** \\(E_R\\)-linear tensoring with \\(H_R(M)\\). All long exact sequences/Bocksteins come from the exactness of \\(H_R\\) and tensor.\n\nIf you *don\u2019t* perform this base change and merely smash with \\(H\\) of the underlying abelian group, you only see \\(\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Tor}_{\\mathbb Z}\\). Base changing to \\(HR\\) is what upgrades all homological algebra to run over **\\(R\\)**.\n\n---\n\n# 5) Quick \u201crecipe\u201d you can reuse\n\nGiven a ring \\(R\\), an \\(R\\)-module \\(M\\), and any spectrum \\(E\\):\n\n1. Form \\(E_R := E\\otimes_{H\\mathbb Z} HR\\) (extension of scalars).  \n2. Define coefficients: \\(E(M) := E_R\\otimes_{HR} H_R(M)\\).  \n3. Compute with \\((\\mathrm{UCT}_R)\\) and the Tor/Ext over \\(R\\):\n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{Tor}^{R}_s\\big(\\pi_t(E_R), M\\big)\\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\pi_{t-s}(E(M)).\n   \\]\n\nEverything you know at the base (\\(E\\)) transports by base change\u2014hence researchers usually state results over \\(\\mathbb Z\\) (and then prime-by-prime or rationally), leaving \\(R\\)-module coefficients as immediate corollaries."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"972f98e769f29cb1-DFW","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"6852e734-e113-4cf4-b445-65a9cf563adb","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"6852e734-e113-4cf4-b445-65a9cf563adb","children":[]}}}
