Keep it at **0644** (`rw-r--r--`).\n\n### Why 0644 is the right default\n- **Apache must read it.** With 0644 Apache can read `.htaccess` reliably on shared hosting.\n- **WordPress & plugins need to write occasionally.** Things like **Permalinks**, **SG Optimizer** rules, caching/compression headers, etc., write to `.htaccess`. If you lock it to 0444, those updates will fail (sometimes silently).\n- **Security benefit is marginal.** If an attacker can run PHP as *your* user (common on shared hosts), they can just `chmod` it back and edit it. Real protection comes from hardening WP, timely updates, least-privilege, and WAF\u2014not 0444.\n\n### When 0444 is acceptable\nIf your root is a **static site** (or your WP rules are fully settled) and you\u2019re comfortable making changes **manually via SFTP**:\n- You may set `.htaccess` to **0444** temporarily.\n- Remember to flip it back to **0644** whenever you (or a plugin) need to change rules.\n\n### Recommended permissions snapshot (SiteGround / Apache)\n- **Directories:** `0755`\n- **Files (general):** `0644`\n- **.htaccess:** `0644` (optionally `0444` only if you never need auto-updates)\n- **wp-config.php:** start with `0600` or `0640` (if the site breaks, use `0644`; hosting setups vary)\n\n### One-liners over SSH/SFTP (safe defaults)\n```bash\n# from your document root, e.g. ~/public_html\nfind . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\nfind . -type f -not -name \"wp-config.php\" -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\n# exceptions\nchmod 644 .htaccess\nchmod 600 wp-config.php    # or 640 if your webserver group reads it\n```\n\n### About your SFTP vs File Manager observation\n- **Large files:** SFTP bypasses PHP limits (`upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`) that constrain web uploads\u2014so yes, it succeeds where the web UI might \u201cignore.\u201d\n- **WordPress media:** Uploading via SFTP places files on disk but doesn\u2019t register them in the Media Library. To use them as media items, upload via WP or run a \u201cMedia from FTP\u201d/\u201cAdd from Server\u201d workflow; otherwise, link files directly.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether your root is fully static or if WP/SG Optimizer still edits `.htaccess`. I\u2019ll suggest a \u201clocked most of the time\u201d workflow (with quick unlock steps) tailored to your setup."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2287,"end_idx":2287,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"9836df524e18a8e5-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"ff950423-b93f-48d2-9b3d-a36d70fc3c77","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"ff950423-b93f-48d2-9b3d-a36d70fc3c77","children":[]}}}
