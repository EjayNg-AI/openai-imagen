Space\u2011time and causality\n\n| Length scale | One\u2011way light\u2011travel time today | After change |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| 3\u202fm across a room | 10\u202fns | **0.11\u202fs** (noticeable pause between action and sight/sound) |\n| Earth diameter (12\u202f756\u202fkm) | 0.04\u202fs | **127\u202fh** (\u2248\u202f5.3\u202fdays) |\n| Earth\u2013Moon (384\u202f000\u202fkm) | 1.28\u202fs | **1.6\u202fyears** |\n| 1\u202fau (Sun\u2013Earth) | 8.3\u202fmin | **1.7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075\u202fyears** |\n\n*What you see is always history.*  Sunrise shows the Sun as it was in the late Lower Palaeolithic.  Nevertheless, **solar power flux is unchanged**: energy density of sunlight near Earth grows by the same factor \\(c/c_{\\oplus}\\) that the photon speed falls, so \\(u\\,c\\) (the Poynting flux) is constant.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Relativity becomes an everyday sport\n\nWith \\(c_{\\oplus}=27.8\\ \\text{m\u202fs}^{-1}\\):\n\n* Walking (5\u202fkm\u202fh\u207b\u00b9\u202f\u2248\u202f0.05\u202fc) gives a Lorentz factor \u03b3\u202f\u2248\u202f1.005: rulers shrink 0.5\u202f%, clocks in your backpack tick 0.5\u202f% slow.\n* Driving at the new \u201cspeed of light\u201d (100\u202fkm\u202fh\u207b\u00b9) is impossible\u2014you would need infinite energy.\n* A fast e\u2011bike at 50\u202fkm\u202fh\u207b\u00b9 (0.50\u202fc) has \u03b3\u202f\u2248\u202f1.15; its relativistic mass and kinetic energy are each 15\u202f% larger than Newtonian estimates.  \n  Required energy for a 1000\u202fkg car to reach 90\u202fkm\u202fh\u207b\u00b9 (0.90\u202fc):  \n  \\(E=(\\gamma-1)mc_{\\oplus}^{2}\\approx10^{6}\\ \\text{J}\\)\u2015still in the range a litre of petrol can supply.\n\nSpeed limits would converge on \\(\\sim60\\ \\text{km\u202fh}^{-1}\\); faster motion costs too much energy and makes you dangerously heavy.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Communications and computing\n\n* **Latency explodes.**  A trans\u2011atlantic cable (6000\u202fkm) introduces ~**9\u202fdays** one\u2011way delay; a voice call has a three\u2011week round trip.\n* **Fibre & copper signalling rates** collapse.  Chip features are ~1\u202fcm across; a logic transition cannot propagate in <0.36\u202fms, so clock rates plateau at a few\u202fkHz.  The digital revolution reverts to the telegraph era: ultra\u2011wide word lengths and massive parallelism to compensate for low serial speed.\n* **Radio astronomy, radar, GPS** become useless; their bandwidth shrinks proportionally to c.\n\nLong\u2011distance information again favours *physical transport* of storage media (now relativistically slow but still faster than photons over continental distances!).\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Mechanics, sound, and everyday engineering\n\nNo material object or signal may exceed \\(c_{\\oplus}\\).  Therefore:\n\n* The **speed of sound** in air (today 343\u202fm\u202fs\u207b\u00b9) must fall below 27\u202fm\u202fs\u207b\u00b9; either \\(\\gamma\\) (heat capacity ratio) or \\(k_{\\rm B}\\) scales down so that acoustic waves obey relativity.  Speech travels like a gentle breeze; you can outrun your own voice.\n* AC power grids must reduce frequency so that the electromagnetic wave which \u201ccarries\u201d the phase angle is still \u2273 one wavelength long.  Expect 0.1\u20131\u202fHz mains instead of 50/60\u202fHz.\n* Transmission\u2011line design flips: inductance and capacitance per unit length both rise \u221d\u202f\\(c/c_{\\oplus}\\), so even short cables behave like long delay lines.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Energy, heat and chemistry\n\nBecause we forced **all binding and excitation energies to scale down together with \\(c^{2}\\)**:\n\n* Combustion enthalpies per mole shrink by 10\u2077; to keep 300\u202fK room temperature comfortable we also reduced \\(k_{\\mathrm B}\\) by 10\u2077, so *thermal* energies track chemical ones and biology remains viable.\n* The Sun stays bright at Earth\u2019s surface, but photosynthesis must store energy 10\u2077\u202f\u00d7 more slowly.  Plants need proportionally more time (and surface area) to grow a joule of biomass; global primary productivity falls, pushing ecosystems toward *slow metabolism*.\n* Nuclear fusion in the solar core is untouched (it occurs far outside our low\u2011c bubble), but **terrestrial nuclear fission becomes negligible**\u2014the MeV per decay become mere 100\u202feV.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Biology and perception\n\n* Retinal photon arrival is delayed (a 3\u202fcm eyeball has ~1\u202fms internal latency), yet nerve conduction (ionic drift) is far below c already, so net visual response lengthens by only a few percent.  After a week you stop noticing.\n* Cardiac and neural electromagnetics propagate by quasi\u2011static fields; those depend on \\((\\varepsilon_{0,\\oplus},\\mu_{0,\\oplus})\\) but not on c itself, so heart rhythms and brain timing remain stable.\n* Radiation biology improves: cosmic\u2011ray muons, being limited to 100\u202fkm\u202fh\u207b\u00b9, typically decay before reaching the ground.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Society & culture\n\n* **Geography re\u2011asserts itself.**  News is local, global coordination rare.  Stock exchanges must reconcile prices that are literally *days* out of date elsewhere.\n* **Relativity enters the toolkit of civil engineers.**  GPS is replaced by *chronometric surveying*\u2014networked atomic clocks on slow vehicles map the metric of space\u2011time directly.\n* The **internet becomes the \u201cslow\u2011net\u201d.**  Content delivery via fleets of autonomous, relativistically\u2011aware cargo drones (\u00bd\u202fc airships!) out\u2011competes fibre links.\n* A new cultural tempo emerges: \u201creal\u2011time\u201d means seconds to minutes, *live* events are neighbourhood\u2011scale, and patience is a cardinal virtue.\n\n---\n\n## Can life really survive?\n\nYes\u2014*if* we are allowed to rescale every dimensional constant that sets an energy **per\u202fparticle** by the same factor \\(c_{\\oplus}/c\\).  Doing so preserves:\n\n* hierarchy of chemical, thermal, and rest\u2011mass energies  \n* atomic sizes and molecular geometries  \n* thermodynamics of water and of biological macromolecules\n\nWhat changes irreversibly is the *causal architecture* of the planet.  Light is no longer the messenger of choice; matter is.  Earth becomes a patchwork of almost\u2011isolated light\u2011cones, each community separated from the next by literal days of optical silence.\n\nIn short, lowering the local speed of light to 100\u202fkm\u202fh\u207b\u00b9 keeps us alive\u2014but pulls humanity back into a world where **space* once again means *delay***, and where *relativity* governs commerce, culture and daily motion as intimately as gravity does today."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"wfr_01986b87185c7ebc99e1e5cdcba426bf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3-pro","default_model_slug":"o3-pro","parent_id":"2a23092c-6ade-4de7-8641-1c80ae9577ba","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"2a23092c-6ade-4de7-8641-1c80ae9577ba","children":[]}}}
