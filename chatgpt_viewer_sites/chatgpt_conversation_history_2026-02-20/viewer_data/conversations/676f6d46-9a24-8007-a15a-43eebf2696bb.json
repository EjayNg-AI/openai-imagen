Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Uninstall WSL Distributions**\nEach WSL distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian) installed needs to be removed manually.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Open **Settings** \u2192 **Apps** \u2192 **Apps & features**.\n2. Scroll to find the installed Linux distribution (e.g., \"Ubuntu\").\n3. Click on the distribution, then click **Uninstall**.\n\nThis removes the specific WSL distribution, including its files and configurations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Unregister Remaining Distributions (if any)**\nIf there are any lingering distributions, you can unregister them via the command line.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as Administrator.\n2. Type:\n   ```powershell\n   wsl --list --all\n   ```\n   This lists all distributions, including stopped or uninstalled ones.\n\n3. Unregister any remaining distributions:\n   ```powershell\n   wsl --unregister <DistroName>\n   ```\n   Replace `<DistroName>` with the name of the distribution (e.g., `Ubuntu`).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Delete WSL Filesystem**\nThe WSL filesystem is stored under a specific directory.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Navigate to the WSL filesystem location:\n   - Default path:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Packages`\n2. Look for folders named after the distributions, such as:\n   ```\n   CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_...\n   ```\n3. Delete these folders to remove residual files.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Disable WSL (Optional)**\nIf you no longer need WSL at all, you can disable it entirely.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Open **Control Panel** \u2192 **Programs** \u2192 **Turn Windows features on or off**.\n2. Scroll down to find **Windows Subsystem for Linux**.\n3. Uncheck the box and click **OK**.\n4. Restart your computer when prompted.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Remove WSL Configuration Files (if necessary)**\nYou can delete any WSL-related configuration files (like `.wslconfig` or `.bashrc`).\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Check your home directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>`) for:\n   - `.wslconfig`\n   - `.bashrc` (or other shell configuration files if present).\n2. Delete these files if no longer needed.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Verify Complete Removal**\nTo ensure WSL and all distributions are removed:\n1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as Administrator.\n2. Run:\n   ```powershell\n   wsl --list --all\n   ```\n   You should see no distributions listed.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- **Data Backup:** Before uninstalling, ensure you back up any important data within WSL if needed.\n- **Reinstallation:** You can reinstall WSL anytime by enabling it in **Windows Features** and reinstalling distributions from the Microsoft Store.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"63c178b7-8454-4e80-87f5-521bb833f841","request_id":"8f8e62984c83f918-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"63c178b7-8454-4e80-87f5-521bb833f841","children":[]}}}
