Ask: *Is \\( \\mathcal U \\) locally presentable?*  (Equivalently: complete, cocomplete, generated under filtered colimits by a small set of finitely presentable objects.)\n3. If *yes*, the commuting property holds automatically.  \n   If *no*, search for explicit counter-examples or embed \\( \\mathcal U \\) in a presentable enlargement (e.g. replace topological spaces by simplicial presheaves).\n4. Finally add (or transport) the model structure; the exactness behaviour is already settled.\n\n---\n\n### 5  |  Take-away for practice\n\n*   **Combinatorial pointed model categories**\u2014the workhorses of modern homotopy theory, derived algebraic geometry, and homological algebra\u2014have the desired exactness of filtered colimits with finite products \u201cfor free.\u201d  \n*   Classical topological\u2010space model categories do **not**, unless you move to a presheaf/simplicial incarnation.  \n*   Whenever you need the commuting property inside a model\u2010categorical argument (e.g. to check monoid axioms, monoidal Bousfield localisations, or to compute homotopy limits by levelwise constructions), work in a combinatorial setting or shift to spectra / simplicial presheaves where the set-level exactness is guaranteed."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"8ac60419-9b3a-495f-9e5c-4bff3e3fdbfd","request_id":"95ddbc1daaa73f5a-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"8ac60419-9b3a-495f-9e5c-4bff3e3fdbfd","children":[]}}}
