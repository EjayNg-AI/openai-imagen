Use HTTP Instead of HTTPS**\n   - Manually type `http://` instead of `https://` in the browser's address bar.\n   - Some browsers (like Chrome and Firefox) will try to automatically redirect to `https://`, so you may need to explicitly enter `http://` and press **Enter**.\n\n### **2. Bypass Browser Warnings**\n   - If the browser warns about an insecure connection, click on **Advanced** and choose **Proceed to [website] (unsafe)**.\n   - This works only if the site allows HTTP connections or has an invalid SSL certificate.\n\n### **3. Modify Browser Settings (Advanced Users)**\n   If the browser forcibly redirects to HTTPS (e.g., due to HSTS), you can:\n   - **Chrome:** Open `chrome://net-internals/#hsts` and delete the site from HSTS settings.\n   - **Firefox:** Type `about:config`, search for `security.mixed_content.block_display_content`, and set it to `false` (not recommended for security reasons).\n\n### **4. Use a Different Browser**\n   - Some older or less restrictive browsers might allow HTTP connections without forcing HTTPS redirection.\n   - Try browsers like Brave, Opera, or Edge.\n\n### **5. Use a Command-Line Tool (For Testing)**\n   - Use `curl`:\n     ```sh\n     curl -v http://example.com\n     ```\n   - Use `wget`:\n     ```sh\n     wget http://example.com\n     ```\n\n### **6. Edit Your Hosts File (If Necessary)**\n   - If the domain enforces HTTPS via DNS records (e.g., using `CNAME` for a CDN), you can manually map it in your system\u2019s `/etc/hosts` file.\n\n### **Caution:**\nEven if you trust the website, browsing over HTTP means:\n   - Your connection is **unencrypted**, making it vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**.\n   - Sensitive data (like login credentials) **can be intercepted**.\n\nIf you own the website, it's highly recommended to set up **Let's Encrypt** for free SSL. Let me know if you need help configuring it! \ud83d\ude80"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"8c2eac47-1254-4fc5-b043-d2b2e109fb11","request_id":"918561247938fd14-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8c2eac47-1254-4fc5-b043-d2b2e109fb11","children":[]}}}
