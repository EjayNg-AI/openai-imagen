prime minister warns of 'messy' transition to post-American order","snippet":"Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has warned that the global order is transitioning into a \"messy and unpredictable\" phase as the U.S. retreats from its long-standing role as a global leader. Speaking ahead of major regional summits, Wong stressed the urgency of advancing trade liberalization and forming strategic alliances among like-minded countries to mitigate the impacts of rising protectionism. He cited U.S. tariffs\u2014part of President Trump's \"liberation day\" trade policies\u2014as destabilizing factors, particularly for trade-reliant nations like Singapore.\n\nWong emphasized the importance of new initiatives such as the Future of Investment and Trade Partnership, and discussed prospects for a European Union\u2013ASEAN free trade agreement. He warned that Singapore, acting as a \"canary in the coal mine,\" is beginning to feel the effects of the global economic slowdown, noting that initial resilience was propped up by pre-emptive business adjustments and technological support.\n\nThe prime minister also highlighted growing geopolitical tensions, particularly the strain on Singapore's balancing act between its strong ties with both the U.S. and China. With no clear successor to American global leadership, Wong described the current era as a volatile transition lacking a dominant, stabilizing power.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1761181205.717,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/video/a2f50428-c377-4a87-be91-9a3d912a7241","title":"Singapore prime minister warns of turbulence ahead in 'post ...","snippet":"Singapore prime minister warns of turbulence ahead in 'post-American' order | FT Interview.

The taskforce, comprising eight members, including government officials and business representatives, will address economic challenges and formulate long-term strategies. Singapore's GDP forecast for 2025 has been downgraded from 1\u20133% to 0\u20132% following a first-quarter contraction. Gan highlighted disruptions in supply chains and cancelled or deferred orders affecting companies connected to Chinese manufacturing. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized the global economic uncertainty caused by the U.S. administration's unpredictable tariff policies, particularly in semiconductor and pharmaceutical sectors. Singapore currently faces a 10% tariff on U.S. imports.

Wong emphasized that uncertainties remain, especially as the U.S. maintains a 10% baseline tariff, impeding long-term business planning and accelerating economic decoupling between the two nations. He noted that this shift is leading to a bifurcated global economic landscape centered around the U.S. and China. Singapore, with its small, trade-dependent economy, is already feeling adverse effects, prompting its central bank to loosen monetary policy and the trade ministry to lower the 2025 growth forecast. These developments come ahead of Singapore\u2019s general election on May 3, which marks Wong's first major electoral test since succeeding Lee Hsien Loong as leader of the People's Action Party (PAP) in 2024. While the PAP is expected to maintain its parliamentary majority, attention will focus on its share of the popular vote, particularly following a lackluster performance in the 2020 election.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1744802297.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/30486264a84bada87ab9fc12410b7da1","title":"Singapore dissolves parliament, paving the way for May 3 general election","snippet":"Singapore has dissolved its parliament, setting the stage for general elections on May 3, 2025. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who succeeded Lee Hsien Loong in 2024, is leading the long-dominant People's Action Party (PAP) into the elections, aiming to solidify his mandate. Although the PAP has governed since Singapore's independence in 1965, its popularity declined in the 2020 general election, when it retained a supermajority but saw its share of the vote drop to near a record low of 61% and its parliamentary dominance reduced as the opposition gained 10 seats. Wong, addressing global uncertainty and internal dissatisfaction\u2014particularly among younger voters\u2014has launched the \"Forward Singapore\" initiative to create a more inclusive and forward-looking national agenda. The PAP plans to field over 30 new candidates, hoping to rejuvenate its image amid criticism of tight governmental controls, high living costs, and growing inequality. Wong emphasized the importance of leadership stability as Singapore confronts global economic challenges, portraying the election as crucial for maintaining the nation's progress and resilience.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1744701732.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wsj.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/one-of-globalizations-biggest-winners-navigates-a-less-predictable-world-2511d361","title":"One of Globalization's Biggest Winners Navigates a Less Predictable World","snippet":"Singapore, a major beneficiary of globalization, faces increasing global uncertainty as international trade and security frameworks unravel. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong warns of a more contested, unpredictable world, referencing the U.S.'s shifting global stance, rising geopolitical tensions, and potential global conflicts. Notably, he highlights Taiwan as a critical flashpoint, urging both deterrence of Chinese aggression and Taiwanese independence aspirations.\n\nDespite rising trade frictions, Singapore's economy remained resilient in early 2025, bolstered by strong exports and strategic shifting of trade patterns. However, new U.S. tariffs, particularly on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, could challenge this stability. To mitigate risks, Singapore is deepening trade ties with like-minded nations through initiatives like the Future of Investment and Trade Partnership.\n\nAlthough strongly aligned with America in defense and investment, Singapore seeks autonomy and balance amid U.S.-China tensions. Wong emphasizes faith in American institutions and leadership, despite current U.S. political introspection. Drawing on its global trade role and sovereign wealth funds, Wong remains cautiously optimistic about Singapore's future and the world\u2019s ability to preserve peace through multilateral cooperation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1758322800.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-singapore-ties-pm-modi-holds-bilateral-with-lawrence-wong-discuss-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/123694655.cms","title":"India-Singapore ties: PM Modi holds bilateral with Lawrence Wong; discuss Pahalgam attack","snippet":"On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a bilateral meeting with Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at Hyderabad House in New Delhi.
