These risks include data poisoning from untrusted sources, privacy breaches involving proprietary data, and manipulation by hackers through malicious prompts. TEQSA emphasized the need for researchers, students, and support staff to recognize AI's potential to degrade research integrity through biased or inaccurate outputs. The guidance suggests enhanced monitoring of graduate research students and encourages oral thesis assessments to ensure academic rigor. Meanwhile, the Australian Research Council's review of its $1 billion National Competitive Grants Program has been delayed by three months amid efforts to revise regulations and improve oversight. Universities have adopted varying AI policies; for example, Monash University bans AI in thesis evaluations, whereas the University of Southern Queensland mandates oral defenses. There is concern over outdated national research conduct codes and a lack of updated AI usage data from institutions such as the NHMRC. TEQSA insists AI usage in research be disclosed to maintain transparency and uphold academic standards.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751968860.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68c7818ee24c832fbad85c7e17bd4eb4","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Expanding academic concerns for Singapore students","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97f4dfd10a3ca11f-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"a39145f7-4499-4d31-a384-99762736dcdc","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a39145f7-4499-4d31-a384-99762736dcdc","children":["468f8930-96a8-4df0-a53e-e1d8a1295f04"]},"468f8930-96a8-4df0-a53e-e1d8a1295f04":{"id":"468f8930-96a8-4df0-a53e-e1d8a1295f04","message":{"id":"468f8930-96a8-4df0-a53e-e1d8a1295f04","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757905305.537557,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Listing difficult subjects","content":"I think it's useful to outline tough areas like A-Maths topics, such as trigonometric identities, surds, and binomial expansions.
