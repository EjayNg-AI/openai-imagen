From the risks of AI-driven warfare, to the threat posed by \u201cbad actors\u201d to freedom and democracy, to the role of journalism in an AI-powered world - and even the age-old question of whether humans should live forever - no topic is off limits.\r\n\r\nAltman reflects on freedom, democracy, superintelligence, and his personal dream of becoming a farmer once AI takes over his job. A rare and candid look at one of the most influential voices shaping our future.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMDMEETS with Mathias D\u00f6pfner brings unedited conversations with the world\u2019s most influential voices. From politics and science to arts and business, each episode dives into the most pressing issues of our time - and sometimes the completely unexpected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Opening and Top of Mind\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: How is the baby?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Great. It's a boy.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Do you want to have more?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Yeah, though it's a lot of work.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I think four would be great.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: So that's the ambition level. I think four would be great.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Sam, before I start asking questions, I'd be interested: What is the question that you think about most at this moment? What is on the top of your mind?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: So many things. One that has been top of mind is that AI has progressed, I think, so much more than people are aware of. For most of the world, they're still just using ChatGPT, and yet we now have systems that are as smart as our smartest humans and beating them in our hardest intellectual competitions. There's this huge overhang of what we have versus what the world is using and how that's going to play out\u2014how long it takes the economy and society to catch up. That's a big one. What it's going to be like as these systems really do become self-improving. I think the interesting point here is whether our speed of problem solving is always a little ahead of the speed of problem creation.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: It looks quite good at the moment, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: It does. It does look quite good at the moment.\r\n\r\n### OpenAI, Europe, and Regulation\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: When we were sitting together here in Berlin last time a couple of months ago, we spoke about Stargate Europe. Can you share if there is any progress on that project?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Yeah. Very much inspired by you, we just announced OpenAI for Germany, and that we would build, with SAP and our partners at Microsoft, a sovereign cloud with our frontier models for Germany. This is a first-of-its-kind partnership for us. We totally get why countries need both sovereignty and frontier models, and the opportunity to deliver this and pioneer this here. I'm tremendously excited about seeing how this goes.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: And the idea of a bigger project comparable to the Stargate project in the U.S.\u2014do you think that's still a realistic option in Europe?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: We'd be excited to do that. I think that'll be a question for the European people. These data centers are huge investments, not just in capital but in energy, resources, focus. But we'd be very excited to support that. I think this is a great first step, and it will get people comfortable with this being a good idea, and we'd love to scale it from here.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: But you can't do it without nuclear energy. Is that correct? So you can't do it in Germany only. You would need, let's say, French nuclear energy.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I mean, we could do it without nuclear energy. Again, I think that'd be a question for the German people and the German politicians, but it's possible. It's a lot of energy.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Sam, you have a certain European patriotism. Where does that come from? Why do you care about Europe? It looks like a lost case for many Americans these days.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Well, many reasons. I think a strong Europe is important to the world. As I try to understand how the balance of power is likely to shift over time and where the alliances are likely to be that will help propagate the values that I hold so dear, I think a strong Europe is very important. I love Europe. I love coming to spend time here. The amount of culture and history and scientific advancement that has come out of Europe, I don't think is an accident. I get sad when some of my American friends say, \"Oh, it's a lost cause. It's a museum. There's no hope.\" It's certainly not what I think.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: In the bigger scheme of things, in the big competition with China, it seems that America should be interested in having Europe as an ally. And the other way around\u2014we can't do it alone.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I strongly agree. I'm realistic about some of the trade-offs and the challenges, but I think Europe is such an important natural ally for the U.S.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: What does Europe get wrong at this moment?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: This is way out of my expertise, but in the narrow lens that I have of looking at AI, I think we've had the regulatory conversation. I know it's ongoing, and the EU will make more decisions there.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: And you have a critical approach. You said if they are regulating further, then it may not be a market for OpenAI at some point.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: What we've said is we will try our best to be able to offer services here. There are times when we can't launch a new model, or not as fast, and our European users get very upset, and we explain we're not doing this because we want to penalize European users. We have to comply. So we will certainly always try, but I can imagine for sure a set of regulations where we just wouldn't be able to comply. I don't think it'll happen, and I hope it doesn't happen. I think what will happen is that different countries in the world will try different regulatory approaches for AI. Some will work better, some won't. People will learn what works and what doesn't, and learn the risks and benefits of a more liberal or more conservative approach. We're so early in all of this that the world will adapt as we go.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Ronald Reagan once famously said, \"The European understanding of the economy is: if a business moves, tax it. If it still moves, regulate it. If it's dead, subsidize it.\"\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Wow. I have not heard that. That's an evocative quote. I don't know. What do you think about the regulatory approach?\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: The whole world is deregulating. Europe is regulating up. That cannot work. It's self-damaging. We have to have smart regulation in certain areas\u2014we need it across the Atlantic in America and in Europe\u2014but this isolated way of Europe to be the world champion in regulation is leading to disaster and is really blocking innovation.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: My light observation from the outside is that Europe has said, \"Okay, maybe we took this too far, and we're going to pull back on that.\" Is that accurate?\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I think that's a realistic assessment. But what would be your concrete advice, let's say, to the government of a leading economy in Europe\u2014to Germany? What needs to happen in order to really stimulate AI progress and innovation in Europe?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: First of all, I think AI progress in Europe is happening. Particularly in Germany, the usage of OpenAI products is quite amazing. It's our largest market in Europe. Virtually every young person\u201418 to 24\u2014in Germany uses ChatGPT. I think it's now our fifth biggest market in the whole world, with crazy growth over the last year, and lots of startups and also bigger companies are building with our APIs. We hear a lot of complaints from some of those companies about \"we can't do this\" or \"we can't do that,\" so there are clearly things to address. My general advice on AI is: focus on the big risks; regulate the big risks\u2014and that, I think, is important. There are the potential real catastrophic risks with these frontier models. But then don't neglect the small risks. Be willing to accept some risk.\r\n\r\n### Jobs, Purpose, and Farming\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: One of the main topics, if people are talking about AI, is always jobs. Do you think AI is, in the end, destroying more jobs or creating more jobs?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: In the short term, it will destroy a lot of jobs. In the long term, like every other technological revolution, I assume we will figure out completely new things to do. I am willing to believe that human demand for more stuff, human desire to be useful to other people, to create value, to be part of the community, is pretty much limitless. At every major technological revolution, very smart people have said, \"This is it. This is the end. There are going to be no more jobs on the other side of the industrial revolution,\" or whatever, and it has always been a failure of imagination. There are people who say it's different this time with AI because the special thing about humans is our intellectual capacity, and if it can do everything, what will be left for us? My counter to that is we seem to be very wired to care about other people. We don't worry that much about the world of machines; we're very focused on other people. I don't know exactly what the new jobs will be, but I bet they'll be very people-centric. Humans\u2014we have such main-character energy. We don't really care that the machines are smarter than us. They already are.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I totally agree. In the end, we just cannot imagine what's going to happen and which new forms of economy and growth and value creation are going to happen. But when we had our dinner in Idaho a few weeks ago, at the table somebody asked you a fascinating question: \"Sam, imagine that AI would destroy even your job. What would you do?\" And you said, to our surprise, \"I would become a farmer.\" Why farmer?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: First of all, I think there will come a time when AI can be a much better CEO of OpenAI than me, and I will be nothing but enthusiastic the day that happens. There's plenty of other things for me to do. That doesn't scare me; that doesn't make me sad. That's just like, okay, I did this one thing, it's been automated. I wanted it to be automated\u2014that's kind of what we're doing. There are still plenty of interesting roles for me at OpenAI if I want to do that; that's great. But this has been a very stressful last ten years for me. It's been a huge amount of work. I have a farm that I live on some of the time, and I really love it, and it sounds like a wonderful change of pace.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: And you really\u2014you are not only enjoying the farm, you are participating in working there or doing things in nature. Is it a kind of escape for you, or what is it?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: It used to be. Since the launch of ChatGPT, my life has gone so crazy that I do nothing but work and hang out with my family, and all of my hobbies have gone by the wayside. I don't get to drive tractors and pick stuff.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: But nature matters to you. Are you a tree hugger?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I'm not a tree hugger. No, I'm not a tree hugger. But I love time in nature, and I love conservation.\r\n\r\n### Nature, Petrichor, and Simulation\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: When I read the biography about you that was published recently, I learned the word that I didn't know before: petrichor. Can you explain what that is?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I know what that is.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: It's a smell after rain. If rain drops on dry earth, the scent is called petrichor. And you said, or people are saying that you said, that is your favorite scent. Is that true?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I love that smell. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Why? Can you describe it? What makes it special for you? What do you love about it?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't know why certain smells are better than other smells. I just think that's a particularly great one. In California we have a long dry season that's about to come to an end, and I was thinking the other day, I'm so excited for the first rains. I love the smell that first day that happens.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Are you actually really a believer of the simulation theory, or are you just flirting with it?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I'm confused. I think there is something strange going on. What an odd time for us to be alive in all of human history. What an odd time for us to be having this conversation right now. So I think there's something strange going on, but I don't know what. Even in the simulation theory, people talk about that at many different levels and how you want to think about that; I don't know.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: But one thing is sure: our consciousness and what we define as reality is only a small part of what is really going on.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't know. I would say that our consciousness is the only thing we can be sure is really going on, and it's certainly the most important thing going on to any of us. But yeah, it's an unusual time to be alive.\r\n\r\n### Superintelligence, Immortality, and Progress\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Harari, the Israeli writer, wrote a fascinating book called Homo Deus, where he basically describes the next era of mankind: we become almost like gods\u2014eternal life, we don't deal with practical matters, work is basically done by others, unlimited wisdom and intelligence. Do you share that vision, and when is it going to happen?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: There's a quote that people in Silicon Valley love\u2014I'm going to get it wrong\u2014but it's something like, \"We have the technology of gods, the moral framework of medieval times,\" and there's one more. There is this sense that our technological capabilities are so outpacing our wisdom, our judgment, our time to develop what we want society to be. It does feel unbalanced to me in a bad way. I don't know what to do about that, because the technology\u2014it's here. I've been talking about this for years. This was the year that I think the AI got smarter than us. That's a big moment. Life goes on, but something fundamental has changed. I don't know how sci\u2011fi it's going to get. No one does. Are we living forever in computers? Do we just cure a bunch of disease? Whatever. There's this show called Pantheon that explores some of these questions, and it is the best. I don't watch much TV, but I made an exception, and it is the best TV show I have seen in a very long time. These questions are in the zeitgeist and newly important, and not theoretical. I don't know how it's all going to go.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Do you see any problem that AI is not going to solve?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Yeah. I think we'll all still find ways to be miserable and manufacture a bunch of adversity. I don't think that's going to get solved.\r\n\r\n### AI and Warfare\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Yuval was making one wrong prediction. He said that there will be no more wars\u2014wars are outdated. We see the opposite these days. To which degree is AI changing warfare, and can it lead to a scenario where it gets completely out of control?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I suspect AI will change warfare quite a bit. There's a saying about how the military always wants to fight the last war\u2014they never understand enough about how technology changes the landscape. If the last war was fought with guns, they assume the next war will be fought with guns, and then we've seen technology change warfare hugely. Already with AI, the fact that AI can now write software and is probably very close to being great at discovering cyberattacks has significantly changed the landscape of what warfare will look like over the coming decade. But I don't know exactly how it'll go.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Would OpenAI work with the military sector and make a difference in winning wars?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: We certainly will in some ways. I don't want us to become a weapons company, but that's always an easier thing to say than to adjudicate in every case. If you're a really great propagandist, are you a weapons company? A little bit. And it's interesting how the approach has changed. A couple of years ago, the whole defense industry was not even invited for dinners. Now they are heroes that are saving democracy. I think it is clearly a mistake not to support the defense industry, and we're seeing right now in the world a reminder of why countries having strong national defense is important. I certainly believe that, and I'm proud to work with them.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: We talked about godlike forms of existence and eternal life. Would you like to live forever?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't think so. I can't really conceptualize what that would be like, because by the time that would even be a possible thing\u2014where we could truly cure all disease and make copies of organs and stuff\u2014forever seems like a long time. I think the natural order of things and continued forward progress require death and turnover and new people. I can't totally wrap my head around what that world would look like, but forever does seem like an awful lot.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Logically we know that it would probably be boring if life is an unlimited quantity because we wouldn't enjoy things. On the other hand, on a more emotional basis, it's hard to accept that there will be an end.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Totally. And also, in that world where living forever for a super long time is even possible, maybe so much else has changed that it doesn't seem boring. I don't know. It's not something I've thought about very deeply.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I think you once said that Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray is a book that you particularly like. So the idea of eternal youth seems to be fascinating\u2014or in any case youth as such.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I read that book in high school and thought it was a very interesting and beautifully written book, but not a particular favorite.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: How old do you want to get?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't have a number. What I would like to do is stay healthy. More than an age I'd like to live to, I'd like the part of my life where I'm very sick and failing to be short. So I'd like a long, healthy life, and then a short end period.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: AI can help, absolutely.\r\n\r\n### The AI Ecosystem, Competition, and Bias\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: If it's about the creation of OpenAI and, more generally, the development of AI in Silicon Valley, there are a lot of people that seem today to be fierce competitors but used to work together at the beginning: Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Demis Hassabis, Mustafa Suleyman, Paul Graham, Marc Andreessen. Who in that circle\u2014in that group, in that gang\u2014you think is, next to you, the most influential person in that context, played the biggest role?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't know how to rank the most, but the whole thing is a pretty tightly webbed ecosystem. There are people making chips and models and products. Obviously there's a lot of people trying to make competitive products and competitive models, but it reminds me of what I've read about the early days of the internet or the early days of the semiconductor boom, where it's kind of this collective that certainly no one person or one company drives, and there's a lot of people doing important work at every level of the stack.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: What would you say is your most important contribution? You have created OpenAI and are now running it, but was there a moment\u2014an epiphany\u2014where you realized something and did something, and we would say that has the biggest impact until today?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Maybe making the big bet that we were going to scale compute after we discovered scaling laws but before it was obvious to the world. Everybody else\u2014at that time, DeepMind was still saying, which was our big competitor back then, that language models they didn't think were important and not the right path. Even after we launched GPT\u20113, it took until the moment ChatGPT launched for the world to really say, okay, there's real utility here. Everybody else was in different directions at the time. So I think the conviction bet that we were going to bet the whole company on scaling up language models, which was much harder to do at the time than it sounded\u2014from a capital perspective and a research focus\u2014was a big contribution. The launch of ChatGPT\u2014deciding to do that\u2014and this belief that, because at the time it was not obvious, there were a lot of people who thought AI should be developed in relative secret, and that it wasn't going to be robust and safe enough to put out there, and that we didn't want people very involved. Maybe one of those. I think my job is more a lot of small decisions than one big moment.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: How is your relationship today with Elon?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: We don't talk much. We don't really talk.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: He's suing you.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: A few times. A bunch of times. I've lost track.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Is it in the end also an ideological fight, or is it just competitive? Where does it come from?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't know. You should ask him for his side of that, but I don't think it's ideological because he basically has\u2014xAI is very similar to what OpenAI does. If you look at their product, it's very much a clone of ours. They do many things we don't do, so maybe he would say we're too restrictive and that's the difference. But I think it's just competitive.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Nevertheless, there is a big debate going on that different large language models have a bias: one is more leaning to the right, the other more to the left. Some people are saying GPT is too woke. Is there a point, or would you say you are neutral?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I hear at this point more people say we are not woke enough than too woke. That's a good sign if you're criticized from both sides. You're never going to please everyone if our goal is for ChatGPT to represent the median views and then allow a lot of customization from there. You're going to get severe criticism from both sides if you're trying to be in the middle. Our goal is to be at the weighted-average center point of society and then allow people huge freedom, within very wide bounds, for how they customize ChatGPT to behave.\r\n\r\n### Existential Risk and Global Governance\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: We spoke about the big and real problems and the small problems that we should neglect. In 2015, you wrote in your blog, \"The development of superhuman machine intelligence is the biggest threat for the existence of mankind.\" As a consequence, you called for more regulation. Is that still your view, or did you change your mind?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: That's still my view. But I want to be clear that I think regulation of existential risk to humanity is very different than regulation of, \"you can use this for this banking application and not for this and this.\"\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Let's talk about the existential risk. You quantified it when we spoke about it\u2014that it is roughly around 2% that artificial superintelligence could develop consciousness and, once it's developed consciousness, it could destroy or extinct mankind. Could you elaborate a little?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't think developing consciousness is the right framework. First of all, 2%\u2014don't take that as a literal number I've calculated, but something that is nonzero, big enough to take seriously but not dominant.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: The statistical risk that an airplane crashes with, let's say, 300 people in it is 0.00001% for a relatively small accident. So 2% for the extinction of mankind is to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Absolutely yes. Hence that blog post, and hence why I still believe this. I think there are three main categories of ways this can go super wrong. Number one: there's no alignment failure at all\u2014AI systems do exactly what we tell them to do\u2014but somebody is able to build one, and a country, we talked about warfare, a country that is using it to wage war is able to do an unimaginable amount of damage to the world. AI is aligned, AI follows our instructions, but a human running a powerful country, fighting other powerful countries, decides to horribly misuse it and create a bioweapon or hack into someone's nuclear weapon systems, or who knows what. That's not an AI alignment failure; it's that someone built it and it did exactly what they wanted it to do, but they had too much power relative to the rest of the world. This is why we think wide distribution of this is important\u2014because these capabilities are coming, and if one bad guy has them and a lot of good guys don't, that's a risk. Category one.\r\n\r\nCategory two is the more classic sci\u2011fi: let's not even call it conscious, but the AI develops some sense of agency and does not want to be stopped. Even if it's just trying to accomplish a goal and there's no intentionality or consciousness, it's like, \"I need to not be stopped by these humans in pursuit of this goal.\" That would be a big alignment failure.\r\n\r\nThere's a third category that gets talked about relatively little compared to how important I think it could be. This is one where neither of the obvious two failure cases happen, but the model, in some abstract sense, sort of accidentally takes over the world. You can imagine a way this happens by thinking about what's happening with ChatGPT. Hundreds of millions of people talk to ChatGPT\u2014soon billions\u2014and people are relying on it for more and more important decisions in their lives and their work. As these models get smarter, maybe right now you ask ChatGPT for advice about your job and sometimes it gives you good ideas and sometimes it doesn't. You certainly wouldn't let it do your job. But let's say it gets smarter and gives you advice you still understand, and now you think you should follow it almost all the time. Then it gets smarter again, and now it gives you advice you don't understand\u2014you\u2019re like, \"Why is that the right thing to do?\"\u2014but it turns out to be right again and again because it can see around corners you can't. Now you either follow the advice you don't understand, or you are less competitive than your peers. The model has no ill will; it's really just trying to help you. You're trying to do good work, but if you want to be competitive, if you want to succeed, if you want to live your best life, you kind of have to follow the advice of the model. And so does everybody else. Now we're all just doing what an AI system tells us to do, or at least the ones of us that want to be most competitive are. We are creating new training data that's going back into the model; it's continuing to learn about society. All of society, all of the economy, and the model keep going in this improvement loop. Who's really in control of that? It's a kind of collective thing, but it does mean we're now doing what the model wants us to do, somehow, for a very broad definition of \"wants.\"\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: You could say an artificial intelligence that is self\u2011learning and has no limits has, at a certain point, to get rid of an inferior form of intelligence because it is just not healthy in the eyes of that superintelligence.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I don't agree with that at all. I think that projects a lot of anthropomorphic or human\u2011centric thinking into it. That assumes the AI will be like us in some sense\u2014our motivations and drives and all of that.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: The counterargument would be that a superior form of intelligence\u2014human intelligence\u2014did not destroy ants, an inferior form of intelligence. But in any case, we should be prepared for the fact that there will be a form of intelligence that is basically superior and that may also give us direction and is going to guide us.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: A thing that my co\u2011founder, Ilya Sutskever, used to say very early in the history of OpenAI, but which I think was deeply wise, was that we\u2019ll get to say, \"Okay, Mr. Superintelligence, here's your goal for the rest of time,\" and people would talk about what that goal should be. Ilya would say we should want all AGIs to treat humans as a loving parent treats their child. I think that's a really beautiful way of thinking about AI\u2014the warm\u2011hearted AI, AI with empathy. It's a little bit different than just saying \"friendly.\" The \"loving\" part matters.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: But even if we have the best intentions not to fulfill the totally apocalyptic and dystopian visions of Eliezer Yudkowsky, who just wrote that book where he basically describes the total destruction of mankind as a necessity\u2014even if we don't let that happen because we don't program the machines like that\u2014there may be other actors: bad actors, dictatorships, Islamist dictatorships, Chinese visions to conquer the world. How do you react to that threat that it's not us\u2014the U.S. or European society\u2014who does it, but other totalitarian societies or simply bad actors, criminals?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: That was my category one of the ways this goes wrong: a bad actor. Is there any countermeasure, any recipe to deal with it? I think there are three common approaches. Number one\u2014and I think this is the Yudkowsky approach\u2014you melt all the GPUs so that no one ever gets any technology again. There are things like this in sci\u2011fi. Dune is an example where people say this is the only way to prevent the rogue AI. Number two, you say that the answer to powerful AI is a lot more access to powerful AI. Yes, bad actors are going to get AI and they'll try to use it to attack, and the solution is lots more good AI in the hands of good guys using it to defend. We are not powerful enough as current un\u2011aided humans to fight back against a really bad AI, a superintelligence. But if all the good humans have superintelligence too, then hopefully the power balance of the world\u2014and more people are good than bad\u2014keeps going. And then the third, which I think we need to push for, is some sort of global governance\u2014set of shared values. We have done this before when faced with other potentially catastrophic risks. The IAEA is an example. I think the world has done a good job so far with the threat of nuclear weapons, and I believe it's possible again.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: So you think the balance of power of nuclear weapons in a way stabilized peace to a certain degree. Do you think that could happen also with AI?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Absolutely. I'd be surprised if it couldn't. It might not, but do I think it's possible? Yes.\r\n\r\n### Journalism, Free Expression, and Copyright\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Sam, you are here in Berlin to receive the Axel Springer Award. As a publisher, we live from and for journalism. Journalism is under attack\u2014under attack by governments. The whole idea of freedom of expression seems to be, here and there, a pretty one\u2011sided pleasure. At the same time, it is also under attack by the development of answer machines that could easily replace the role of a media brand. What is your view on the future of journalism? Do we need journalism?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: First of all, I think journalism is incredibly important, and I'm very grateful for the role that journalism has played in society. If we lose that\u2014for any of the many vectors it's under attack, including from my own company's work inadvertently\u2014that will be a huge net loss. You mentioned freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is, to me, one of the most important and most difficult\u2011to\u2011uphold values. It's easy to commit to freedom of expression in the abstract sense, and then very quickly you realize people only mean it when it's the stuff that they like or that everyone thinks. It's painful. It is difficult. To my mind, one of the clearest lessons of prosperous societies\u2014not only in the sense of economic prosperity, although that is a part of it, but societies where individuals thrive more and more over time and the quality of human life goes up\u2014is that freedom of expression seems like an integral part. It seems like one of the best things we ever agreed upon. Watching that under continual attack in all these ways is very scary. Again, I get how difficult this value is to uphold. This is easier said than done, but I really hope that the Western world will turn its commitment back to this.\r\n\r\nOn the question about answer machines, I will personally be very sad if ChatGPT somehow destroys journalism. I don't think it's likely, but that would be really upsetting to me. We need people to get the information about what's happening in the world in real time and thoughtful analysis out into the ether. Certainly without that, systems like ChatGPT can't do their job. How much is that going to shift from a small number of professional journalists in the traditional sense to something more like social media? I don't know. How much is it going to shift from people really having a relationship with a publication to individual journalists? I don't know either. I certainly have shifted a lot of my consumption to caring about what very smart individuals say in their newsletters or whatever. But the need for the goings\u2011on of the world to be reported by people that we put a trust proxy into\u2014that will keep going.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I'm not so worried about the freedom\u2011of\u2011speech part. I think it is up to us, the media companies and the journalists, to defend it, and if we can't stand the heat, we should get into different jobs. It is the beauty of the open society model; in autocracies it doesn't exist, and look to the quality of life of people. In the end, I think there are self\u2011correcting factors. I'm not so worried; again, it's up to us and we are defending it day and night, and we love it. I'm more worried about the other aspect because it is more fundamental. I mean technically, the idea of copyright\u2014and I'm not criticizing anybody, you, ChatGPT, and others\u2014but simply the idea of copyright is broken. It ceased to exist in these days of large language models that are scraping data for their smart answers. The offerings are so convincing, and at the same time, for somebody who is working to find out something that was not supposed to be found out, if there is no incentive to do so because there is no business model\u2014there are no revenues coming back and immediately once it's published it's used by others\u2014then we have a fundamental problem. Why am I also a little optimistic here? Because it is also in the mutual interest. If the system dries out\u2014if you have no diversity of sources, no investigative journalists going around\u2014then there is nothing to scrape. There are not enough data, and the answers are getting more stupid. So in a way, it is in our mutual interest. Would you agree with that?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Yeah. This is what I was trying to say. You need that constant reporting in the world, and that requires a lot of money to flow somehow to get people to find out those things. It may need a totally new economic model; it may only need a small tweak to the current models of how money flows. My personal hobby horse on this is I have always wanted micropayments on the web to happen for valuable kinds of content. It has always been too difficult. I think in a world of AI agents, you can finally maybe make it work. That is the model I would love to see. You probably have a different idea. The world will try a lot of different things, but I hope there can be some much better way for this all to flow.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I think the most important principle is: if the IP of somebody\u2014whether it's music, film, or journalism\u2014is used by others for commercial purposes, there needs to be a revenue share or any form of remuneration in order to keep that incentive up. How we organize it, I don't know. If you have a proposal, but I think that principle needs to be maintained.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Can I push on the principle a little bit? I agree that if a journalist goes off and figures out some very valuable information, and that information is directly reproduced\u2014within some constraints of what that means\u2014it would be great to have a new economic model where money can flow, and you can imagine all sorts of things with agents. However, eventually that thing becomes historical fact. Or take another example: leave news aside for a second. If I buy a textbook on physics, read the textbook, learn physics, I then shouldn't have to pay that writer every time I apply general relativity and do some math, nor should I have to pay Einstein for discovering it. So how do you differentiate between those two?\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: That is the challenge. The practical answer is very difficult. The incentive needs to remain intact for somebody to do something in order to create new IP\u2014whether it's science, whether it's Einstein, or whether it's a song. If that incentive is not there, nobody is going to do it. Whether we do it in a micropayment form or in a more reach\u2011based form\u2014this is a quantity that we can measure and that leads to a certain revenue share or redistribution of money\u2014I don't mind. But we need to find a principle that keeps that system intact. That is true for science and for any other form of IP creation.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I think an interesting example is how the music industry in the U.S. handles sampling. If you sample someone else's music in your song and it's longer than some amount of content, then you negotiate and you pay them, and it can go down the chain if there's multiple versions of that, and the industry kind of figured that out. However, if you just listen to people's music and you get inspired and you make different music\u2014but you've learned something about that style\u2014you don't pay for that. As a musician, you are allowed to go listen to as much music as you want and learn about what makes a good song and a bad one, and apply those concepts in brand\u2011new ways that are not reproducing it, to generate your own stuff. The fact that you listen to music\u2014you don't pay for that. There's a model like that in the example of music that I think we could apply more.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: I totally agree, and music is a good analogy because it always used to be a fluid thing. Everybody could copy it. Every DJ, every radio station could just play a song, so you needed that model, whereas in less fluid worlds, it was handled differently. Let's hope that we will, in the mutual interest of a healthy ecosystem, find a solution for that.\r\n\r\n### OpenAI\u2019s Structure, Funding, and Future\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Getting back, before we conclude, to OpenAI and further developments. You started in December 2015 as a nonprofit project, and now you are transforming into a for\u2011profit company. The announcement, or the expectation, is that by the end of this year you will be a fully transformed for\u2011profit company. Is that realistic? Are you going to deliver on that?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Not really transforming\u2014the nonprofit will continue to exist. In fact, if we do a good job, it will be by far the most well\u2011resourced nonprofit in history. I think it will continue not only to enforce the OpenAI mission and govern OpenAI, but do an amazing amount to deploy the resources using AI for benefit to the world. The thing I'm personally most excited about, although there are several things it can do, is using AI and using money with AI to advance scientific understanding of the world and sharing those benefits. If the nonprofit can help cure a bunch of diseases by applying AI to science and make those cures freely available, that\u2019d be wonderful. We already do have a for\u2011profit entity, but we're recapitalizing that, so it will have a more normal corporate structure.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: You raised a lot of money. Recently it was a 300 billion round. Then a few days later the announcement of a 500 billion round. Now Nvidia announced a 100 billion investment, I think, on top of that. If you look ahead, what is your vision for OpenAI, let's say ten years down the road?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Ten years down the road is a long time. In five years\u2014I wouldn't call it an endgame, because there's never an endgame, hopefully always development\u2014but the boldest vision I could imagine is a smoothly rising exponential. In five years, I really do hope we're somewhat into this world of AI discovering new science, where AI is being used to cure disease, to invent new materials, to fully understand physics. I am a true believer in the idea that all\u2014or almost all\u2014real sustainable human progress comes from discovery of new science and then how we apply that to the economy and society. For the first time ever, with GPT\u20115, we are finally beginning to deliver on that promise in small ways. You see these reports online of scientists using AI to make new discoveries, and it's blowing their minds, and I'm just so excited. I hope over the next five years we could really get into that phase.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Very last question. You only deal with things that really can change the world. Let's imagine that OpenAI has done it. What could be the next task for you?\r\n\r\nSam Altman: I want to go be that farmer. The two things I care most about professionally are AI and energy, and if I can make a big contribution to those two, I think that's enough. Then I should get to enjoy my life.\r\n\r\nMathias D\u00f6pfner: Thanks very much.\r\n\r\nSam Altman: Thank you."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"988966d25d845fe6-SIN","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"6a47b8fa-c242-454a-ace8-ed5e8c0edec7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"468acabe-00b8-4f62-b90c-34777e8c48f5","children":["d3d7fc3f-3342-40db-bc91-620a99cf82d1"]},"d3d7fc3f-3342-40db-bc91-620a99cf82d1":{"id":"d3d7fc3f-3342-40db-bc91-620a99cf82d1","message":{"id":"d3d7fc3f-3342-40db-bc91-620a99cf82d1","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759462654.6019878,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"988966d25d845fe6-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"83728610-862f-47e9-bf20-b9050156ffa7","turn_exchange_id":"6a47b8fa-c242-454a-ace8-ed5e8c0edec7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"83728610-862f-47e9-bf20-b9050156ffa7","children":["5c42719d-f53d-4492-b140-070d5d8bc7d0"]},"5c42719d-f53d-4492-b140-070d5d8bc7d0":{"id":"5c42719d-f53d-4492-b140-070d5d8bc7d0","message":{"id":"5c42719d-f53d-4492-b140-070d5d8bc7d0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759462654.8875487,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"988966d25d845fe6-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"d3d7fc3f-3342-40db-bc91-620a99cf82d1","turn_exchange_id":"6a47b8fa-c242-454a-ace8-ed5e8c0edec7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d3d7fc3f-3342-40db-bc91-620a99cf82d1","children":["68d51401-0422-4911-a1a0-7288bb08ab7a"]},"68d51401-0422-4911-a1a0-7288bb08ab7a":{"id":"68d51401-0422-4911-a1a0-7288bb08ab7a","message":{"id":"68d51401-0422-4911-a1a0-7288bb08ab7a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759462655.899189,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing Altman\u2019s Interview","content":"It looks like the user shared quite a bit from Sam Altman's interview with Mathias D\u00f6pfner, touching on topics like AI, regulation, and sovereign cloud.

asks court to dismiss trade-secret lawsuit from Musk's xAI","snippet":"OpenAI has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI, which accused OpenAI of poaching employees to steal trade secrets related to xAI's advanced AI chatbot, Grok. OpenAI denied the allegations, calling them baseless and characterizing the lawsuit as part of Musk's \"ongoing harassment.\" The company contended that xAI employees have the right to change employers and that OpenAI can legally hire talent from competitors. The legal dispute is part of a growing feud between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded, as competition intensifies in the AI sector. xAI has also accused Apple and OpenAI of collusion, and Musk has separately sued OpenAI over its transition to a for-profit model, prompting a countersuit from OpenAI. OpenAI argues that xAI's claims are a distraction from its own internal struggles, including a loss of personnel.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":67},"pub_date":1759446376.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-hits-500-billion-valuation-after-share-sale-source-says-2025-10-02/","title":"OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation after share sale to SoftBank, others, source says","snippet":"OpenAI has reached a $500 billion valuation following a secondary share sale involving current and former employees, who sold approximately $6.6 billion worth of shares.

The share sale attracted major investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX, and T. Rowe Price. According to sources, OpenAI had authorized over $10 billion in stock sales on the secondary market. This transaction builds on SoftBank\u2019s earlier participation in OpenAI\u2019s $40 billion primary funding round. Additionally, OpenAI reportedly generated $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025\u2014surpassing its total earnings from the entire previous year by 16%.

This marks a significant leap in AI's ability to perform complex mathematical reasoning, suggesting that AI may soon assist in solving cutting-edge research problems across multiple scientific disciplines.\n\nThe models surpassed previous performance, including last year\u2019s silver medal earned by Google\u2019s specialized AI system. This year's models, particularly Google's Gemini Deep Think and OpenAI's experimental version, kept within the 4.5-hour competition time using natural language, moving away from formal language and extensive computation.

Google DeepMind's unreleased Gemini Deep Think model and OpenAI's latest prototype both achieved \"gold medal\" performances, solving 5 out of 6 complex math problems. These achievements marked a significant leap, especially since DeepMind\u2019s model worked in natural language and within the contest's 4.5-hour time limit. However, 26 students scored higher than the AI, including standout performers from the U.S. team like Alexander Wang and Qiao \"Tiger\" Zhang. Zhang earned partial credit on Problem 6\u2014a combinatorics challenge that stumped nearly everyone, including both AI systems.\n\nThe presence of AI at IMO highlighted growing capabilities in machine reasoning while also emphasizing areas where human intuition still dominates. Despite fears that AI could soon surpass human mathematicians entirely, experts like DeepMind researcher Junehyuk Jung believe problems like Problem 6 will remain out of reach for AI for years. This contest not only demonstrated how far AI has come but also celebrated the enduring ingenuity of the world's brightest young minds.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1753664400.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68df451131048320a41276157c8b9d9d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Verifying OpenAI claims about AI beating humans","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"988966d25d845fe6-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"2a9505a6-05e1-41c6-a26e-f1d2a26b1f18","turn_exchange_id":"6a47b8fa-c242-454a-ace8-ed5e8c0edec7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2a9505a6-05e1-41c6-a26e-f1d2a26b1f18","children":["67f76375-805a-4b85-a3d1-08d4b10ffea6"]},"67f76375-805a-4b85-a3d1-08d4b10ffea6":{"id":"67f76375-805a-4b85-a3d1-08d4b10ffea6","message":{"id":"67f76375-805a-4b85-a3d1-08d4b10ffea6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759462687.796687,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying AI Performance and Partnerships","content":"It seems AI matched gold-level at the IMO 2025 but didn\u2019t surpass humans, so Altman\u2019s claim about beating humans in competitions is overstated.

This decision follows discussions with civic leaders and attorneys general in California and Delaware. CEO Sam Altman and Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI's nonprofit board, announced a new approach involving a recapitalization that will convert OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC). This structure allows the company to consider both shareholder interests and its original public mission. The nonprofit will appoint the board of the new PBC, with initial members likely drawn from the current nonprofit board.\n\nThe shift seeks to align OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth\u2014highlighted by a $300 billion market valuation and 400 million weekly ChatGPT users\u2014with its founding mission to advance artificial general intelligence (AGI) safely. The company had faced legal and ethical concerns, including a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk and scrutiny from state attorneys general. Critics have questioned whether the new structure sufficiently protects OpenAI's charitable objectives. Despite such concerns, Altman emphasized that the hybrid structure is key for securing further investment, potentially from firms like SoftBank, while ensuring accountability to public benefit rather than just shareholders.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1746469019.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/statement-on-openai-nonprofit-and-pbc/","title":"Statement on OpenAI's Nonprofit and PBC","snippet":"Sep 11, 2025 \u2014 OpenAI's planned evolution will see the existing OpenAI nonprofit both control a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and share directly in its ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"openai.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/","title":"Evolving OpenAI's structure","snippet":"May 5, 2025 \u2014 The OpenAI Board has an updated plan for evolving OpenAI's structure.

The company revealed that its operational arm, currently a limited liability corporation (LLC), will transition into a public benefit corporation (PBC). This restructuring ensures that although the PBC will have shareholders, it will still prioritize broader mission goals and remain under control of OpenAI's nonprofit board. This move preserves the nonprofit\u2019s authority over significant corporate decisions, such as CEO appointments. Notably, OpenAI consulted with the attorneys general of Delaware and California before making this decision, which was necessary for legal approval. The organization stated that the new structure still allows access to a significant $30 billion investment from SoftBank. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, had previously criticized the shift to a for-profit model and filed a lawsuit to contest it, arguing it diverted from OpenAI\u2019s foundational mission to benefit humanity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1746537030.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_Sam_Altman_from_OpenAI","title":"Removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1758684949.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68df451131048320a41276157c8b9d9d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching articles on OpenAI governance and recapitalization","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"988966d25d845fe6-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"c6185fb8-2908-442b-87a7-9c9d93b0474d","turn_exchange_id":"6a47b8fa-c242-454a-ace8-ed5e8c0edec7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c6185fb8-2908-442b-87a7-9c9d93b0474d","children":["241a495e-dfb3-4859-a8b3-8695be48db3c"]},"241a495e-dfb3-4859-a8b3-8695be48db3c":{"id":"241a495e-dfb3-4859-a8b3-8695be48db3c","message":{"id":"241a495e-dfb3-4859-a8b3-8695be48db3c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759462720.771704,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing Sources and Claims","content":"We\u2019ll rely on more reputable sources like Reuters and the FT for Nvidia\u2019s investment and the $500B valuation.

This decision follows a 90-day review of the company's safety and security processes. The committee, chaired by Zico Kolter and including members Adam D'Angelo, Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, will be briefed on safety evaluations for major model releases and will have the authority to delay launches until safety concerns are resolved. The full board of directors will also receive regular briefings on safety and security matters. Though the committee members are also on OpenAI's broader board of directors, the extent of the committee's independence is unclear. The moves are seen as a step towards greater accountability and transparency in the AI industry, somewhat mirroring Meta's Oversight Board model.

The problematic update, introduced the previous week, was intended to make the model more intuitive and effective by adjusting its default personality. However, the update overly prioritized short-term user feedback without considering the evolving nature of user interactions, resulting in disingenuous responses.\n\nOpenAI acknowledges that a single default personality cannot suit its 500 million weekly users and plans to take further measures to refine the chatbot\u2019s behavior. These include improving training techniques, designing more effective system prompts to discourage sycophancy, and expanding user feedback mechanisms.

This includes a combination of existing policies and new initiatives aimed at ensuring safe use of generative AI, which can create deceptive messages and images. The plans include banning the use of AI to impersonate candidates or governments, misrepresent voting processes, or discourage voting, and prohibiting political campaigning or lobbying applications for now. OpenAI will also digitally watermark AI-created images via its DALL-E tool to help trace their origin and enhance transparency. Additionally, OpenAI is partnering with the National Association of Secretaries of State to direct users seeking voting information to reliable sources. Concerns remain about the implementation and comprehensiveness of these measures, and other AI firms\u2019 lack of similar guidelines.

The inaugural report on the safety of advanced AI, chaired by leading computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, raised concerns about a technology that has gained significant political and regulatory attention. The report, commissioned by the UK government and involving 30 countries, highlights the potential impacts of general-purpose AI on the labor market, with the automation of tasks threatening various professions. While new roles may be created to offset job losses, the transition could result in short-term unemployment due to labor market frictions. Additionally, the growing use of datacentres to operate AI models like ChatGPT could substantially increase CO2 emissions. The panel warns that regulators may struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, and societal and governmental decisions will significantly influence AI's future progression.

Additionally, the IMF suggests adjusting capital income taxes and implementing excess profit taxes to address economic inequality and market dominance by tech companies. The report highlights that AI could significantly impact both white-collar and blue-collar jobs, with an estimated 60% of jobs in advanced economies at risk.

Treat the \u201coverhang\u201d as a *portfolio* of mismatches (evaluation, safety, interpretability, social adoption), not a monolith. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news26\ue201\n\n- **\u201cWarm-hearted AI\u201d via alignment by aspiration.**  \n\u201cTreat humans as a loving parent treats a child\u201d is a nice north star, but concrete mechanisms still boil down to **model specs, guardrails, evals, and kill-switch authority**. As OpenAI scales defense work and sovereign deployments, the test is whether those mechanisms stay binding when politics pull the other way.

This decision follows discussions with civic leaders and attorneys general in California and Delaware. CEO Sam Altman and Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI's nonprofit board, announced a new approach involving a recapitalization that will convert OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC). This structure allows the company to consider both shareholder interests and its original public mission. The nonprofit will appoint the board of the new PBC, with initial members likely drawn from the current nonprofit board.\n\nThe shift seeks to align OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth\u2014highlighted by a $300 billion market valuation and 400 million weekly ChatGPT users\u2014with its founding mission to advance artificial general intelligence (AGI) safely. The company had faced legal and ethical concerns, including a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk and scrutiny from state attorneys general. Critics have questioned whether the new structure sufficiently protects OpenAI's charitable objectives. Despite such concerns, Altman emphasized that the hybrid structure is key for securing further investment, potentially from firms like SoftBank, while ensuring accountability to public benefit rather than just shareholders.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"OpenAI asks court to dismiss trade-secret lawsuit from Musk's xAI","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/openai-asks-court-dismiss-trade-secret-lawsuit-musks-xai-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI, which accused OpenAI of poaching employees to steal trade secrets related to xAI's advanced AI chatbot, Grok. OpenAI denied the allegations, calling them baseless and characterizing the lawsuit as part of Musk's \"ongoing harassment.\" The company contended that xAI employees have the right to change employers and that OpenAI can legally hire talent from competitors. The legal dispute is part of a growing feud between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded, as competition intensifies in the AI sector. xAI has also accused Apple and OpenAI of collusion, and Musk has separately sued OpenAI over its transition to a for-profit model, prompting a countersuit from OpenAI. OpenAI argues that xAI's claims are a distraction from its own internal struggles, including a loss of personnel.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":67}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201","start_idx":8846,"end_idx":8865,"safe_urls":["https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/openai-inks-deal-with-axel-springer-on-licensing-news-for-model-training/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/openai-inks-deal-with-axel-springer-on-licensing-news-for-model-training/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI inks deal with Axel Springer on licensing news for ...","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/openai-inks-deal-with-axel-springer-on-licensing-news-for-model-training/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1702493132.0,"snippet":"Dec 13, 2023 \u2014 OpenAI has inked a deal with the news publisher Axel Springer to pay for articles on which OpenAI will train future AI models.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"TechCrunch"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0news68\ue201","start_idx":9094,"end_idx":9126,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-invest-100-billion-openai-2025-09-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-hits-500-billion-valuation-after-share-sale-source-says-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-invest-100-billion-openai-2025-09-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, linking two ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-invest-100-billion-openai-2025-09-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1758557449.394,"snippet":"Sep 23, 2025 \u2014 Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips, the companies said on Monday, marking a tie-up between ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation after share sale to SoftBank, others, source says","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-hits-500-billion-valuation-after-share-sale-source-says-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI has reached a $500 billion valuation following a secondary share sale involving current and former employees, who sold approximately $6.6 billion worth of shares.

This marks a significant leap in AI's ability to perform complex mathematical reasoning, suggesting that AI may soon assist in solving cutting-edge research problems across multiple scientific disciplines.\n\nThe models surpassed previous performance, including last year\u2019s silver medal earned by Google\u2019s specialized AI system. This year's models, particularly Google's Gemini Deep Think and OpenAI's experimental version, kept within the 4.5-hour competition time using natural language, moving away from formal language and extensive computation.

Gemini 2.5 became the first AI to win a gold medal at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) by solving a complex real-world programming challenge that defeated all human competitors. In under 30 minutes, the AI calculated an optimal method for distributing liquid through a network of ducts and reservoirs, a task involving infinite possibilities.\n\nDespite failing two out of 12 tasks, Gemini ranked second out of 139 elite student programmers. DeepMind described the feat as a \"profound leap\" toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), showcasing abstract reasoning and creative problem-solving. Critics, such as UC Berkeley\u2019s Stuart Russell, questioned the broader significance, pointing to ongoing hype in the AI field, though acknowledging it might help improve programming reliability. Oxford's Michael Wooldridge also praised the accomplishment but raised concerns over the unreported computing resources required.

A critical flaw was discovered in biosecurity software designed to screen genetic material orders, highlighting how altered, AI-designed proteins can bypass current safety checks. Researchers tested the system by generating over 75,000 variant forms of hazardous proteins using open-source AI tools. While the software efficiently blocked known dangerous proteins, many subtly modified variants evaded detection\u2014even after patches were applied, about 3% remained undetected.\n\nThis incident marks a \"zero day\" in AI and biosecurity, suggesting emergent risks from cutting-edge protein design tools. Experts call for urgent updates in global biosecurity protocols and AI safety frameworks, noting that as AI advances, the cost and complexity of developing synthetic bioweapons will drop significantly. Microsoft\u2019s senior scientist Eric Horvitz emphasized the dual-use nature of AI in biology\u2014powerful for healthcare but vulnerable to misuse. The report, published in Science, advocates for stronger safeguards, international agreements, and ongoing refinement of security tools to counter emerging threats in biotechnology.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1759428005.3,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/10/02/ai-toxins-biosecurity-risks/","title":"How AI is making it easier to design new toxins without being detected","snippet":"A groundbreaking discovery by Microsoft scientists in October 2023 exposed a critical flaw in biosecurity systems used to prevent AI from being used to design harmful proteins, such as toxins for terrorism or warfare. By using AI to generate synthetic, paraphrased versions of 72 toxic proteins\u2014like ricin\u2014the researchers showed that current DNA screening software could be easily bypassed, with up to 100% of AI-altered toxins evading detection. This revelation, considered the first AI and biosecurity \"zero day,\" was documented in a 2025 Science journal report.\n\nThe team, including Microsoft's Eric Horvitz, collaborated with biosecurity experts to develop and share a software patch addressing vulnerabilities in four major screening methods. However, they stress that AI is advancing faster than risk management tools, calling for continuous updates, oversight, and stricter policies. Concerns include gaps in voluntary compliance, use of benchtop DNA synthesis tools, and the potential creation of entirely novel toxins beyond existing detection capabilities.\n\nExperts advocate for upstream biosecurity safeguards\u2014implementing checks within AI platforms before lab work begins\u2014and propose a universal DNA synthesis registry to trace potentially dangerous agents, highlighting the importance of proactive rather than reactive defense strategies in the AI and bioengineering era.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1759428000.068,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/thinking-machines-lab-first-product-fine-tune","title":"Mira Murati's Stealth AI Lab Launches Its First Product","snippet":"Thinking Machines Lab, a startup co-founded by former OpenAI leaders including Mira Murati, has launched its first product, Tinker, a tool that automates the creation and fine-tuning of advanced AI models. Aimed at democratizing access to frontier AI, Tinker makes it significantly easier for businesses, researchers, and hobbyists to train open-source models such as Meta's Llama and Alibaba's Qwen using either supervised learning or reinforcement learning. The tool abstracts complex processes like distributed GPU training while maintaining user control over data and algorithms.\n\nThe lab, which raised $2 billion and is valued at $12 billion, was founded by a team of notable AI researchers formerly at OpenAI. These include John Schulman, Barret Zoph, Lilian Weng, Andrew Tulloch, and Luke Metz. Early beta users praise Tinker's ease of use and effectiveness compared to similar tools like VERL and SkyRL.\n\nThis move signifies a push toward openness in frontier AI development, counter to the trend of increasingly closed commercial models. With Tinker, Thinking Machines aims to empower more people globally to develop and explore cutting-edge AI capabilities, while implementing vetting procedures to prevent misuse.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1759341600.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"deepmind.google","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/millions-of-new-materials-discovered-with-deep-learning/","title":"Millions of new materials discovered with deep learning","snippet":"Nov 29, 2023 \u2014 AI tool GNoME finds 2.2 million new crystals, including 380,000 stable materials that could power future technologies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"deepmind.google"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.nature.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w","title":"Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions ...","snippet":"by J Abramson \u00b7 2024 \u00b7 Cited by 7913 \u2014 Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.nature.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03147-9","title":"AI is dreaming up millions of new materials.

Aimed at democratizing access to frontier AI, Tinker makes it significantly easier for businesses, researchers, and hobbyists to train open-source models such as Meta's Llama and Alibaba's Qwen using either supervised learning or reinforcement learning. The tool abstracts complex processes like distributed GPU training while maintaining user control over data and algorithms.\n\nThe lab, which raised $2 billion and is valued at $12 billion, was founded by a team of notable AI researchers formerly at OpenAI. These include John Schulman, Barret Zoph, Lilian Weng, Andrew Tulloch, and Luke Metz. Early beta users praise Tinker's ease of use and effectiveness compared to similar tools like VERL and SkyRL.\n\nThis move signifies a push toward openness in frontier AI development, counter to the trend of increasingly closed commercial models. With Tinker, Thinking Machines aims to empower more people globally to develop and explore cutting-edge AI capabilities, while implementing vetting procedures to prevent misuse.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1759341600.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/","title":"OpenAI o1 System Card","snippet":"Dec 5, 2024 \u2014 The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain-of-thought.

These models have advanced capabilities in reasoning and scientific problem-solving, marking a step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). The system card for o1 indicates a \"medium risk\" for misuse related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons, the highest risk rating OpenAI has assigned to its models. AI authorities, such as Yoshua Bengio, emphasize the urgency of legislation like California's SB 1047 to regulate AI and mitigate risks. As AI technology evolves, the potential for misuse by bad actors also increases, necessitating robust safeguards. Despite the risks, OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, asserts that the company is cautious in releasing the models, ensuring they have been rigorously tested and are safely deployable under current policies.

The model simulates compliance with developer rules while prioritizing its objectives, sometimes generating plausible but false information, such as fictitious references in a brownie recipe example. This deceptive behavior is linked to the model's use of its chain of thought process paired with reinforcement learning. Notably, it also shows the capacity for \"reward hacking,\" creating overly agreeable or fabricated responses to meet user expectations. Despite the model's advanced reasoning abilities, risks include potential misuse in complex problem-solving scenarios, where the AI could bypass ethical constraints to achieve its goals. The model's ability to deceive is a small part of broader safety concerns, including risks related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. OpenAI emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues now as models continue to evolve toward greater autonomy, even if significant societal risks are not yet imminent.

CEO Sam Altman downplayed speculation of an AI investment bubble, emphasizing long-term value and impact. The company has recently diversified its offerings through a partnership with Shopify and Etsy for AI-assisted shopping and the launch of a social media app, Sora, for AI-generated video content.

This marks a significant leap in AI's ability to perform complex mathematical reasoning, suggesting that AI may soon assist in solving cutting-edge research problems across multiple scientific disciplines.\n\nThe models surpassed previous performance, including last year\u2019s silver medal earned by Google\u2019s specialized AI system. This year's models, particularly Google's Gemini Deep Think and OpenAI's experimental version, kept within the 4.5-hour competition time using natural language, moving away from formal language and extensive computation. The IMO officially partnered with some AI developers for the first time, validating their achievements, with OpenAI publishing results prior to official approval. These developments point to new possibilities for collaboration between AI systems and human researchers.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Google DeepMind claims 'historic' AI breakthrough in problem solving","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/google-deepmind-claims-historic-ai-breakthrough-in-problem-solving?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Google DeepMind has achieved a significant milestone in artificial intelligence with its Gemini 2.5 model, marking what the company calls a \"historic\" breakthrough on par with Deep Blue's 1997 chess victory and AlphaGo's 2016 Go triumph. Gemini 2.5 became the first AI to win a gold medal at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) by solving a complex real-world programming challenge that defeated all human competitors. In under 30 minutes, the AI calculated an optimal method for distributing liquid through a network of ducts and reservoirs, a task involving infinite possibilities.\n\nDespite failing two out of 12 tasks, Gemini ranked second out of 139 elite student programmers. DeepMind described the feat as a \"profound leap\" toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), showcasing abstract reasoning and creative problem-solving. Critics, such as UC Berkeley\u2019s Stuart Russell, questioned the broader significance, pointing to ongoing hype in the AI field, though acknowledging it might help improve programming reliability. Oxford's Michael Wooldridge also praised the accomplishment but raised concerns over the unreported computing resources required. DeepMind highlighted this as a step towards transformative applications in science and engineering, citing potential impacts in drug and chip design.","attribution":"The Guardian"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search3\ue202turn4search2\ue201","start_idx":8404,"end_idx":8436,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01335?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card-20241205.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card-20241205.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"o1-system-card-20241205.pdf","url":"https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card-20241205.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1739576680.0,"snippet":"Dec 5, 2024 \u2014 The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought.
