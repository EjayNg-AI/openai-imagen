of April 2025, Singapore has not formally recognized Palestine as a sovereign state.\ue204 \ue203However, the government has indicated a conditional readiness to do so.\ue204\ue206\n\n### Singapore's Position on Palestinian Statehood\n\n\ue203In July 2024, Foreign Minister Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan stated in Parliament that Singapore is \"prepared in principle\" to recognize the State of Palestine.\ue204 \ue203This recognition would occur at an \"appropriate time,\" with the key consideration being whether such a move would contribute to peace and a negotiated two-state solution \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n### Conditions for Recognition\n\n\ue203Singapore's stance is contingent upon several factors:\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Effective Governance**: \ue203There must be a Palestinian government that exercises effective control over its territories and can represent all Palestinians.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Renunciation of Terrorism**: \ue203The Palestinian leadership must categorically reject terrorism.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Recognition of Israel**: \ue203The Palestinian government must accept Israel's right to exist \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203These conditions reflect Singapore's commitment to a peaceful resolution and the establishment of two states living side by side in peace and security.\ue204\ue206\n\n### Diplomatic Engagement and Support\n\n\ue203While formal recognition is pending, Singapore maintains a Representative Office in Ramallah and collaborates with the Palestinian Authority (PA) on capacity-building initiatives.\ue204 \ue203Through the Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP), Singapore has trained over 750 Palestinian officials in areas such as diplomacy, water management, economic management, and urban planning.\ue204 \ue203Additionally, Singapore offers fully funded scholarships for Palestinian officials to pursue postgraduate studies in local universities \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n### International Context\n\n\ue203Globally, over 140 UN member states have recognized Palestine.\ue204 \ue203However, key nations, including the United States and several European Union members, have not extended formal recognition.\ue204 \ue203Singapore's cautious approach aligns with its broader foreign policy principles, emphasizing adherence to international law and the importance of direct negotiations between the parties involved.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203In summary, Singapore supports the two-state solution and is prepared to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state when conditions conducive to lasting peace are met.\ue204\ue206
