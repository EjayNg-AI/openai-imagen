Despite the unchanged price, the device is anticipated to include significant upgrades, including the A19 chip, MagSafe charging, and Apple\u2019s latest in-house wireless and modem chips. This will align its processing power with the base iPhone 17, although potential GPU differences could lead to slight performance variations.\n\nRumors indicate a possible announcement date of February 17, 2026, though there's no confirmation yet on display changes like the transition to Dynamic Island. Earlier leaks suggested such a shift, but newer information points to no display redesign, preserving distinctions between the 17e and the flagship iPhone 17. The device enters a competitive landscape poised to go head-to-head with the upcoming Google Pixel 10a and launch ahead of Samsung's Galaxy S26 event. While the iPhone 16e was well received, its pricing was a point of criticism; however, network incentives have helped maintain its appeal as the most accessible way to experience iOS.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770652800.0,"attribution":"www.t3.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techradar.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/siri-will-officially-become-apples-biggest-ever-embarrassment-if-these-new-ios-27-delay-rumors-are-true","title":"Siri will officially become Apple's biggest-ever embarrassment if these new iOS 27 delay rumors are true","snippet":"Apple is facing increasing criticism over persistent delays in the AI-driven overhaul of Siri, first announced in June 2024 and intended to launch with iOS 18. As of February 2026, key features have yet to materialize, with new reports indicating further delays into the releases of iOS 26.5 in May and iOS 27 in September. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the most delayed features include voice-based in-app control and Siri's ability to access personal data for contextual tasks, such as locating and playing a podcast from an old message.\n\nThis two-year lag is particularly frustrating for users\u2014especially those who upgraded to the iPhone 16 in anticipation of these capabilities. The delay also highlights how far behind Siri remains compared to Google\u2019s AI-powered assistant, Gemini, which has already delivered similar features. Apple has reportedly partnered with Google to integrate Gemini into Siri, but even with this collaboration, progress is slow. The situation is being dubbed one of Apple\u2019s longest-running failures, topping past missteps like Apple Maps and the AirPower charger. With substantial expectations still unmet, skepticism is mounting about whether Siri's promised transformation will arrive on time\u2014or at all.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770894866.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-timeline-hardware-ai-device-launch-jony-ive-iyo-2026-2","title":"OpenAI just gave a clearer timeline for shipping its mystery AI device","snippet":"OpenAI has provided a clearer timeline for its upcoming and highly secretive AI hardware device, developed in collaboration with renowned designer Jony Ive. According to a court filing made on Monday, the company does not expect to ship the product before the end of February 2027. This timeline was detailed by OpenAI VP Peter Welinder amid an ongoing legal dispute with the startup Iyo over the \"io\" trademark. Previously, OpenAI anticipated unveiling the device in the second half of 2026.\n\nDue to the trademark conflict, OpenAI confirmed it no longer plans to use the \"io\" branding for the device and has removed branding references and promotional content related to Ive's involvement.

will officially become Apple's biggest-ever embarrassment if these new iOS 27 delay rumors are true","snippet":"Apple is facing increasing criticism over persistent delays in the AI-driven overhaul of Siri, first announced in June 2024 and intended to launch with iOS 18. As of February 2026, key features have yet to materialize, with new reports indicating further delays into the releases of iOS 26.5 in May and iOS 27 in September. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the most delayed features include voice-based in-app control and Siri's ability to access personal data for contextual tasks, such as locating and playing a podcast from an old message.\n\nThis two-year lag is particularly frustrating for users\u2014especially those who upgraded to the iPhone 16 in anticipation of these capabilities. The delay also highlights how far behind Siri remains compared to Google\u2019s AI-powered assistant, Gemini, which has already delivered similar features. Apple has reportedly partnered with Google to integrate Gemini into Siri, but even with this collaboration, progress is slow. The situation is being dubbed one of Apple\u2019s longest-running failures, topping past missteps like Apple Maps and the AirPower charger. With substantial expectations still unmet, skepticism is mounting about whether Siri's promised transformation will arrive on time\u2014or at all.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1770894866.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-sees-200-billion-market-cap-wipeout-as-stock-slides-on-ai-fears-88917cc0","title":"Apple sees $200 billion market-cap wipeout as stock slides on AI fears","snippet":"Apple experienced a significant setback with a $202 billion drop in market capitalization following a 5% decline in its stock price. The decline was spurred by concerns over delays in upgrading its Siri virtual assistant with advanced AI capabilities. A Bloomberg report indicated testing issues may push features originally slated for the iOS 26.4 update in March to iOS 26.5 in May or even iOS 27 in September. A key problem is Siri's heavy reliance on OpenAI's ChatGPT instead of Apple's own AI infrastructure. Apple also partners with Google's Gemini AI models. These delays, combined with rising memory and storage costs due to AI-related demand, are fueling investor anxiety. Despite these challenges, analysts note Apple is managing cost pressures better than some competitors. Apple\u2019s future stock performance is seen as highly dependent on its successful AI feature rollout in 2026. Analysts emphasize Apple\u2019s prioritization of user privacy and seamless integration, which may also be contributing to the delays.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1770934560.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-siri-not-ready-yet-apple-may-push-google-gemini-powered-ai-features-to-ios-26-5-or-later/articleshow/128239130.cms","title":"New Siri not ready yet: Apple may push Google Gemini-powered AI features to iOS 26.5 or later","snippet":"Apple has postponed the release of major AI features initially planned for iOS 26.4, following internal testing that showed the updated Siri is still not fully ready, according to Bloomberg.

A recent leak indicates that both the M5 Pro and M5 Max may use the same base chip, a strategy similar to Nvidia\u2019s GPU manufacturing approach, where chips are binned\u2014sorted by quality\u2014for different performance tiers. While this suggests that M5 Pro Macs might use lower-binned versions of the M5 Max chips, Apple maintains high manufacturing standards, and such a move could help improve availability and cost-effectiveness. If true, this represents a major shift in Apple\u2019s chip strategy, as prior Pro and Max chips (like M3 and M4 versions) used distinct silicon.

The Vision Pro, launched in February 2024 for $3,499, generated initial excitement but failed to maintain momentum due to limited mainstream content and competition from more affordable rivals like Meta's Quest. Apple is now prioritizing two types of smart glasses. The first model, N50, which pairs with an iPhone and lacks its own display, is targeted for unveiling next year and release by 2027. A second, more advanced version with an integrated display is planned for 2028, but Apple is accelerating its development to compete with Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses. These upcoming Apple glasses will rely heavily on AI and voice interaction. Apple has not publicly commented on the shift. The announcement comes amid broader industry competition in the AI and wearable tech space, as Meta and Google push ahead with their own device innovations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1759357976.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.hardwarezone.com.sg","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/mobile/wearables/apple-vision-pro-m5-review-singapore-price-buy","title":"Apple has improved the Vision Pro, but its days could be ...","snippet":"30 Oct 2025 \u2014 The only negative thing about the new Dual Knit band is that it messes up your hair even more.

The AirTag retains its original pricing\u2014$29 for a single unit and $99 for a four-pack.\n\nThe new model also boasts a 50% louder speaker and a Bluetooth chip with extended range capabilities. Precision Finding is now supported on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models running watchOS 26.2.1 or later. Compatibility with existing AirTag accessories is maintained.\n\nApple emphasizes privacy and security with the new AirTag, noting that it does not store location history and uses end-to-end encryption within the Find My network. It includes protections against unwanted tracking, such as rotating Bluetooth identifiers and cross-platform alerts. Apple collaborated with Google in 2023 to establish an industry standard aimed at addressing tracking concerns.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1769437938.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.goodhousekeeping.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/electronics/a70142602/apple-airtag-2-release-2026/","title":"Apple's New AirTag 2 Is Here-And the OG Just Dropped to 30% Off","snippet":"Apple has launched the second-generation AirTag, the AirTag 2, enhancing the Bluetooth tracker\u2019s capabilities since its original 2021 debut.

Additionally, the Share Item Location feature has been upgraded to let users securely share item locations with airlines, supported by 36 airline partners, with 15 more expected to join soon.\n\nDespite the advancements in AirTag 2, the original AirTag remains a valuable option\u2014especially due to its current 30% discount. A four-pack offers even more savings, bringing the price per unit under $18.

The Vision Pro, launched in February 2024 for $3,499, generated initial excitement but failed to maintain momentum due to limited mainstream content and competition from more affordable rivals like Meta's Quest. Apple is now prioritizing two types of smart glasses. The first model, N50, which pairs with an iPhone and lacks its own display, is targeted for unveiling next year and release by 2027. A second, more advanced version with an integrated display is planned for 2028, but Apple is accelerating its development to compete with Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses. These upcoming Apple glasses will rely heavily on AI and voice interaction. Apple has not publicly commented on the shift. The announcement comes amid broader industry competition in the AI and wearable tech space, as Meta and Google push ahead with their own device innovations.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Apple's 2026 and 2027 Product Roadmap: Foldable iPhone, iPhone 18 Pro, M5 Macs, and More -

Despite the unchanged price, the device is anticipated to include significant upgrades, including the A19 chip, MagSafe charging, and Apple\u2019s latest in-house wireless and modem chips. This will align its processing power with the base iPhone 17, although potential GPU differences could lead to slight performance variations.\n\nRumors indicate a possible announcement date of February 17, 2026, though there's no confirmation yet on display changes like the transition to Dynamic Island. Earlier leaks suggested such a shift, but newer information points to no display redesign, preserving distinctions between the 17e and the flagship iPhone 17. The device enters a competitive landscape poised to go head-to-head with the upcoming Google Pixel 10a and launch ahead of Samsung's Galaxy S26 event. While the iPhone 16e was well received, its pricing was a point of criticism; however, network incentives have helped maintain its appeal as the most accessible way to experience iOS.","attribution":"T3"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"MacRumors"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view5\ue201","start_idx":6680,"end_idx":6697,"safe_urls":["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Apple\u2019s

The decline was spurred by concerns over delays in upgrading its Siri virtual assistant with advanced AI capabilities. A Bloomberg report indicated testing issues may push features originally slated for the iOS 26.4 update in March to iOS 26.5 in May or even iOS 27 in September. A key problem is Siri's heavy reliance on OpenAI's ChatGPT instead of Apple's own AI infrastructure. Apple also partners with Google's Gemini AI models. These delays, combined with rising memory and storage costs due to AI-related demand, are fueling investor anxiety. Despite these challenges, analysts note Apple is managing cost pressures better than some competitors. Apple\u2019s future stock performance is seen as highly dependent on its successful AI feature rollout in 2026. Analysts emphasize Apple\u2019s prioritization of user privacy and seamless integration, which may also be contributing to the delays.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1770934560.0,"attribution":"www.marketwatch.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/apple-earnings-stock-results-iphone-ai/card/tim-cook-touts-unique-apple-ai-strategy-iTCN6VuD83qwTfb6cJX1","title":"Tim Cook touts unique Apple AI strategy","snippet":"Regarding Apple's AI strategy, Cook shared that the company is pursuing a dual approach of splitting workloads between on-device AI and cloud services.

As of February 2026, key features have yet to materialize, with new reports indicating further delays into the releases of iOS 26.5 in May and iOS 27 in September. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the most delayed features include voice-based in-app control and Siri's ability to access personal data for contextual tasks, such as locating and playing a podcast from an old message.\n\nThis two-year lag is particularly frustrating for users\u2014especially those who upgraded to the iPhone 16 in anticipation of these capabilities. The delay also highlights how far behind Siri remains compared to Google\u2019s AI-powered assistant, Gemini, which has already delivered similar features. Apple has reportedly partnered with Google to integrate Gemini into Siri, but even with this collaboration, progress is slow. The situation is being dubbed one of Apple\u2019s longest-running failures, topping past missteps like Apple Maps and the AirPower charger. With substantial expectations still unmet, skepticism is mounting about whether Siri's promised transformation will arrive on time\u2014or at all.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1770894866.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investors.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-siri-release-delayed-again/","title":"Hopes Fade For Early 2026 Apple Siri Release. Apple Stock Drops.","snippet":"Apple's highly anticipated upgrade to its Siri digital assistant, dubbed Siri 2.0, has been delayed again, missing its expected March 2026 release window. Initially planned for mid-2025, Siri 2.0\u2019s development was hindered by technical challenges, despite Apple partnering with Google to fast-track progress. Latest reports suggest a staggered release, with an initial May launch followed by additional features rolling out in September\u2014likely coinciding with the iPhone 18 Pro launch. This delay has disappointed investors and caused Apple stock to drop 5%, closing at $261.73.\n\nAnalyst Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI maintained an \u201coutperform\u201d rating for Apple, citing the company\u2019s focus on data privacy and seamless integration as reasons for the delayed deployment of personalized Siri features. He projects the Siri upgrade could be introduced at the WWDC event in June. Despite the stock dip, Apple remains technically positioned within a cup base pattern with a buy point at $288.62, possibly forming a lower entry-level handle now.\n\nThe delay in Siri 2.0 underscores Apple\u2019s ongoing challenges in catching up to AI leaders, raising questions about how it will meet investor demand in the fast-evolving digital assistant landscape.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1770934440.0,"attribution":"www.investors.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.apple.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.apple.com/sg/newsroom/2025/06/apple-intelligence-gets-even-more-powerful-with-new-capabilities-across-apple-devices/","title":"Apple Intelligence gets even more powerful with new ...","snippet":"10 Jun 2025 \u2014 Developers can now access the Apple Intelligence on-device foundation model to power private, intelligent experiences within their apps.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.apple.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/","title":"Introducing Apple Intelligence for iPhone, iPad, and Mac","snippet":"10 Jun 2024 \u2014 Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.

The agreement, expected to cost Apple around $1 billion annually, marks a temporary solution as Apple works to develop its own AI systems. This move comes in response to Siri\u2019s past struggles to match the complexity and versatility of rivals like Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nThe deal is said to be distinct from previous talks about embedding Gemini directly into Siri as a chatbot and will not integrate Google's AI-powered search into Apple operating systems. Apple had previously announced delays in AI updates to Siri until 2026 and recently restructured its AI leadership, placing Mike Rockwell in charge of Siri development after CEO Tim Cook lost confidence in John Giannandrea. Meanwhile, competitors like Google and Amazon have significantly enhanced their voice assistants with AI, increasing pressure on Apple to catch up.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1762373748.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/814654/apple-intelligence-google-gemini-ai-siri","title":"Apple is planning to use a custom version of Google Gemini for Apple Intelligence","snippet":"Apple reportedly plans to enhance its AI-upgraded Siri using a custom version of Google's Gemini AI model, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman.

The custom Gemini model, featuring 1.2 trillion parameters, will run on Apple\u2019s Private Cloud Compute servers, while Apple will continue using its own models for some Siri functions. Previously, Apple considered other AI partners like OpenAI and Anthropic before choosing Google. Though this deal does not include integrating Gemini's chatbot directly into Siri, Apple is open to future third-party AI integrations. The upgraded Siri is scheduled for release in spring 2026. Apple also continues to invest in its own AI technologies, suggesting they may ultimately replace Gemini in the future.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1762373553.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/12/tech/apple-picks-google-to-power-ai-for-long-delayed-siri-overhaul/","title":"Apple picks Google to power AI for long-delayed Siri overhaul","snippet":"Apple has announced a multi-year partnership with Google to integrate Google\u2019s Gemini AI models and cloud technology into its products, including a long-awaited revamp of the Siri voice assistant. The collaboration aims to enhance Apple Intelligence features with more personalization while maintaining Apple\u2019s privacy standards. This marks a significant development in Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which has faced delays and technical issues. In response to the announcement, Alphabet's market value briefly rose, nearing $4 trillion. Though financial details weren't disclosed, Bloomberg had previously reported Apple might pay about $1 billion annually for access to Gemini.\n\nThe initiative represents a strategic pivot for Apple, which has been under scrutiny for lagging in AI advancements. Analyst Dan Ives called the move a crucial turning point that validates Google\u2019s AI capabilities and revives Apple\u2019s AI roadmap. Apple also recently reshuffled its AI leadership, appointing former Google and Microsoft exec Amar Subramanya as VP of AI. Despite potential antitrust concerns over the deepening Apple-Google collaboration\u2014already under scrutiny for its search engine partnership\u2014the companies reiterate their commitment to innovation and user privacy in the AI domain.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1768240572.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomsguide.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/apple-intelligence/siri-is-finally-getting-smarter-and-apple-is-set-to-lean-on-google-gemini-for-it","title":"The new Siri will reportedly 'lean' on Gemini - here's what that means for you","snippet":"Apple is preparing a major upgrade to Siri, expected to roll out in March 2026 as part of its broader AI expansion.

This strategic collaboration allows Siri to deliver more intelligent and faster responses while maintaining Apple\u2019s signature privacy and user interface. Despite the Google technology behind the scenes, users won\u2019t see any outward Google branding or features.\n\nIn addition to the new Siri, Apple plans to launch a smart home display with speaker and wall-mount options, refreshing its HomePod mini and Apple TV products as part of this next-generation AI integration.

On its Q1 FY2026 earnings call, Tim Cook explicitly described Apple as \u201cintegrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue201\n\nAt WWDC25 (June 2025), Apple doubled down on \u201ceverywhere in the OS\u201d integration\u2014announcing new Apple Intelligence features spanning iPhone/iPad/Mac/Watch/Vision Pro, including:\n- **Live Translation**\n- **Visual Intelligence updates** (acting on what\u2019s on your screen)\n- **Image Playground** and **Genmoji** enhancements\n- **Shortcuts** gaining direct access to Apple Intelligence models \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n**Developer direction matters here:** Apple is explicitly trying to make AI part of the OS platform layer by giving third-party apps access to the **on-device model** via a first-party framework (\u201cFoundation Models framework\u201d), including **tool calling** support. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view2\ue201\n\n## 2) The architectural \u201cline in the sand\u201d: on-device first, then Private Cloud Compute\nApple\u2019s AI messaging is unusually rigid about **where computation happens** and **what happens to data**.\n\n### On-device is the default\nApple\u2019s privacy materials describe on-device processing as the \u201ccornerstone,\u201d claiming deep integration into iPhone/iPad/Mac \u201cthroughout your apps\u201d so it can use personal context **without collecting your personal data**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue201\n\n### Private Cloud Compute (PCC) is the escalation path\nWhen requests exceed device capacity, Apple Intelligence can route to **Private Cloud Compute** (PCC), where Apple claims:\n- only **task-relevant** data is sent,\n- data is **not stored** and **not accessible to Apple**, and\n- independent experts can **inspect** the server software. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn1view1\ue201\n\nWhat\u2019s distinctive (and Apple keeps emphasizing) is *verifiability*: Apple\u2019s security research blog describes a **transparency log** for code running on PCC, **public binary inspection**, and devices refusing to talk to servers unless the software is publicly logged. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \nApple also published follow-up materials about enabling external researchers and a **security guide** for PCC. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201\n\n## 3) Model training stance: \u201cwe don\u2019t train on your private data\u201d\nApple repeats (in both privacy and ML research channels) that it **does not use users\u2019 private personal data or interactions to train its foundation models**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn1view3\ue201\n\nThat commitment is core to Apple\u2019s OS-AI positioning: they\u2019re trying to make \u201cAI everywhere\u201d feel compatible with Apple\u2019s privacy brand\u2014*even if it costs them speed of iteration versus cloud-first competitors.*\n\n## 4) Partnerships: Apple is *not* \u201cgoing it alone\u201d for Siri\nTwo parallel tracks are now visible:\n\n### (A) OpenAI (ChatGPT) as an optional add-on\nWhen Apple introduced Apple Intelligence (June 2024), Apple announced **ChatGPT integration across Apple platforms**\u2014i.e., Apple can hand off certain requests to ChatGPT with user awareness/permission. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue201\n\nThis fits Apple\u2019s philosophy: keep the OS experience consistent, but allow a \u201cbest tool for the job\u201d plug-in when needed.\n\n### (B) Google (Gemini) as a foundation for the next Siri\nThe bigger shift is Siri. Reuters reported (Nov 5, 2025) that Apple planned to use Google\u2019s **Gemini** model (reported as **1.2T parameters**) to help power a Siri revamp\u2014framed as a **stopgap** until Apple\u2019s own systems are ready. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view3\ue201\n\nOn the Jan 29, 2026 earnings call, Cook also explicitly said Apple is \u201cvery happy with the collaboration with Google.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1view5\ue201\n\n**Interpretation (not speculation):** Apple is effectively saying \u201cAI is OS-native,\u201d but also admitting\u2014by action\u2014that Siri\u2019s next leap may require outside frontier models. That\u2019s a meaningful strategic tell.\n\n## 5) The near-term roadmap (and the awkward part): Siri is slipping again\nRecent reporting says Apple\u2019s biggest \u201cagentic OS\u201d promise\u2014**a more personal, context-aware Siri that can act across apps and understand what\u2019s on-screen**\u2014has faced internal-testing snags.\n\nBloomberg (Feb 11, 2026) reported features originally targeted for **iOS 26.4 (March 2026)** may be spread into **iOS 26.5 (May 2026)** and even **iOS 27 (September 2026)**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view6\ue201  \nThe Verge summarized the same shift and added that Apple is also testing other AI pieces (like a web-search tool) in that cycle. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view5\ue201\n\n## 6) What Apple\u2019s \u201clatest position\u201d amounts to (a blunt take)\n1) **Apple is serious about OS-level AI**\u2014they\u2019re building first-party frameworks, shipping cross-OS features, and turning privacy architecture (PCC) into a differentiator. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n2) **Apple is also in catch-up mode on assistant capability**, and the \u201cGemini for Siri\u201d track is hard evidence they\u2019re prioritizing *shipping* over purity. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view3\ue202turn1view5\ue201  \n3) The biggest risk to the strategy isn\u2019t \u201cAI vision,\u201d it\u2019s **execution latency**: the longer Siri\u2019s agentic capabilities slip, the more Apple Intelligence risks being perceived as *nice OS features* rather than the \u201cOS becomes AI\u201d moment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view6\ue202turn3view5\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a **decision tree** of what Apple is likely to do next (2026\u21922027) depending on whether Siri 26.5 lands cleanly, how much Gemini is used, and whether Apple opens Apple Intelligence to additional third-party model providers.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Latest reporting on Apple\u2019s AI direction\ue202turn0news35,turn0news37,turn0news39,turn2news34,turn2news35,turn2news37\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn1view5\ue202turn3view3\ue201","start_idx":366,"end_idx":416,"safe_urls":["https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/","https://www.apple.com/sg/newsroom/2025/06/apple-intelligence-gets-even-more-powerful-with-new-capabilities-across-apple-devices/","https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/01/29/apple-aapl-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/","https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-use-googles-ai-model-run-new-siri-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-11-05/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Apple](https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Privacy -
