Ursula von der Leyen announced EU defense spending proposals, and Zelenskyy suggested initial steps for peace, including prisoner release and missile bans. Trump, expected to propose global peace plans in Congress, indicated a commitment to the minerals deal, viewing it as a deterrent to further aggression from Putin.
