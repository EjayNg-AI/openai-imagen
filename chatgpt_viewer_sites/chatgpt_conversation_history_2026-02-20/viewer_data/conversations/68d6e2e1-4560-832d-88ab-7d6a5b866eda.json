Ladies and gentlemen, last year I stood at this podium and I showed this map. This map shows the curse of Iran\u2019s terror axis. This axis threatened the peace of the entire world. It threatened the stability of our region and the very existence of my country, Israel. Iran was rapidly developing a massive nuclear weapons program and a massive ballistic missile program. These were meant not only to destroy Israel; they were meant also to threaten the United States and blackmail nations everywhere.\n\nFrom Gaza, it dispatched waves of Hamas terrorists. They stormed into Israel on October 7th and committed acts of unspeakable savagery. From Lebanon, Hezbollah launched thousands of missiles and rockets at our cities, terrorizing our citizens. In Syria, the murderous dictator Assad hosted Iran\u2019s forces, tightening a noose of death around our throats. In Yemen, the Houthis launched ballistic missiles at Israel while choking global trade at the mouth of the Red Sea.\n\n### A Year of Counterstrikes\n\nSo what\u2019s happened over the past year? We\u2019ve hammered the Houthis, including yesterday. We crushed the bulk of Hamas\u2019s terror machine. We crippled Hezbollah, taking out most of its leaders and much of its weapons arsenal. You remember those beepers, the pagers? We paged, and believe me, they got the message, and thousands of terrorists dropped to the ground. We destroyed Assad\u2019s armaments in Syria. We deterred Iran\u2019s Shiite militias in Iraq. And most importantly, above anything else that we did in this past year and this past decade, we devastated Iran\u2019s atomic weapons and ballistic missile programs.\n\nSo here\u2019s where things stand today. Half the Houthi leadership in Yemen\u2014gone. In Gaza\u2014gone. Nasrallah in Lebanon\u2014gone. The Assad regime in Syria\u2014gone. Those militias in Iraq are still deterred, and their leaders, if they attack Israel, will also be gone. And as for Iran\u2019s top military commanders and its top atomic bomb scientists\u2014well, they\u2019re gone too.\n\n### Operation Rising Lion and the US Partnership\n\nIsrael\u2019s 12-day war with Iran, which I renamed Operation Rising Lion\u2014it\u2019s from the Bible\u2014will go down in the annals of military history. Our daring pilots neutralized Iran\u2019s missile defenses and took control of the skies over Tehran. And you saw this: Israeli fighter pilots and American B\u20112 pilots bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment sites. I want to thank President Trump for his bold and decisive action. President Trump and I promised to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and we delivered on that promise.\n\nWe removed an existential threat to Israel, indeed a mortal threat to the civilized world. We lifted a dark cloud that could have claimed millions and millions of lives. But, ladies and gentlemen, we must remain vigilant. We must remain absolutely clear\u2011minded and vigilant. We must not allow Iran to rebuild its military nuclear capacity. Iran\u2019s stockpiles of enriched uranium must be eliminated, and tomorrow UN Security Council sanctions on Iran must be snapped back.\n\n### Finishing the War in Gaza\n\nThanks to the resolve of our people, the courage of our soldiers, and the bold decisions we took, Israel rebounded from its darkest day to deliver one of the most stunning military comebacks in history. But we\u2019re not done. We\u2019re not done yet. The final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City. They vow to repeat the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again, no matter how diminished their forces. That is why Israel must finish the job. That is why we want to do so, and that is why we want to do so as fast as possible.\n\n### Remembering October 7 and Why We Fight\n\nLadies and gentlemen, much of the world no longer remembers October 7th, but we remember. Israel remembers October 7th. On that day\u2014well, I\u2019ll tell you, you can remember October 7th too. You see this large pin here? It\u2019s a QR code. What I ask you to do is hold up your phone, zoom in, and you too will see why we fight and why we must win. It\u2019s all in here.\n\nOn October 7th, Hamas carried out the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. They slaughtered 1,200 innocent people, including over 40 Americans and foreign nationals from dozens of countries represented here. They beheaded men. They raped women. They burnt babies alive. They burnt babies alive in front of their parents. What monsters. And these monsters took more than 250 people hostage. Those included Holocaust survivors, grandmothers, and their grandchildren\u2014who takes hostage grandmothers and grandchildren? Hamas. So far we\u2019ve brought home 207 of these hostages. But 48 still remain in the dungeons of Gaza. Twenty of them are alive\u2014starved, tortured, deprived of any daylight, deprived of humanity. These are the names of the 20 living hostages: Ghee and Serve Berman, brothers; and David Kuno, another pair of brothers; Guy\u2014you saw the picture of Amed, forced to dig his own grave.\n\n### A Direct Address to the Hostages and Their Captors\n\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, I want to do something I\u2019ve never done before. I want to speak from this forum directly to those hostages through loudspeakers. I\u2019ve surrounded Gaza with massive loudspeakers connected to this microphone in the hope that our dear hostages will hear my message. I\u2019ll say it first in Hebrew and then in English.\n\nOur brave heroes, this is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter and we will not rest until we bring all of you home.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thanks to special efforts by Israeli intelligence, my words are now also being streamed live to the cell phones of Gazans. So to the remaining Hamas leaders and to the jailers of our hostages, I now say: Lay down your arms. Let my people go. Free the hostages\u2014all of them, the whole 48. Free the hostages now. Do it and you will live. If you don\u2019t, Israel will hunt you down.\n\nIf Hamas agrees to our demands, the war could end right now. Gaza would be demilitarized. Israel would retain overriding security control, and a peaceful civilian authority would be established by Gazans and others committed to peace with Israel.\n\n### The War\u2019s Endgame and Why It Matters to You\n\nAnd of course you understand that the war in Gaza has affected every Israeli, but I\u2019m sure there are people in New York or in London or in Melbourne and elsewhere who are probably thinking, What does all of this have to do with me? And the answer is: everything, because our enemies are your enemies. So let\u2019s do something else. First, a UN pop quiz. Raise your hand if you know the answer. Here\u2019s the first question: Who shouts \u201cDeath to America\u201d? Is it Iran, Hamas, the Houthis\u2014or all of the above? All of the above\u2014correct. All of the above.\n\nSecond question: Who has murdered Americans and Europeans in cold blood? Is it al\u2011Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, or all of the above? Correct again\u2014all of the above. So here\u2019s the point I wanted to make. Our enemies hate all of us with equal venom. They want to drag the modern world back to the past, to a dark age of violence, fanaticism, and terror. I think many of you are already feeling, in your own societies, the radical Islamist surge. You know\u2014I\u2019m sure you do\u2014you know, deep down, that Israel is fighting your fight.\n\nSo I want to tell you a secret. Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel\u2019s superb intelligence services that have, time and again, prevented terrorist attacks in their capitals\u2014time and again saving countless lives. General George Keegan, former head of U.S. Air Force Intelligence, once said that if the United States had to gather on its own the intelligence that Israel gives it, we would have to establish five CIAs\u2014five CIAs. This past June, when Israel struck Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, German Chancellor Merz admitted the truth. He said, \u201cIsrael is doing the dirty work for all of us.\u201d President Trump understands better than any other leader that Israel and America face a common threat. He showed the world that when Iran and its proxies murder Americans, take Americans hostage, shout \u201cDeath to America,\u201d burn American flags, and try to assassinate the President of the United States\u2014not once but twice\u2014there is a price to pay for all that.\n\n### Appeasement, Lawfare, and Moral Clarity\n\nBut regrettably, many leaders who are represented in this hall send a very different message. Sure, in the days immediately following October 7th many of them supported Israel, but that support quickly evaporated when Israel did what any self\u2011respecting nation would do in the wake of such a savage attack. We fought back. Now just imagine\u2014just sit back for a second and imagine\u2014an attack against America proportionate to the attack against Israel on October 7th. Imagine a terror regime dispatching thousands of terrorists to invade the United States. They massacre 40,000 Americans. They take 10,000 Americans hostage. What do you think America would do? You think America would leave that regime standing? You don\u2019t think that\u2014no way, not a chance. The United States would wipe out that terror regime and ensure that such savagery would never threaten America again. This is precisely what Israel is doing in Gaza. We\u2019re wiping out the terror regime of Hamas and ensuring that this savagery will never threaten Israel again. That\u2019s what we are doing. That\u2019s what any self\u2011respecting government would do.\n\nYet\u2014and it\u2019s a yet that I\u2019m sorry to say here\u2014over time many world leaders buckled. They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies, and antisemitic mobs. There\u2019s a familiar saying: When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Well, for many countries here, when the going got tough, you caved. And here\u2019s the shameful result of that collapse: For much of the past two years, Israel has had to fight a seven\u2011front war against barbarism, with many of your nations opposing us. Astoundingly, as we fight the terrorists who murdered many of your citizens, you are fighting us. You condemn us, you embargo us, and you wage political and legal warfare\u2014it\u2019s called lawfare\u2014against us. I say to the representatives of those nations: This is not an indictment of Israel. It\u2019s an indictment of you. It\u2019s an indictment of weakened leaders who appease evil rather than support a nation whose brave soldiers guard you from the barbarians at the gate. They\u2019re already penetrating your gates. When will you learn? You can\u2019t appease your way out of jihad, and you won\u2019t escape the Islamist storm by sacrificing Israel. To overcome that storm, you have to stand with Israel. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing. As the prophets of Israel foretold in the Bible, you\u2019ve turned good into evil and evil into good.\n\n### Answering the Genocide and Starvation Lies\n\nNow, I want to drill down on this. Take the false charge of genocide. Israel is accused of deliberately targeting civilians. Ladies and gentlemen, the opposite is true. The head of urban warfare studies, Colonel John Spencer\u2014perhaps the world\u2019s greatest expert on urban warfare\u2014says Israel is applying more measures to minimize civilian casualties than any military in history. And because we\u2019re doing that, the ratio of non\u2011combatant to combatant casualties is less than two to one in Gaza. That\u2019s an astoundingly low ratio, lower than NATO\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, especially when you consider that Gaza is one of the most densely populated urban areas on Earth. It has hundreds of miles of terror tunnels underground, countless terror towers above ground, and thousands of terrorists embedded in the tunnels and in these towers in civilian areas. If you want to see what measures Israel takes to avoid civilian casualties in this war, just look at what we\u2019re doing now in Gaza City, the last Hamas stronghold, one of the two last strongholds. For three weeks Israel dropped millions of leaflets, sent millions of text messages, and made countless phone calls urging civilians to leave Gaza City before our military moves in. At the same time, Hamas implants itself in mosques, schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, and streets to force those civilians not to leave\u2014to stay in harm\u2019s way\u2014and it often threatens them at gunpoint if they try to do so. For Israel, every civilian casualty is a tragedy. For Hamas, it\u2019s a strategy. Hamas uses civilians as human shields and as props in its sick propaganda war against Israel\u2014a propaganda war that the Western media buys hook, line, and sinker.\n\nNow, despite Hamas threats, close to 700,000 Gazans\u2014almost three\u2011quarters of a million\u2014have already heeded our calls and moved to safe zones. Now, I want to ask you a simple, logical question: Would a country committing genocide plead with the civilian population it is supposedly targeting to get out of harm\u2019s way? When we tell them \u201cGet out\u201d\u2014if we wanted to commit genocide\u2014we\u2019re trying to get them out, and Hamas is trying to keep them in. This charge is so baseless. The comparison to genocide\u2014wholesale slaughter of populations\u2014did the Nazis ask the Jews to leave? \u201cKindly leave, go out.\u201d You want me to name all the genocidal leaders of history? Just go one by one\u2014did anyone do this? Did they say, \u201cGet out so we can come in\u201d? Of course not. So the truth has been turned on its head. Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization whose charter calls for the murder of all Jews on the planet\u2014this genocidal organization is given a pass; it\u2019s barely mentioned. While Israel, which does everything it can to get civilians out of harm\u2019s way, is put in the dock. What a joke. You want to hear another one? Israel is accused of deliberately starving the people of Gaza, when Israel is deliberately feeding the people of Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, Israel has let into Gaza more than two million tons of food and aid\u2014that\u2019s one ton of aid for every man, woman, and child in Gaza, nearly 3,000 calories per person per day. Some starvation policy. If there are Gazans who don\u2019t have enough food, it\u2019s because Hamas is stealing it. Hamas steals it, hoards it, and sells it at exorbitant prices to fund its war machine. Last month\u2014even the UN, not exactly a supporter of Israel; you\u2019re supposed to laugh, by the way\u2014even the UN admitted that Hamas and other armed groups looted 85 percent of the trucks. That\u2019s why you have deprivation. Those who peddle the blood libels of genocide and starvation against Israel are no better than those who peddled blood libels against the Jews in the Middle Ages, when they falsely accused us of poisoning wells, spreading plague, and using the blood of children to bake Passover matzahs. Antisemitism dies hard. In fact, it doesn\u2019t die at all. It just keeps coming back with its libelous lies, refurbished, regurgitated over and over again.\n\nAnd I want to tell you something else. These antisemitic lies have consequences. In recent months, Jews have been assaulted in Canada, Austria\u2014or rather Australia\u2014Britain, France, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Here in America, an elderly Holocaust survivor was burned to death in Colorado. And a beautiful young couple from the Israeli Embassy in Washington was brutally gunned down right in front of the Holocaust Museum there. Thankfully, President Trump\u2019s administration is forcefully fighting the scourge of antisemitism, and every government here should follow its lead. But many do the opposite. They actually reward the worst antisemites on Earth. This week the leaders of France, Britain, Australia, Canada, and other countries unconditionally recognized a Palestinian state. They did so after the horrors committed by Hamas on October 7th\u2014horrors praised on that day by nearly 90 percent of the Palestinian population. Let me say that again: nearly 90 percent of Palestinians supported the attack on October 7th. Not only supported it\u2014they celebrated it. They danced on the rooftops. They threw candies. That\u2019s true both in Gaza and in Judea and Samaria\u2014the West Bank, as you call it\u2014and it\u2019s the way they celebrated another horror. Rooftops, they cheered, they threw candy. You know what message the leaders who recognized the Palestinian state this week sent to the Palestinians? It\u2019s a very clear message: murdering Jews pays off. Well, I have a message for these leaders: When the most savage terrorists on Earth are refusing your decision, you didn\u2019t do something right\u2014you did something wrong, horribly wrong. Your disgraceful decision will encourage terrorism against Jews and against innocent people everywhere. It will be a mark of shame on all of you.\n\n### The Real Obstacle to Peace\n\nBut\u2014\u201cBut wait a minute, Mr. Prime Minister,\u201d they tell me\u2014\u201cwait a minute, we believe in a two\u2011state peace with a Palestinian state.\u201d There\u2019s only one problem with that: the Palestinians don\u2019t believe in this solution. They never have. They don\u2019t want a state next to Israel; they want a Palestinian state instead of Israel. And that\u2019s why every time they were offered a Palestinian state but were required to end the conflict with Israel and recognize the Jewish state, every time over the decades, they turned it down. And that is why every time they were given territory, they used it to attack us. In fact, they effectively had a Palestinian state in Gaza. So what did they do with that state? Peace? Coexistence? No. They attacked us time and time again. Totally unprovoked, they fired rockets into our cities. They murdered our children. They turned Gaza into a terror base from which they committed the October 7th massacre.\n\nSo here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: The persistent Palestinian rejection of a Jewish state in any boundary is what has driven this conflict for over a century. It is still driving it. It\u2019s not the absence of a Palestinian state; it\u2019s the presence and existence of a Jewish state. And I find it amazing\u2014amazing\u2014that the foreign chanceries and ministries and all those who pontificate about this, the leaders, how can they not see this basic truth when it is repeated again and again and again? And I want to say something else. This rejection of a Jewish state not only applies to Hamas; it also applies to the so\u2011called moderate Palestinian Authority. You should know that the Palestinian Authority pays terrorists to slay Jews. The more Jews the terrorists slay, the more the Palestinian Authority pays. The Palestinian Authority names its government buildings, its public squares, its institutions after the mass murderers of Jews, whom they glorify as martyrs. They pay and glorify not just the killers of Jews but also killers of Christians\u2014Christians like Taylor Force, an American veteran who was brutally murdered in Israel by Palestinian terrorists.\n\nBut again I hear from the Western leaders; they tell me, \u201cThe PA promised us it will reform, and I know this time, Prime Minister, it will be different.\u201d Yeah, right. We\u2019ve heard these promises for decades. They always promise; they never deliver, because, you see, the Palestinian Authority is corrupt to the core. They haven\u2019t held elections in 20 years. They use the same textbooks as Hamas\u2014exactly the same textbooks. They teach their children to hate Jews and destroy the Jewish state. And Christians don\u2019t fare much better. When Bethlehem\u2014the birthplace of Jesus\u2014was under Israeli control, 80 percent of its residents were Christians, but since the PA took control, that number has dwindled to under 20 percent.\n\nThese are the intolerant fanatics who perpetrated and supported the October 7th massacre. Giving the Palestinians a state one mile from Jerusalem after October 7th is like giving al\u2011Qaeda a state one mile from New York City after September 11th. This is sheer madness. It\u2019s insane. And we won\u2019t do it.\n\n### Israel\u2019s Consensus and Resolve\n\nSo here\u2019s another message to those Western leaders: Israel will not allow you to shove a terrorist state down our throats. We will not commit national suicide because you don\u2019t have the guts to face down a hostile media and antisemitic mobs demanding Israel\u2019s blood. And I want you to grasp something else, which is also distorted in the media. I say this not only in my name or in the name of my government, but on behalf of all the people of Israel. Last year there was a vote in the Knesset, our parliament, on whether or not to oppose the imposition of a Palestinian state. You want to guess what the results were? Out of 120 members of our parliament, 99 voted against and only nine supported. That\u2019s over 90 percent. It\u2019s not a fringe group. It\u2019s not the Prime Minister who himself is extreme or he\u2019s held hostage by extreme parties to his right. It\u2019s over 90 percent of Israelis. My opposition to a Palestinian state is not simply my policy or my government\u2019s policy; it is the policy of the State and the people of the State of Israel.\n\nWestern leaders may have buckled under the pressure, and I guarantee you one thing: Israel won\u2019t. Israel\u2019s victories over the Iranian terror axis have opened up possibilities for peace that were unthinkable two years ago.\n\n### New Paths to Peace: Syria and Lebanon\n\nTake Syria. For decades, the very idea of peace between Israel and Syria seemed unimaginable. Well, no more. Today we have begun serious negotiations with the new Syrian government. I believe an agreement can be reached that respects Syria\u2019s sovereignty and protects both Israeli security and the security of the minorities in the region, including the Druze minority. From the founding of Israel, Druze and Jews have been brothers in arms. We have fought together. We\u2019ve bled together. We\u2019ve built our lives together. When I was a young commander in Israel\u2019s special forces, my own life was saved by the invaluable advice given to me by a great friend, Salem Shoofey, a heroic Druze IDF veteran. And that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t sit idly by, nor could Israel sit idly by, while the Druze were being slaughtered by Daesh, and I instructed our forces to stop the massacre\u2014which they promptly did.\n\nPeace between Israel and Lebanon is possible as well. I call on the Lebanese government to also begin direct negotiations with Israel. I commend it for its declared aim to disarm Hezbollah, but we need more than words. If Lebanon takes genuine and sustained action to disarm Hezbollah, I\u2019m sure we can achieve a sustainable peace. Of course, until that happens, we will take whatever action we need to defend ourselves and to maintain the conditions of the ceasefire that was established in Lebanon. Our goal is not merely to monitor actions but to prevent them from violating the ceasefire and attacking us at any time. But I\u2019m sure that if the Lebanese government persists in its goal of disarming, peace will come very speedily and very readily.\n\n### A Broader Regional Peace and a Vision for Iran\n\nVictory over Hezbollah has made peace possible with our two Arab neighbors in the north. Victory over Hamas will make peace possible with nations throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Our victory would lead to a dramatic extension and expansion of these historic Abraham Accords, which President Trump brokered between Arab leaders and myself five years ago. And I took note\u2014as I\u2019m sure you did too\u2014of the encouraging words spoken here by the President of Indonesia. This is the country with the largest Muslim population of all nations, and it\u2019s also a sign of what could come. Forward\u2011looking Arab and Muslim leaders know that cooperating with Israel will provide them with groundbreaking Israeli technologies, including in medicine and science, in agriculture and water, in defense and AI, and so many other fields. I believe that in the coming years, the Middle East will look dramatically different. Many of those who wage war on Israel today will be gone tomorrow. Brave peacemakers will take their place. And nowhere\u2014nowhere\u2014will this be more true than in Iran. The long\u2011suffering Iranian people will regain their freedom. They will make Iran great again. And our two ancient peoples\u2014the people of Israel and the people of Iran\u2014will restore a friendship that will benefit the entire world.\n\n### History, Resolve, and Closing\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the horrors that happened on one dark day\u2014October 7th\u2014those horrors happened countless times during the centuries of my people\u2019s exile among the nations. Jewish blood was cheap. Jews were killed with impunity. We had to beg others to defend us. The rise of Israel did not mean that the attempts to destroy us would end; it meant that we could fight back against those attacks, and that is exactly what Israel has done since October 7th. Our sons and daughters fought like lions. Our brave soldiers donned their uniforms and rushed into battle. They were armed with the dreams of the hundred generations of Jews who came before them: the dream of living as a free people in the Land of Israel, our beloved homeland for more than 3,000 years; the dream of living in our own independent state; the dream of having an army to defend ourselves; and the dream of being a light unto the nations, a beacon of progress, ingenuity, innovation, for the benefit of all humanity. On October 7th, the enemies of Israel tried to extinguish that light. Two years later, the resolve of Israel and the strength of Israel burn brighter than ever. With God\u2019s help, that strength and that resolve will lead us to a speedy victory and to a brilliant future of prosperity and peace. Thank you very much."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9855019f497181ef-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4251b65c-0ca1-4b1d-8cad-89f57009161b","children":["a30172ba-07b1-4816-9952-e9172a81c645"]},"b43e8caf-5d68-4eff-8128-1e8a30400bf0":{"id":"b43e8caf-5d68-4eff-8128-1e8a30400bf0","message":{"id":"b43e8caf-5d68-4eff-8128-1e8a30400bf0","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758913561.597,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["FULL REMARKS: Israeli PM Netanyahu addresses world leaders at United Nations in NYC\n\n---\n\n### Opening and Iran\u2019s Terror Axis\n\nThe families of our dear hostages languishing in the dungeons of Gaza. Ladies and gentlemen, last year I stood at this podium and I showed this map. This map shows the curse of Iran\u2019s terror axis. This axis threatened the peace of the entire world. It threatened the stability of our region and the very existence of my country, Israel. Iran was rapidly developing a massive nuclear weapons program and a massive ballistic missile program. These were meant not only to destroy Israel; they were meant also to threaten the United States and blackmail nations everywhere.\n\nFrom Gaza, it dispatched waves of Hamas terrorists. They stormed into Israel on October 7th and committed acts of unspeakable savagery. From Lebanon, Hezbollah launched thousands of missiles and rockets at our cities, terrorizing our citizens. In Syria, the murderous dictator Assad hosted Iran\u2019s forces, tightening a noose of death around our throats. In Yemen, the Houthis launched ballistic missiles at Israel while choking global trade at the mouth of the Red Sea.\n\n### A Year of Counterstrikes\n\nSo what\u2019s happened over the past year? We\u2019ve hammered the Houthis, including yesterday. We crushed the bulk of Hamas\u2019s terror machine. We crippled Hezbollah, taking out most of its leaders and much of its weapons arsenal. You remember those beepers, the pagers? We paged, and believe me, they got the message, and thousands of terrorists dropped to the ground. We destroyed Assad\u2019s armaments in Syria. We deterred Iran\u2019s Shiite militias in Iraq. And most importantly, above anything else that we did in this past year and this past decade, we devastated Iran\u2019s atomic weapons and ballistic missile programs.\n\nSo here\u2019s where things stand today. Half the Houthi leadership in Yemen\u2014gone. In Gaza\u2014gone. Nasrallah in Lebanon\u2014gone. The Assad regime in Syria\u2014gone. Those militias in Iraq are still deterred, and their leaders, if they attack Israel, will also be gone. And as for Iran\u2019s top military commanders and its top atomic bomb scientists\u2014well, they\u2019re gone too.\n\n### Operation Rising Lion and the US Partnership\n\nIsrael\u2019s 12-day war with Iran, which I renamed Operation Rising Lion\u2014it\u2019s from the Bible\u2014will go down in the annals of military history. Our daring pilots neutralized Iran\u2019s missile defenses and took control of the skies over Tehran. And you saw this: Israeli fighter pilots and American B\u20112 pilots bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment sites. I want to thank President Trump for his bold and decisive action. President Trump and I promised to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and we delivered on that promise.\n\nWe removed an existential threat to Israel, indeed a mortal threat to the civilized world. We lifted a dark cloud that could have claimed millions and millions of lives. But, ladies and gentlemen, we must remain vigilant. We must remain absolutely clear\u2011minded and vigilant. We must not allow Iran to rebuild its military nuclear capacity. Iran\u2019s stockpiles of enriched uranium must be eliminated, and tomorrow UN Security Council sanctions on Iran must be snapped back.\n\n### Finishing the War in Gaza\n\nThanks to the resolve of our people, the courage of our soldiers, and the bold decisions we took, Israel rebounded from its darkest day to deliver one of the most stunning military comebacks in history. But we\u2019re not done. We\u2019re not done yet. The final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City. They vow to repeat the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again, no matter how diminished their forces. That is why Israel must finish the job. That is why we want to do so, and that is why we want to do so as fast as possible.\n\n### Remembering October 7 and Why We Fight\n\nLadies and gentlemen, much of the world no longer remembers October 7th, but we remember. Israel remembers October 7th. On that day\u2014well, I\u2019ll tell you, you can remember October 7th too. You see this large pin here? It\u2019s a QR code. What I ask you to do is hold up your phone, zoom in, and you too will see why we fight and why we must win. It\u2019s all in here.\n\nOn October 7th, Hamas carried out the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. They slaughtered 1,200 innocent people, including over 40 Americans and foreign nationals from dozens of countries represented here. They beheaded men. They raped women. They burnt babies alive. They burnt babies alive in front of their parents. What monsters. And these monsters took more than 250 people hostage. Those included Holocaust survivors, grandmothers, and their grandchildren\u2014who takes hostage grandmothers and grandchildren? Hamas. So far we\u2019ve brought home 207 of these hostages. But 48 still remain in the dungeons of Gaza. Twenty of them are alive\u2014starved, tortured, deprived of any daylight, deprived of humanity. These are the names of the 20 living hostages: Ghee and Serve Berman, brothers; and David Kuno, another pair of brothers; Guy\u2014you saw the picture of Amed, forced to dig his own grave.\n\n### A Direct Address to the Hostages and Their Captors\n\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, I want to do something I\u2019ve never done before. I want to speak from this forum directly to those hostages through loudspeakers. I\u2019ve surrounded Gaza with massive loudspeakers connected to this microphone in the hope that our dear hostages will hear my message. I\u2019ll say it first in Hebrew and then in English.\n\nOur brave heroes, this is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter and we will not rest until we bring all of you home.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thanks to special efforts by Israeli intelligence, my words are now also being streamed live to the cell phones of Gazans. So to the remaining Hamas leaders and to the jailers of our hostages, I now say: Lay down your arms. Let my people go. Free the hostages\u2014all of them, the whole 48. Free the hostages now. Do it and you will live. If you don\u2019t, Israel will hunt you down.\n\nIf Hamas agrees to our demands, the war could end right now. Gaza would be demilitarized. Israel would retain overriding security control, and a peaceful civilian authority would be established by Gazans and others committed to peace with Israel.\n\n### The War\u2019s Endgame and Why It Matters to You\n\nAnd of course you understand that the war in Gaza has affected every Israeli, but I\u2019m sure there are people in New York or in London or in Melbourne and elsewhere who are probably thinking, What does all of this have to do with me? And the answer is: everything, because our enemies are your enemies. So let\u2019s do something else. First, a UN pop quiz. Raise your hand if you know the answer. Here\u2019s the first question: Who shouts \u201cDeath to America\u201d? Is it Iran, Hamas, the Houthis\u2014or all of the above? All of the above\u2014correct. All of the above.\n\nSecond question: Who has murdered Americans and Europeans in cold blood? Is it al\u2011Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, or all of the above? Correct again\u2014all of the above. So here\u2019s the point I wanted to make. Our enemies hate all of us with equal venom. They want to drag the modern world back to the past, to a dark age of violence, fanaticism, and terror. I think many of you are already feeling, in your own societies, the radical Islamist surge. You know\u2014I\u2019m sure you do\u2014you know, deep down, that Israel is fighting your fight.\n\nSo I want to tell you a secret. Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel\u2019s superb intelligence services that have, time and again, prevented terrorist attacks in their capitals\u2014time and again saving countless lives. General George Keegan, former head of U.S. Air Force Intelligence, once said that if the United States had to gather on its own the intelligence that Israel gives it, we would have to establish five CIAs\u2014five CIAs. This past June, when Israel struck Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, German Chancellor Merz admitted the truth. He said, \u201cIsrael is doing the dirty work for all of us.\u201d President Trump understands better than any other leader that Israel and America face a common threat. He showed the world that when Iran and its proxies murder Americans, take Americans hostage, shout \u201cDeath to America,\u201d burn American flags, and try to assassinate the President of the United States\u2014not once but twice\u2014there is a price to pay for all that.\n\n### Appeasement, Lawfare, and Moral Clarity\n\nBut regrettably, many leaders who are represented in this hall send a very different message. Sure, in the days immediately following October 7th many of them supported Israel, but that support quickly evaporated when Israel did what any self\u2011respecting nation would do in the wake of such a savage attack. We fought back. Now just imagine\u2014just sit back for a second and imagine\u2014an attack against America proportionate to the attack against Israel on October 7th. Imagine a terror regime dispatching thousands of terrorists to invade the United States. They massacre 40,000 Americans. They take 10,000 Americans hostage. What do you think America would do? You think America would leave that regime standing? You don\u2019t think that\u2014no way, not a chance. The United States would wipe out that terror regime and ensure that such savagery would never threaten America again. This is precisely what Israel is doing in Gaza. We\u2019re wiping out the terror regime of Hamas and ensuring that this savagery will never threaten Israel again. That\u2019s what we are doing. That\u2019s what any self\u2011respecting government would do.\n\nYet\u2014and it\u2019s a yet that I\u2019m sorry to say here\u2014over time many world leaders buckled. They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies, and antisemitic mobs. There\u2019s a familiar saying: When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Well, for many countries here, when the going got tough, you caved. And here\u2019s the shameful result of that collapse: For much of the past two years, Israel has had to fight a seven\u2011front war against barbarism, with many of your nations opposing us. Astoundingly, as we fight the terrorists who murdered many of your citizens, you are fighting us. You condemn us, you embargo us, and you wage political and legal warfare\u2014it\u2019s called lawfare\u2014against us. I say to the representatives of those nations: This is not an indictment of Israel. It\u2019s an indictment of you. It\u2019s an indictment of weakened leaders who appease evil rather than support a nation whose brave soldiers guard you from the barbarians at the gate. They\u2019re already penetrating your gates. When will you learn? You can\u2019t appease your way out of jihad, and you won\u2019t escape the Islamist storm by sacrificing Israel. To overcome that storm, you have to stand with Israel. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing. As the prophets of Israel foretold in the Bible, you\u2019ve turned good into evil and evil into good.\n\n### Answering the Genocide and Starvation Lies\n\nNow, I want to drill down on this. Take the false charge of genocide. Israel is accused of deliberately targeting civilians. Ladies and gentlemen, the opposite is true. The head of urban warfare studies, Colonel John Spencer\u2014perhaps the world\u2019s greatest expert on urban warfare\u2014says Israel is applying more measures to minimize civilian casualties than any military in history. And because we\u2019re doing that, the ratio of non\u2011combatant to combatant casualties is less than two to one in Gaza. That\u2019s an astoundingly low ratio, lower than NATO\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, especially when you consider that Gaza is one of the most densely populated urban areas on Earth. It has hundreds of miles of terror tunnels underground, countless terror towers above ground, and thousands of terrorists embedded in the tunnels and in these towers in civilian areas. If you want to see what measures Israel takes to avoid civilian casualties in this war, just look at what we\u2019re doing now in Gaza City, the last Hamas stronghold, one of the two last strongholds. For three weeks Israel dropped millions of leaflets, sent millions of text messages, and made countless phone calls urging civilians to leave Gaza City before our military moves in. At the same time, Hamas implants itself in mosques, schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, and streets to force those civilians not to leave\u2014to stay in harm\u2019s way\u2014and it often threatens them at gunpoint if they try to do so. For Israel, every civilian casualty is a tragedy. For Hamas, it\u2019s a strategy. Hamas uses civilians as human shields and as props in its sick propaganda war against Israel\u2014a propaganda war that the Western media buys hook, line, and sinker.\n\nNow, despite Hamas threats, close to 700,000 Gazans\u2014almost three\u2011quarters of a million\u2014have already heeded our calls and moved to safe zones. Now, I want to ask you a simple, logical question: Would a country committing genocide plead with the civilian population it is supposedly targeting to get out of harm\u2019s way? When we tell them \u201cGet out\u201d\u2014if we wanted to commit genocide\u2014we\u2019re trying to get them out, and Hamas is trying to keep them in. This charge is so baseless. The comparison to genocide\u2014wholesale slaughter of populations\u2014did the Nazis ask the Jews to leave? \u201cKindly leave, go out.\u201d You want me to name all the genocidal leaders of history? Just go one by one\u2014did anyone do this? Did they say, \u201cGet out so we can come in\u201d? Of course not. So the truth has been turned on its head. Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization whose charter calls for the murder of all Jews on the planet\u2014this genocidal organization is given a pass; it\u2019s barely mentioned. While Israel, which does everything it can to get civilians out of harm\u2019s way, is put in the dock. What a joke. You want to hear another one? Israel is accused of deliberately starving the people of Gaza, when Israel is deliberately feeding the people of Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, Israel has let into Gaza more than two million tons of food and aid\u2014that\u2019s one ton of aid for every man, woman, and child in Gaza, nearly 3,000 calories per person per day. Some starvation policy. If there are Gazans who don\u2019t have enough food, it\u2019s because Hamas is stealing it. Hamas steals it, hoards it, and sells it at exorbitant prices to fund its war machine. Last month\u2014even the UN, not exactly a supporter of Israel; you\u2019re supposed to laugh, by the way\u2014even the UN admitted that Hamas and other armed groups looted 85 percent of the trucks. That\u2019s why you have deprivation. Those who peddle the blood libels of genocide and starvation against Israel are no better than those who peddled blood libels against the Jews in the Middle Ages, when they falsely accused us of poisoning wells, spreading plague, and using the blood of children to bake Passover matzahs. Antisemitism dies hard. In fact, it doesn\u2019t die at all. It just keeps coming back with its libelous lies, refurbished, regurgitated over and over again.\n\nAnd I want to tell you something else. These antisemitic lies have consequences. In recent months, Jews have been assaulted in Canada, Austria\u2014or rather Australia\u2014Britain, France, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Here in America, an elderly Holocaust survivor was burned to death in Colorado. And a beautiful young couple from the Israeli Embassy in Washington was brutally gunned down right in front of the Holocaust Museum there. Thankfully, President Trump\u2019s administration is forcefully fighting the scourge of antisemitism, and every government here should follow its lead. But many do the opposite. They actually reward the worst antisemites on Earth. This week the leaders of France, Britain, Australia, Canada, and other countries unconditionally recognized a Palestinian state. They did so after the horrors committed by Hamas on October 7th\u2014horrors praised on that day by nearly 90 percent of the Palestinian population. Let me say that again: nearly 90 percent of Palestinians supported the attack on October 7th. Not only supported it\u2014they celebrated it. They danced on the rooftops. They threw candies. That\u2019s true both in Gaza and in Judea and Samaria\u2014the West Bank, as you call it\u2014and it\u2019s the way they celebrated another horror. Rooftops, they cheered, they threw candy. You know what message the leaders who recognized the Palestinian state this week sent to the Palestinians? It\u2019s a very clear message: murdering Jews pays off. Well, I have a message for these leaders: When the most savage terrorists on Earth are refusing your decision, you didn\u2019t do something right\u2014you did something wrong, horribly wrong. Your disgraceful decision will encourage terrorism against Jews and against innocent people everywhere. It will be a mark of shame on all of you.\n\n### The Real Obstacle to Peace\n\nBut\u2014\u201cBut wait a minute, Mr. Prime Minister,\u201d they tell me\u2014\u201cwait a minute, we believe in a two\u2011state peace with a Palestinian state.\u201d There\u2019s only one problem with that: the Palestinians don\u2019t believe in this solution. They never have. They don\u2019t want a state next to Israel; they want a Palestinian state instead of Israel. And that\u2019s why every time they were offered a Palestinian state but were required to end the conflict with Israel and recognize the Jewish state, every time over the decades, they turned it down. And that is why every time they were given territory, they used it to attack us. In fact, they effectively had a Palestinian state in Gaza. So what did they do with that state? Peace? Coexistence? No. They attacked us time and time again. Totally unprovoked, they fired rockets into our cities. They murdered our children. They turned Gaza into a terror base from which they committed the October 7th massacre.\n\nSo here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: The persistent Palestinian rejection of a Jewish state in any boundary is what has driven this conflict for over a century. It is still driving it. It\u2019s not the absence of a Palestinian state; it\u2019s the presence and existence of a Jewish state. And I find it amazing\u2014amazing\u2014that the foreign chanceries and ministries and all those who pontificate about this, the leaders, how can they not see this basic truth when it is repeated again and again and again? And I want to say something else. This rejection of a Jewish state not only applies to Hamas; it also applies to the so\u2011called moderate Palestinian Authority. You should know that the Palestinian Authority pays terrorists to slay Jews. The more Jews the terrorists slay, the more the Palestinian Authority pays. The Palestinian Authority names its government buildings, its public squares, its institutions after the mass murderers of Jews, whom they glorify as martyrs. They pay and glorify not just the killers of Jews but also killers of Christians\u2014Christians like Taylor Force, an American veteran who was brutally murdered in Israel by Palestinian terrorists.\n\nBut again I hear from the Western leaders; they tell me, \u201cThe PA promised us it will reform, and I know this time, Prime Minister, it will be different.\u201d Yeah, right. We\u2019ve heard these promises for decades. They always promise; they never deliver, because, you see, the Palestinian Authority is corrupt to the core. They haven\u2019t held elections in 20 years. They use the same textbooks as Hamas\u2014exactly the same textbooks. They teach their children to hate Jews and destroy the Jewish state. And Christians don\u2019t fare much better. When Bethlehem\u2014the birthplace of Jesus\u2014was under Israeli control, 80 percent of its residents were Christians, but since the PA took control, that number has dwindled to under 20 percent.\n\nThese are the intolerant fanatics who perpetrated and supported the October 7th massacre. Giving the Palestinians a state one mile from Jerusalem after October 7th is like giving al\u2011Qaeda a state one mile from New York City after September 11th. This is sheer madness. It\u2019s insane. And we won\u2019t do it.\n\n### Israel\u2019s Consensus and Resolve\n\nSo here\u2019s another message to those Western leaders: Israel will not allow you to shove a terrorist state down our throats. We will not commit national suicide because you don\u2019t have the guts to face down a hostile media and antisemitic mobs demanding Israel\u2019s blood. And I want you to grasp something else, which is also distorted in the media. I say this not only in my name or in the name of my government, but on behalf of all the people of Israel. Last year there was a vote in the Knesset, our parliament, on whether or not to oppose the imposition of a Palestinian state. You want to guess what the results were? Out of 120 members of our parliament, 99 voted against and only nine supported. That\u2019s over 90 percent. It\u2019s not a fringe group. It\u2019s not the Prime Minister who himself is extreme or he\u2019s held hostage by extreme parties to his right. It\u2019s over 90 percent of Israelis. My opposition to a Palestinian state is not simply my policy or my government\u2019s policy; it is the policy of the State and the people of the State of Israel.\n\nWestern leaders may have buckled under the pressure, and I guarantee you one thing: Israel won\u2019t. Israel\u2019s victories over the Iranian terror axis have opened up possibilities for peace that were unthinkable two years ago.\n\n### New Paths to Peace: Syria and Lebanon\n\nTake Syria. For decades, the very idea of peace between Israel and Syria seemed unimaginable. Well, no more. Today we have begun serious negotiations with the new Syrian government. I believe an agreement can be reached that respects Syria\u2019s sovereignty and protects both Israeli security and the security of the minorities in the region, including the Druze minority. From the founding of Israel, Druze and Jews have been brothers in arms. We have fought together. We\u2019ve bled together. We\u2019ve built our lives together. When I was a young commander in Israel\u2019s special forces, my own life was saved by the invaluable advice given to me by a great friend, Salem Shoofey, a heroic Druze IDF veteran. And that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t sit idly by, nor could Israel sit idly by, while the Druze were being slaughtered by Daesh, and I instructed our forces to stop the massacre\u2014which they promptly did.\n\nPeace between Israel and Lebanon is possible as well. I call on the Lebanese government to also begin direct negotiations with Israel. I commend it for its declared aim to disarm Hezbollah, but we need more than words. If Lebanon takes genuine and sustained action to disarm Hezbollah, I\u2019m sure we can achieve a sustainable peace. Of course, until that happens, we will take whatever action we need to defend ourselves and to maintain the conditions of the ceasefire that was established in Lebanon. Our goal is not merely to monitor actions but to prevent them from violating the ceasefire and attacking us at any time. But I\u2019m sure that if the Lebanese government persists in its goal of disarming, peace will come very speedily and very readily.\n\n### A Broader Regional Peace and a Vision for Iran\n\nVictory over Hezbollah has made peace possible with our two Arab neighbors in the north. Victory over Hamas will make peace possible with nations throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Our victory would lead to a dramatic extension and expansion of these historic Abraham Accords, which President Trump brokered between Arab leaders and myself five years ago. And I took note\u2014as I\u2019m sure you did too\u2014of the encouraging words spoken here by the President of Indonesia. This is the country with the largest Muslim population of all nations, and it\u2019s also a sign of what could come. Forward\u2011looking Arab and Muslim leaders know that cooperating with Israel will provide them with groundbreaking Israeli technologies, including in medicine and science, in agriculture and water, in defense and AI, and so many other fields. I believe that in the coming years, the Middle East will look dramatically different. Many of those who wage war on Israel today will be gone tomorrow. Brave peacemakers will take their place. And nowhere\u2014nowhere\u2014will this be more true than in Iran. The long\u2011suffering Iranian people will regain their freedom. They will make Iran great again. And our two ancient peoples\u2014the people of Israel and the people of Iran\u2014will restore a friendship that will benefit the entire world.\n\n### History, Resolve, and Closing\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the horrors that happened on one dark day\u2014October 7th\u2014those horrors happened countless times during the centuries of my people\u2019s exile among the nations. Jewish blood was cheap. Jews were killed with impunity. We had to beg others to defend us. The rise of Israel did not mean that the attempts to destroy us would end; it meant that we could fight back against those attacks, and that is exactly what Israel has done since October 7th. Our sons and daughters fought like lions. Our brave soldiers donned their uniforms and rushed into battle. They were armed with the dreams of the hundred generations of Jews who came before them: the dream of living as a free people in the Land of Israel, our beloved homeland for more than 3,000 years; the dream of living in our own independent state; the dream of having an army to defend ourselves; and the dream of being a light unto the nations, a beacon of progress, ingenuity, innovation, for the benefit of all humanity. On October 7th, the enemies of Israel tried to extinguish that light. Two years later, the resolve of Israel and the strength of Israel burn brighter than ever. With God\u2019s help, that strength and that resolve will lead us to a speedy victory and to a brilliant future of prosperity and peace.

loudspeakers broadcast Netanyahu's speech to UN into Gaza","snippet":"In an unprecedented move, the Israeli military used loudspeakers mounted on trucks at the Gaza border to broadcast Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the United Nations into Gaza. The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction. Conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate, with widespread devastation, power outages, and famine in some areas.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758900825.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/benjamin-netanyahu-un-speech-gaza","title":"Netanyahu vows to 'finish job' in Gaza during UN speech as delegates walk out","snippet":"In a highly contentious speech at the United Nations General Assembly on September 26, 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to \"finish the job\" in Gaza and vehemently opposed international recognition of a Palestinian state, calling it \"insane.\" His remarks followed the recent recognition of Palestinian statehood by countries including the UK, France, Canada, and Australia, which he criticized as encouraging terrorism. As he entered the UN hall, over 100 diplomats from more than 50 nations staged a walkout in protest.\n\nNetanyahu compared Palestinian statehood near Jerusalem to giving al-Qaeda land near New York post-9/11 and denied accusations of genocide in Gaza. He defended Israel's military campaign, stating it targeted the last strongholds of Hamas in Gaza City, despite international outcry over the humanitarian crisis and recent airstrikes that killed dozens of Palestinians.\n\nThe speech drew criticism for using emotional propaganda, such as a QR code linking to footage of the October 7 Hamas attacks and claims that his message was broadcast in Gaza through hijacked phones, a claim not substantiated on the ground. Thousands protested in New York, and Netanyahu's address was largely attended by junior diplomats.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758904818.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/26/gaza-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-un-united-nations-unga-west-bank-donald-trump-middle-east-crisis-live","title":"Netanyahu tells UN that Israel \u2018must finish the job\u2019 in Gaza after dozens of delegates walk out in protest - as it happened","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758903160.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/e53eee3b76dfa568e03ac584e46991a5","title":"Facing global isolation at UN, a defiant Netanyahu says Israel 'must finish the job' against Hamas","snippet":"In a defiant address to the United Nations amid growing international condemnation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel \"must finish the job\" against Hamas in Gaza. Delivered amid walkouts and protests, his speech came as Israel faces international isolation over its ongoing war, accusations of war crimes, and a potential genocide case at the U.N.'s highest court. Netanyahu criticized countries recognizing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of encouraging terrorism, and reiterated his opposition to a two-state solution, framing the conflict as a broader struggle against radical Islam.\n\nDespite growing global pressure and the war's toll\u2014over 65,000 Palestinians killed and mass displacement\u2014Netanyahu pledged to continue military operations. He used visual aids and symbolic gestures, including a QR code pin referencing the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, to reinforce his message. He also highlighted military actions against perceived threats across the region and claimed Israel is negotiating security arrangements with Syria\u2019s new government.\n\nMeanwhile, countries including Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K. have recognized a Palestinian state, and the European Union is considering sanctions on Israel.

As he entered the UN hall, over 100 diplomats from more than 50 nations staged a walkout in protest.\n\nNetanyahu compared Palestinian statehood near Jerusalem to giving al-Qaeda land near New York post-9/11 and denied accusations of genocide in Gaza. He defended Israel's military campaign, stating it targeted the last strongholds of Hamas in Gaza City, despite international outcry over the humanitarian crisis and recent airstrikes that killed dozens of Palestinians.\n\nThe speech drew criticism for using emotional propaganda, such as a QR code linking to footage of the October 7 Hamas attacks and claims that his message was broadcast in Gaza through hijacked phones, a claim not substantiated on the ground. Thousands protested in New York, and Netanyahu's address was largely attended by junior diplomats.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758904818.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/israeli-loudspeakers-broadcast-netanyahu-speech-to-un-gaza","title":"Israeli loudspeakers broadcast Netanyahu's speech to UN into Gaza","snippet":"In an unprecedented move, the Israeli military used loudspeakers mounted on trucks at the Gaza border to broadcast Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the United Nations into Gaza. The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction. Conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate, with widespread devastation, power outages, and famine in some areas.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758900825.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/e53eee3b76dfa568e03ac584e46991a5","title":"Facing global isolation at UN, a defiant Netanyahu says Israel 'must finish the job' against Hamas","snippet":"In a defiant address to the United Nations amid growing international condemnation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel \"must finish the job\" against Hamas in Gaza. Delivered amid walkouts and protests, his speech came as Israel faces international isolation over its ongoing war, accusations of war crimes, and a potential genocide case at the U.N.'s highest court. Netanyahu criticized countries recognizing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of encouraging terrorism, and reiterated his opposition to a two-state solution, framing the conflict as a broader struggle against radical Islam.\n\nDespite growing global pressure and the war's toll\u2014over 65,000 Palestinians killed and mass displacement\u2014Netanyahu pledged to continue military operations. He used visual aids and symbolic gestures, including a QR code pin referencing the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, to reinforce his message. He also highlighted military actions against perceived threats across the region and claimed Israel is negotiating security arrangements with Syria\u2019s new government.\n\nMeanwhile, countries including Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K. have recognized a Palestinian state, and the European Union is considering sanctions on Israel. At the same time, pro-Palestinian protests grow, and even Israel\u2019s allies, like the U.S., show signs of distancing themselves from Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758859544.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.americanrhetoric.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benjaminnetanyahuiranairstrikes.htm","title":"Announcement of Targeted Airstrikes in Iran (transcript-video)","snippet":"Binyamin Netanyahu Operation Rising Lion: Israel's PM Announces Targeted Preemptive Airstrikes in Iran delivered 13 June 2025.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.americanrhetoric.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war","title":"Iran\u2013Israel war","snippet":"The Iran\u2013Israel war, also known as the Twelve-Day War (13 June \u2013 24 June 2025), was an armed conflict in the Middle East.

of Lebanon's slain Hezbollah chief says his father's final days were filled with rage","snippet":"In a September 2025 interview, Jawad Nasrallah, son of slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, recounted his father's final days, marked by anger and frustration over a significant Israeli intelligence breach. In September 2024, Israel detonated communication devices used by Hezbollah members, leading to dozens of deaths and maimings. Shortly after, Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut, an event that initiated a full-scale Israeli offensive across Lebanon, resulting in over 4,000 deaths and extensive destruction.\n\nThe war aimed to neutralize Hezbollah in response to its cross-border attacks in support of Hamas, significantly weakening the group and leading to increased internal and external pressure for it to disarm. Displaced like many Lebanese, Jawad described the emotional toll of his father's death and the alienation felt during wartime, amid sectarian distrust. Despite Hezbollah\u2019s losses and political setbacks, including the fall of its ally Bashar al-Assad and Lebanon\u2019s new government pushing for sole control over arms, Jawad reaffirmed resistance to disarmament and expressed a continued spiritual connection to his father.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758877434.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/video-shows-walkout-during-netanyahus-2024-un-speech-not-2025-2025-09-25/","title":"Video shows walkout during Netanyahu's 2024 UN speech ...","snippet":"1 day ago \u2014 Fact Check: Video shows walkout during Netanyahu's 2024 UN speech, not 2025 ...

As he entered the UN hall, over 100 diplomats from more than 50 nations staged a walkout in protest.\n\nNetanyahu compared Palestinian statehood near Jerusalem to giving al-Qaeda land near New York post-9/11 and denied accusations of genocide in Gaza. He defended Israel's military campaign, stating it targeted the last strongholds of Hamas in Gaza City, despite international outcry over the humanitarian crisis and recent airstrikes that killed dozens of Palestinians.\n\nThe speech drew criticism for using emotional propaganda, such as a QR code linking to footage of the October 7 Hamas attacks and claims that his message was broadcast in Gaza through hijacked phones, a claim not substantiated on the ground.

Meanwhile, international outrage grows due to high casualties, displacement, and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where more than 65,500 have died and over 167,000 have been injured.

Prosor cited a decrease in Iranian arms shipments and Houthi attacks as evidence that mounting pressure is effective.

Despite being a staunch supporter of Israel, Merz expressed deep concern about the humanitarian impact of the military campaign, particularly on civilians. His remarks underscore growing discontent within Germany over its unwavering support for Israel amid intensifying global condemnation. Other German officials, including Jewish life commissioner Felix Klein and several Social Democrat MPs, echoed his concerns, criticizing the humanitarian consequences and advocating for halting arms exports to Israel. Israel\u2019s blockade, aimed at pressuring Hamas in ceasefire talks, has worsened conditions for Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents. Meanwhile, Hamas reportedly accepted a revised ceasefire plan, which Israel rejected, sticking to a prior U.S.-supported proposal. The conflict, sparked by Hamas\u2019s October 2023 attack that killed 1,200 Israelis, has since claimed over 53,500 Palestinian lives, according to Palestinian sources. Tensions also escalated in Jerusalem during the annual Flag March, marked by anti-Palestinian provocations and a controversial visit by Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to the sensitive Al Aqsa mosque compound, drawing condemnation from Jordan.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748274139.835,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68d6e4307988833190b9076f65a2a86c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for German Chancellor Merz 2025 quotes","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9855093fed80ce4b-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"b488a5f1-cbd6-44c8-ae26-7c12c4e7edad","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b488a5f1-cbd6-44c8-ae26-7c12c4e7edad","children":["089f9705-c01a-4156-b648-25317839220f"]},"d1f737e5-4b03-4255-9e5c-f3d60bfa9567":{"id":"d1f737e5-4b03-4255-9e5c-f3d60bfa9567","message":{"id":"d1f737e5-4b03-4255-9e5c-f3d60bfa9567","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758913293.560859,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Confirming transcript authenticity","content":"The web results support the claims in the user's transcript, including Assad\u2019s regime falling, Nasrallah\u2019s death, and the June 2025 war.

At least 19 Palestinians were killed in airstrikes, including members of two families in Zawayda town. The Israeli military reported striking 170 targets in Gaza, focusing on Hamas infrastructure. The military operation, launched following Hamas\u2019 deadly October 2023 attack, has led to a humanitarian crisis, with widespread destruction and hunger.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff expressed confidence in a diplomatic breakthrough, referencing a 21-point Middle East peace proposal shared by President Trump with Muslim-majority nations. Trump reportedly assured Arab leaders that Israel would not annex the West Bank. However, Netanyahu reaffirmed his opposition to Palestinian statehood and criticized nations recognizing it. Netanyahu is under an International Criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes, which Israel rejects.\n\nNearly 65,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, and around 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with 20 believed alive. Hamas warned that expanding the offensive endangers hostages, while Israel urged Gaza residents to reject Hamas.

General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned recent recognitions of Palestinian statehood by Western nations including France, Britain, Australia, and Canada. He criticized these moves as rewarding Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel, framing them as a message that \"murdering Jews pays off.\" Netanyahu's speech, amidst a backdrop of mass walkouts by delegates and protests in New York, marked a defiant response to growing international isolation over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu reiterated Israel's opposition to Palestinian statehood and accused world leaders of hypocrisy, highlighting private support for Israel\u2019s intelligence efforts despite public criticism. He also rejected accusations of genocide and defended Israel\u2019s military campaign, claiming that Hamas\u2019s governing capacity in Gaza had been dismantled.\n\nPalestinian leadership, including President Mahmoud Abbas, praised global support for statehood, calling for post-war governance and disarmament of Hamas. Despite broad international backing, Palestinian statehood still faces a veto barrier at the U.N. Security Council, led by the U.S., which remains Israel's key ally. Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump signaled potential peace deal progress but reaffirmed opposition to Israeli annexation of the West Bank, a move that could jeopardize the Abraham Accords.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758907089.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-presses-with-gaza-city-assault-34-palestinians-killed-2025-09-20/","title":"Israel presses on with Gaza City assault, at least 60 ...","snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 A total of 48 of the hostages remain in Gaza, and around 20 are thought to be alive.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758372771.734,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/israeli-loudspeakers-broadcast-netanyahu-speech-to-un-gaza","title":"Israeli loudspeakers broadcast Netanyahu's speech to UN into Gaza","snippet":"In an unprecedented move, the Israeli military used loudspeakers mounted on trucks at the Gaza border to broadcast Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the United Nations into Gaza. The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction.

The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction.

As he entered the UN hall, over 100 diplomats from more than 50 nations staged a walkout in protest.\n\nNetanyahu compared Palestinian statehood near Jerusalem to giving al-Qaeda land near New York post-9/11 and denied accusations of genocide in Gaza. He defended Israel's military campaign, stating it targeted the last strongholds of Hamas in Gaza City, despite international outcry over the humanitarian crisis and recent airstrikes that killed dozens of Palestinians.\n\nThe speech drew criticism for using emotional propaganda, such as a QR code linking to footage of the October 7 Hamas attacks and claims that his message was broadcast in Gaza through hijacked phones, a claim not substantiated on the ground. Thousands protested in New York, and Netanyahu's address was largely attended by junior diplomats.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758904818.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/e53eee3b76dfa568e03ac584e46991a5","title":"Facing global isolation at UN, a defiant Netanyahu says Israel 'must finish the job' against Hamas","snippet":"In a defiant address to the United Nations amid growing international condemnation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel \"must finish the job\" against Hamas in Gaza. Delivered amid walkouts and protests, his speech came as Israel faces international isolation over its ongoing war, accusations of war crimes, and a potential genocide case at the U.N.'s highest court. Netanyahu criticized countries recognizing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of encouraging terrorism, and reiterated his opposition to a two-state solution, framing the conflict as a broader struggle against radical Islam.\n\nDespite growing global pressure and the war's toll\u2014over 65,000 Palestinians killed and mass displacement\u2014Netanyahu pledged to continue military operations. He used visual aids and symbolic gestures, including a QR code pin referencing the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, to reinforce his message. He also highlighted military actions against perceived threats across the region and claimed Israel is negotiating security arrangements with Syria\u2019s new government.\n\nMeanwhile, countries including Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K. have recognized a Palestinian state, and the European Union is considering sanctions on Israel. At the same time, pro-Palestinian protests grow, and even Israel\u2019s allies, like the U.S., show signs of distancing themselves from Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758859544.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kJSbEhGeB8","title":"LIVE: Netanyahu speech at UN General Assembly 2025","snippet":"Watch live as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other world leaders address the U.N.

He also held up a multiple-choice card pointing fingers at Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Yemen\u2019s Houthi militia as anti-American actors, reinforcing his message with a standardized-test style answer: \u201cAll of the above.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he sported a large QR code button linking to an Israeli perspective on the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks.

Netanyahu insisted that Israel must \u201cfinish the job\u201d to prevent further attacks and secure the release of hostages. He rejected calls for Palestinian statehood, likening it to enabling terrorism near Israeli borders, and criticized world leaders like UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron for recognizing a Palestinian state, accusing them of encouraging anti-Israel violence.\n\nNetanyahu also targeted Iran and its regional proxies, boasting about a successful 2024 Israeli operation against Hezbollah. He highlighted humanitarian aid delivered to Gaza since the conflict began, countering claims of deliberate starvation. Speaking directly to hostages and Palestinian civilians via loudspeakers and text messages, Netanyahu appealed for the release of captives and offered Hamas militants a chance to surrender. He concluded with a promise that Israel would not rest until all hostages were safely returned.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758903743.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/israeli-loudspeakers-broadcast-netanyahu-speech-to-un-gaza","title":"Israeli loudspeakers broadcast Netanyahu's speech to UN into Gaza","snippet":"In an unprecedented move, the Israeli military used loudspeakers mounted on trucks at the Gaza border to broadcast Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the United Nations into Gaza. The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction.

The research, conducted by experts from multiple countries and NGOs, analyzed data from August 2024 to February 2025, documenting nearly 24,000 trauma-related cases. Explosions caused about two-thirds of the injuries, with burns\u2014particularly severe in children\u2014accounting for 18%, and 30% of injuries caused by firearms. These findings underscore the devastating impact of Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign in Gaza following Hamas\u2019s October 2023 attacks. The report suggests that many injuries stem from indiscriminate aerial and explosive assaults in civilian areas. Experts also found that malnutrition due to supply restrictions in Gaza has worsened patient outcomes.

The assault targets underground structures and high-rise buildings, with approximately 20 tower blocks demolished over the past two weeks. The campaign intensified ahead of the expected formal recognition of Palestinian statehood by ten countries, including Australia, Belgium, Britain, and Canada.\n\nIsrael\u2019s forces are pushing into central and western areas of Gaza City, where most civilians are sheltering. Conflicting reports surround the displacement figures: Israel estimates over 500,000 have fled the city since early September, whereas Hamas claims under 300,000 have left, with 900,000 remaining, including Israeli hostages. Hamas warns the hostages\u2019 lives are at risk due to ongoing attacks.\n\nHamas also reports that over 1,800 residential buildings and 13,000 tents housing displaced people have been destroyed since August.

The humanitarian toll continues to mount nearly two years into the conflict, with Gazan authorities reporting over 65,000 Palestinians killed, mostly civilians, and widespread displacement and infrastructure destruction.\n\nThe recent offensive has drawn international criticism, with some Western allies moving toward formal recognition of a Palestinian state. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to announce the UK's support for Palestinian statehood, diverging from traditional policy. Meanwhile, protests erupt in Israel as families of hostages held by Hamas push for a resolution. Of the 48 remaining captives, 20 are believed to be alive.

Nearly 31% of the fatalities are children under the age of 18. This escalation resumed in March after a two-month ceasefire, following the outbreak of war on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israeli communities, resulting in 1,200 Israeli deaths and 251 hostages.\n\nThe health ministry calculates deaths based on hospital-reported lists, and while initially including unidentified bodies, since October 2024 it has counted only identified victims. The figure may undercount actual deaths, with thousands believed to be buried under rubble. A Lancet study and the UN also suggest the real toll is likely higher, estimating that women and children make up nearly 70% of verified deaths.\n\nIsrael has reported 454 soldiers killed and claims nearly 20,000 Hamas fighters have died, though this has not been recently updated. The Israel Defense Forces argue they aim to minimize civilian casualties, attributing high numbers to Hamas operating within dense urban areas.

The sanctions are expected to be reinstated after Britain, France, and Germany accused Iran of violating the 2015 nuclear deal, which aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The IAEA had been working to re-establish cooperation with Iran after its nuclear sites were targeted by Israel and the U.S. in June. Araqchi emphasized that the recent inspection agreement, signed in Egypt, would only remain valid if no hostile actions\u2014such as the sanctions \"snapback\"\u2014are taken against Iran. The U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a Russian and Chinese proposal to delay the sanctions reimposition, but the resolution is unlikely to pass.

The sanctions, set to snap back at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday, follow accusations by European powers (E3: Britain, France, and Germany) that Iran violated the 2015 nuclear deal. Netanyahu emphasized the threat Iran poses, referring to Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June, and called for the elimination of Iran\u2019s enriched uranium stockpiles.\n\nDiplomatic efforts to delay the sanctions failed despite a Russian-Chinese proposal for a six-month delay and Iranian suggestions to preserve diplomacy. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi criticized the West for not engaging constructively. European diplomats stated Iran was unwilling to compromise. The upcoming sanctions will reinstate restrictions on arms, uranium enrichment, missile activity, energy sectors, and impose asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe sanctions restore punitive measures lifted under the 2015 deal, which has been unraveling since the U.S. exited it in 2018 under President Trump and reimposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758898474.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/26/gaza-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-un-united-nations-unga-west-bank-donald-trump-middle-east-crisis-live","title":"Netanyahu tells UN that Israel 'must finish the job' in Gaza after dozens of delegates walk out in protest - as it happened","snippet":"At the United Nations General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a controversial address, vowing to \"finish the job\" in Gaza and strongly opposing the recognition of Palestinian statehood, which he described as \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201csheer madness.\u201d This came days after countries like the UK, France, Canada, and Australia officially recognized Palestine, diverging from the U.S. Netanyahu's statements prompted over 100 diplomats from more than 50 countries to walk out in protest.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Israel broadcasted Netanyahu\u2019s speech into Gaza via loudspeakers, and claimed to have used digital means to broadcast it directly to residents\u2019 phones, though it's unclear how effective this was. He reaffirmed Israel's commitment to recovering hostages and dismantling Hamas.\n\nSimultaneously, former U.S. President Donald Trump publicly opposed any Israeli annexation of the West Bank, aiming to maintain diplomatic leverage amid ongoing conflicts.\n\nOther developments include the UN updating a list of companies operating in Israeli settlements, possible expulsion of Israeli broadcaster Kan from Eurovision, and international objections to Israel's blockade of a humanitarian flotilla to Gaza.

Israel has blamed Hamas, but there is no confirmed evidence linking the terror group directly to the looting. The humanitarian crisis, driven by severe food shortages, has escalated to the point where 94% of aid trucks in July alone were intercepted.\n\nAdding to the crisis, over 1,000 people have reportedly been killed at aid distribution points, with the UN attributing the deaths to shootings, though Israel denies firing on aid seekers except for using warning shots. Food security experts warn that Gaza is on the brink of a \u201cworst-case scenario famine.\u201d Meanwhile, peace efforts continue to stall, with Hamas refusing cease-fire deals that require disarmament and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu approving a full military occupation of Gaza.

Displaced residents and aid workers express skepticism over the claims of hospital protection and the feasibility of returning to destroyed northern areas.

This closure has halted the UN World Food Programme\u2019s ability to deliver food via what was its main route, cutting daily meal distributions nearly in half. Community kitchens and health clinics have shut, leaving residents facing rising food prices and severe scarcity. Displaced residents report difficulty finding essential items, including vegetables, while water access has dropped to below 25% of daily needs due to fuel shortages and security issues.\n\nAlthough Israeli officials contend that there are no limits on aid and accuse Hamas of diverting supplies, aid agencies argue that logistical and security constraints, especially post-Zikim closure, are obstructing deliveries. The UN states that nearly 40% of aid transport requests to northern Gaza have been denied. Health infrastructure is collapsing, with several malnutrition centers and hospitals shutting down or reaching capacity. UNICEF warns of worsening child malnutrition, calling the situation dire.

Since Israel ended an 11-week blockade in May, less than 8% of WFP trucks have successfully delivered aid due to Israeli delays and theft during transit. Israel claims enough aid enters and blames Hamas for theft, though the UN reports no evidence of systematic diversion. Meanwhile, Jordan and the UAE conducted symbolic airdrops of 25 tons of aid, but WFP insists only land deliveries can meet the large-scale needs of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million people.

The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction.

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the United Nations into Gaza. The operation, conducted in coordination with civilian elements and overseen by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, immediately sparked controversy. The government claimed the goal was to convey a message to Gaza's population and Hamas, indicating that war would end if hostages were returned, Hamas was disarmed, and the Strip demilitarized. Netanyahu's speech criticized Western recognition of Palestine and vowed to continue military operations, stating that Hamas remnants remain active in Gaza. He asserted that refusal to comply would result in being \"hunted.\"\n\nThe government also alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s speech was forcibly broadcast through telephones in Gaza, a claim without verified evidence. Military sources criticized the loudspeaker campaign as lacking tactical value. The context of the broadcast is Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive following Hamas\u2019 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 in Israel and led to over 65,000 Palestinian deaths. Recent airstrikes, particularly in Gaza City, resulted in further civilian casualties and destruction.

The proposed pact aimed to create a demilitarized zone in the region, which has witnessed recent sectarian violence impacting the Druze community. Israel, home to a significant Druze minority, argues the corridor is essential to protect the sect. However, Syria rejected the move, citing sovereignty concerns.\n\nPreviously conducted talks in Baku, Paris, and London had brought the two long-time adversaries close to an agreement. The breakdown comes despite U.S. envoy Tom Barrack suggesting a shift toward a more limited \"de-escalation agreement,\" in which Israel would halt attacks and Syria would avoid moving military equipment near the border.\n\nSyria voiced fears that Israel is intentionally delaying progress, with President Ahmed al-Sharaa questioning Israel's intentions and commitment. Israel has emphasized the deal\u2019s importance for both national security and regional minority protection, particularly the Druze.

Netanyahu criticized countries recognizing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of encouraging terrorism, and reiterated his opposition to a two-state solution, framing the conflict as a broader struggle against radical Islam.\n\nDespite growing global pressure and the war's toll\u2014over 65,000 Palestinians killed and mass displacement\u2014Netanyahu pledged to continue military operations. He used visual aids and symbolic gestures, including a QR code pin referencing the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, to reinforce his message. He also highlighted military actions against perceived threats across the region and claimed Israel is negotiating security arrangements with Syria\u2019s new government.\n\nMeanwhile, countries including Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K. have recognized a Palestinian state, and the European Union is considering sanctions on Israel. At the same time, pro-Palestinian protests grow, and even Israel\u2019s allies, like the U.S., show signs of distancing themselves from Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758859544.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"worldview.stratfor.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/implications-syria-israel-de-escalation-agreement","title":"The Implications of a Syria-Israel De-Escalation Agreement","snippet":"3 hours ago \u2014 Since the December 2024 collapse of the former Syrian President Bashar al Assad's regime, Israel has carried out thousands of airstrikes ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"worldview.stratfor.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.jpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-868700","title":"Benjamin Netanyahu signals peace hopes with Syria, ...","snippet":"3 hours ago \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of peace with Syria and Lebanon during his speech to the United Nations General ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.jpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_%282024%E2%80%93present%29","title":"Israeli invasion of Syria (2024\u2013present)","snippet":"Following the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024, Israel invaded the buffer zone in southwestern Syria (adjacent to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights)","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1733643025.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Assad_regime","title":"Fall of the Assad regime","snippet":"On 8 December 2024, the Assad regime collapsed during a major offensive by opposition forces.

At least 19 Palestinians were killed in airstrikes, including members of two families in Zawayda town. The Israeli military reported striking 170 targets in Gaza, focusing on Hamas infrastructure. The military operation, launched following Hamas\u2019 deadly October 2023 attack, has led to a humanitarian crisis, with widespread destruction and hunger.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff expressed confidence in a diplomatic breakthrough, referencing a 21-point Middle East peace proposal shared by President Trump with Muslim-majority nations. Trump reportedly assured Arab leaders that Israel would not annex the West Bank. However, Netanyahu reaffirmed his opposition to Palestinian statehood and criticized nations recognizing it.

This is meant to restore deterrence after Oct 7 and to rally wavering allies by tying Israel\u2019s fight to theirs. The frame tracks the record: a 12-day Iran\u2013Israel clash in June with U.S. B-2 participation is well documented; the 2024 Hezbollah pager/walkie-talkie detonations are also established. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\n2) **Blunt diplomatic isolation** by recasting Western recognitions of Palestinian statehood as rewarding terrorism, while pledging to \u201cfinish the job\u201d in Gaza.

The loudspeaker broadcast happened; the phone hijack claim remains unverified. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue201\n\n4) **Shape the endgame narrative**: no Palestinian state \u201cshoved down our throats\u201d; instead, a demilitarized Gaza under Israeli overriding security, and\u2014strikingly\u2014**overtures to Syria and Lebanon** contingent on Hezbollah disarmament and new Syria talks. Media confirm these overtures exist, but a concrete framework is not yet public and talks have already snagged. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search14\ue202turn4news19\ue201\n\n## Where the speech is strong\n- **Domestic consolidation & deterrence theater.** In Israeli politics, a hard \u201cno\u201d to a Palestinian state has broad parliamentary backing (e.g., the 99\u20139 Knesset vote against unilateral recognition). The speech aligns with that consensus and projects resolve to adversaries. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search13\ue201\n- **Strategic signaling to Tehran & Beirut.** Public claims of degraded Iranian and Hezbollah capability\u2014paired with reminders of covert strikes\u2014serve deterrence even if some details are embellished.

There **has** been widespread diversion/offloading of aid along routes, but outcome indicators, not tonnage, drive global opinion\u2014and those indicators are dire. Expect continued reputational and legal pressure. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search10\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n- **The casualty-ratio debate.** John Spencer (West Point MWI) has argued Israel employed unusually extensive precautions and has cited low non-combatant ratios. Independent analyses contest both the data and definitions (e.g., who is counted as a combatant), landing far higher civilian shares. Quoting Spencer persuades sympathetic audiences; it does not move skeptical governments or NGOs reviewing broader datasets. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n- **Lawfare isn\u2019t going away.** ICC warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant are live; several European states and civil society actors are aligning their policies to them. Washington may sanction the ICC, but that doesn\u2019t erase exposure in much of the world. The more the speech leans on \u201clawfare\u201d as bad faith, the less it addresses concrete compliance and accountability demands from partners Israel still needs. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn5news16\ue202turn5search1\ue201\n\n- **Syria/Lebanon peace talk.** As vision, it\u2019s bold; as policy, it\u2019s premature. Hezbollah disarmament is a generational problem, not a speech-act; Syria\u2019s transition is fluid and violently contested. Announcing peace horizons without deliverables risks compounding skepticism. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search14\ue201\n\n## On your premise (\u201cglobal antagonism,\u201d \u201cbiased media,\u201d leaders \u201chostage to propaganda\u201d)\nSome of that exists\u2014yes. But much of the backlash isn\u2019t only bias; it\u2019s **structure**:\n- **Scale and duration** of civilian harm are now central to how democracies assess allies\u2019 wars. The humanitarian baselines are being set by UN agencies and allied militaries\u2019 own doctrines, not just by media frames. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n- **Legal drag** (ICJ genocide case; ICC warrants) is institutional, slow, and sticky. Calling it propaganda won\u2019t change the compulsion those courts exert on many governments\u2019 policy space. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201\n- **Policy divergence** among allies is real: key Western states recognized Palestine not because they \u201clove Hamas\u201d but because they read the post-war vacuum as strategically untenable absent a political horizon. Israel\u2019s categorical rejection of statehood locks that divergence in. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news43\ue201\n\nIn short: attributing all headwinds to bias misses the levers you\u2019d need to actually shift.\n\n## What would *work* if Israel wants to regain strategic room\n1) **War termination + credible political horizon.** Even if not \u201ca Palestinian state now,\u201d outline verifiable steps (sequenced demobilization, municipal governance with external guarantees, monitored corridors, strict benchmarks). Allies need something concrete to sell at home. (Your loudspeaker offer\u2014demilitarization with overriding security\u2014is a starting outline, not an end-state.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news44\ue201  \n2) **Outcomes-based humanitarian proof.** Move from \u201ctonnage in\u201d to **observable nutrition and mortality outputs**: independent corridors, escorted distribution beyond offloading choke points, third-party monitoring, and public, disaggregated casualty audits. That would blunt the famine narrative in a way speeches can\u2019t. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn2search10\ue201  \n3) **Legal risk management.** Announce and empower credible, externalized investigations of alleged violations (not just IDF internal reviews), adopt transparent civilian-harm mitigation reforms, and publish ROE adaptations for dense urban fights. That\u2019s how partners argue you\u2019re meeting ICJ interim obligations\u2014again, outcomes, not rhetoric. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n4) **Decouple strategic victories from hyperbole.** \u201cDevastated\u201d Iran\u2019s programs and \u201chalf the Houthi leadership\u2014gone\u201d are maximalist claims that invite forensic debunking and erode net credibility.

Israel, home to a significant Druze minority, argues the corridor is essential to protect the sect. However, Syria rejected the move, citing sovereignty concerns.\n\nPreviously conducted talks in Baku, Paris, and London had brought the two long-time adversaries close to an agreement. The breakdown comes despite U.S. envoy Tom Barrack suggesting a shift toward a more limited \"de-escalation agreement,\" in which Israel would halt attacks and Syria would avoid moving military equipment near the border.\n\nSyria voiced fears that Israel is intentionally delaying progress, with President Ahmed al-Sharaa questioning Israel's intentions and commitment.

Netanyahu is under an International Criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes, which Israel rejects.\n\nNearly 65,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, and around 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with 20 believed alive.

He also rejected accusations of genocide and defended Israel\u2019s military campaign, claiming that Hamas\u2019s governing capacity in Gaza had been dismantled.\n\nPalestinian leadership, including President Mahmoud Abbas, praised global support for statehood, calling for post-war governance and disarmament of Hamas. Despite broad international backing, Palestinian statehood still faces a veto barrier at the U.N. Security Council, led by the U.S., which remains Israel's key ally.

tells UN that Israel 'must finish the job' in Gaza after dozens of delegates walk out in protest - as it happened","snippet":"At the United Nations General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a controversial address, vowing to \"finish the job\" in Gaza and strongly opposing the recognition of Palestinian statehood, which he described as \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201csheer madness.\u201d This came days after countries like the UK, France, Canada, and Australia officially recognized Palestine, diverging from the U.S. Netanyahu's statements prompted over 100 diplomats from more than 50 countries to walk out in protest.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Israel broadcasted Netanyahu\u2019s speech into Gaza via loudspeakers, and claimed to have used digital means to broadcast it directly to residents\u2019 phones, though it's unclear how effective this was. He reaffirmed Israel's commitment to recovering hostages and dismantling Hamas.\n\nSimultaneously, former U.S. President Donald Trump publicly opposed any Israeli annexation of the West Bank, aiming to maintain diplomatic leverage amid ongoing conflicts.\n\nOther developments include the UN updating a list of companies operating in Israeli settlements, possible expulsion of Israeli broadcaster Kan from Eurovision, and international objections to Israel's blockade of a humanitarian flotilla to Gaza. A BMJ study also highlighted severe civilian injuries in Gaza resembling combat wounds, raising further humanitarian concern.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758903160.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/netanyahu-calls-un-prevent-irans-nuclear-resurgence-2025-09-26/","title":"Netanyahu calls on UN to prevent Iran's nuclear resurgence","snippet":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the United Nations on Friday to prevent Iran from rebuilding its nuclear and military capabilities, ahead of the reimposition of U.N. sanctions on Tehran. The sanctions, set to snap back at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday, follow accusations by European powers (E3: Britain, France, and Germany) that Iran violated the 2015 nuclear deal. Netanyahu emphasized the threat Iran poses, referring to Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June, and called for the elimination of Iran\u2019s enriched uranium stockpiles.\n\nDiplomatic efforts to delay the sanctions failed despite a Russian-Chinese proposal for a six-month delay and Iranian suggestions to preserve diplomacy. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi criticized the West for not engaging constructively. European diplomats stated Iran was unwilling to compromise. The upcoming sanctions will reinstate restrictions on arms, uranium enrichment, missile activity, energy sectors, and impose asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe sanctions restore punitive measures lifted under the 2015 deal, which has been unraveling since the U.S. exited it in 2018 under President Trump and reimposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758898474.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-israel-sign-38-billion-military-aid-package-idUSKCN11K2CI/","title":"U.S., Israel sign $38 billion military aid package","snippet":"Sep 14, 2016 \u2014 The $38 billion memorandum of understanding covers U.S. fiscal years 2019-2028 and succeeds the current $30 billion MOU signed in 2007, which ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1473931348.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-resume-shipping-500-pound-bombs-israel-us-official-says-2024-07-10/","title":"US to resume shipping 500-pound bombs to Israel, ...","snippet":"Jul 10, 2024 \u2014 President Joe Biden's administration will resume shipping 500-pound bombs to Israel but will continue to hold back on supplying 2000-pound ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1720643442.011,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/e53eee3b76dfa568e03ac584e46991a5","title":"Facing global isolation at UN, a defiant Netanyahu says Israel 'must finish the job' against Hamas","snippet":"During a defiant address to the United Nations General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel\u2019s ongoing war against Hamas despite mounting global condemnation and accusations of war crimes. Facing international isolation, Netanyahu insisted Israel \"must finish the job\" in Gaza, amid increasing recognition of Palestinian statehood by countries such as France, the UK, and Canada, and growing tensions with the EU and the International Criminal Court, which has issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s speech was met with a mass walkout by delegates and protests outside the UN. He characterized the conflict as part of a broader regional struggle against radical Islam and praised former U.S. President Donald Trump for his support. Netanyahu used visual aids, including a map marked \"THE CURSE,\" and attempted to broadcast his message into Gaza using loudspeakers and alleged mobile phone hijacks.\n\nIn Gaza, displaced Palestinians expressed exhaustion and determination for statehood, while Hamas denounced Netanyahu\u2019s justifications as false. Meanwhile, rising tolls from Israel\u2019s campaign\u2014over 65,000 Palestinians killed and 90% displaced\u2014have intensified international outcry.

The Israeli military intercepted 99% of these, avoiding widespread damage, though some missiles caused minor damages and injured a child. This attack is Iran's direct retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike in Syria two weeks prior, killing two Iranian generals. The U.S., supporting Israel, deployed aircraft and defense systems, successfully aiding in intercepting the majority of the threats. Global leaders condemned the Iranian action, emphasizing the risk of a broader regional conflict. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard warned of severe responses to any harm to Iran's interests.

The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced the acquisition, pending approval from its ministerial committee for defense procurement. The U.S. government, which manages foreign military sales, will oversee the deal. This purchase will add to Israel's existing fleet of four KC-46 tankers and is expected to enhance the Israeli military's long-range strategic capabilities. These aircraft were recently used during a 12-day air campaign against Iran in June. The deal also includes equipping the planes with unspecified Israeli systems. Although the U.S. provides extensive military assistance to Israel, this continued support has drawn scrutiny from some U.S. lawmakers due to ongoing concerns about Israel's military operations in Gaza and debates over domestic spending priorities.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755703070.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/apr/13/iran-launches-drone-attack-against-israel","title":"G7 releases statement condemning Iran retaliatory attacks on Israel - as it happened","snippet":"The G7 has strongly condemned Iran's unprecedented retaliatory drone and missile attacks on Israel, which occurred in response to the death of a top Iranian commander in an Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.

The US reiterated its support for Israel while stressing the need to avoid further escalation. The UN and several countries, including Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, have called for restraint to prevent a broader regional conflict.

The US, UK, and an unexpected ally, Jordan, also provided crucial support. Israel faced minimal damage with only one reported casualty, a 7-year-old Bedouin girl. Iranian attacks included ballistic and cruise missiles, along with explosive drones, while Hezbollah from Lebanon also fired 40 rockets. The successful interceptions involved Israel's fighter aircraft, David's Sling, and Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missiles. The US played a pivotal role intercepting over Iraq and Syria and deployed Patriot missile batteries and warships in the region, while Jordan's F-16 jets protected their airspace.

He accused these governments of sending a message that violence pays, referencing the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that killed around 1,200 people in Israel. Netanyahu condemned the move as a \"mark of shame\" and reinforced his government's stance against Palestinian statehood.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s speech, aimed at defending Israel\u2019s continued military campaign in Gaza, took place amid widespread international criticism over the war, which Gaza health officials say has killed more than 65,000 people and devastated the territory. Scores of UN delegates walked out in protest, while pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked traffic in New York. Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel\u2019s commitment to destroying Hamas, while dismissing genocide allegations and defending his country\u2019s actions.\n\nMeanwhile, countries supporting Palestinian recognition argue that doing so supports a two-state solution. Netanyahu also addressed Israeli hostages still held in Gaza and hinted at possible progress in indirect negotiations, as Trump signaled optimism for a near-term deal. Yet Netanyahu faces growing internal and international pressure over the war and potential West Bank annexation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758916760.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-says-it-will-not-recognise-palestinian-state-this-time-2025-09-27/","title":"New Zealand says it will not recognise Palestinian state at this time","snippet":"New Zealand has announced it will not recognize the State of Palestine at this time, despite supporting a two-state solution. Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that the ongoing conflict, the control of Gaza by Hamas, and the lack of a clear pathway forward make recognition premature. Peters also expressed concern that early recognition could hinder ceasefire efforts by entrenching the positions of both Israel and Hamas. This position contrasts with recent moves by traditional allies Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which have recognized Palestine, joining over 140 countries globally. The New Zealand government emphasized it remains open to recognition in the future, pending improvements in the situation. The opposition Labour Party criticized the decision, arguing that recognition is vital to achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East, and claimed the government's stance misaligns New Zealand with historical progress.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758933528.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/britain-australia-canada-recognise-palestinian-state-2025-09-21/","title":"Four major Western nations recognise Palestinian state, to ...","snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 LONDON/TORONTO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal all recognised a Palestinian state on Sunday in a move borne out ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758463927.07,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"omni.se","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://omni.se/a/3MrzoA","title":"Netanyahu tog omv\u00e4g f\u00f6r att undvika att bli gripen","snippet":"Israels premi\u00e4rminister Benjamin Netanyahu genomf\u00f6rde en ovanlig flygresa till New York genom att ta en omv\u00e4g \u00f6ver Gibraltar sund, vilket f\u00f6rl\u00e4ngde flygtiden till 13 timmar ist\u00e4llet f\u00f6r de normala elva.

Israel\u2019s current campaign tempo, strike reach, and diplomatic room are\u2014in practice\u2014co-produced with the United States. Here\u2019s a clear-eyed map of the dependencies, the failure modes, and what \u201cwalking a fine wire\u201d really means.\n\n## The hard dependencies\n\n- **Kinetics & reach.** Long-range strike and sustained sortie rates leaned on U.S. enablers: aerial refueling deployments, targeting/intel fusion, and (in June) direct U.S. participation against Iranian facilities (\u201cOperation Rising Lion,\u201d incl. B-2 strikes). Even press that\u2019s cautious on specifics agrees U.S. lift and refuelers were decisive for tempo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n- **Missile defense & interceptors.** Iron Dome/David\u2019s Sling/Tamir production and replenishment rely on U.S. co-funding and co-production (Raytheon\u2013Rafael). The April 2024 multi-theater interception of Iran\u2019s barrage was a coalition event coordinated by CENTCOM with U.S., UK, French, and Jordanian shooters in the stack. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n- **Munitions pipeline.** JDAM kits, 155mm shells, precision air-to-ground ordnance\u2014Washington can (and has) modulated flows (e.g., pausing 2,000-lb bombs while resuming 500-lb). That lever remains live. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n- **Diplomatic shielding.** The U.S. veto (or the threat of it) has repeatedly blocked UNSC moves Israel deems harmful; without it, sanctions/embargoes and binding measures would bite. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n- **Lawfare countermeasures.** With ICC warrants in play against Israeli leaders, U.S. executive actions and sanctions on ICC officials are not symbolic\u2014they deter allied compliance and reduce arrest risk in some jurisdictions. That is unique cover the EU will not provide. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search19\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search1\ue201\n\n- **Strategic aid baseline.** The $38B 2019\u20132028 MOU hardwires ~$3.8B/yr plus missile defense; post-Oct-7 supplementals added to that baseline. Future KC-46 buys for IAF themselves ride U.S. FMF. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn1news31\ue201\n\n## The new pressure environment\n\n- **Legitimacy gap vs. outcomes.** Allies now judge by *humanitarian outcomes*, not tonnage or intent. That\u2019s why Europe\u2019s center of gravity shifted toward recognizing Palestinian statehood; it\u2019s a structural, not merely \u201cbiased media,\u201d shift. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news27\ue202turn2search21\ue202turn2search10\ue201\n\n- **Legal drag.** ICJ provisional measures + ICC warrants create sticky constraints for many U.S. partners. U.S. shielding helps, but it doesn\u2019t travel well across all jurisdictions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue201\n\n- **U.S. conditionality risk.** Even under a friendly White House, the bureaucracy and Congress can tweak export approvals or impose tactical holds when civilian-harm risk spikes. That happened already with heavy bombs in 2024. Expect this tool to recur if Gaza ops intensify without visible mitigation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n- **Coalition arithmetic.** April 2024 proved missile defense is a *coalition* sport; if Amman, Paris, London sour, interception density falls and costs rise. That, in turn, raises U.S. burden\u2014and U.S. scrutiny. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n## Scenario tree (next 6\u201312 months)\n\n1) **Supportive-but-conditional U.S. (base case).** High aid, intel, and refueling posture continue; episodic holds on specific munitions; aggressive U.S. counter-lawfare. Requires Israel to demonstrate tighter civilian-harm mitigation and a credible governance plan for Gaza to keep European cooperation from collapsing further. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue201\n\n2) **Constrained U.S. (credible).** A spike in civilian casualties or a headline incident triggers broader munitions conditioning; Europe expands embargoes; Jordan limits airspace cooperation. Israel can fight, but at reduced tempo and higher strategic risk exposure.\n\n3) **Shock case (low-probability, high-impact).** A regional miscalculation (e.g., major mass-casualty strike in Lebanon or Iran) + domestic U.S. backlash forces a temporary freeze on key kits. Israel\u2019s long-range suppression and sustained urban operations become significantly harder without substitutes.\n\n## Practical hedges Israel would need (if it wants to keep the wire from snapping)\n\n- **Shift from \u201cinputs\u201d to **audited outcomes**:** publish independent, third-party-monitored data on aid delivery *and* population nutrition/mortality; open monitored corridors; adopt and publicize ROE adaptations for dense urban combat. This is what keeps U.S./European legal desks onside. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n- **Industrial buffering:** accelerate domestic lines for PGMs and Tamir-class interceptors (with U.S. co-production as surge, not single point of failure); prioritize 250/500-lb precision kits over 2,000-lb effects to match U.S. risk tolerances. (Raytheon-Rafael capacity is an asset\u2014use it to diversify geographic risk.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n- **Air-enabler resilience:** front-load KC-46 deliveries and tanker crew training; plan refuel-lite strike concepts (standoff, attritable platforms) for periods when U.S. tankers are reprioritized. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news31\ue201\n\n- **Diplomatic geometry:** give Washington and key Europeans *something to sell*: a staged Gaza demilitarization/administration framework with measurable benchmarks and third-party roles\u2014distinct from immediate statehood but not a vacuum. That is the single most powerful inoculant against future holds. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news27\ue201\n\n- **Message discipline:** stop making easily falsifiable quantitative boasts (\u201cdevastated\u201d programs; \u201chalf the Houthi leadership\u201d)\u2014they invite forensic pushback and erode U.S./EU staffers\u2019 willingness to go to bat for you. Keep claims tight and verifiable, let effects speak. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news67\ue201\n\n## Bottom line\n\nOperationally, diplomatically, legally, and industrially, Israel is **interdependent** with the U.S. right now. That\u2019s not a weakness if managed\u2014*but it is a single point of strategic failure if neglected*. The wire holds if Israel aligns its conduct to preserve U.S./coalition support (outcomes, not rhetoric), builds supply-chain slack, and offers a credible political horizon that lets partners justify continued backing at home. Otherwise, the next spike in civilian harm or a regional misstep could translate, very quickly, into fewer refuelers, slower resupply, and a colder UNSC room. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-page \u201crisk register\u201d with triggers, indicators, and mitigations that you can keep updated week-to-week."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search7\ue201","start_idx":634,"end_idx":680,"safe_urls":["https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Operation-Rising-Lion-06-17-25-6.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Operation-Rising-Lion-6-23-25-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://my.rusi.org/resource/operation-rising-lion-the-first-72-hours.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([RUSI](https://my.rusi.org/resource/operation-rising-lion-the-first-72-hours.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Operation Rising Lion: The First 72 Hours","url":"https://my.rusi.org/resource/operation-rising-lion-the-first-72-hours.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jun 16, 2025 \u2014 By 15 June Israel had struck over 250 targets, and launched new attacks on Iranian energy infrastructure, especially oil and gas facilities, as ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"U.S.-Israel-Iran Conflict: 6/23/25 Update","url":"https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Operation-Rising-Lion-6-23-25-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jun 23, 2025 \u2014 \u00bb At midnight on June 20, a large B-2 strike package took off from Whiteman Air Base in.

This closure has halted the UN World Food Programme\u2019s ability to deliver food via what was its main route, cutting daily meal distributions nearly in half. Community kitchens and health clinics have shut, leaving residents facing rising food prices and severe scarcity. Displaced residents report difficulty finding essential items, including vegetables, while water access has dropped to below 25% of daily needs due to fuel shortages and security issues.\n\nAlthough Israeli officials contend that there are no limits on aid and accuse Hamas of diverting supplies, aid agencies argue that logistical and security constraints, especially post-Zikim closure, are obstructing deliveries. The UN states that nearly 40% of aid transport requests to northern Gaza have been denied. Health infrastructure is collapsing, with several malnutrition centers and hospitals shutting down or reaching capacity. UNICEF warns of worsening child malnutrition, calling the situation dire. Humanitarian conditions also continue to deteriorate in the south, such as in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah, where mass displacement is straining already limited food and medical resources.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758894555.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/investigations/visual-evidence-upends-israels-official-story-deadly-attack-gaza-hospital-2025-09-26/","title":"Visual evidence upends Israel's official story for deadly attack on Gaza hospital","snippet":"A Reuters investigation has cast serious doubt on Israel's official explanation for the August 25, 2025, Israeli military strike on Nasser Hospital in Gaza that killed 22 people, including five journalists. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed they were targeting a Hamas-operated surveillance camera but visual evidence proves the camera belonged to Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri, who had repeatedly used the same setup covered with his personal prayer rug to protect it from heat and dust. Masri and other journalists were killed in two tank strikes while reporting from a stairwell they frequently used for media coverage.

The food aid surprised me.","snippet":"Ken Isaacs, vice president of programs for Samaritan\u2019s Purse, recounts his recent visit to Gaza amidst a severe humanitarian crisis following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. He highlights the collapse of governance and the immense suffering of civilians. Initially skeptical of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), Isaacs became an advocate after witnessing its food distribution efforts. Despite criticism from the UN and NGOs due to its military-like approach and support from Israel and the U.S., Isaacs describes GHF as effective and professional, distributing food under extremely dangerous conditions. He argues that traditional UN-led humanitarian methods are ineffective in Gaza\u2019s current volatile environment, especially since UNRWA is no longer allowed to operate due to ties with Hamas. GHF claims to have distributed over 167 million meals, while UN trucks have been frequently looted. Isaacs calls for collaboration between the UN and GHF, including accepting the need for armed escorts. He urges pragmatism over ideology, emphasizing that moral clarity and action are essential to saving lives amidst the ongoing crisis.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758809460.963,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.fdd.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/08/05/un-reports-88-percent-of-aid-trucks-slated-for-delivery-in-gaza-since-may-looted-along-routes/","title":"UN Reports 88 Percent of Aid Trucks Slated for Delivery in ...","snippet":"Aug 5, 2025 \u2014 August 5, 2025 | Flash Brief.

This closure has halted the UN World Food Programme\u2019s ability to deliver food via what was its main route, cutting daily meal distributions nearly in half. Community kitchens and health clinics have shut, leaving residents facing rising food prices and severe scarcity. Displaced residents report difficulty finding essential items, including vegetables, while water access has dropped to below 25% of daily needs due to fuel shortages and security issues.\n\nAlthough Israeli officials contend that there are no limits on aid and accuse Hamas of diverting supplies, aid agencies argue that logistical and security constraints, especially post-Zikim closure, are obstructing deliveries. The UN states that nearly 40% of aid transport requests to northern Gaza have been denied. Health infrastructure is collapsing, with several malnutrition centers and hospitals shutting down or reaching capacity. UNICEF warns of worsening child malnutrition, calling the situation dire.

Prime Minister Meloni criticized the campaign as dangerous and unnecessary. Israel, without addressing accusations of drone involvement, reiterated its stance against breaching the blockade and offered to transport aid itself if dropped at a nearby port.

Its revenue streams have largely collapsed due to halted imports and aid shipments following Israel\u2019s intensified military campaign. The group struggles to pay salaries to fighters and civil servants and has ceased providing benefits to families of deceased fighters. Efforts to maintain governance in Gaza now rely heavily on austerity, community involvement, and emergency committees.\n\nHamas previously generated income by taxing commercial goods and allegedly seizing humanitarian aid, though major aid organizations and the UN state there's no systematic theft of aid evidence. Still, Israeli and Egyptian intelligence report instances of Hamas profiting from inflated prices and extortions. Internally, financial collapse and repressive tactics have fueled public resentment, diminishing Hamas's popularity.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed they were targeting a Hamas-operated surveillance camera but visual evidence proves the camera belonged to Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri, who had repeatedly used the same setup covered with his personal prayer rug to protect it from heat and dust. Masri and other journalists were killed in two tank strikes while reporting from a stairwell they frequently used for media coverage. The IDF later admitted that the strike occurred without required approval from senior command and without a legal review, violating internal protocols.\n\nThe IDF has not provided a full explanation for why a second strike followed amidst rescue operations. Moreover, no credible evidence has been offered linking the killed journalists or victims to militant activity. The attack adds to a growing pattern of journalist fatalities in the Gaza conflict\u2014over 200 so far\u2014with the Committee to Protect Journalists noting that despite international condemnation, Israel has neither held personnel accountable nor revised its engagement protocols.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758889258.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-presses-with-gaza-city-assault-34-palestinians-killed-2025-09-20/","title":"Israel presses on with Gaza City assault, at least 60 Palestinians killed","snippet":"As of September 21, 2025, Israel has continued its military offensive on Gaza City and the wider Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of at least 60 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. The assault targets underground structures and high-rise buildings, with approximately 20 tower blocks demolished over the past two weeks. The campaign intensified ahead of the expected formal recognition of Palestinian statehood by ten countries, including Australia, Belgium, Britain, and Canada.\n\nIsrael\u2019s forces are pushing into central and western areas of Gaza City, where most civilians are sheltering. Conflicting reports surround the displacement figures: Israel estimates over 500,000 have fled the city since early September, whereas Hamas claims under 300,000 have left, with 900,000 remaining, including Israeli hostages. Hamas warns the hostages\u2019 lives are at risk due to ongoing attacks.\n\nHamas also reports that over 1,800 residential buildings and 13,000 tents housing displaced people have been destroyed since August. Overall, Gazan authorities say more than 65,000 Palestinians have died in the nearly two-year conflict.

This contradicts claims by Israel and the U.S. government, which back a controversial new private aid operation led by a for-profit U.S. firm with military ties. The study reviewed 156 reported incidents of aid theft or loss from October 2023 to May 2025, finding none directly linked to Hamas. However, 44 incidents were attributed directly or indirectly to actions by the Israeli military.\n\nDespite the USAID findings, the U.S. State Department maintains Hamas has looted aid, citing unspecified video evidence and accusing aid groups of covering up corruption. Israel similarly claims Hamas diverts or sells aid, although these claims haven\u2019t been independently verified. The conflict began after a Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and has since resulted in nearly 60,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Palestinian sources, with severe food shortages worsening in Gaza.

Efforts are being made to establish a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in southern Gaza\u2019s al-Mawasi area, including the construction of new aid distribution hubs and the expansion of the Kissufim crossing. These efforts are criticized as insufficient, with tight restrictions still hindering aid delivery.\n\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israel-backed organization, is managing limited food distribution, but many centers have shut down. Displaced residents and aid workers express skepticism over the claims of hospital protection and the feasibility of returning to destroyed northern areas.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed they were targeting a Hamas-operated surveillance camera but visual evidence proves the camera belonged to Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri, who had repeatedly used the same setup covered with his personal prayer rug to protect it from heat and dust. Masri and other journalists were killed in two tank strikes while reporting from a stairwell they frequently used for media coverage. The IDF later admitted that the strike occurred without required approval from senior command and without a legal review, violating internal protocols.\n\nThe IDF has not provided a full explanation for why a second strike followed amidst rescue operations. Moreover, no credible evidence has been offered linking the killed journalists or victims to militant activity. The attack adds to a growing pattern of journalist fatalities in the Gaza conflict\u2014over 200 so far\u2014with the Committee to Protect Journalists noting that despite international condemnation, Israel has neither held personnel accountable nor revised its engagement protocols.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758889258.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.camera.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.camera.org/article/delayed-fog-of-war-onset-media-regress-on-al-ahli-hospital-blast/","title":"Delayed Fog of War Onset: Media Regress on Al-Ahli Hospital ...","snippet":"Apr 15, 2025 \u2014 In contrast, the Jerusalem Post, which had relied on Reuters reporting, has commendably amended its misleadingly murky Al-Ahli blast coverage.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.camera.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.camera.org/topic/gaza-media-corrections/","title":"Corrections: Gaza Strip | Topics - CAMERA.org","snippet":"In Gaza Strip coverage, the wire service corrects a headline which upgraded to fact an unverified claim about Israeli military culpability in the death of over ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.camera.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tandfonline.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13537121.2024.2394292","title":"The New York Times coverage of the Israel-Hamas war","snippet":"by E Gilboa \u00b7 2024 \u00b7 Cited by 10 \u2014 This article presents serious errors, corrections and omissions in the New York Times coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza from October 2023 to June 2024.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.tandfonline.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.poynter.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2023/the-new-york-times-explains-its-gaza-hospital-blast-headline-change/","title":"The New York Times explains its Gaza hospital blast ...","snippet":"Oct 24, 2023 \u2014 The Times headline changed: \u201cIsrael and Palestinians Blame Each Other for Blast at Gaza Hospital That Killed Hundreds.\u201d","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.poynter.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.hollywoodreporter.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/new-york-times-gaza-hospital-blast-reporting-hamas-israel-1235624756/","title":"New York Times Says It Was \"Incorrect\" to Rely on Hamas ...","snippet":"Oct 23, 2023 \u2014 The New York Times has said it was wrong to \u201cheavily\u201d rely on claims by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas that Israel was to blame for the Oct. 17 Al-Ahli ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.hollywoodreporter.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"san.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://san.com/cc/some-news-outlets-issue-corrections-on-gaza-aid-center-shootings/","title":"The Washington Post issues corrections on Gaza aid ...","snippet":"Jun 4, 2025 \u2014 That hospital story led to corrections from The New York Times, though the BBC, which first reported the incident, defended its journalism.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749071768.0,"attribution":"san.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mediaite.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/cnn-corrects-report-that-blamed-gaza-hospital-explosion-on-israel/","title":"CNN Corrects Report on Gaza Hospital Bombing","snippet":"Oct 25, 2023 \u2014 CNN has now added a correction to their online article about the hospital explosion, admitting they failed to attribute initial claims about it ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.mediaite.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"besacenter.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://besacenter.org/the-new-york-times-coverage-of-the-israel-hamas-warrandom-errors-or-endemic-malaise/","title":"The New York Times Coverage of the Israel-Hamas War","snippet":"Oct 10, 2024 \u2014 The errors and omissions created false context and lacked transparency.

This closure has halted the UN World Food Programme\u2019s ability to deliver food via what was its main route, cutting daily meal distributions nearly in half. Community kitchens and health clinics have shut, leaving residents facing rising food prices and severe scarcity. Displaced residents report difficulty finding essential items, including vegetables, while water access has dropped to below 25% of daily needs due to fuel shortages and security issues.\n\nAlthough Israeli officials contend that there are no limits on aid and accuse Hamas of diverting supplies, aid agencies argue that logistical and security constraints, especially post-Zikim closure, are obstructing deliveries. The UN states that nearly 40% of aid transport requests to northern Gaza have been denied. Health infrastructure is collapsing, with several malnutrition centers and hospitals shutting down or reaching capacity. UNICEF warns of worsening child malnutrition, calling the situation dire.

Israel criticized the report as deeply flawed, accusing the IPC of methodological breaches and data manipulation, including cherry-picking and potentially fabricating figures. The Israeli Foreign Ministry called for an urgent and transparent review and threatened to pressure IPC donors to stop funding unless a new report is issued within two weeks.\n\nThe IPC, supported by multiple U.N. agencies and global aid organizations, has previously declared famines in Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has confirmed that Gaza has met two of the three official famine thresholds: extreme food shortages for over 20% of the population and severe acute malnutrition in one-third of children. Amid Israel\u2019s blockade and ongoing conflict, starvation and malnutrition are escalating, with 79 deaths due to hunger reported in just one week\u2014surpassing numbers from the previous 21 months. Over 60,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 145,000 injured, the vast majority civilians, including over 18,000 children. \n\nThe World Food Programme has called for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access. Strict Israeli restrictions on aid, compounded by bans on international media access and attacks on local journalists, have severely hindered both relief efforts and media coverage. Families report surviving without food for days, and doctors are seeing universal malnourishment among patients.

The conflict began after a Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and has since resulted in nearly 60,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Palestinian sources, with severe food shortages worsening in Gaza. The new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has taken over aid distribution but is criticized for violating humanitarian neutrality principles.

This closure has halted the UN World Food Programme\u2019s ability to deliver food via what was its main route, cutting daily meal distributions nearly in half. Community kitchens and health clinics have shut, leaving residents facing rising food prices and severe scarcity. Displaced residents report difficulty finding essential items, including vegetables, while water access has dropped to below 25% of daily needs due to fuel shortages and security issues.\n\nAlthough Israeli officials contend that there are no limits on aid and accuse Hamas of diverting supplies, aid agencies argue that logistical and security constraints, especially post-Zikim closure, are obstructing deliveries. The UN states that nearly 40% of aid transport requests to northern Gaza have been denied. Health infrastructure is collapsing, with several malnutrition centers and hospitals shutting down or reaching capacity. UNICEF warns of worsening child malnutrition, calling the situation dire.
