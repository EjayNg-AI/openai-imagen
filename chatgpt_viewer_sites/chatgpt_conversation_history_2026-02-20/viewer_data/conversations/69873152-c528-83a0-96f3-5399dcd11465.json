What you *can* do is:\n\n- Send the **PDF (including scanned/image-only PDFs)** as an input to a **vision-capable model** via the API.\n- Prompt the model to **transcribe/convert the content into LaTeX** as plain text output.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s PDF input feature works by putting **(a) extracted text and (b) an image of each page** into the model\u2019s context. That\u2019s exactly what you want for scanned PDFs, because the page images are what the model reads when there\u2019s little/no embedded text. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nAnd **GPT-5.2 supports text + image inputs** (so it\u2019s in the class of models that can use PDF inputs). \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n### Minimal Python example (send a scanned PDF and ask for LaTeX)\n```python\nimport base64\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\npdf_path = \"scanned.pdf\"\nwith open(pdf_path, \"rb\") as f:\n    b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\nresp = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-5.2\",\n    input=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"input_file\",\n                    \"filename\": \"scanned.pdf\",\n                    \"file_data\": f\"data:application/pdf;base64,{b64}\",\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"input_text\",\n                    \"text\": (\n                        \"Convert this PDF into LaTeX. Output ONLY LaTeX.\\n\"\n                        \"- Preserve section structure.\\n\"\n                        \"- Use proper math mode for equations.\\n\"\n                        \"- If something is illegible, mark it as \\\\textbf{[ILLEGIBLE]} rather than guessing.\\n\"\n                    ),\n                },\n            ],\n        }\n    ],\n)\n\nprint(resp.output_text)\n```\n\n### Practical caveats (important)\n- **Accuracy isn\u2019t guaranteed**, especially for dense math, tables, or low-resolution scans. Expect cleanup and a verification pass.\n- PDF inputs have **size limits** (e.g., per-file and per-request caps), so large PDFs often need paging/chunking. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n- If you need *very* high-fidelity math OCR, a specialized math-OCR tool can still beat general vision models; many people use a hybrid workflow (OCR/math-OCR \u2192 LLM cleanup).\n\nIf you tell me what kind of scanned PDF it is (math notes? textbook pages? exam paper with diagrams?), I can give you a conversion + verification workflow that\u2019s robust enough for production."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":541,"end_idx":558,"safe_urls":["https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"File inputs | OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI Platform"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":663,"end_idx":680,"safe_urls":["https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"GPT-5.2 Model | OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI Platform"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":2044,"end_idx":2061,"safe_urls":["https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"File inputs | OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI Platform"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2429,"end_idx":2429,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"File inputs | OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files","attribution":"OpenAI Platform"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files","https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"File inputs | OpenAI API","snippet":"Only models that support both text and image inputs, such as gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, or o1, can accept PDF files as input.

use \\hyperref[...]{} or \\ref with \\label).\n10) If a Question has no answer in the source, still include an entry in Answers stating:\n   - \u201cAnswer not provided in source.\u201d (do not invent).\n11) Worked Examples: keep their solutions inline (do NOT move them), unless the source explicitly labels them as exercises.\n\nD) Keep it compilable and minimally invasive\n12) Preserve all math, symbols, and wording unless structural edits require tiny fixes (e.g., missing braces).\n13) Do not introduce exotic packages. You may add standard ones only if needed:\n   - hyperref, amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, geometry, graphicx (and only others if truly required).\n14) Do not change the meaning of the content.
