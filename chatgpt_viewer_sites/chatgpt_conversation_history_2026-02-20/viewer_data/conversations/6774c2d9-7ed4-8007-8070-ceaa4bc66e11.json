If the remainder is `0`, the number is divisible by 200.\n3. The `if` statement handles this condition and prints the appropriate message.\n\nYou can replace `int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))` with any number or integrate it into a loop to check a range of numbers."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"0029cd4e-bf6d-4ca0-afb3-b452996254b5","request_id":"8fafb96e6b44f906-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0029cd4e-bf6d-4ca0-afb3-b452996254b5","children":[]}}}
