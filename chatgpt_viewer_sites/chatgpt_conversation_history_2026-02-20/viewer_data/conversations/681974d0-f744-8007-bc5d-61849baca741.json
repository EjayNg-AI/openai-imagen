has recently revised its corporate structure to maintain nonprofit oversight while transitioning its for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC).\ue204 \ue203This decision reflects a strategic response to internal and external pressures, aiming to balance the organization's mission with the demands of scaling artificial general intelligence (AGI) development.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Structural Evolution: From Nonprofit to PBC\n\n**Original Framework:** \ue203Founded in 2015 as a nonprofit, OpenAI introduced a \"capped-profit\" model in 2019, creating OpenAI LP to attract investment while limiting returns to 100 times the initial investment.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Proposed Shift:** \ue203In late 2024, OpenAI proposed converting its for-profit arm into a PBC, potentially reducing nonprofit control to facilitate greater capital influx.\ue204 \ue203This move aimed to simplify the capital structure and attract substantial investments, including a $40 billion funding round.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Revised Plan:** \ue203Facing criticism from civic leaders, legal experts, and co-founder Elon Musk, OpenAI reversed course in May 2025.\ue204 \ue203The updated plan retains the nonprofit's control over the PBC, ensuring that the organization's mission remains central to its operations.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0news15\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Key Features of the New Structure\n\n- **Nonprofit Oversight:** \ue203The nonprofit parent retains control over the PBC, including the appointment of its board members.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news15\ue201\ue206\n\n- **Capital Structure:** \ue203The PBC model allows for traditional equity investments, removing the previous cap on investor returns.\ue204 \ue203This change aims to attract significant funding necessary for AGI development.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n- **Mission Alignment:** \ue203As a PBC, OpenAI is legally obligated to balance shareholder interests with its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f Implications and Considerations\n\n**Governance:** \ue203Retaining nonprofit control over the PBC is intended to safeguard OpenAI's mission.\ue204 \ue203However, the effectiveness of this oversight will depend on the nonprofit's ability to influence PBC decisions, especially as external investments increase.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Investor Relations:** \ue203The removal of profit caps may attract more investors but could also introduce pressures to prioritize financial returns over the organization's mission.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Regulatory Scrutiny:** \ue203The restructuring has drawn attention from legal authorities, including the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, who are reviewing the changes to ensure compliance with nonprofit laws.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news15\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e Forward-Looking Perspective\n\nOpenAI's revised structure represents an attempt to balance the need for substantial investment in AGI development with its foundational mission. \ue203The success of this model will depend on the nonprofit's ability to maintain meaningful oversight and the organization's commitment to its stated public benefit objectives.\ue204 \ue203As the AI industry continues to evolve, OpenAI's approach may serve as a precedent for other organizations navigating similar challenges.\ue204\ue206\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202OpenAI Retains Nonprofit Control Amid Restructuring\ue202turn0news15,turn0news16,turn0news18\ue201

This decision follows discussions with civic leaders and attorneys general in California and Delaware. CEO Sam Altman and Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI's nonprofit board, announced a new approach involving a recapitalization that will convert OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC). This structure allows the company to consider both shareholder interests and its original public mission. The nonprofit will appoint the board of the new PBC, with initial members likely drawn from the current nonprofit board.\n\nThe shift seeks to align OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth\u2014highlighted by a $300 billion market valuation and 400 million weekly ChatGPT users\u2014with its founding mission to advance artificial general intelligence (AGI) safely. The company had faced legal and ethical concerns, including a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk and scrutiny from state attorneys general. Critics have questioned whether the new structure sufficiently protects OpenAI's charitable objectives. Despite such concerns, Altman emphasized that the hybrid structure is key for securing further investment, potentially from firms like SoftBank, while ensuring accountability to public benefit rather than just shareholders.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":15}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1257,"end_idx":1258,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Amid criticism, OpenAI will keep nonprofit oversight while restructuring","url":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/openai-nonprofit-public-benefit-20311580.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746483897.0,"snippet":"OpenAI announced on Monday that it will retain control through its nonprofit organization as it transitions to a public benefit corporation, a for-profit business legally required to consider the pub...","attribution_segments":["949-1"],"supporting_websites":[{"title":"OpenAI reverses course and says its nonprofit will continue to control its business","url":"https://apnews.com/article/3dbfca4d13586debf9740e0dede8ba47?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746469019.0,"snippet":"After months of pursuing a plan to convert itself into a for-profit business, OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the company that makes ChatGPT and othe...","attribution":"AP News"},{"title":"OpenAI, facing pressure, announces its nonprofit will stay in control after all.

recent decision to retain nonprofit control over its operations marks a significant reversal from its earlier restructuring plans.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \ud83e\udded The Original Plan: Ceding Nonprofit Control\n\n\ue203In December 2024, OpenAI proposed converting its for-profit subsidiary, OpenAI LP, into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC).\ue204 \ue203This transition aimed to remove the nonprofit's controlling stake, allowing the PBC to operate independently.\ue204 \ue203The rationale was to simplify the capital structure and attract substantial investments, including a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank \ue200cite\ue202turn0news16\ue201.\ue204 \ue203Under this plan, the nonprofit would have exchanged its control for equity in the new PBC, using the proceeds to fund separate charitable initiatives.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 The Reversal: Maintaining Nonprofit Oversight\n\n\ue203By May 2025, facing mounting criticism from civic leaders, legal experts, and co-founder Elon Musk, OpenAI reversed its course.\ue204 \ue203The updated plan retains the nonprofit's control over the PBC, ensuring that the organization's mission remains central to its operations \ue200cite\ue202turn0news16\ue201.\ue204 \ue203The nonprofit will continue to appoint the PBC's board members and hold a significant equity stake, aligning financial growth with its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f Implications of the Reversal\n\n**Governance:** \ue203Retaining nonprofit control over the PBC is intended to safeguard OpenAI's mission.\ue204 \ue203However, the effectiveness of this oversight will depend on the nonprofit's ability to influence PBC decisions, especially as external investments increase.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Investor Relations:** \ue203The removal of profit caps may attract more investors but could also introduce pressures to prioritize financial returns over the organization's mission.\ue204\ue206\n\n**Regulatory Scrutiny:** \ue203The restructuring has drawn attention from legal authorities, including the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, who are reviewing the changes to ensure compliance with nonprofit laws \ue200cite\ue202turn0news16\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e Forward-Looking Perspective\n\n\ue203OpenAI's revised structure represents an attempt to balance the need for substantial investment in AGI development with its foundational mission.\ue204 \ue203The success of this model will depend on the nonprofit's ability to maintain meaningful oversight and the organization's commitment to its stated public benefit objectives.\ue204 \ue203As the AI industry continues to evolve, OpenAI's approach may serve as a precedent for other organizations navigating similar challenges.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202OpenAI Retains Nonprofit Control Amid Restructuring\ue202turn0news16,turn0news18,turn0news20\ue201

your assessment is accurate: the primary change in OpenAI's revised restructuring plan is the retention of nonprofit oversight over its for-profit operations, reversing the 2024 proposal that would have removed such oversight.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 2024 Proposal: Ceding Nonprofit Control\n\n\ue203In December 2024, OpenAI proposed converting its for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and relinquishing the nonprofit's controlling stake.\ue204 \ue203This move aimed to simplify the capital structure and attract substantial investments, including a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank.\ue204 \ue203Under this plan, the nonprofit would have exchanged its control for equity in the new PBC, using the proceeds to fund separate charitable initiatives.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 2025 Reversal: Maintaining Nonprofit Oversight\n\n\ue203By May 2025, facing mounting criticism from civic leaders, legal experts, and co-founder Elon Musk, OpenAI reversed its course.\ue204 \ue203The updated plan retains the nonprofit's control over the PBC, ensuring that the organization's mission remains central to its operations.\ue204 \ue203The nonprofit will continue to appoint the PBC's board members and hold a significant equity stake, aligning financial growth with its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f Implications of the Reversal\n\n- **Governance:** \ue203Retaining nonprofit control over the PBC is intended to safeguard OpenAI's mission.\ue204 \ue203However, the effectiveness of this oversight will depend on the nonprofit's ability to influence PBC decisions, especially as external investments increase.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Investor Relations:** \ue203The removal of profit caps may attract more investors but could also introduce pressures to prioritize financial returns over the organization's mission.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** \ue203The restructuring has drawn attention from legal authorities, including the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, who are reviewing the changes to ensure compliance with nonprofit laws.\ue204\ue206\n\n### \ud83e\udded Summary\n\n\ue203The central shift is the nonprofit's decision to maintain oversight of the PBC, contrasting with the 2024 plan that would have removed such control.\ue204 \ue203This reversal aims to balance the need for substantial investment in AGI development with OpenAI's foundational mission.\ue204 \ue203The success of this model will depend on the nonprofit's ability to maintain meaningful oversight and the organization's commitment to its stated public benefit objectives.\ue204\ue206

while the retention of nonprofit control over OpenAI's for-profit operations is the most prominent reversal from the 2024 plan, several other significant changes have been implemented in the revised 2025 restructuring.\ue204 Here's a detailed comparison:\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Key Differences Between the 2024 Plan and the 2025 Restructuring\n\n#### 1. **Governance Structure**\n\n- **2024 Plan:** \ue203OpenAI proposed converting its for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and relinquishing the nonprofit's controlling stake.\ue204 \ue203This move aimed to simplify the capital structure and attract substantial investments, including a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n- **2025 Restructuring:** \ue203OpenAI reversed its course, deciding to maintain the nonprofit's control over the PBC.\ue204 \ue203The nonprofit will continue to appoint the PBC's board members and hold a significant equity stake, ensuring that the organization's mission remains central to its operations.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n#### 2. **Investor Return Structure**\n\n- **2024 Plan:** \ue203The for-profit arm operated under a \"capped-profit\" model, limiting investor returns to 100 times their investment.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n- **2025 Restructuring:** \ue203The capped-profit model has been removed.\ue204 \ue203Investors and employees will now own regular stock with no cap on appreciation, aiming to attract more capital to support the high costs of developing and distributing artificial general intelligence (AGI).\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n#### 3. **Equity Distribution**\n\n- **2024 Plan:** \ue203The nonprofit would have exchanged its control for equity in the new PBC, using the proceeds to fund separate charitable initiatives.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n- **2025 Restructuring:** \ue203The nonprofit will become a significant shareholder in the PBC, with its stake expected to grow as the PBC's valuation increases.\ue204 \ue203This structure aims to align financial growth with the mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n#### 4. **Regulatory Oversight**\n\n- **2024 Plan:** \ue203The plan faced criticism from civic leaders, legal experts, and co-founder Elon Musk, who argued that OpenAI strayed from its mission to benefit humanity with AGI.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news21\ue201\ue206\n\n- **2025 Restructuring:** \ue203The decision to retain nonprofit control came after discussions with civic leaders and the Attorneys General of California and Delaware.\ue204 \ue203The California Department of Justice is reviewing the new proposed plan to ensure compliance with nonprofit laws.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n#### 5. **Mission Alignment**\n\n- **2024 Plan:** \ue203Critics expressed concerns that removing nonprofit control could undermine OpenAI's mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news21\ue201\ue206\n\n- **2025 Restructuring:** \ue203CEO Sam Altman emphasized that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring AGI benefits all humanity.\ue204 \ue203He noted that OpenAI needs potentially trillions of dollars to fulfill its mission and deliver democratized AI tools such as ChatGPT.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Summary\n\n\ue203While the retention of nonprofit control is the most notable change from the 2024 plan, the 2025 restructuring also includes significant adjustments to investor return structures, equity distribution, regulatory oversight, and reaffirmation of OpenAI's mission.\ue204 \ue203These changes aim

This move aims to attract the capital necessary to remain competitive in the fast-evolving AI sector. The restructuring allows OpenAI to increase fundraising capabilities while retaining oversight by its nonprofit parent, which will be a major shareholder in the updated entity.\n\nThis decision follows legal scrutiny and criticism, notably from co-founder Elon Musk, who filed a lawsuit alleging OpenAI had deviated from its mission to benefit humanity. The company confirmed collaboration with Microsoft, regulators, and new nonprofit commissioners to finalize the plan.\n\nCEO Sam Altman and Board Chairman Bret Taylor emphasized that the updated structure closely mirrors the current one and is designed to satisfy investors while preserving the company\u2019s foundational mission. OpenAI seeks to raise up to $40 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank at a $300 billion valuation, which remains feasible under the revised plan.\n\nDespite this, analysts warned that controlling interest by the nonprofit could constrain aggressive capital-raising efforts. Musk\u2019s lawsuit and a $97.4 billion takeover bid he led remain unresolved, adding further intrigue to OpenAI\u2019s governance future.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746475256.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"indianexpress.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/openai-scraps-plan-to-restructure-into-for-profit-company-9984869/","title":"OpenAI scraps plan to restructure into for-profit company","snippet":"In March, OpenAI secured $40 billion in funding from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which committed $30 billion directly.

abandons plan to become a for-profit company","snippet":"OpenAI has decided to abandon its plan to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit company following discussions with civic leaders and oversight from the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. Instead, it will transition its for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), aligning with similar shifts by other AI organizations like Anthropic and xAI. The restructure removes the previous cap on investor returns, allowing OpenAI to raise more capital to support the high costs of developing and distributing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Control will remain with the nonprofit board, which will appoint the PBC\u2019s board and obtain a significant and growing equity stake as the PBC\u2019s valuation increases.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring AGI benefits all humanity. He noted that OpenAI needs potentially trillions of dollars to fulfill its mission and deliver democratized AI tools such as ChatGPT. While the company adapts its structure for growth and broader access, Altman reaffirmed OpenAI\u2019s foundational commitment to public benefit over profit maximization and to open, minimally restricted access to its technologies. The California Attorney General's office continues to review the revised corporate structure.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746471096.0,"attribution":"The Verge"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/openai-s-nonprofit-will-retain-control-of-company-after-pushback","title":"OpenAI Walks Back For-Profit Plan, Nonprofit to Keep Control","snippet":"OpenAI also announced it will remove a cap on the financial returns its investors can earn, a move likely to appeal to current and future ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746473984.486937,"attribution":"Bloomberg"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/openai-reverses-course-says-its-nonprofit-will-remain-in-control-of-its-business-operations/","title":"OpenAI reverses course, says its nonprofit will remain in control of its ...","snippet":"OpenAI has decided that its nonprofit division will retain control over its for-profit organization, after the company initially announced ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746466784.506167,"attribution":"TechCrunch"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.usnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2025-05-05/openai-reverses-course-and-says-its-nonprofit-will-continue-to-control-its-business","title":"OpenAI Reverses Course and Says Its Nonprofit Will Continue to ...","snippet":"Among the changes would be removing a cap OpenAI had placed on how much profit it could make. \u201cThere's so much more demand to use AI tools ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746470384.493762,"attribution":"US News"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"money.usnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2025-05-05/openai-to-remain-under-non-profit-control-in-change-of-restructuring-plans","title":"OpenAI Dials Back Conversion Plan, Nonprofit to Retain Control","snippet":"(Reuters) -OpenAI has dialed back a significant restructuring plan, with its nonprofit parent retaining control in a move that is likely to ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746466784.506167,"attribution":"U.S. News Money"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.astralcodexten.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/openai-nonprofit-buyout-much-more","title":"OpenAI Nonprofit Buyout: Much More Than You Wanted To Know","snippet":"This subsidary was supposedly a \u201ccapped forprofit\u201d, meaning that their investors were capped at 100x return -

will continue to be controlled by nonprofit amid restructuring scrutiny","snippet":"OpenAI has revised its restructuring plan to ensure its for-profit subsidiary remains under the control of its nonprofit parent organization, amid legal and public scrutiny. The move is partly in response to a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk, who argued that OpenAI strayed from its mission to benefit humanity with artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the decision prioritizes the organization's mission rather than addressing Musk\u2019s legal challenge. The restructuring includes converting the for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC), committed to both mission and shareholder interests. This arrangement aims to reinforce the nonprofit's oversight and ensure adherence to OpenAI's founding goals.

Those two tweaks\u2014mission oversight plus uncapped equity\u2014pull SoftBank in opposite directions: governance is now slightly tighter than it expected, but the upside is far higher.  The net effect is that SoftBank is unlikely to walk away, but the price of its money will rise and the term sheet will change.  Below is a deeper look at why.\n\n## 1  SoftBank\u2019s position before and after the U-turn  \n\n### 1.1  What SoftBank thought it was buying  \n* **March 2025 term sheet** \u2013 SoftBank agreed to lead up to a $40 billion round at a ~$300 billion valuation, but included a clause cutting its commitment by $20 billion if OpenAI failed to become a fully independent for-profit by end-2025 \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201.  \n* The attraction was two-fold: (i) the chance to own ordinary stock with theoretically unlimited upside once the 100-\u00d7 cap vanished, and (ii) looser nonprofit veto rights that would let SoftBank influence strategy directly.  \n\n### 1.2  What actually changed  \n* **Nonprofit retains board control** \u2013 OpenAI\u2019s parent will continue to appoint the PBC\u2019s directors and hold a \u201csignificant and growing\u201d equity stake \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn1view3\ue201.  \n* **Profit cap scrapped** \u2013 investors and employees now get normal stock; potential upside is no longer fixed \ue200cite\ue202turn3news9\ue202turn3search1\ue201.  \n* **SoftBank still referenced by OpenAI insiders as an anchor investor** \u2013 management says the compromise is \u201cwell over the bar\u201d needed for current backers to stay in \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201, and an insider told *Business Insider* the revision \u201cwill satisfy requirements\u201d tied to SoftBank\u2019s cheque \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201.  \n\n## 2  Implications for the SoftBank-OpenAI relationship  \n\n### 2.1  Negotiating leverage tilts to SoftBank  \nSoftBank\u2019s conditional clause gives it an automatic reason to reopen price and governance talks.  Because the nonprofit now keeps final say, SoftBank may seek:  \n\n| SoftBank ask | Rationale | Likely outcome |\n|--------------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Observer or super-majority board seat** | Balance nonprofit veto | Possible but only in a minority/observer role |\n| **Ratchet or downside-protection warrants** | Offset mission-driven decisions that cap profitability | Highly probable |\n| **Enhanced disclosure & audit rights** | Mitigate asymmetric information risk | Almost certain |\n\nThe nonprofit, eager for the $30 billion net cash SoftBank still promises \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue201, is incentivised to concede on economics rather than on governance, leading to a \u201cprice-over-power\u201d compromise.\n\n### 2.2  SoftBank\u2019s strategy aligns despite added friction  \nMasayoshi Son has publicly declared a pivot to \u201cArtificial Super-Intelligence\u201d bets and is already syndicating pieces of the OpenAI deal to other Vision Fund LPs to manage risk \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn5view0\ue201.  Vision Fund 3\u2019s thesis is to write mega-cheques where capital intensity is a feature, not a bug.  OpenAI\u2019s need for \u201cpotentially trillions\u201d in compute and data centres fits that playbook \ue200cite\ue202turn3news9\ue202turn0news44\ue201.\n\n## 3  Broader fund-raising outlook (2025-2028)\n\n### 3.1  Positives  \n1. **Uncapped equity** \u2013 removes the single biggest deterrent for late-stage and sovereign-wealth investors who balked at a 100 \u00d7 ceiling \ue200cite\ue202turn3news9\ue201.  \n2. **PBC branding** \u2013 mainstream LPs increasingly view PBCs (e.g., Anthropic, Patagonia) as ESG-friendly structures; this broadens the pool beyond pure-tech VC to impact funds \ue200cite\ue202turn13news9\ue201.  \n3. **Microsoft precedent** \u2013 existing $13 billion strategic backing shows corporates are comfortable operating under nonprofit oversight, so the template is proven \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201.\n\n### 3.2  Headwinds  \n1. **Regulatory drag** \u2013 the California and Delaware AG reviews remain active and could impose reporting or golden-share restrictions that make future equity rounds slower and more lawyer-heavy \ue200cite\ue202turn13search1\ue202turn13search3\ue201.  \n2. **Mission-profit tension** \u2013 critics argue a PBC board must weigh shareholder value; if the nonprofit blocks a high-profit but societally risky product, investors may sue \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201.  \n3. **SoftBank signalling** \u2013 if SoftBank pushes for softer mission covenants and fails, that negative signal could chill follow-on investors.\n\n### 3.3  Capital-raising scenarios  \n\n| Scenario (2026-27) | Probability | Funding capacity | Notes |\n|--------------------|-------------|------------------|-------|\n| **Baseline: SoftBank stays, valuation cut 10-15 %** | 55 % | $30-35 bn | Renegotiated terms but deal closes; opens door to Gulf SWFs |\n| **Optimistic: Nonprofit grants SoftBank a board observer; valuation intact** | 25 % | $40 bn+ | Minimal friction; SoftBank PR wins; faster close |\n| **Pessimistic: SoftBank halves commitment; Middle-East funds step in** | 15 % | $15-20 bn | Longer raise; higher dilution; slower infra rollout |\n| **Regulatory shock: AG imposes mission lock-box** | 5 % | <$10 bn | Raises shift to debt-like structures or compute-sharing JVs |\n\n## 4  Bottom line  \n\nThe structural compromise is a double-edged sword.  For SoftBank it reduces governance influence but preserves huge economic optionality; the firm\u2019s risk-seeking DNA and public commitment to AI make withdrawal unlikely.  For OpenAI, retaining mission control fends off reputational risk yet still unlocks uncapped equity\u2014a trade-off that should keep the SoftBank money (and others) flowing, albeit at a steeper cost of capital and under heavier legal scrutiny in the next funding cycles."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201","start_idx":892,"end_idx":909,"safe_urls":["https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/openai-scraps-plan-to-restructure-into-for-profit-company-9984869/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/openai-scraps-plan-to-restructure-into-for-profit-company-9984869/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI scraps plan to restructure into for-profit company | Technology News - The Indian Express","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/openai-scraps-plan-to-restructure-into-for-profit-company-9984869/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Indian Express"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn1view3\ue201","start_idx":1324,"end_idx":1352,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/05/openai-non-profit-elon-musk"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/05/openai-non-profit-elon-musk))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI dials back conversion plan, nonprofit to retain control | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"OpenAI reverses course and says non-profit arm will retain control of firm | Technology | The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/05/openai-non-profit-elon-musk","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3news9\ue202turn3search1\ue201","start_idx":1466,"end_idx":1496,"safe_urls":["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/openai-s-nonprofit-will-retain-control-of-company-after-pushback?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theverge.com/openai/661303/openai-stays-nonprofit-sam-altman-employee-memo?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/openai/661303/openai-stays-nonprofit-sam-altman-employee-memo?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/openai-s-nonprofit-will-retain-control-of-company-after-pushback?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI abandons plan to become a for-profit company","url":"https://www.theverge.com/openai/661303/openai-stays-nonprofit-sam-altman-employee-memo?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746471096.0,"snippet":"OpenAI has decided to abandon its plan to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit company following discussions with civic leaders and oversight from the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. Instead, it will transition its for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), aligning with similar shifts by other AI organizations like Anthropic and xAI. The restructure removes the previous cap on investor returns, allowing OpenAI to raise more capital to support the high costs of developing and distributing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Control will remain with the nonprofit board, which will appoint the PBC\u2019s board and obtain a significant and growing equity stake as the PBC\u2019s valuation increases.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring AGI benefits all humanity.

Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. \r\nOur for-profit LLC, which has been under the nonprofit since 2019, will transition to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)\u2013a purpose-driven company structure that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission.\r\nThe nonprofit will control and also be a large shareholder of the PBC, giving the nonprofit better resources to support many benefits. \r\nOur mission remains the same, and the PBC will have the same mission.\r\nWe made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California. We thank both offices and we look forward to continuing these important conversations to make sure OpenAI can continue to effectively pursue its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity. Sam wrote the letter below to our employees and stakeholders about why we are so excited for this new direction.\u2014Bret Taylor\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nSam\u2019s Letter to Employees.\r\nOpenAI is not a normal company and never will be.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhen we started OpenAI, we did not have a detailed sense for how we were going to accomplish our mission. We started out staring at each other around a kitchen table, wondering what research we should do. Back then, we did not contemplate products, a business model. We could not contemplate the direct benefits of AI being used for medical advice, learning, productivity, and much more, or the needs for hundreds of billions of dollars of compute to train models and serve users.\r\n\r\nWe did not really know how AGI was going to get built, or used. A lot of people could imagine an oracle that could tell scientists and presidents what to do, and although it could be incredibly dangerous, maybe those few people could be trusted with it.\r\n\r\nA lot of people around OpenAI in the early days thought AI should only be in the hands of a few trusted people who could \u201chandle it\u201d. \r\n\r\nWe now see a way for AGI to directly empower everyone as the most capable tool in human history. If we can do this, we believe people will build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward. It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to this path of democratic AI. We want to put incredible tools in the hands of everyone. We are amazed and delighted by what they are creating with our tools, and how much they want to use them. We want to open source very capable models. We want to give our users a great deal of freedom in how we let them use our tools within broad boundaries, even if we don\u2019t always share the same moral framework, and to let our users make decisions about the behavior of ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is the best path forward\u2014AGI should enable all of humanity to benefit each other. We realize some people have very different opinions.\r\n\r\nWe want to build a brain for the world and make it super easy for people to use for whatever they want (subject to few restrictions; freedom shouldn\u2019t impinge on other people\u2019s freedom, for example). \r\n\r\nPeople are using ChatGPT to increase their productivity as scientists, coders, and much more\u2060(opens in a new window). People are using ChatGPT to solve serious healthcare challenges they are facing and learn more than ever before. People are using ChatGPT to get advice about how to handle difficult situations. We are very proud to offer a service that is doing so much for so many people; it is the one of most direct fulfillments of our mission we can imagine. \r\n\r\nBut they want to use it much more; we currently cannot supply nearly as much AI as the world wants and we have to put usage limits on our systems and run them slowly. As the systems become more capable, they will want to use it even more, for even more wonderful things. \r\n\r\nWe had no idea this was going to be the state of the world when we launched our research lab almost a decade ago. But now that we see this picture, we are thrilled.\r\n\r\nIt is time for us to evolve our structure. There are three things we want to accomplish:\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to operate and get resources in such a way that we can make our services broadly available to all of humanity, which currently requires hundreds of billions of dollars and may eventually require trillions of dollars. We believe this is the best way for us to fulfill our mission and to get people to create massive benefits for each other with these new tools.\r\nWe want our nonprofit to be the largest and most effective nonprofit in history that will be focused on using AI to enable the highest-leverage outcomes for people.\r\nWe want to deliver beneficial AGI. This includes contributing to the shape of safety and alignment; we are proud of our track record with the systems we have launched, the alignment research we have done, processes like red teaming, and transparency into model behavior with innovations like the model spec\u2060(opens in a new window). As AI accelerates, our commitment to safety grows stronger. We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI.\r\nWe made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. We look forward to advancing the details of this plan in continued conversation with them, Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners.\r\n\r\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, is today a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit. That will not change.\r\n\r\nThe for-profit LLC under the nonprofit will transition to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) with the same mission. PBCs have become the standard for-profit structure for other AGI labs like Anthropic and X.ai, as well as many purpose driven companies like Patagonia. We think it makes sense for us, too.\r\n\r\nInstead of our current complex capped-profit structure\u2014which made sense when it looked like there might be one dominant AGI effort but doesn\u2019t in a world of many great AGI companies\u2014we are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock. This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\r\n\r\nThe nonprofit will continue to control the PBC, and will become a big shareholder in the PBC, in an amount supported by independent financial advisors, giving the nonprofit resources to support programs so AI can benefit many different communities, consistent with the mission. And as the PBC grows, the nonprofit\u2019s resources will grow, so it can do even more. We\u2019re excited to soon get recommendations from our nonprofit commission on how we can help make sure AI benefits everyone\u2014not just a few. Their ideas will focus on how our nonprofit work can support a more democratic AI future, and have real impact in areas like health, education, public services, and scientific discovery. \r\n\r\nWe believe this sets us up to continue to make rapid, safe progress and to put great AI in the hands of everyone. Creating AGI is our brick in the path of human progress; we can\u2019t wait to see what bricks you will add next.\r\n\r\nSam Altman\r\nMay

will continue to be controlled by nonprofit amid restructuring scrutiny","snippet":"OpenAI has revised its restructuring plan to ensure its for-profit subsidiary remains under the control of its nonprofit parent organization, amid legal and public scrutiny. The move is partly in response to a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk, who argued that OpenAI strayed from its mission to benefit humanity with artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the decision prioritizes the organization's mission rather than addressing Musk\u2019s legal challenge. The restructuring includes converting the for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC), committed to both mission and shareholder interests. This arrangement aims to reinforce the nonprofit's oversight and ensure adherence to OpenAI's founding goals. California Attorney General Rob Bonta's office is reviewing the new plan, while civic leaders and former employees continue to question whether OpenAI's commercial interests legally remain subordinate to its charitable mission. Nonprofit coalitions have echoed concerns about mission drift and urged further investigation. Despite the controversy, OpenAI insists the updated structure bolsters its capacity to deliver on its public-interest mission while engaging transparently with stakeholders.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746471754.309,"attribution":"Politico"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/","title":"OpenAI dials back conversion plan, nonprofit to retain control - Reuters","snippet":"On Monday, OpenAI said the nonprofit parent would continue to control the PBC and become a big shareholder in it.

Publicly, the documents project continuity (\u201cthe nonprofit will remain in control\u201d) while quietly admitting that the company must abandon its five-year-old capped-profit model and seek \u201chundreds of billions, maybe trillions\u201d of dollars to keep pace in the AGI race.  The tone is markedly more candid than earlier statements, yet still selective: it openly concedes massive capital needs and regulatory pressure, but it sidesteps specific investor concessions and the details of Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit.  Below is a close reading of the text, set against external reporting and prior announcements.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Context and Key Announcements  \n\nOpenAI confirms three headline moves:  \n* **Conversion of the for-profit LLC into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC).** The PBC must balance shareholder value with the mission, mirroring structures at Anthropic and xAI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n* **Nonprofit retains control and acquires a \u201clarge\u201d equity stake.** This reverses a December 2024 proposal that would have ceded oversight to a fully independent PBC. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n* **Elimination of the 100\u00d7 investor-return cap.** Altman characterises the new equity as \u201cnormal stock,\u201d a move Reuters, Politico and The Verge interpret as designed to keep SoftBank\u2019s planned $40 billion round alive. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1news6\ue201  \n\nRegulators in California and Delaware are scrutinising the deal, and their early feedback shaped the final structure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn2news10\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2  Tone and Nuance of the Press Release  \n\n### 2.1  Conciliatory framing  \nBoard chair Bret Taylor opens by crediting \u201ccivic leaders\u201d and the two attorneys-general, implicitly acknowledging that political and legal pressure forced the U-turn. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 The language is diplomatic\u2014there is no mention of Musk\u2019s lawsuit or SoftBank\u2019s funding conditions\u2014even though both were central in media coverage. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \n\n### 2.2  Selective transparency  \nThe press release discloses the nonprofit\u2019s future shareholding but omits dilution, governance-override thresholds, or whether investors will be granted observer seats.  These omissions are notable given SoftBank\u2019s reported desire for stronger board rights after the reversal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 3  Candor and Self-Reflection in Altman\u2019s Letter  \n\n### 3.1  Admission of past uncertainty  \nAltman recounts the \u201ckitchen-table\u201d origins of OpenAI, admitting the founders had no product plan or funding model and were unsure \u201chow AGI was going to get built, or used.\u201d  This retrospective humility contrasts with earlier promotional rhetoric and reads as a rare public concession of early strategic vagueness. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n### 3.2  Explicit cost disclosure  \nThe letter states that fulfilling the mission will \u201ccurrently require hundreds of billions of dollars and may eventually require trillions.\u201d  That level of candor about capital need is unusual in Silicon-Valley founder letters and appears aimed at justifying the removal of the profit cap.  External outlets immediately linked the number to SoftBank\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s willingness to inject more cash. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news6\ue202turn2news10\ue201  \n\n### 3.3  Shift from elitist to democratic rhetoric  \nAltman contrasts early internal views\u2014AI in the hands of \u201ca few trusted people\u201d\u2014with a current commitment to \u201cdemocratic AI\u201d and open-sourcing \u201cvery capable models.\u201d  This rhetorical pivot seeks to defuse criticism that OpenAI has become commercially secretive since GPT-4. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n\n### 3.4  Moral self-positioning  \nThe letter frames OpenAI as a bulwark against \u201cauthoritarian AI,\u201d implicitly casting rivals (notably Chinese state-backed labs) as the alternative.  This binary framing is aspirational but glosses over complex geopolitics and potential Western misuse. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news11\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4  Addressing Complex and Evolving Issues  \n\n| Issue acknowledged | Depth of treatment | Notable nuance |\n|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Regulatory oversight** | Names both AG offices, pledges \u201ccontinued conversation.\u201d | Signals cooperation but not the concrete concessions regulators demanded. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue201 |\n| **Capital vs. mission tension** | Notes need for huge funding and insists mission unchanged. | Does not specify investor safeguards beyond the PBC label. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201 |\n| **Safety and alignment** | Highlights model spec, red-teaming, and transparency. | Omits the board-level safety disagreements that led to the 2023 governance crisis. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search6\ue201 |\n| **Criticism of mission drift** | Implicitly referenced through \u201cdifferent opinions.\u201d | Declines to mention Musk suit or coalition letters calling for antitrust scrutiny. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue201 |\n\nOverall, the documents show **willingness to surface previously unspoken challenges (funding scale, early confusion)** while **deflecting the most contentious legal and investor details**.\n\n---\n\n## 5  Strategic Messaging to Stakeholders  \n\n* **Investors** hear that upside is now uncapped and the structure \u201csimpler,\u201d reducing legal uncertainty around capped-profit shares.  That message is meant to calm SoftBank and sovereign-wealth LPs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n* **Employees** are told \u201cOpenAI is not a normal company and never will be,\u201d reaffirming the mission and hinting they will also get ordinary equity instead of capped units\u2014an implicit retention tool in a hot talent market. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news6\ue201  \n* **Regulators and critics** are offered deference (\u201cwe thank both offices\u201d) and structural concessions, but little hard evidence of enforcement mechanisms beyond board appointment powers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn2news11\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 6  Potential Omissions and Ambiguities  \n\n1. **Governance mechanics:**  No detail on veto rights, golden shares, or how mission violations would be adjudicated.  \n2. **SoftBank term sheet revisions:**  Letter is silent on whether valuation or board seats will change.  Reuters reports renegotiation is underway. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news10\ue201  \n3. **Profit-sharing with the nonprofit:**  The phrase \u201csupported by independent financial advisors\u201d signals a valuation process but offers no formula for dividend flow to charitable work.  \n\nThese gaps may fuel further scrutiny from the California DOJ and watchdog groups. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 7  Overall Evaluation  \n\nThe press release and Altman\u2019s letter are **more candid than earlier OpenAI communications**, openly acknowledging massive capital needs, regulatory engagement, and past strategic uncertainty.

The restructure removes the previous cap on investor returns, allowing OpenAI to raise more capital to support the high costs of developing and distributing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Control will remain with the nonprofit board, which will appoint the PBC\u2019s board and obtain a significant and growing equity stake as the PBC\u2019s valuation increases.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring AGI benefits all humanity. He noted that OpenAI needs potentially trillions of dollars to fulfill its mission and deliver democratized AI tools such as ChatGPT.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the decision prioritizes the organization's mission rather than addressing Musk\u2019s legal challenge.

Critics argue the shift compromises OpenAI\u2019s ethical commitments and safety standards. The restructuring attempts to balance the need for massive capital investment with OpenAI\u2019s original vision. CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the mission remains unchanged, highlighting the growing societal benefits of AI. However, some advocacy groups and legal authorities, including the California and Delaware attorneys general, are scrutinizing the new model, questioning whether the nonprofit will genuinely exert independent oversight.

The company confirmed collaboration with Microsoft, regulators, and new nonprofit commissioners to finalize the plan.\n\nCEO Sam Altman and Board Chairman Bret Taylor emphasized that the updated structure closely mirrors the current one and is designed to satisfy investors while preserving the company\u2019s foundational mission. OpenAI seeks to raise up to $40 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank at a $300 billion valuation, which remains feasible under the revised plan.\n\nDespite this, analysts warned that controlling interest by the nonprofit could constrain aggressive capital-raising efforts.

Instead, it will transition its for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), aligning with similar shifts by other AI organizations like Anthropic and xAI. The restructure removes the previous cap on investor returns, allowing OpenAI to raise more capital to support the high costs of developing and distributing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Control will remain with the nonprofit board, which will appoint the PBC\u2019s board and obtain a significant and growing equity stake as the PBC\u2019s valuation increases.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring AGI benefits all humanity. He noted that OpenAI needs potentially trillions of dollars to fulfill its mission and deliver democratized AI tools such as ChatGPT. While the company adapts its structure for growth and broader access, Altman reaffirmed OpenAI\u2019s foundational commitment to public benefit over profit maximization and to open, minimally restricted access to its technologies. The California Attorney General's office continues to review the revised corporate structure.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746471096.0,"attribution":"The Verge"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/","title":"OpenAI dials back conversion plan, nonprofit to retain control - Reuters","snippet":"It announced in March it would raise up to $40 billion in a new funding round led by SoftBank Group (9984.T) , opens new tab, at a $300 billion ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746497768.428302,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musks-xai-buys-social-media-platform-x-45-billion-2025-03-28/","title":"Musk's social media firm X bought by his AI company, valued at $33 ...","snippet":"Musk's xAI startup was launched less than two years ago and recently raised $10 billion in a funding round that valued the company at $75 ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743206400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.anthropic.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation","title":"Anthropic raises Series E at $61.5B post-money valuation","snippet":"Anthropic has raised $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation.

The war in Ukraine and changing U.S. foreign policy, particularly under former President Trump, have prompted many to prioritize strengthening European security and autonomy. Despite lower salaries than those in the U.S., companies like Comand AI, Alpine Eagle, and Helsing are attracting talent from major tech firms and universities. Funding in European defense startups surged to $626 million in 2024, up dramatically from $62 million in 2022, reflecting rising interest and investment amid increasing European military budgets. Startups are recruiting both experienced professionals and new graduates, who view their work as contributing to the defense of democracy. Events like hackathons have further fueled this ecosystem. Ethical concerns about AI's role in warfare remain, but the drive for mission-focused, meaningful work is drawing many to the sector, signaling a significant shift in the AI talent landscape in Europe.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745989974.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.linkedin.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/large-language-model-llm-engineer-salary-guide-2025-what-60myc","title":"Large Language Model ( LLM ) Engineer Salary Guide 2025","snippet":"Bonus structures, stock options, and signing bonuses can add another $30,000 to $100,000+ to annual compensation, especially at top-tier ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743984000.0,"attribution":"LinkedIn"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/anthropic-launches-a-program-to-support-scientific-research/","title":"Anthropic launches a program to support scientific research","snippet":"The program, announced Monday, will offer up to $20,000 in Anthropic API credits over a six-month period to \u201cqualified\u201d researchers who'll be ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746465381.935943,"attribution":"TechCrunch"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.analyticsvidhya.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/generative-ai-salary-trends/","title":"Generative AI Salary Trends 2025 Edition - Analytics Vidhya","snippet":"Average pay for AI engineers is about \u20b9800,000 per year\u200b (roughly $10k\u2013$12k USD).

The restructure removes the previous cap on investor returns, allowing OpenAI to raise more capital to support the high costs of developing and distributing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Control will remain with the nonprofit board, which will appoint the PBC\u2019s board and obtain a significant and growing equity stake as the PBC\u2019s valuation increases.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring AGI benefits all humanity. He noted that OpenAI needs potentially trillions of dollars to fulfill its mission and deliver democratized AI tools such as ChatGPT.

Bottom Line\n\nThe structural U-turn gives OpenAI three concrete competitive gains:\n\n1. **Recruiting parity**\u2014uncapped equity plus non-profit halo undercuts Anthropic\u2019s and xAI\u2019s best talking points on both pay and purpose.  \n2. **Massive, regulator-approved fundraising**\u2014a clearer legal wrapper makes $100 bn-plus datacentre schemes financeable, preserving compute dominance.  \n3. **Political cover**\u2014retained non-profit control comforts U.S. and EU policymakers just as safety regulations tighten.\n\nAnthropic still erodes OpenAI\u2019s technical edge on specialised tasks, and xAI\u2019s deep pockets plus Twitter-scale data give it a shot at leap-frogging in reasoning benchmarks.  But with the capital-and-comp reset, **OpenAI is better positioned than six months ago to stay in front of the frontier-lab pack and steer the trajectory toward its version of AGI.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":1294,"end_idx":1311,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI dials back conversion plan, nonprofit to retain control | Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7search3\ue202turn7news19\ue201","start_idx":1474,"end_idx":1505,"safe_urls":["https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theverge.com/openai/661303/openai-stays-nonprofit-sam-altman-employee-memo?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/openai/661303/openai-stays-nonprofit-sam-altman-employee-memo?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Announcing The Stargate Project | OpenAI","url":"https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1737417600.0,"snippet":"The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI"},{"title":"OpenAI abandons plan to become a for-profit company","url":"https://www.theverge.com/openai/661303/openai-stays-nonprofit-sam-altman-employee-memo?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746471096.0,"snippet":"OpenAI has decided to abandon its plan to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit company following discussions with civic leaders and oversight from the Attorneys General of California and Delaware.
