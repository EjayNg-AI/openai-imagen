\"geostrategic climate change.\"\ue204 \ue203He noted a shift from unipolarity to multipolarity, from free trade to protectionism, and from multilateralism to unilateralism.\ue204 \ue203These changes, he emphasized, introduce profound unpredictability, instability, and volatility into global affairs.\ue204 \ue203Such a transition poses challenges for small, trade-dependent nations like Singapore,

repercussions of these global shifts, including the potential for trade wars and disruptions to supply chains.\ue204 \ue203He underscored that Singapore's economic model, characterized by trust, openness, and a level playing field, is essential for navigating these challenges.\ue204 \ue203Maintaining these principles is crucial for the nation's continued prosperity amidst a more fragmented

importance of upholding a rules-based international order and respecting international law.\ue204 \ue203He advocated for Singapore to remain nimble, seizing opportunities that arise from changing circumstances while avoiding potential pitfalls.\ue204 \ue203This approach involves maintaining strong diplomatic ties, advocating for multilateralism, and ensuring that Singapore's foreign policy is
