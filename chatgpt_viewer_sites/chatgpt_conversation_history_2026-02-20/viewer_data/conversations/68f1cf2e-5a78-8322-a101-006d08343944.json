In Singapore, the universe is somewhat limited, but there *are* a few contenders. Before listing, here are caveats and criteria to scrutinize:\n\n---\n\n## Key screening criteria you should check\n\nWhen evaluating such funds, you should look at:\n\n1. **Duration / effective maturity** \u2014 preferably \u2264 2-3 years (or shorter, depending on your risk tolerance).  \n2. **Credit quality / rating profile** \u2014 mostly investment grade (e.g. BBB and above) or government-backed bonds.  \n3. **Liquidity / redemptions** \u2014 daily dealing is preferable, avoid lockups.  \n4. **Currency risk** \u2014 for Singapore investors, SGD-denominated or hedged units are better to reduce FX risk.  \n5. **Fees / expenses** \u2014 lower TER helps, particularly for low-yield strategies.  \n6. **Track record & fund size** \u2014 longevity, scale, consistent management.  \n\n---\n\n## Candidate funds in/available to Singapore investors\n\nHere are some unit trusts / bond funds in Singapore (or distributed there) that lean toward your \u201chigh quality, short duration\u201d aim. None is perfect, and you\u2019ll have to dig into the latest factsheet for duration, credit composition, etc.\n\n| Fund | Highlights / why it\u2019s relevant | Points to check / caveats |\n|---|---|---|\n| **LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund** | Actively managed, invests in Singapore and international bonds, specifically marketed for \u201cshort duration\u201d exposure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search37\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search1\ue201 | Its effective duration was modest (around 1.48 yrs in a past reference) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201 \u2014 check the latest. Also check the credit mix (some lower-grade exposure might be present). |\n| **Nikko AM Shenton Short Term Bond Fund (SGD class)** | The mandate is to preserve capital and liquidity, invest in quality short-term bonds and money market instruments. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search27\ue202turn0search2\ue201 | \u201cShort-term\u201d is somewhat vague \u2014 look at max maturity / weighted avg maturity, and credit breakdown. |\n| **United SGD Fund (UOBAM)** | This is a more conservative, SGD fixed income fund with good reputation in Singapore. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search11\ue201 | It might not strictly be \u201cshort duration\u201d \u2014 check its duration and how much exposure to longer bonds. |\n| **AB Short Duration Bond Portfolio** | Global fund that seeks high total return via investment grade fixed income, oriented to short duration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue201 | Because it\u2019s global, currency hedging and regional credit risk matters. Also, verify what \u201cshort duration\u201d means in the mandate. |\n| **HSBC GIF \u2013 Ultra Short Duration Bond** | The sub-fund aims to invest in bonds and money market instruments whose average duration **is not expected to exceed 1 year** (i.e. true ultra-short) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue201 | But because it\u2019s distributed globally, check whether there's a Singapore-distributor class (SGD). Also confirm credit quality and costs. |\n\n---\n\n## Observations & Comments\n\n- The **LionGlobal** fund is one of the more directly relevant funds marketed as \u201cshort duration.\u201d  \n- Many bond funds in Singapore are more \u201cintermediate\u201d duration or \u201ccore bond\u201d rather than strict short duration.  \n- Some funds (e.g. AB Short Duration, HSBC Ultra Short Duration) are global; you\u2019ll need to consider currency hedging, tax, access and class variants.  \n- The tradeoff is yield: shorter duration tends to deliver lower yields (but lower sensitivity).  \n- As of recent data, the LionGlobal Short Duration fund had a yield-to-maturity ~3.18 % and an effective duration of ~2.25 years for its ETF share class version; but that includes cash and securities mixture. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can pull up **all** the short-duration SGD / Singapore-available fixed income unit trusts currently open for subscription (with latest duration, yield, fees) and send you a ranked list. Want me to do that for your investment horizon (e.g. 1\u20132 yrs)?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search37\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":1551,"end_idx":1611,"safe_urls":["https://endowus.com/investment-funds-list/lion-global-short-duration-bond-fund-SG9999016026?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://growbeansprout.com/bond-funds-guide-singapore?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/fund-lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-active-etf-sgd-class.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/unit-trusts/funds-details.page?fundCode=SGBF&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Lion Global Investors](https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/fund-lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-active-etf-sgd-class.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund (Active ETF SGD Class)","url":"https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/fund-lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-active-etf-sgd-class.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund (Active ETF SGD Class) is Singapore's first active bond ETF and first listed share class of an existing fund.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"lionglobal short duration bond fund class a (sgd) - Singapore - OCBC","url":"https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/unit-trusts/funds-details.page?fundCode=SGBF&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Why we like the fund.

(\u201cLarge\u201d in this domain is relative \u2014 bond funds generally aren\u2019t as massive as equities, but these are among the more prominent ones.)\n\n  \n| Fund | Why it\u2019s a good candidate | Key metrics & caveats |\n|---|---|---|\n| **LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund** | This is one of the flagship short-duration bond funds in Singapore. It has strong brand backing (LionGlobal/OCBC) and is transitioning into an actively traded ETF share class, which adds liquidity transparency. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search16\ue201 | As of recent data, the fund\u2019s total assets exceed **SGD 1.2 billion** (for the A SGD Dist class) according to Morningstar display. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201 <br> It maintains a weighted average credit quality of around A- (investment grade) and an effective duration of ~2.25 years (including cash) per latest factsheet. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search10\ue201 <br> The ETF variant has a lower management fee (0.25% p.a.) than the unlisted unit trust class. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue201 |\n| **United SGD Fund (UOBAM)** | This fund is well established and has been around since 1998. UOBAM is a known institutional name in Singapore. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search35\ue201 | Its performance has been fairly consistent: ~2.93% p.a. (as of March 2025) historically. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201 <br> According to UOBAM\u2019s announcements, the fund has crossed **SGD 2 billion in AUM** status. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search35\ue201 <br> But one downside: it may hold a broader maturity spectrum (not strictly ultra-short), so check its current duration before investing. |\n| **Nikko AM Shenton Short Term Bond Fund (SGD class)** | This is a focused \u201cshort term / capital preservation + liquidity\u201d bond fund, typically preferred by conservative investors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search26\ue201 | Its AUM (SGD class) is ~ SGD 663.9 million per Morningstar listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue201 <br> It has a low management fee of ~0.30% p.a. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 <br> Because its size is somewhat smaller than the first two, it\u2019s less dominant, but it is still among the better known short-duration bond funds in Singapore.  \n\n---\n\n### My assessment & caveats\n\n- **Size / scale matters** in fixed income because liquidity and resilience to redemption pressures improve as AUM grows. By that metric, LionGlobal and United tend to be more robust in stress.  \n- **Credit risk** is always present. Even \u201chigh quality\u201d bond funds may have exposure to corporates; during credit stress, such holdings can hurt.  \n- **Duration drift**: Funds may stretch out maturities tactically. Always check the **current effective duration** in the latest factsheet, because \u201cshort duration\u201d in name doesn\u2019t guarantee it in all environments.  \n- The **ETF share class** of the LionGlobal fund is a positive development: increased transparency, intraday trading, and likely better liquidity.  \n- **Currency/FX risk** is less of an issue for the ones denominated in SGD (or hedged variants).  \n\nIf you like, I can pull the **latest (2025) fact sheets** and rank these (plus a few others) by size, yield, duration, and risk for you. Do you want me to do that?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search16\ue201","start_idx":620,"end_idx":681,"safe_urls":["https://global.morningstar.com/en-ea/investments/funds/0P00006FYV/quote?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://growbeansprout.com/lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-income?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/fund-lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-active-etf-sgd-class.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/unit-trusts/funds-details.page?fundCode=SGBF&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Lion Global Investors](https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/fund-lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-active-etf-sgd-class.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund (Active ETF SGD Class)","url":"https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/fund-lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-active-etf-sgd-class.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1757024313.0,"snippet":"The LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund (Active ETF SGD Class) is Singapore's first active bond ETF and first listed share class of an existing ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund: Earn regular income with a ...","url":"https://growbeansprout.com/lionglobal-short-duration-bond-fund-income?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Some of the key features of the LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund include: Broader exposure: Includes both Singapore and global bonds ...","attribution":"Grow Bean Sprout"},{"title":"lionglobal short duration bond fund class a (sgd) - Singapore - OCBC","url":"https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/unit-trusts/funds-details.page?fundCode=SGBF&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Why we like the fund.
