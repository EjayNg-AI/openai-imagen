The discussion of its potential weight dates back to 2006 when Harvard physicist Russell Seitz attempted to calculate it, resulting in an estimated 50 grams - roughly the weight of a couple of strawberries. However, with the tremendous advancements in technology and data usage, this estimate seems obsolete. Discover magazine proposed another method by considering the electrons needed to encode information, estimating the internet's weight at a tiny fraction of a gram. More recent attempts suggest using the total data stored and the minimum energy required to reset bits, yielding an even smaller estimate of 53 quadrillionths of a gram at room temperature. A more speculative approach suggests encoding the internet's data in DNA, equating it to approximately 960,947 grams, or 10.6 average American males.

Landauer\u2019s penalty only appears when **discarding** degrees of freedom, complicating any mass assignment to \u201cinformation itself\u201d.\n\n4. **Gauge of physical reality**  \n   Information is *observer\u2011relative*: the same physical microstate can encode different logical bits for different observers. Mass\u2011energy is observer\u2011independent (invariant rest mass). Bridging them requires extra structure (e.g., specifying the encoding apparatus).\n\n---\n\n### 5\u202f\u202fA forward\u2011looking view  \n\n* **Reversible and quantum computing** aim to approach zero Landauer cost, making the \u201cmass of information\u201d effectively vanish in practice.  \n* **Black\u2011hole physics** hints that Landauer\u2019s bound might be *saturated* in extreme gravity, suggesting nature already enforces the tightest possible link between information loss and energy flow.  \n* **Experimental efforts** (e.g., Vopson et\u202fal.) to weigh information are valuable, but even a positive result would still give a *temperature\u2011dependent* coefficient, not a universal identity.\n\n> **Bottom line:**  \n> Landauer provides a robust *bridge* between information theory and thermodynamics, and Einstein provides the universal *bridge* between energy and mass.

The idea remains speculative and has drawn substantial criticism for the same temperature\u2011 and frame\u2011dependence issues above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n* **Bekenstein bound and black\u2011hole entropy** relate *maximum* information to mass\u2013energy contained within a radius, but as an inequality, not a modification of the dispersion relation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n* **Relativistic formulations of Landauer** keep the standard energy\u2013momentum relation intact and treat Landauer\u2019s cost as an *additional* thermodynamic bookkeeping term, not something to be subtracted from \\(E^{2}\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\nIn short, even the boldest MEI proposals do **not** tamper with \\(E^{2}=m^{2}c^{4}+p^{2}c^{2}\\); they place information somewhere else in the accounting.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u202f\u202fPhysical consistency tests your formula would fail\n\n1. **Lorentz covariance** \u2013 A bath at 300\u202fK in its rest frame looks colder if you run past it at relativistic speed. Your \\(E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) would change, yet \\(m\\) and \\(p\\) would transform in the usual way; the equality cannot hold in both frames simultaneously.\n\n2. **Thermodynamic limit** \u2013 Cool the bath to \\(T\\to 0\\). Your extra term vanishes, so you recover the standard relation\u2014but nothing discontinuous should happen at exactly \\(T=0\\). A fundamental law that switches form at a bath\u2011dependent threshold is suspicious.\n\n3. **Reversible computing thought\u2011experiment** \u2013 Use Fredkin/Toffoli gates (classical) or unitary qubit operations (quantum). You can carry out any computation without erasure, so \\(E_{\\mathrm{L}}=0\\) regardless of \\(\\mathcal N_{\\text{bits}}\\). The same hardware either obeys or violates your modified dispersion depending on the programmer\u2019s choice.\n\n---\n\n## 5\u202f\u202fA more coherent way to blend the concepts (if one insists)\n\nInstead of *subtracting* Landauer energy from the relativistic invariant, keep the textbook relation intact and treat information as a **state\u2011dependent potential** for heat release:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{usable}} = E_{\\text{tot}}\n                  - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln 2\\,\\Delta\\mathcal N_{\\text{bits}}}_{\\text{heat dumped during irreversible operations}}\n\\]\n\nHere \\(E_{\\text{tot}}\\) still satisfies \\(E^{2}=m^{2}c^{4}+p^{2}c^{2}\\); the second term merely predicts how much of that energy will *inexorably* become waste heat if you irreversibly compress the system\u2019s logical state space. That keeps Lorentz symmetry and energy conservation intact while acknowledging Landauer\u2019s penalty.\n\n---\n\n## 6\u202f\u202fBottom line\n\n*Landauer\u2019s bound is a profound bridge between thermodynamics and information theory, but it is **conditional** (temperature\u2011, observer\u2011 and process\u2011dependent). Einstein\u2019s energy\u2013momentum relation is a bedrock identity of relativistic kinematics. Splicing the two by simple subtraction produces a relation that is neither invariant nor experimentally consistent.*\n\nSo the short answer to your proposal is **no**: the physics we know does not permit redefining the invariant \\(E^{2}\\) by subtracting a Landauer cost. A consistent mass\u2011energy\u2011information framework must treat information as a **contextual thermodynamic resource**, not as a negative contribution to the universal dispersion relation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":855,"end_idx":874,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/html/2407.15690v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.15690v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Landauer principle and the second law in a relativistic ... - arXiv","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.15690v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1721606400.0,"snippet":"The problem of formulating thermodynamics in a relativistic scenario remains unresolved, although many proposals exist in the literature.
