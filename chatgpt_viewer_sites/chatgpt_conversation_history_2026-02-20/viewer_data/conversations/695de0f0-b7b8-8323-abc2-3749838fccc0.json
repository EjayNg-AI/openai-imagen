The underlying base model already has the raw intelligence; but responding autogressively to a user prompt alone often does not unlock this intelligence. The pattern processing does not go deep enough. Chain of thought generation allows the pattern processing to go much deeper, whilst still leveraging on the power of the existing attention mechanism architecture (that has been in use since the seminal 2017 attention is all you need paper).\n\nWhat other algorithmic breakthroughs might lead to even deeper latent space activation and as such, further push the reasoning paradigm to yet another level.

In the research literature, the closest *technical* relatives are things like **latent reasoning** (doing intermediate steps in continuous hidden states rather than text tokens) and **activation/representation steering** (directly intervening on hidden activations). \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue202turn2view2\ue201\n\n## Where your CoT story is strong \u2014 and where it\u2019s a bit hand-wavy\n**Strong:** Chain-of-thought (CoT) often helps because it effectively **increases test-time compute**. Each intermediate token forces another forward pass, and those outputs get looped back as new inputs. Some theory work frames this as increasing the transformer\u2019s \u201ceffective depth\u201d because outputs are fed back in. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201\n\n**But:** interpreting this purely as \u201cactivating latent space\u201d risks skipping a few mechanisms:\n- CoT tokens are a *mixture* of real problem structure plus \u201cglue\u201d for coherence; the language channel may be an awkward substrate for complex search/planning. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n- CoT can be **unfaithful**: the model can generate a plausible explanation while internally using a different latent process. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n\nSo: \u201clatent activation\u201d is a fine metaphor, but the actionable levers seem to be **(i) more compute, (ii) better search, (iii) better internal state control**, and **(iv) better self-verification**.\n\n## Algorithmic directions that plausibly unlock \u201cdeeper activation\u201d than CoT\n\n### 1) **Reasoning in continuous latent space (not words)**\nInstead of forcing intermediate steps into tokens, you let the model \u201cthink\u201d in its **hidden states** and only decode to language at the end (or intermittently). A concrete example is **Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought)**: it feeds the model\u2019s last hidden state back as the next input embedding (\u201clatent mode\u201d), and reports that this can enable a **breadth-first-search-like** pattern (multiple potential next steps encoded) rather than committing early like vanilla CoT. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue202turn10view0\ue201\n\n**Why this can be a big deal:** language tokens are a bottleneck. Continuous states can represent *superpositions of candidate moves* and richer search states than text. (Also: it dodges the \u201cexplain in English while thinking\u201d constraint.)\n\n### 2) **Scaling test-time compute without generating more tokens**\nA very direct \u201cdeeper activation\u201d lever is: **do more internal steps per output token**.  \nOne approach: **recurrent depth / looped blocks** that you can unroll to arbitrary depth at inference. Geiping et al. propose iterating a recurrent block so the model \u201cimplicitly reasons in latent space,\u201d contrasting this with CoT-style token expansion; they also emphasize it doesn\u2019t require specialized CoT training data and can work with small context windows. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201\n\n**Intuition:** CoT gives you *more forward passes because you emitted more tokens*. Recurrent depth gives you *more forward passes even if you emit few tokens*. That\u2019s a cleaner knob.\n\n### 3) **Parallel search and selection in latent space**\nOnce reasoning happens in continuous space, you want the analog of \u201csample multiple CoTs and vote,\u201d but *for latent trajectories*. One paper explicitly tackles this: **Parallel Test-Time Scaling for Latent Reasoning Models** proposes sampling mechanisms in continuous space (e.g., **Monte Carlo dropout**, **additive Gaussian noise**) and a **Latent Reward Model** to score/select trajectories. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n**Why it matters:** deep reasoning is often about *exploration + selection*. CoT self-consistency is the token-space version; this is the latent-space version.\n\n### 4) **Direct activation/representation interventions (\u201csteering\u201d)**\nIf your goal is literally \u201cactivate the right subspace,\u201d then you can skip prompting gymnastics and **intervene on activations**.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing family of methods:\n- **Activation steering**: add a learned \u201csteering vector\u201d to hidden states to bias behavior.  \n- **Feature-guided steering via sparse autoencoders**: e.g., FGAA operates in the latent space of a **Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)** and selects SAE features to build more precise steering vectors. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue201  \n- **Gradient-refined adaptive steering / latent-subspace activation**: e.g., work on \u201cTransformer Latent-Subspace Activation\u201d explores clustering per-prompt activation differences and using lightweight probes to pick steering directions. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n**How this upgrades \u201creasoning\u201d:** you can imagine a dedicated \u201cdeliberation manifold\u201d (proof-mode, planner-mode, verifier-mode) and steering becomes an *inference-time mode switch*.\n\n### 5) **Multiplicative activation scaling (a subtler, often more interpretable knob)**\nInstead of adding a direction, you can **scale** certain activations\u2014amplifying or damping computations the model already knows how to do. \u201cActivation Scaling for Steering and Interpreting Language Models\u201d frames this as learning sparse scalars that modify activation magnitudes to strengthen/weaken/reverse existing directions, and extends to a dynamic version that generalizes across prompts. \ue200cite\ue202turn14search0\ue201\n\n**Why this is interesting for \u201clatent activation\u201d:** it\u2019s closer to \u201cturn the volume up on the right circuitry\u201d than \u201cpush the state into a new direction,\u201d and often plays nicer with overall coherence.\n\n### 6) **Steering uncertainty/exploration explicitly (avoid premature commitment)**\nA big failure mode in hard reasoning is early overconfidence. **Entropic Activation Steering (EAST)** targets this at the representation level: it constructs a steering vector (entropy-weighted combination of representations) and applies it during the forward pass to increase action entropy / exploration\u2014reported to be more effective than just tweaking token sampling temperature. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n**Why it could boost reasoning:** deep reasoning often requires controlled *search*; steering the model away from greedy collapse can unlock longer-horizon plans.\n\n### 7) **Introspective tooling: models that can read/describe activations**\nThis is less \u201cactivation\u201d and more \u201cactivation-aware metacognition,\u201d but it could become a key enabler.  \n**Activation Oracles** (built via LatentQA-style training) aim to answer questions about internal activations and can recover information not present in the input text (e.g., properties fine-tuned into a model). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\nPair this with large-scale feature discovery (e.g., interpreting many SAE features) and you can imagine a future pipeline:\n1) detect which internal features are (not) firing for a task,  \n2) diagnose failure mode (missing constraint? wrong abstraction?),  \n3) apply targeted steering/scaling to correct. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n## A few forward-looking \u201cspeculative\u201d bets (not settled research)\nIf I had to bet on the next *qualitative* jump beyond CoT-as-text:\n\n- **A private \u201cthought channel\u201d**: an internal scratchpad not forced into human language (basically latent reasoning), but trained end-to-end so it\u2019s *useful* rather than just larger. (Coconut-style ideas are early versions.) \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n- **Learned search operators**: instead of emitting tokens \u201ctherefore\u2026\u201d, the model learns latent operators like *branch*, *merge*, *backtrack*, *constraint-propagate*, and you supervise those operators with verifiers/reward models (latent reward models are a step in this direction). \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- **Mechanistically-grounded mode routing**: mixture-of-experts routing, but trained so \u201cproof mode\u201d routes to different experts than \u201cstory mode,\u201d and you can externally steer that routing with interpretable probes/SAE features. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what you mean operationally by \u201cdeeper latent activation\u201d (e.g., *higher success on long proofs*, *better backtracking*, *lower hallucination under long horizons*), I can map these directions to that target and point to the most relevant concrete techniques/papers to start from."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view1\ue201","start_idx":199,"end_idx":216,"safe_urls":["https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/latent-space"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/latent-space))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"What
