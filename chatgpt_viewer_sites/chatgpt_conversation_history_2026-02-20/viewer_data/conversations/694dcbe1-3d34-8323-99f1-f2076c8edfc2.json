The right one depends on whether you care more about **ease**, **faithful layout**, or **semantic/accessible HTML**.\n\n## Option 1 (easiest): Pandoc \u2192 HTML, render math with MathJax\nThis is usually the best starting point for \u201cturn notes into web pages\u201d.\n\n**Command**\n```bash\npandoc input.tex -s -o output.html --mathjax\n```\nPandoc supports LaTeX\u2192HTML conversion and can embed MathJax for TeX math rendering. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search19\ue201\n\n**How your constructs map**\n- `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `equation`, `align`, `pmatrix`, `array`: keep as TeX math and let **MathJax** render it in-browser.\n- `\\section{...}` \u2192 headings (`<h2>...`)\n- `\\begin{tabular}...\\end{tabular}` \u2192 HTML tables (often works well for straightforward tables)\n- `{\\bf ...}` \u2192 bold (typically becomes `<strong>`)\n\n**Main caveat:** spacing/layout commands like `\\bigskip`, `\\medskip`, `\\noindent` often don\u2019t translate \u201cliterally\u201d into HTML semantics (and may be ignored or approximated). The usual fix is to rely on paragraph breaks + CSS instead of TeX spacing commands, or do a small pre/post-processing step.\n\n**If you want KaTeX instead of MathJax:** be careful\u2014KaTeX famously does **not** support the `align` environment (it supports `aligned` instead), so your documents would likely break unless you edit environments. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \nSo with your current LaTeX, **MathJax is the safer choice**.\n\n## Option 2 (most faithful \u201cLaTeX-like\u201d conversion): TeX4ht via `make4ht`\nIf you want something that behaves more like a TeX-driven HTML backend (often handling more LaTeX constructs and spacing more naturally), use TeX4ht\u2019s modern build tool.\n\n**Command**\n```bash\nmake4ht input.tex\n```\nThis is the basic HTML conversion path. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search12\ue201\n\nTo integrate MathJax (common approach), you typically pass a MathJax-related option/profile (details vary by setup), and `make4ht` is explicitly designed to work with HTML5 and MathJax workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n**When to prefer this**\n- You care about LaTeX-ish layout fidelity (spacing commands, etc.)\n- You have more complex tables\n- You want a TeX-native conversion pipeline rather than a document-converter pipeline\n\n## Option 3 (most \u201csemantic\u201d + accessibility friendly): LaTeXML \u2192 HTML5 + MathML\nLaTeXML converts LaTeX into HTML5 and typically represents math as **MathML** (Mathematical Markup Language), which can be good for accessibility and copy/paste/search. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search21\ue201\n\n**Typical tool**\n- `latexmlc` is the common \u201cdo it in one go\u201d command-line driver. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n**Nice bonus:** LaTeXML supports splitting large documents into multiple pages/sites as part of its toolchain. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n## A small but important HTML gotcha (if you keep TeX in the HTML)\nIf you use the \u201cleave TeX math in the HTML and let MathJax render it\u201d style, remember that HTML has reserved characters (`<`, `&`, etc.). You generally must not place raw HTML tags inside math delimiters, and you may need to escape certain characters if they appear in your math/text. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search24\ue201\n\n## What I\u2019d recommend for *your* documents\n- Start with **Pandoc + MathJax** (fastest path to decent, editable HTML). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n- If you find Pandoc drops too much of your spacing / table structure, switch to **make4ht (TeX4ht)**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- If you specifically want **MathML / accessibility-oriented HTML**, use **LaTeXML**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search21\ue201\n\nIf you tell me whether your goal is (a) one single HTML page per `.tex`, (b) split into one page per `\\section`, or (c) integrate into an existing site template/header/footer, I can suggest a clean \u201cbuild pipeline\u201d (including folder structure + batch conversion commands)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search19\ue201","start_idx":580,"end_idx":627,"safe_urls":["https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html","https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pandoc.org/demo/example33/3.6-math-rendering-in-html.html","https://pandoc.org/demo/example33/3.6-math-rendering-in-html.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/s.m.fearn//blog/2021/pandoc/","https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/s.m.fearn//blog/2021/pandoc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Pandoc User's Guide","url":"https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Pandoc can convert between numerous markup and word processing formats, including, but not limited to, various flavors of Markdown, HTML, LaTeX and Word docx.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"3.6 Math rendering in HTML","url":"https://pandoc.org/demo/example33/3.6-math-rendering-in-html.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"--mathjax [ = URL].
