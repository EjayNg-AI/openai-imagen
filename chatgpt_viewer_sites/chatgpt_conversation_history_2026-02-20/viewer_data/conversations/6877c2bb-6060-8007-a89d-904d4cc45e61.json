However, it\u2019s important to use mouthwash correctly to maximize its benefits. Avoid using mouthwash immediately after brushing, as it can wash away the fluoride from the toothpaste. Instead, use mouthwash before brushing or at a different time of day. For fluoride-containing mouthwash, refrain from eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes after use to allow maximum efficacy. Mouthwash should be used once or twice daily unless directed otherwise by a dental care provider. While antibacterial mouthwash can be beneficial, overuse can disrupt the oral microbiome by killing beneficial bacteria. Always follow specific instructions for medicated mouthwash prescribed by a dental care provider, as improper use can lead to side effects such as dry mouth or tooth staining. Children under six should avoid mouthwash due to the risk of ingestion. Before adding mouthwash to your routine, consult with a dental professional to ensure it meets your health needs and safety requirements.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1736071200.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6877c2cf44388007833d896471ad756f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"960278b22bf791b3-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"12f5d440-c8c5-4b93-b7e0-19cdeaefc61f","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"12f5d440-c8c5-4b93-b7e0-19cdeaefc61f","children":["1e4ef9eb-b81b-4a92-bb2c-b09d541704ac"]},"1e4ef9eb-b81b-4a92-bb2c-b09d541704ac":{"id":"1e4ef9eb-b81b-4a92-bb2c-b09d541704ac","message":{"id":"1e4ef9eb-b81b-4a92-bb2c-b09d541704ac","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752679132.194712,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering mouthwash guidelines","content":"I found that Colgate Peroxyl can be used up to four times a day for mouth sores, thanks to its antiseptic properties.

Pushing that to three-or-four times every day is usually unnecessary and can dry the mouth, wash away toothpaste fluoride, and disturb the normal oral microbiome. If you have a special-purpose rinse that explicitly says \u201cup to 4 \u00d7 daily\u201d (for example, Colgate Peroxyl\u00ae for mouth sores), follow the label\u2014but that is a medicated product meant for short-term therapeutic use, not routine freshening.\n\n---\n\n## Why \u201ctwo times\u201d is the usual ceiling\n\n| Reason | What happens if you over-rinse? |\n|--------|---------------------------------|\n| **Fluoride dilution** | Rinsing within 30 min of brushing can remove the fluoride film that protects enamel. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue201 |\n| **Microbiome balance** | Antibacterial rinses can wipe out beneficial bacteria, leading to rebound bad breath or opportunistic infections. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue201 |\n| **Mucosal irritation & dry mouth** | Frequent exposure to alcohol, essential oils, or cetyl-pyridinium chloride can desiccate tissues or cause sloughing. |\n| **Staining with some actives** | Chlorhexidine and some CPC formulas darken teeth if used longer or more often than prescribed. |\n| **No added benefit** | After plaque is disrupted twice daily, extra swishes provide diminishing returns according to ADA reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## Exceptions that do allow four times daily  \n\n- **Medicated hydrogen-peroxide rinse for sores (Colgate Peroxyl\u00ae).** Label: \u201crinse for 1 min, **up to four times daily** after meals and at bedtime.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n  *Intended only for 7-10 days while ulcers heal; long-term use can delay healing or cause tissue whitening.*\n\n- **Prescription chlorhexidine (0.12 %)** may be ordered 2\u20133 \u00d7 daily for severe gingivitis, but that\u2019s under a dentist\u2019s supervision.\n\n---\n\n## Practical guidance\n\n1. **Read the exact product label**  \n   Ordinary cosmetic-/fluoride rinses from Colgate typically say \u201cuse **twice daily**.\u201d Example: Plax directions in Singapore. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n2. **Keep at least 30 min between brushing and rinsing** unless the label or your dentist says otherwise, to preserve fluoride uptake.\n\n3. **If you feel the need to rinse more than twice daily** (e.g. dry mouth, frequent snacking, orthodontic appliances), discuss alternatives with your dentist:\n   - Sugar-free xylitol lozenges or sprays  \n   - Saline or plain water rinses between meals  \n   - Switching to an alcohol-free, neutral-pH mouthwash once or twice daily and water the rest of the time.\n\n4. **Stop and consult** if you notice brown staining, burning, altered taste, or persistent dryness.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nUsing a standard Colgate mouthwash **three or four times a day every day is not recommended**; it offers little additional benefit and comes with potential downsides.

You should also clean between your teeth once daily using dental floss. Begin brushing at the back teeth, using a circular motion, and systematically work your way around. Pay attention to brushing the inside surfaces of your teeth and behind the front teeth. A thorough cleaning includes brushing your tongue, cheeks, and the roof of your mouth. Avoid rinsing immediately after brushing to maintain fluoride levels.

Brittany Seymour from the American Dental Association and Margherita Fontana of the University of Michigan School of Dentistry recommend spitting without rinsing to preserve the beneficial ingredients of the toothpaste. If rinsing is necessary, it should be done 20 minutes post-brushing or with a fluoride mouthwash. A 1999 study found that less rinsing reduces cavities and decay, especially in those with high-sugar diets. For children, brushing with small amounts of fluoride toothpaste is crucial, and they should avoid swallowing it. Pediatric dentist Scott Cashion advises children to spit without rinsing to allow fluoride protection overnight.

Experts recommend several simple yet effective ways to maintain oral hygiene and avoid costly dental issues. Limit sugar intake and snacking to reduce acid attacks on teeth caused by bacteria. Brush with a fluoride toothpaste for two minutes twice daily, primarily before breakfast and before bed. Use electric toothbrushes with pressure sensors, avoid wetting the brush to enhance fluoride retention, and brush all surfaces including gums and tongue. Wait 30 minutes after eating before brushing to allow saliva to remineralize teeth. Avoid rinsing with water or mouthwash immediately after brushing to retain fluoride benefits. Flossing or using interdental brushes is essential for cleaning between teeth. Good habits should start early in childhood, with parental monitoring to ensure proper technique. Regular checkups, proper stress management, and using technology like sugar scanning apps can all contribute to better dental health. Avoid DIY dentistry and seek professional help when needed. Ultimately, moderation in diet and consistency in care are key, and even dentists occasionally indulge, emphasizing a balanced approach to oral health.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1730350809.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6877c2cf44388007833d896471ad756f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"960339404c875f41-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"0e7910b9-56f4-40d5-bf2e-95d69da68c90","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0e7910b9-56f4-40d5-bf2e-95d69da68c90","children":["ae753875-d247-41e0-9a19-c1566ac9d0fa"]},"ae753875-d247-41e0-9a19-c1566ac9d0fa":{"id":"ae753875-d247-41e0-9a19-c1566ac9d0fa","message":{"id":"ae753875-d247-41e0-9a19-c1566ac9d0fa","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752687031.805141,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing fluoride exposure risk","content":"Frequent small doses of fluoride are considered beneficial, but the current guideline suggests twice-daily exposure.

The CDC recognizes water fluoridation as a major public health achievement for reducing cavities. Starting in 1955 with Crest, fluoride toothpaste became widespread in dental care. The ADA requires fluoride in products bearing its seal, recommending twice-daily use. Fluoride concentrations of at least 1,000 ppm in toothpaste are effective, while high-fluoride toothpaste may benefit high-risk individuals. Despite its benefits, excessive fluoride can cause fluorosis in children's developing teeth, so careful monitoring is necessary. Controversy exists over potential health risks, though most studies show fluoride levels in public supplies are safe. Alternatives like calcium phosphate toothpaste are being researched but lack ADA approval.

Firstly, it\u2019s not necessary to wet your toothbrush before use\u2014dry brushing can increase friction and fluoride effectiveness. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste. After consuming sugary or acidic food and drinks, wait 10 minutes before brushing to avoid damaging the softened enamel. Rinse your mouth with water instead of rinsing away removed acids and food particles. After brushing, avoid rinsing your mouth as it can wash away the protective fluoride. If you knock out a tooth, place it back in the socket or preserve it in milk while seeking dental care. Antibacterial mouthwashes might reduce both harmful and beneficial bacteria, which could affect breath quality. Finally, only have teeth whitening procedures done by a professional dentist to avoid health risks associated with unsafe products.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1519062028.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/20/lifestyle/dentist-reveals-most-common-dental-mistake-people-make/","title":"Dentist reveals the toothbrushing mistake nearly everyone is making","snippet":"Dr. Victoria Sampson, a functional dentist, recently sparked widespread discussion after sharing that many people brush their teeth incorrectly by rinsing after brushing.

She emphasized that rinsing removes the beneficial fluoride from toothpaste that protects the teeth and gums. Her recommendation\u2014to spit out excess toothpaste without rinsing\u2014drew mixed reactions online. Some agreed, noting improved dental health after adopting this habit, while others pointed to contradicting instructions on toothpaste labels and common dental practices.

It is commonly added to public drinking water, dental products like toothpaste, and available as supplements. Fluoride's benefits in reducing tooth decay stem from its ability to inhibit bacterial growth and enhance the mineralization of teeth, forming a protective layer against damage. While fluoride is essential for dental health, excessive intake can lead to conditions such as dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis, characterized by enamel discoloration and fragile bones, respectively. Both acute and chronic overexposure can result in adverse health effects, thus it's important to manage intake wisely. Most people get sufficient fluoride from tap water and dental products but those reliant on non-fluoridated bottled water might be at risk of deficiency. Regular dental hygiene and check-ups remain key practices to ensure dental health, especially if fluoride intake is insufficient from natural sources.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1546889835.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6877c2cf44388007833d896471ad756f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"960339404c875f41-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"28974bfd-5c7e-4a4c-80ed-11a92f0edc1a","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"28974bfd-5c7e-4a4c-80ed-11a92f0edc1a","children":["c98c6b6e-437b-4336-ac35-9077df8a86de"]},"c98c6b6e-437b-4336-ac35-9077df8a86de":{"id":"c98c6b6e-437b-4336-ac35-9077df8a86de","message":{"id":"c98c6b6e-437b-4336-ac35-9077df8a86de","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752687057.62412,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing fluoride exposure details","content":"The current sources suggest that fluoride exposure is generally beneficial but has limitations, especially with frequent rinsing.
