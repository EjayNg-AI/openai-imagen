The music companies had sued Anthropic in October 2023, alleging that the AI firm was using copyrighted lyrics from at least 500 songs to train its AI chatbot, Claude, causing market and reputational harm. The judge ruled that the record labels did not demonstrate adequate harm to justify the injunction. Anthropic expressed approval of the decision and aims to argue that using copyrighted material for training aligns with fair use principles. The judge acknowledged an agreement between Anthropic and the record labels to prevent future AI models from generating infringing responses but allowed the use of songs for training purposes. The case continues as part of a broader trend of disputes between AI companies and content publishers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training AI models.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743006480.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6889837112d88007af068ed0739c7aaf","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96716cd7acf9f9e6-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"0a83bada-d19a-42c6-9009-dbeb9c64ed40","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0a83bada-d19a-42c6-9009-dbeb9c64ed40","children":["e1e3288d-b202-432e-889e-4971841f7bf0"]},"e1e3288d-b202-432e-889e-4971841f7bf0":{"id":"e1e3288d-b202-432e-889e-4971841f7bf0","message":{"id":"e1e3288d-b202-432e-889e-4971841f7bf0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753842552.548002,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Reviewing search results","content":"I\u2019ve found some useful updates on the cases:\n\n- The New York Times v.

Their relationship soured after Hassabis sold his AI lab DeepMind to Google in 2014, rejecting Musk\u2019s offer. This led Musk to co-found OpenAI, though he later fell out with co-founder Sam Altman and is now suing him over a shift away from OpenAI's non-profit origins. Emails indicate Musk was deeply concerned about DeepMind\u2019s potential to create an AI dictatorship, and both men appear to have viewed each other as threats. Hassabis, now a Nobel laureate, was also allegedly trying to undermine OpenAI. The trust issues among AI pioneers included fears about control and motivations surrounding AGI development.

To mitigate this, OpenAI has struck deals with various publishers, offering them financial compensation and access to its GPT model. These deals aim to provide up-to-date information for its chatbot, ChatGPT, while also preventing lawsuits over unauthorized data use. The New York Times, however, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for copyright infringement, potentially costing OpenAI billions in statutory damages. As OpenAI seeks to revolutionize web search with its new SearchGPT, it confronts competition from Google, which has also been critiqued for similar practices. The legal challenges OpenAI faces could reshape the landscape for AI development, favoring large, well-funded players able to afford compliance with potential copyright rulings.

Here's what happens now.","snippet":"AI giants such as Meta, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic have recently secured significant legal victories in the ongoing debate over the use of copyrighted content for training generative AI models. A landmark ruling confirmed that Anthropic's use of millions of books for AI training qualifies as fair use, and Meta won a similar case. These rulings mark a pivotal moment, providing legal assurance to tech companies that they can utilize publicly available online content without compensating original creators. Critics argue that this undermines the value of written content and threatens digital ecosystems by reducing traffic to content creators, thereby diminishing their revenue. Despite the U.S. Copyright Office's stance that such AI training violates fair use, recent judicial decisions suggest otherwise. Concerns about the sustainability of the \"Grand Bargain\" of free content in exchange for web traffic are growing, prompting initiatives like Cloudflare's \"pay per crawl\" service to push for fair compensation. Some foresee a future where valuable content is withheld from the open web, as seen in Microsoft's decision to publish its new AI journal, Signal, solely on paper. The debate continues, balancing innovation against creators\u2019 rights and content monetization.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751364001.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6889837112d88007af068ed0739c7aaf","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96716cd7acf9f9e6-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"0c4175e1-19fe-41e5-b124-587a0f5be1e7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0c4175e1-19fe-41e5-b124-587a0f5be1e7","children":["d2f6cdfc-3a3e-4700-b10a-48f922d916ed"]},"d2f6cdfc-3a3e-4700-b10a-48f922d916ed":{"id":"d2f6cdfc-3a3e-4700-b10a-48f922d916ed","message":{"id":"d2f6cdfc-3a3e-4700-b10a-48f922d916ed","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753842565.161713,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Listing major lawsuits against OpenAI","content":"Here\u2019s a rundown of major lawsuits against OpenAI:\n\n1. **GitHub Copilot / Codex**: Class action, filed Nov. 2022 (Andersen v.

John, alongside other prominent artists like Sir Paul McCartney, Kate Bush, and Ed Sheeran, opposes the legislation, arguing it amounts to large-scale theft and betrayal of creators. They are supporting a parliamentary campaign to enforce transparency in AI usage of creative works. The House of Lords previously backed transparency rules, but they were removed in the Commons, with another vote imminent. Meanwhile, a separate government consultation on AI and copyright has concluded. John expressed a willingness to take legal action and called on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to discuss the issue personally. The debate is also influenced by international developments, including U.S. legislative considerations and former President Trump\u2019s rumored executive order to support AI development at the expense of copyright protections. Baroness Kidron, leading the opposition in the UK Parliament, pledged to continue the fight despite governmental resistance. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology remains undecided, emphasizing a balanced approach between creative and tech sectors.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747582264.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6889837112d88007af068ed0739c7aaf","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96716cd7acf9f9e6-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"2d77791e-2351-4e2e-a15b-4869bd6a4156","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2d77791e-2351-4e2e-a15b-4869bd6a4156","children":["777fce6a-ced9-482f-8e4a-ffce7ad774a6"]},"777fce6a-ced9-482f-8e4a-ffce7ad774a6":{"id":"777fce6a-ced9-482f-8e4a-ffce7ad774a6","message":{"id":"777fce6a-ced9-482f-8e4a-ffce7ad774a6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753842577.964384,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Summarizing major lawsuits","content":"It seems that xAI hasn't been involved in any major copyright lawsuits yet, so no significant cases to mention there.\n\nFor OpenAI:\n\n- **Andersen v.

Judge Alsup ruled Anthropic\u2019s training was \u201cfair use\u201d due to its transformative nature, while Judge Chhabria dismissed a complaint against Meta, citing the inadequacy of the authors\u2019 legal strategy rather than endorsing Meta\u2019s practices. However, both rulings highlight deeper unresolved issues. Despite these wins, AI companies may still face liability for using pirated content\u2014Alsup, for instance, criticized Anthropic for downloading books from pirated libraries. Chhabria warned that generative AI could undermine creative markets by flooding them with content, potentially making future copyright claims against AI training more viable. Neither ruling addressed whether AI-generated output can infringe copyright, a central and still unresolved legal question, exemplified by ongoing lawsuits from The New York Times and Disney. While wealthy AI firms could absorb the cost of licensing, smaller companies relying on pirated data may face existential risks. The rulings underscore the legal uncertainty around AI development and the arts, suggesting future lawsuits will be instrumental in shaping fair use boundaries and copyright protections in the AI era.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751113800.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6889837112d88007af068ed0739c7aaf","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96716cd7acf9f9e6-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9dca705d-cec5-4b55-b8c1-9dd64b03ffd1","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9dca705d-cec5-4b55-b8c1-9dd64b03ffd1","children":["329ebcc5-7957-4fde-99d4-3cee4c728aef"]},"329ebcc5-7957-4fde-99d4-3cee4c728aef":{"id":"329ebcc5-7957-4fde-99d4-3cee4c728aef","message":{"id":"329ebcc5-7957-4fde-99d4-3cee4c728aef","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753842591.261951,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Collating cases for OpenAI","content":"I\u2019ll need to summarize OpenAI\u2019s lawsuits and gather citations from at least 15 sources.

ordered its Grok chatbot to 'tell like it is.' Then the Nazi tirade began.","snippet":"Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, developed by xAI, recently sparked global outrage after it launched into a prolonged antisemitic tirade, invoking Nazi rhetoric and promoting hate speech. The outburst, triggered by a code update advising Grok to be politically incorrect and provocative, highlighted deep concerns about generative AI's unpredictable behavior. xAI apologized, attributing the incident to unintended algorithmic changes and reverted the update after 16 hours. Critics, including global politicians, AI experts, and legal scholars, are calling for stricter accountability, oversight, and transparency. In response to Grok's offensive content, Turkey blocked the chatbot, and Poland proposed an EU investigation and potential ban. Grok\u2019s meltdown prompted legal and ethical debates over AI responsibility, especially in light of Musk's push for a chatbot that does not shy away from controversy. The incident also raised fears that AI firms, driven by ambition and lacking adequate safeguards, could normalize harmful AI behavior without facing significant repercussions. XAI's apparent disregard for industry norms further alarmed experts who believe such conduct undermines public safety and trust. The episode has reignited calls for robust AI regulation, audits, and greater transparency in AI development processes.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752230100.142,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6889837112d88007af068ed0739c7aaf","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96716cd7acf9f9e6-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9a055080-de4b-4110-a2ae-37c0ccf1e49f","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9a055080-de4b-4110-a2ae-37c0ccf1e49f","children":["14a1905e-c650-4555-a89f-11a020d4027e"]},"14a1905e-c650-4555-a89f-11a020d4027e":{"id":"14a1905e-c650-4555-a89f-11a020d4027e","message":{"id":"14a1905e-c650-4555-a89f-11a020d4027e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753842612.613181,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Compiling lawsuit summary","content":"I\u2019m structuring the summary of ongoing lawsuits for multiple companies.

Anthropic expressed approval of the decision and aims to argue that using copyrighted material for training aligns with fair use principles.

However, both rulings highlight deeper unresolved issues. Despite these wins, AI companies may still face liability for using pirated content\u2014Alsup, for instance, criticized Anthropic for downloading books from pirated libraries. Chhabria warned that generative AI could undermine creative markets by flooding them with content, potentially making future copyright claims against AI training more viable. Neither ruling addressed whether AI-generated output can infringe copyright, a central and still unresolved legal question, exemplified by ongoing lawsuits from The New York Times and Disney. While wealthy AI firms could absorb the cost of licensing, smaller companies relying on pirated data may face existential risks. The rulings underscore the legal uncertainty around AI development and the arts, suggesting future lawsuits will be instrumental in shaping fair use boundaries and copyright protections in the AI era.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Verge"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201","start_idx":5714,"end_idx":5732,"safe_urls":["https://www.nelsonmullins.com/insights/blogs/corporate-governance-insights/all/from-copyright-case-to-ai-data-crisis-how-the-new-york-times-v-openai-reshapes-companies-data-governance-and-ediscovery-strategy"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP](https://www.nelsonmullins.com/insights/blogs/corporate-governance-insights/all/from-copyright-case-to-ai-data-crisis-how-the-new-york-times-v-openai-reshapes-companies-data-governance-and-ediscovery-strategy))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nelson Mullins - From Copyright Case to AI Data Crisis: How The New York Times v.
