In 1959, Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) took charge of a self-governing Singapore, symbolically donning white uniforms to signify a commitment to clean, incorruptible government\u301038\u2020L182-L190\u3011. The new leaders pursued merger with Malaysia in 1963 to gain a larger common market, but political and racial frictions led to Singapore\u2019s expulsion and full independence on 9 August 1965\u30103\u2020L239-L247\u3011\u30103\u2020L243-L250\u3011. This sudden nationhood, \u201cwithout a hinterland nor natural resources,\u201d left Singapore \u201con our own\u201d and in a precarious state\u30103\u2020L243-L250\u3011\u30106\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Yet by 1990, Singapore had transformed into one of Asia\u2019s most prosperous and stable nations. This report examines the key factors and decisions \u2013 economic policies, geostrategic moves in foreign policy and defense, internal political stability, and the individuals who drove these changes \u2013 that underpinned Singapore\u2019s remarkable success between 1959 and 1990.\n\n## Economic Transformation into a Global Trade and Financial Hub  \nUnder the stewardship of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his capable team, Singapore embarked on bold economic strategies that turned its vulnerabilities into strengths. **Major economic policies and decisions** during 1959\u20131990 included an aggressive industrialization drive, an open economy welcoming foreign investment, heavy investment in infrastructure and education, and continual upgrading of industry.\n\n### Early Industrialization and Export Strategy (1960s)  \nAt independence, unemployment exceeded 10% and the economy relied on entrep\u00f4t trade with little manufacturing base\u30101\u2020L147-L155\u3011\u30101\u2020L167-L173\u3011. To create jobs, the new government pursued **rapid industrialization**. In 1961, a United Nations team led by Dutch economist Albert Winsemius advised Singapore to industrialize swiftly, recommending creation of over 200,000 jobs in a decade\u30101\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u30101\u2020L175-L183\u3011. Acting on these recommendations, Finance Minister Dr. Goh Keng Swee established the Economic Development Board (EDB) in 1961 with a S$100 million fund to drive industrial growth\u30101\u2020L173-L181\u3011. EDB\u2019s first task was developing the **Jurong Industrial Estate** \u2013 transforming swamp land in Jurong into a manufacturing hub for labor-intensive factories producing goods like garments, toys and wigs\u30101\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301046\u2020L382-L390\u3011. \n\nWhile initially the plan included a common market via the Malaysia merger, by 1965 it was clear that Singapore would have to survive on its own external markets\u30103\u2020L235-L243\u3011\u30106\u2020L135-L143\u3011. Singapore\u2019s leaders thus \u201cswitched to an export-oriented strategy\u201d focused on the global market\u30106\u2020L135-L143\u3011. Rather than protectionism, Singapore *opened* its economy to foreign companies, going \u201cagainst the grain\u201d of the era\u30106\u2020L148-L156\u3011. This meant courting multinational corporations (MNCs) to invest and manufacture in Singapore for export. Dr. Goh articulated the logic: large foreign firms had the expertise, capital and global networks Singapore lacked\u30106\u2020L162-L170\u3011. They could rapidly create jobs and industrial know-how, and eventually transfer skills to local enterprises\u30106\u2020L168-L175\u3011\u30106\u2020L170-L177\u3011. \n\n**Attracting Foreign Investment:** In 1967, Singapore passed the **Economic Expansion Incentives Act**, offering generous tax breaks and exemptions to entice investors\u30106\u2020L199-L205\u3011. The EDB was restructured in 1968 to focus solely on investment promotion \u2013 other functions were spun off to new agencies like the Development Bank of Singapore (for financing), Jurong Town Corporation (industrial estate management), and Intraco (trade)\u30106\u2020L177-L186\u3011\u30106\u2020L179-L187\u3011. EDB officers fanned out worldwide, pitching Singapore to giants such as Texas Instruments, Fairchild, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric. They famously demonstrated extraordinary speed and efficiency \u2013 for example, in 1968 EDB helped **National Semiconductor** go from site visit to production in **two weeks**, impressing other American firms to follow suit\u30106\u2020L185-L194\u3011\u30106\u2020L191-L199\u3011. By the early 1970s this strategy paid off: U.S. and Japanese electronics firms set up assembly plants, and **investment commitments from 1968\u20131973 totaled over S$2.3\u202fbillion**, fueling annual GDP growth above 10%\u301011\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP rose from 16% in 1966 to 22% by 1973, as unemployment plummeted from 9% to under 5%\u301011\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u301011\u2020L143-L150\u3011.\n\n### Infrastructure Development and Connectivity  \nDeveloping world-class **infrastructure** was seen as vital to support industry and overcome Singapore\u2019s geophysical constraints. The government invested heavily in modernizing the port, expanding utilities, building housing, and improving transport links:\n\n- **Port and Shipping:** Leveraging its strategic location on the Malacca Strait, Singapore continually upgraded its port facilities. In 1965 the new Jurong Port opened to serve industries\u30101\u2020L189-L197\u3011, and in 1972 the Port of Singapore Authority inaugurated Southeast Asia\u2019s first **container terminal** at Tanjong Pagar, ahead of regional rivals\u301039\u2020L27-L30\u3011. These moves cemented Singapore as a major shipping hub. By the 1980s, Singapore\u2019s port was among the **busiest in the world** \u2013 in 1984 it handled 527.5 million gross tons of shipping, surpassing even Rotterdam in vessel tonnage\u301040\u2020L283-L291\u3011. This connectivity made Singapore a key node in global trade.  \n\n- **Air Transport:** Similarly, Singapore invested in becoming an aviation hub. In the 1970s, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew overruled foreign experts by deciding to relocate the main airport from land-locked Paya Lebar to coastal Changi, believing a seaside location offered unlimited expansion room\u301015\u2020L163-L171\u3011\u301015\u2020L173-L180\u3011. Changi Airport opened in 1981 as the **largest airport in Asia**, featuring record-breaking engineering feats\u301015\u2020L175-L183\u3011. The gamble paid off \u2013 by 1990 a second terminal opened and passenger throughput had nearly doubled (15 million annually, up from 8 million in 1981)\u301015\u2020L175-L183\u3011\u301015\u2020L181-L188\u3011. With Singapore Airlines (a new national carrier started in 1972) building a global reputation, Changi became a critical air gateway linking Europe, Asia and Oceania.\n\n- **Public Housing and Urban Infrastructure:** Addressing the severe housing shortage was both a social and economic priority. In 1960 the Housing & Development Board (HDB) was formed, led by **Lim Kim San** (dubbed \u201cMr. HDB\u201d) as its first chairman\u301049\u2020L19-L27\u3011\u301049\u2020L29-L37\u3011. Backed by government funding, HDB launched a massive public housing program that within a few years rehoused tens of thousands from slums into modern high-rise apartments. By providing affordable homes and improving living conditions, this program not only lifted productivity but also underpinned political stability (as discussed later). Other infrastructure, from reliable utilities to industrial estates and later the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system (opened 1987), were systematically developed, creating a world-class urban environment attractive to investors and conducive to growth\u301015\u2020L153-L162\u3011\u301015\u2020L157-L165\u3011.\n\n### Education and Workforce Development  \nSingapore\u2019s leadership understood that its people were its only resource. They therefore invested heavily in **education, training, and population skills** to build a competent workforce for industrialization. As early as the 1960s, technical and vocational education was expanded \u2013 by 1965 Singapore already had \u201ca pool of semi-skilled workers\u201d to support growing industries\u30108\u2020L226-L234\u3011. Education spending remained a priority, with new institutions like polytechnics and vocational institutes established to produce technicians and engineers. Over time, the emphasis shifted to higher skills: in the 1970s, the government introduced programs to **\u201cupskill workers\u201d** and produce more graduates in engineering and business, anticipating a need for skilled manpower in more advanced industries\u301011\u2020L167-L175\u3011\u301011\u2020L189-L197\u3011. \n\nThe medium of instruction was switched to **English** (with mother-tongue languages taught alongside) \u2013 a strategic move that equipped Singaporeans to operate in international business and technology environments while also uniting a multi-ethnic society. By the 1980s Singapore boasted high literacy rates (illiteracy was largely erased)\u301044\u2020L309-L317\u3011 and a growing cohort of professionals. This focus on human capital paid off: foreign investors cited the disciplined, educated workforce as a key draw, and Singaporeans were able to move from labor-intensive jobs into higher-value occupations as the economy upgraded.\n\n### Climbing the Value Chain: Upgrading and Restructuring (1970s\u20131980s)  \nBy the early 1970s, the success in attracting industry led to a new challenge \u2013 **labor shortages**. The rapid expansion had effectively absorbed unemployment; by 1973, joblessness fell to around 4%\u301011\u2020L143-L151\u3011\u301011\u2020L151-L159\u3011. Wages began to rise and Singapore could no longer compete purely on cheap labor. Neighboring countries with larger populations (Malaysia, Indonesia) were industrializing, threatening to undercut Singapore in low-end manufacturing\u301011\u2020L153-L161\u3011. The government\u2019s response was to **upgrade the economy** toward higher value activities. \n\nIn 1973, Finance Minister Hon Sui Sen outlined a two-pronged strategy: (1) **attract capital-intensive, technology-heavy industries** such as petrochemicals, precision engineering, and electronics manufacturing; and (2) **increase productivity through skills upgrading** across the workforce\u301011\u2020L162-L170\u3011\u301011\u2020L166-L174\u3011. Tax incentives were now tailored to target high-tech investments. This bore fruit \u2013 for example, by the late 1970s Singapore had become one of the world\u2019s largest oil refining centers (with Shell, Esso and others operating huge refineries) and was assembling more complex products like disk drives and semiconductors\u301011\u2020L174-L182\u3011\u301011\u2020L181-L189\u3011. \n\nTo accelerate the shift up the value chain, in 1979 the National Wages Council (NWC) implemented a bold **\u201cCorrective Wage Policy.\u201d** This involved sharply raising wages and CPF (pension) contributions over 1979\u20131981 to push firms toward higher-skilled, efficient operations\u301015\u2020L135-L143\u3011\u301015\u2020L137-L144\u3011. The intent was to price out low-value, labor-intensive activities and encourage automation and skill upgrades. Indeed, many low-end producers left for cheaper locations, while investment poured into electronics, machinery, and pharma \u2013 net manufacturing investment averaged S$1.7\u202fbillion annually from 1980\u201384, led by high value-added sectors\u301015\u2020L144-L152\u3011\u301015\u2020L148-L156\u3011. The state simultaneously poured resources into **infrastructure for connectivity** \u2013 a notable example being the huge investment to build **Changi Airport** (S$1.5\u202fbillion) despite skepticism, underscoring long-term vision in support of Singapore\u2019s role as an international transport and business hub\u301015\u2020L163-L171\u3011\u301015\u2020L175-L183\u3011.\n\nThis ambitious restructuring was largely successful in creating a more advanced economy. However, it was not without pain \u2013 coupled with a global recession, the wage shock contributed to Singapore\u2019s first post-independence **recession in 1985**\u301015\u2020L189-L197\u3011\u301015\u2020L191-L194\u3011. The government reacted by temporarily easing cost pressures (freezing wages, cutting business costs) and promoting new growth areas, including services and higher-tech manufacturing. By 1986, Singapore rebounded into a sustained boom through the late 1980s\u301013\u2020L71-L74\u3011. **By 1990, the city-state had achieved First World economic status:** per capita GDP had risen from around US$500 in 1965 to over US$12,000, and Singapore had become a global **financial center** and Asia\u2019s second-busiest port and airport. The deliberate policies of industrial diversification, openness to trade, and continual upgrading explain much of this economic miracle\u301044\u2020L309-L317\u3011\u301044\u2020L313-L320\u3011.\n\n## Geostrategic Positioning and Foreign Policy  \nSingapore\u2019s geopolitical strategy \u2013 how it leveraged its location and managed foreign relations \u2013 was the other pillar of its success. **Geostrategic positioning** for Singapore meant taking advantage of its location at a major crossroads of global trade, while pursuing a shrewd foreign policy of neutrality, active diplomacy, and alliance-building to secure its sovereignty and economic interests.\n\n### Leveraging Strategic Location as a Hub  \nSingapore lies astride the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea, one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. The new nation capitalized on this by entrenching itself as a critical **transportation and trade hub**. As noted, massive investments in port infrastructure enabled Singapore to handle ever-growing maritime trade \u2013 by the 1980s hundreds of ships plied its harbor daily and it rivaled giants like Rotterdam in throughput\u301040\u2020L283-L291\u3011. The government maintained a free-port regime (low tariffs and efficient customs) to encourage shippers to use Singapore as their regional base, a continuation of its historic entrep\u00f4t role but now supercharged with modern efficiency. This hub status not only earned revenue and jobs directly, but also made Singapore indispensable in global commerce, giving it a strategic economic weight disproportionate to its size. \n\nSimilarly, in aviation Singapore positioned itself as the gateway between East and West. Changi Airport\u2019s rise to a top-tier international airport meant that by the late 1980s, Singapore was a key stopover for flights connecting Europe to Australia and Asia. The presence of major multinational corporations and banks was also facilitated by Singapore\u2019s connectivity. In essence, the nation turned its geography into an asset: **a crucial node in global supply chains**. This fostered relationships with major economies that had a stake in Singapore\u2019s stability (e.g. Japan, the US, and Europe relied on Singapore\u2019s port and financial markets), subtly bolstering Singapore\u2019s security and influence.\n\n### \u201cFriend to All\u201d: Active and Pragmatic Foreign Policy  \nFrom the outset, Singapore adopted a foreign policy that can be summarized by the motto **\u201cbe friends with all, enemies with none.\u201d** As a tiny state in a turbulent region, it sought **recognition, alliances, and a voice on the international stage** to safeguard its independence. Key elements of this strategy included:\n\n- **Joining International Organizations:** Within weeks of independence, Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam secured Singapore\u2019s admission to the **United Nations** (21 September 1965, as the UN\u2019s 117th member) with Malaysia\u2019s support\u301048\u2020L114-L123\u3011. Singapore also joined the **Commonwealth** (October 1965) and later the **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)** in 1970\u301034\u2020L642-L650\u3011. By joining NAM \u2013 a group of states not formally aligned with either the US or Soviet blocs \u2013 Singapore signaled its independent stance in the Cold War while building links with developing countries. At the same time, it maintained a pro-Western economic orientation and remained a loyal Commonwealth member, hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1971\u301034\u2020L644-L652\u3011. This multi-framework diplomacy ensured Singapore was plugged into global networks and had platforms to voice its interests.\n\n- **Founding ASEAN:** Regionally, Singapore was a **founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)** in 1967\u301034\u2020L701-L709\u3011. S. Rajaratnam joined foreign ministers from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines in signing the Bangkok Declaration to form ASEAN\u301030\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u301048\u2020L133-L137\u3011. This was a critical move to promote regional cooperation and stability at a time Southeast Asia was fraught with conflict (the Vietnam War, Indonesia\u2013Malaysia Confrontation, etc.). ASEAN started modestly, but by the late 1970s it became an effective forum for economic and security collaboration \u2013 in 1976 ASEAN leaders signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation committing to peaceful relations\u301034\u2020L663-L671\u3011\u301034\u2020L667-L675\u3011. Singapore consistently championed ASEAN\u2019s unity and *\u201cfound ways to cooperate\u201d* despite diversity\u301030\u2020L73-L81\u3011. Through ASEAN, Singapore helped foster a stable regional environment, which was indispensable for its security and allowed its economy to flourish. For instance, in the 1980s, Singapore and ASEAN played a role in resolving the Cambodia conflict by presenting a united front against Vietnam\u2019s occupation of Cambodia. \n\n- **Balancing Great Power Relations:** Singapore\u2019s leaders skillfully balanced relations with major powers. The country was firmly anti-communist domestically, which aligned it with Western interests during the Cold War. It cultivated a close partnership with the **United States** in trade and later in defense cooperation (in 1990, Singapore would sign a Memorandum of Understanding allowing limited U.S. military use of its facilities). Yet Singapore also avoided becoming a pawn of the West \u2013 by being in NAM and keeping open ties with the Soviet Union and China, it hedged its bets. Notably, Singapore did not establish formal diplomatic ties with the People\u2019s Republic of **China** until 1990, largely out of deference to sensitivities in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur during the Cold War. However, unofficial links (trade, cultural) grew, and Singapore later served as an influential example for China\u2019s economic reforms (Deng Xiaoping famously visited Singapore in 1978 to learn from its development model). In essence, Singapore ensured it was **relevant to all major powers** \u2013 a \u201cconstructive and responsible\u201d player in international affairs, as its foreign policy doctrine stresses\u301016\u2020L93-L101\u3011\u301018\u2020L90-L99\u3011. This brought investments, security guarantees, and diplomatic clout beyond its size.\n\n- **Regional Diplomacy and Bilateral Ties:** Singapore maintained generally pragmatic bilateral relations with neighbors **Malaysia and Indonesia** despite early tensions. After separation, it worked with Malaysia on practical arrangements (currency interchangeability until 1973, water supply agreements, etc.) even as issues of race and politics simmered. With Indonesia, Singapore swiftly normalized relations after the end of Sukarno\u2019s Konfrontasi in 1966. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew forged a respectful relationship with President Suharto, and by 1973 the two countries had an agreement on economic and technical cooperation. Singapore\u2019s survival ethos drove it to resolve disputes peacefully (e.g. negotiating maritime boundaries, agreeing on resource sharing) and to **embed itself in a web of regional cooperation** so that its neighbors also had a stake in its success. By 1990, Singapore was trading and investing heavily in the region and was seen as an integral part of Southeast Asia\u2019s stability and growth story.\n\nIn summary, through astute diplomacy, Singapore expanded its international \u201cspace\u201d despite its small size \u2013 securing political legitimacy, economic partnerships, and a say in regional matters. Its foreign policy was underpinned by **respect for sovereignty and international law**, a principle it championed as protection for small states\u301018\u2020L90-L99\u3011. This enabled Singapore to punch above its weight diplomatically, which in turn reinforced its economic and security position.\n\n## Defense and Security Strategy  \nEnsuring its own **defense and security** was a matter of survival for Singapore. The British withdrawal \u201cEast of Suez\u201d announced in 1967 meant Singapore had to build an armed forces from scratch\u30106\u2020L141-L149\u3011. Surrounded by much larger neighbors and having experienced racial riots and communist insurgency in the 1950s\u201360s, Singapore\u2019s leadership made defense a top priority alongside economic development. The result was a remarkably rapid creation of a modern military and internal security framework, which provided the stability essential for success.\n\n### Building a Credible Defense Force  \nUpon independence, Singapore had only two under-strength infantry regiments and no air force or navy to speak of\u301027\u2020L65-L72\u3011. Defense Minister Dr. Goh Keng Swee\u2019s task was urgent \u201cto build up a strong local defence force\u201d\u301046\u2020L392-L400\u3011. He implemented **compulsory national service (NS)** in 1967, requiring 18-year-old males to serve in the military\u301046\u2020L392-L400\u3011. This policy quickly expanded the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) with citizen soldiers and remains a cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s defense. \n\nHowever, manpower alone wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 Singapore lacked expertise in military organization. In a move kept secret at the time, Goh Keng Swee turned to **Israel** for help in 1965, after approaches to India and others were rebuffed\u301027\u2020L73-L81\u3011\u301027\u2020L87-L92\u3011. Israel, seeing a parallel in Singapore\u2019s situation, sent a team of military advisers (disguised as civilian \u201cMexicans\u201d to avoid political backlash) to design and train the SAF. These advisers helped establish the command structure, training regimens, and strategy for a small armed force that could deter larger foes\u301027\u2020L87-L92\u3011. This covert assistance was crucial in the late 1960s when Singapore faced threats of aggression \u2013 there were even fears (though largely rhetoric) that radical elements in Malaysia might invade the tiny island\u301027\u2020L65-L72\u3011. With Israeli guidance, Singapore swiftly built an army along Israeli lines: tough, tech-focused, and with a doctrine of forward defense. By the early 1970s Singapore had formed its first infantry brigades, acquired fighter jets for a nascent **air force**, and begun constructing a navy.\n\nTo further bolster security, Singapore and Malaysia, together with Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, established the **Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)** in 1971\u301022\u2020L344-L354\u3011\u301022\u2020L351-L359\u3011. Under the FPDA, these powers agreed to consult and jointly repel any armed attack on Malaysia or Singapore\u301022\u2020L344-L353\u3011. A small **\u201cresidual force\u201d** of British, Australian and New Zealand troops (around 7,000) remained in Singapore into the mid-1970s as a transitional security measure\u301022\u2020L351-L359\u3011. The FPDA provided an external deterrent while the SAF was still developing. By 1975, Singapore\u2019s armed forces were much more capable, and the foreign forces fully withdrew (the last NZ battalion left in 1989)\u301022\u2020L358-L366\u3011\u301022\u2020L359-L367\u3011. Singapore continued to value FPDA for joint training exercises and as a symbol of continued strategic support\u301022\u2020L363-L370\u3011.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Singapore invested heavily in defense procurement and local capability. The government set aside a significant portion of the budget (often 20\u201330%) for defense. It also started indigenous defense industries such as **Chartered Industries of Singapore** (est. 1967) to produce ammunition and weapons, laying the foundation for what is now a thriving local defense technology sector (ST Engineering). The SAF by the 1980s had advanced American, British, and locally developed equipment, making it one of the best-armed per capita in Asia. The overarching strategy was **deterrence** \u2013 encapsulated in Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s famous idea that Singapore must be like a **\u201cpoisonous shrimp\u201d**, small but not worth swallowing without severe consequences. By 1990, Singapore\u2019s military, though small in absolute terms, was modern, well-trained, and had demonstrated its effectiveness through regular exercises with FPDA partners and others. This credible defense posture successfully deterred external threats and gave investors confidence that Singapore would remain secure.\n\n### Internal Security and Stability  \nSecurity for Singapore also meant maintaining internal harmony and political order. The tumultuous 1950s\u201360s had seen communist-inspired unrest (strikes, student riots) and communal violence (race riots in 1964) that could easily tear apart the fragile nation\u30101\u2020L199-L207\u3011\u30103\u2020L230-L238\u3011. The PAP government took a hard line against those threats to ensure a stable environment for nation-building:\n\n- **Crushing the Communist Insurgency:** Left-wing and pro-communist groups had been influential in the anti-colonial struggle. Once in power, the PAP moved decisively against the communist network. Operation Coldstore in 1963 (under British auspices) had already detained key communist-linked leaders. After independence, the government continued to **\u201cstamp out the communist elements that were fomenting unrest\u201d** \u2013 a task described as \u201ctop objective\u201d by Dr. Winsemius, the economic advisor\u30108\u2020L236-L244\u3011. Through the Internal Security Act (ISA), security agencies arrested and detained agitators who threatened subversion. This effectively neutralized the local communist movement by the early 1970s, ensuring no repeat of the violent strikes and instability that had plagued the early 60s\u30101\u2020L199-L207\u3011. While this approach was criticized by some as heavy-handed, it undeniably removed a major source of disruption, allowing economic policies to proceed unimpeded.\n\n- **Fostering Racial and Religious Harmony:** Learning from the racial riots under Malaysia, Singapore\u2019s leaders made multiracialism a core tenet. Lee Kuan Yew insisted on a **society where all races are treated equally**, rejecting the notion of special rights for any group\u30103\u2020L230-L238\u3011. Policies were put in place to prevent segregation and promote interaction \u2013 for example, public housing estates had ethnic quotas to avoid racial enclaves, and schools were integrated. The National Pledge penned by S. Rajaratnam in 1966 explicitly embodied the ideal \u201cregardless of race, language or religion\u201d\u301048\u2020L127-L135\u3011. Minority rights were safeguarded by a Presidential Council. This focus on unity helped Singapore avoid the communal strife that bedeviled some neighboring countries. After the 1969 post-independence racial riots (which were quickly contained), Singapore saw no significant ethnic violence in the subsequent decades. **Internal stability** along racial and religious lines meant social cohesion, which is critical for long-term development.\n\n- **Law and Order and Anti-Corruption:** The rule of law was strictly upheld. Singapore\u2019s approach to governance under Lee was often described as **\u201cauthoritarian but effective.\u201d** Dissent was curbed to prevent instability \u2013 opposition politicians faced stringent defamation laws and detentions (e.g., communist sympathizers or later, alleged Marxist conspirators in 1987\u2019s Operation Spectrum were detained without trial). The government argued that a **\u201cstrident approach\u201d** was needed in a fledgling nation where chaos could easily erupt\u301044\u2020L321-L328\u3011. Simultaneously, a sweeping campaign against corruption was waged to clean up public life. Immediately in 1959, the PAP government expanded the powers of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and toughened anti-corruption laws\u301038\u2020L182-L190\u3011. All civil servants and ministers were held to austere standards \u2013 in a dramatic example, Minister of State Wee Toon Boon was charged and jailed for corruption in 1975, proving that even high officials would not be spared\u301038\u2020L240-L248\u3011. These actions cemented a reputation for clean, efficient governance. As Dr. Goh quipped, the new leadership came in wearing white and had to *\u201cput an end to corrupt practices\u201d* to differentiate from the colonial past\u301038\u2020L182-L190\u3011. By the 1980s, Singapore was internationally praised for its lack of corruption, which encouraged foreign investment and public trust.\n\n- **Tripartism and Labor Peace:** Internally, another political achievement was turning a once restive labor force into a cooperative partner in growth. In the 1960s, labor strikes were common (over 100 strikes in 1961 alone) and unions were often influenced by radical elements\u30101\u2020L199-L207\u3011. The PAP worked to bring unions under a national center loyal to development goals. In 1961 the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) was formed under the PAP\u2019s Devan Nair after a split with pro-communist unionists\u30108\u2020L242-L250\u3011. Through measures like the 1968 Employment Act (which limited collective bargaining scope and outlawed wildcat strikes) and sustained dialogue, the government fostered **\u201ctripartism\u201d** \u2013 collaboration between unions, employers, and the state\u30108\u2020L253-L261\u3011. A pivotal moment was the 1969 Modernization of the Labour Movement seminar, where Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew urged unions to see themselves as partners in nation-building rather than class warriors\u30108\u2020L253-L261\u3011. This led to the adoption of productivity agreements and the establishment of the **National Wages Council (NWC)** in 1972 to amicably set wage guidelines acceptable to all sides\u30108\u2020L259-L267\u3011. The results were striking: labor strikes virtually disappeared (from 10 in 1972 to just 1 by 1977, and **zero** annually for many years thereafter)\u30108\u2020L273-L281\u3011. Industrial peace reigned, which, combined with rising real wages for workers, created a win-win climate. Tripartism has been called Singapore\u2019s \u201csecret weapon\u201d for competitiveness, ensuring that disputes are resolved by consensus rather than conflict\u30108\u2020L274-L282\u3011. This social stability was a critical complement to economic policy \u2013 investors could count on uninterrupted operations and a cooperative workforce.\n\nIn combination, these internal security and political strategies created a **stable and predictable environment** rare in the developing world of that era. By **\u201cstaying stable,\u201d** Singapore was able to \u201cstay exceptional\u201d in economic performance\u30108\u2020L277-L285\u3011. The strong state and political continuity (the PAP won every election handily, and Lee Kuan Yew remained Prime Minister for the entire 1959\u20131990 period) allowed for consistent long-term planning. While political freedoms were curtailed, many citizens accepted this trade-off for prosperity and order. Indeed, under Lee\u2019s leadership, Singapore \u201ctransformed\u2026into one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries\u201d with a robust economy\u301044\u2020L309-L317\u3011, albeit through a governance style \u201cdefined by an authoritarian approach that limited political freedoms\u201d\u301044\u2020L321-L328\u3011. This stable foundation underpinned all the economic and geostrategic initiatives described earlier.\n\n## Major Personalities and Their Contributions (1959\u20131990)  \nSingapore\u2019s success story was driven by a core group of leaders and advisors \u2013 often referred to as the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d \u2013 as well as contributions from foreign experts and institutional heads. The following table summarizes **key individuals** (both Singaporean and foreign) and their roles in this transformative period:\n\n| **Personality**            | **Role(s) in 1959\u20131990**                                   | **Key Contributions**                                                                        |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Lee Kuan Yew**           | Prime Minister (1959\u20131990); PAP Secretary-General         | Visionary leader and strategist of modern Singapore. Insisted on multiracial equality\u30103\u2020L230-L238\u3011 and meritocracy, and drove policies emphasizing education, discipline, and zero tolerance for corruption\u301038\u2020L182-L190\u3011\u301044\u2020L321-L328\u3011.

Also reformed education (introduced streaming, set up Curriculum Development Institute) to meet manpower needs\u301046\u2020L396-L400\u3011. Goh\u2019s pragmatic policies underpinned both economic growth and security. |\n| **S. Rajaratnam**          | Minister for Culture (1959\u201365); **Foreign Minister** (1965\u20131980); Deputy PM (1980\u201385) | Singapore\u2019s chief diplomat and ideologue of multiculturalism.

As PAP chairman and Deputy PM, Toh helped establish the structures of independent Singapore\u2019s government. He was instrumental in designing **national symbols** (flag, coat of arms, state crest) and promoting national identity. Oversaw scientific and technical development in the 1970s, laying groundwork for research and tertiary education (he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore in 1968). An advocate for meritocracy and equal opportunity, he ensured minority representation in government. |\n| **Hon Sui Sen**            | Chairman of EDB (1961\u201368); Minister for Finance (1970\u20131983) | Key economic policymaker who succeeded Goh as Finance Minister. As **EDB\u2019s first chairman**, he was hands-on in attracting early multinational investments and developing industrial estates\u301046\u2020L382-L390\u3011. Later, as Finance Minister during the 1970s boom, Hon managed Singapore\u2019s finances conservatively \u2013 producing regular budget surpluses and high national savings. He led the **economic upgrading** strategy in 1979, announcing the wage adjustments to spur higher productivity\u301011\u2020L165-L173\u3011. Under his watch Singapore developed into a financial hub (he oversaw the growth of the Asian Dollar Market in Singapore) and diversified into petrochemicals and tech manufacturing\u301011\u2020L174-L182\u3011. |\n| **Lim Kim San**           | Chairman of Housing & Development Board (1960\u20131963); Minister for National Development (1963\u201367); various ministerial posts through 1980s | The **architect of Singapore\u2019s public housing miracle**, credited with alleviating the housing crisis of the 1960s.

His success earned him the moniker \u201cMr. HDB\u201d and the 1965 Ramon Magsaysay Award. Housing stability provided the social foundation for economic progress. Later, as National Development Minister, he also expanded utilities and urban infrastructure. Lim\u2019s work gave Singapore a world-class urban environment and a property-owning middle class, fostering social stability. |\n| **C.V. Devan Nair**        | Union Leader; Secretary-General of NTUC (1961\u20131965, 1970\u201379); President of Singapore (1981\u201385) | A former trade unionist who became a crucial link between the PAP government and labor. Devan Nair founded the **NTUC** in 1961, rallying non-communist unions under a national center\u30108\u2020L242-L250\u3011. He championed the **\u201cModernization of the Labour Movement\u201d** in 1969 to shift unions from confrontation to cooperation with employers and government\u30108\u2020L253-L261\u3011. This laid the basis for Singapore\u2019s tripartite labor relations and virtually eliminated strikes by the 1970s\u30108\u2020L273-L281\u3011. Nair later became President, but his key contribution was securing labor peace and turning unions into partners in development \u2013 a unique achievement in the region\u30108\u2020L274-L282\u3011. |\n| **Dr. Albert Winsemius**   | Chief Economic Adviser to Singapore Government (1961\u20131984) | A Dutch economist and UN expert, Winsemius was the behind-the-scenes **foreign adviser** who guided Singapore\u2019s early development strategy. He led the 1961 UN mission that recommended industrialization\u30101\u2020L159-L167\u3011, and thereafter advised Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s cabinet for over two decades. **Winsemius\u2019s recommendations** were pivotal: he urged developing Jurong, diversifying from trading into manufacturing, building public housing to improve living conditions, establishing Singapore as a finance hub, and even the idea of a merger (and later separation) from Malaysia\u301052\u2020L1-L4\u3011. He visited Singapore twice yearly to review progress\u301052\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Many of his ideas \u2013 from welcoming MNCs to constructing the landmark Jurong Town and Changi Airport \u2013 became reality. Lee Kuan Yew acknowledged Singapore \u201cowes much of her success\u201d to Winsemius\u301050\u2020L18-L26\u3011. |\n| **Israeli Military \u201cAdvisers\u201d** (e.g. Lt. Col. Yaakov Elazari\u2019s team) | Secret consultants to Ministry of Defence (1965\u20131967) | A team of Israeli Defense Force officers who, at Dr. Goh\u2019s request, traveled covertly to Singapore to help build its defense forces when other nations refused\u301027\u2020L73-L81\u3011\u301027\u2020L87-L92\u3011. They designed the army\u2019s structure, training programs, and strategies tailored for Singapore\u2019s constraints. Under the codename \u201cProject Viking,\u201d they advised on everything from command organization to jungle warfare. They also helped procure weapons and set up local training schools. These advisers have been credited with transforming the fledgling forces into a disciplined military within a few years, essentially laying the foundation of the SAF. Their contribution gave Singapore the means to defend itself during its most vulnerable early years. |\n| **Yusof bin Ishak**        | Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State) 1959\u201365; **President of Singapore** (1965\u20131970) | Singapore\u2019s first Malayan-born Head of State and, after independence, first President. Though a ceremonial figure, Yusof Ishak was a vital symbol of **multiracial nationhood** \u2013 a Malay Muslim leader for a Chinese-majority country. He embodied the principle of equality among races that Singapore strove for. During the 1964 racial riots, Yusof made appeals for calm and unity. His image on currency and the naming of institutions after him helped reinforce the identity of a new nation that values all communities. The Yusof Ishak era set the tone for presidency as a unifying, stabilizing institution above politics in Singapore. |\n\n*Table: Key figures in Singapore\u2019s success (1959\u20131990) and their contributions.* Each played a distinct role \u2013 from policy vision and execution (Lee, Goh, Hon, etc.) to diplomacy (Rajaratnam), social cohesion (Lim, Yusof), labor harmony (Nair), and external expertise (Winsemius, Israeli advisers) \u2013 but together they formed an extraordinary team that steered Singapore\u2019s transformation.\n\n## Conclusion  \nBetween 1959 and 1990, Singapore rose from Third World obscurity to First World excellence through a combination of **astute economic planning, strategic global engagement, strong defense, and enlightened (if sometimes uncompromising) governance**. Major economic decisions \u2013 embracing free trade, courting multinationals, massive infrastructure development, continuous industrial upgrading \u2013 turned a tiny city-state with \u201cno natural resources\u201d into a bustling manufacturing and financial hub\u30106\u2020L136-L144\u3011\u301044\u2020L313-L320\u3011. Singapore leveraged its geostrategic position by becoming indispensable to international trade and by practicing a foreign policy of balance and proactivity, which won it friends in all camps. Meanwhile, the PAP leadership fostered domestic stability by uniting the population across ethnic lines, crushing threats of communism and unrest, and instilling an efficient, corruption-free administration. \n\nBy 1990, the results were evident: Singapore had one of Asia\u2019s highest GDP per capita, a reputation as a global city of commerce, and a secure, cohesive society. It had also managed a smooth political succession, as Lee Kuan Yew handed over the premiership after 31 years of continuous rule\u301041\u2020L9-L17\u3011, leaving behind robust institutions to carry the legacy forward. The Singapore story of 1959\u20131990 illustrates how visionary leadership and pragmatic policy \u2013 executed with consistency and supported by a capable team \u2013 can overcome extreme odds. As one historian noted, **Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues \u201ctransformed [Singapore] from a small, resource-deficient colony\u2026into the most prosperous country in Southeast Asia\u201d**\u301044\u2020L309-L317\u3011. The confluence of sound economic policies, geostrategic savvy, political stability, and effective personalities provides a model that has been studied by many other nations\u301044\u2020L323-L328\u3011. In sum, Singapore\u2019s success was not due to luck or one factor alone, but rather the *synergy* of all these factors working in concert over three critical decades. \n\n**Sources:** The information above is drawn from historical analyses, government archives, and expert accounts, including Singapore government publications and statements by key figures, as cited in the text\u30101\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301044\u2020L309-L317\u3011, among others.
