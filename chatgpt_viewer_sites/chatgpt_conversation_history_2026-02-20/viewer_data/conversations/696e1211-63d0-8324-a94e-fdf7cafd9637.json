and silver hit record highs as markets reel from Trump's latest tariff threat","snippet":"Gold and silver prices surged to record highs while European stock markets declined following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose new tariffs on eight European countries in a bid to force the sale of Greenland to the U.S. On Monday morning, gold jumped 1.6% to $4,666 per ounce, having hit a peak of $4,689, while silver climbed 3.6% to $93.15 after briefly reaching $94.08. The heightened geopolitical risk pushed investors toward safe-haven assets and caused the U.S. dollar to weaken, notably falling 4% against the Swiss franc and 0.2% versus the Japanese yen.\n\nEuropean markets reacted negatively, with France\u2019s CAC 40 falling 1.6%, Germany\u2019s DAX 1.4%, and London's FTSE 100 down 0.3%. Major European automakers and U.S. tech stocks listed abroad also saw significant losses. Trump's proposed tariffs would begin at 10% on February 1 and rise to 25% by June 1 unless a deal over Greenland is reached, raising concerns over escalating trade tensions. Analysts warn that if Trump's aggressive posture continues, especially during the upcoming Davos forum, the current market instability may intensify. The EU is reportedly preparing retaliation if these tariffs are enacted.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768809526.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-silver-hit-record-highs-trumps-greenland-tariffs-spark-safety-rally-2026-01-19/","title":"Gold, silver hit record highs as Trump's Greenland tariffs spark safety rally","snippet":"Gold and silver prices surged to record highs on Monday amidst rising geopolitical tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose additional tariffs on European nations unless they agree to sell Greenland to the United States. Spot gold rose 1.6% to $4,666.65 per ounce, after peaking at $4,689.39, while U.S. gold futures hit $4,671.40 per ounce. Spot silver soared 4% to $93.50 after reaching a record $94.08. Analysts attributed the rally to a shift toward safe-haven assets like gold, yen, and the Swiss franc amid increased geopolitical risks and market uncertainty. EU diplomats are preparing retaliatory measures in case the tariffs proceed. Despite silver\u2019s strong outperformance\u2014evidenced by a sharp drop in the gold-silver ratio\u2014analysts like those at J.P. Morgan remain more bullish on gold due to its more stable structural outlook. Other precious metals also saw gains, with platinum increasing 1.1% to $2,353.25 and palladium edging up 0.2% to $1,804.06.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1768809079.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/business/factbox-gold-price-facts-and-milestones-on-road-to-800-idUSL28761191/","title":"FACTBOX - Gold price facts and milestones on road to $800","snippet":"2 Nov 2007 \u2014 * January 1980 - Gold hits record high at $850 per ounce.

Investors turned to safe-haven assets, pushing gold to $4,689.39 per ounce and silver up 3.3% to $94.08 per ounce. The dollar weakened, and global stock markets, including the FTSE 100, Nikkei, and major European indices, fell. The FTSE 100 decline was softened by gains in precious metal miners and defense stocks. \n\nTrump proposed a new tariff plan beginning with a 10% levy on imports from several European nations, potentially rising to 25% by June 1. In response, Brussels is considering reinstating tariffs on \u20ac93 billion of US goods and broader restrictions on American services and investments. Analysts highlight that disruptions to capital flows\u2014not trade\u2014pose the greatest risk. With European investors holding $8 trillion in U.S. assets, market shifts could be significant. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions with Iran kept Brent crude oil prices stable near $64 per barrel.

Oil prices also climbed due to conflict in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Thames Water announced it had received six takeover offers, with hopes to finalize a deal by June. The UK Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing several water companies\u2019 appeals to increase customer bills further.

ANZ raised its gold forecasts, Google parent Alphabet reportedly acquired cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion, and fund managers made a significant shift away from U.S. equities due to recession and trade war concerns.\n\nAdditionally, South Yorkshire announced a move to public transport control, construction insolvencies remained high, and Lloyds Bank prepared for an IT reshuffle that may result in job losses.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1742311760.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.latimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/money-company/story/2009-02-20/gold-tops-1-000-mark-for-first-time-since-march","title":"Gold tops $1000 mark for first time since March","snippet":"20 Feb 2009 \u2014 The contract closed at $1,001.80, short of the record close of $1,004.30 set on March 18, 2008.

This surge, amounting to more than a 50% rise for the year, is driven by investor fears of inflation, growing global debt, and increased demand for safe-haven assets amid the ongoing US government shutdown. Silver also hit a record high at $49.57 per ounce. The rally in gold is supported by robust central bank purchases aimed at diversifying reserves away from the US dollar and strong physical and institutional investor demand. Notably, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio cited gold as a superior alternative to the dollar and a reliable portfolio diversifier. Despite the sharp rise, some market watchers express concern about the unsustainable, parabolic nature of the trend. Data reporting from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also been disrupted due to the shutdown, adding to market opacity. Goldman Sachs has now raised its gold price target to $4,900, citing sustained central bank buying and strong gold-backed ETF inflows.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1759889123.296,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/investing-usd200-in-gold-8715076","title":"Got an Extra $200? Here's How Much You Could Make in 20 Years Investing in Gold","snippet":"This article from Investopedia explores the long-term potential of investing in gold by using a hypothetical $200 investment. It illustrates gold\u2019s historical performance, notably its rise from under $100 per ounce in the 1970s to breaking above $2,000 by 2024. A $200 investment in gold made in 2000 could have grown to nearly $1,900 by 2024, depending on purchase timing and price fluctuations.\n\nGold is praised for its role as a store of value, inflation hedge, and portfolio diversifier, especially during economic or geopolitical crises. Key factors that influence gold prices include inflation, real interest rates, U.S. Federal Reserve policy, currency fluctuations, and investor sentiment. However, gold also has downsides: it doesn\u2019t generate income, is volatile, and physical ownership entails storage and security costs.\n\nThough gold has delivered respectable long-term returns similar to the S&P 500 (excluding dividends), it hasn't always outperformed equities, especially when dividends are included. The article also compares gold to assets like Bitcoin, which has outpaced gold in recent years but with much greater volatility. Overall, the piece emphasizes that gold can be a valuable component of a diversified investment strategy but is not without risks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1727293890.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696e12b136c083228c01d83a28e49419","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for gold price historical peaks and records","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b9680b60-5785-4f96-b227-702a428b3293","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"99507ccb-3e2c-4b3d-921d-a145038ca55e","turn_exchange_id":"7984d10a-6af6-46fa-86e5-d7e61bf54745","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"99507ccb-3e2c-4b3d-921d-a145038ca55e","children":["7cfe4d00-0206-470f-a8ea-388d396de37b"]},"7cfe4d00-0206-470f-a8ea-388d396de37b":{"id":"7cfe4d00-0206-470f-a8ea-388d396de37b","message":{"id":"7cfe4d00-0206-470f-a8ea-388d396de37b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768821522.73318,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying gold price records and sources","content":"I\u2019ve gathered sources for key gold price milestones.

This steep rise, paralleled by significant jumps in silver (nearly $70 an ounce) and other precious metals, reflects a strong rally driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical forces. Central bank bullion purchases, interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and growing geopolitical unrest have made gold a preferred defensive asset. A weakening US dollar and lower yields have further boosted demand. Forecasts suggest gold could reach $US4900\u2013$US5000 by 2026 if current conditions persist.\n\nThis surge has reshaped investor behavior, prompting both retail and institutional interest, with ETFs on the ASX seeing record inflows of $1.6 billion.

However, this growth rate remains slower than the 1.1% projected for 2025. The IMF also projects a 0.6% growth in 2027. Inflation is expected to ease in 2026, aligning with Japan\u2019s 2% target by 2027 as food and commodity prices stabilize. The government, under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, has introduced a record $783 billion budget and a large stimulus program to support households facing higher living costs. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate to 0.75% in December, its highest in 30 years, signaling readiness to continue increasing rates amid prolonged inflation exceeding the target.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1768815405.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-households-expect-prices-keep-rising-survey-shows-2026-01-19/","title":"Japan households expect prices to keep rising, survey shows","snippet":"A Bank of Japan (BOJ) survey from December 2025 shows that a majority of Japanese households expect prices to continue rising over the next few years, supporting expectations of further increases in currently low interest rates. Specifically, 86% of households expect prices to rise a year from now, slightly down from 88% in September, with average anticipated inflation at 11.6%. Looking five years ahead, 83% foresee price increases, down from 84.8%. Despite slight declines in expectations, households remain concerned about inflation, elevating the need for careful monetary policy. The BOJ ended its decade-long stimulus in 2024 and raised interest rates to 0.75% amid continued inflation, driven by solid wage growth and a weakening yen. Core consumer inflation reached 3.0% in November 2025\u2014remaining above the BOJ\u2019s 2% target for nearly four years\u2014while food prices alone surged 7.0%. Though the BOJ is expected to maintain rates in its next meeting, some policymakers suggest future hikes may come earlier due to inflationary pressures.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1768801046.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/some-boj-see-scope-raise-rates-sooner-than-markets-expect-sources-say-2026-01-16/","title":"Some in BOJ see scope to raise rates sooner than markets ...","snippet":"3 days ago \u2014 BOJ set to keep policy rate steady at 0.75% in January; Many in BOJ see scope for more hikes, some won't rule out April; Analysts expect BOJ ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1768531306.982,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/5d6de78f-10a0-4883-8437-c05b9562ab37","title":"Japan's Takaichi calls snap election for February 8 in bid for 'major policy change'","snippet":"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has announced the dissolution of parliament and a snap general election for February 8, just three months into her term.

With approval ratings around 75%, Takaichi is leveraging her popular image as Japan\u2019s first female prime minister and a reformist leader, despite her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) facing unpopularity and losing its coalition with Komeito. The election is expected to be Japan\u2019s shortest post-WWII campaign. The newly aligned opposition between Komeito and the Constitutional Democratic Party could pose a significant challenge. Takaichi also pledged military strengthening and a tougher stance on national security, drawing publicity\u2014and controversy\u2014for remarks involving a hypothetical conflict over Taiwan.

In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF states that current global growth is heavily dependent on a narrow set of drivers\u2014chiefly the booming U.S. technology sector. U.S. growth is forecast at 2.4% in 2026 and 2% in 2027, outpacing other G7 countries. However, a sharp correction in AI-driven market expectations could reduce global growth by 0.4 percentage points.\n\nIMF's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas cited growing concerns over rising leverage among AI firms and potential stock market overvaluation, drawing comparisons to the dotcom bubble. Despite geopolitical tensions, including trade threats from the U.S. President and instability over U.S. Federal Reserve independence, global growth expectations for 2026 were upgraded from 3.1% to 3.3%. China and Canada also showed improved forecasts, while UK and Germany\u2019s projections remain modest.\n\nThe IMF highlighted both downside risks and an optimistic scenario where AI productivity delivers earlier-than-expected benefits, potentially boosting growth. Central bank independence, especially that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, was emphasized as vital for global financial stability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1768815030.139,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/imf-sees-steady-global-growth-2026-ai-boom-offsets-trade-headwinds-2026-01-19/","title":"IMF sees steady global growth in 2026 as AI boom offsets trade headwinds","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its global growth forecast for 2026 to 3.3%, driven by a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) investments and easing U.S. tariff pressures. This marks a 0.2 percentage point increase since October 2025, with 2025 growth also revised up to 3.3%. The 2027 forecast remains steady at 3.2%. The improved outlook reflects adaptation by global businesses to reroute supply chains and benefit from new trade agreements and reductions in U.S. tariffs.\n\nAI investment\u2014particularly in infrastructure like data centers and chips\u2014is significantly boosting growth in the U.S. (now forecast at 2.4% for 2026), Spain, and the UK. However, IMF officials warn that excessive reliance on AI-fueled gains could pose inflation risks or trigger corrections if productivity expectations aren't met.

While employment shows modest softening and consumer job confidence has waned, economic growth remains robust, with the Atlanta Fed projecting Q3 GDP growth at 3.9%.\n\nInflation persists above the 2% target, partly fueled by tariffs, and Powell suggested that price pressure could remain. A lack of key government data due to a federal shutdown has increased uncertainty, making policy decisions harder and likened by Powell to \"driving in the fog.\" Markets had anticipated further easing, but Powell\u2019s comments reduced expectations for a December rate cut from 92% to 67%. Despite ending quantitative tightening, Powell emphasized it shouldn\u2019t be taken as a pivot toward easing. His leadership faces a rising challenge as differing views within the Fed intensify ahead of his term's 2026 end.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1761778380.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/6a04be70-6d05-4f03-b4c7-39ceae52bb64","title":"Fed to launch $40bn debt-buying scheme after money market strains","snippet":"The Federal Reserve announced a $40 billion short-term Treasury bill purchasing program starting December 12, 2025, to stabilize money markets following volatility caused by its recent quantitative tightening (QT) efforts. This move comes shortly after the Fed halted QT on December 1, amid rising concerns over strained overnight lending markets, notably the repo market, where interest rates had become disconnected from the Fed's target rates. The program will target Treasury debt maturing within four weeks to a year and aims to bolster banking system reserves ahead of April\u2019s tax season, which typically drains liquidity.\n\nFed Chair Jay Powell clarified that the purchases are not intended as a return to broader monetary stimulus but rather as a technical intervention to maintain reserve stability. Analysts likened the move to the 2019 repo market crisis, where a similar miscalculation in balance sheet reduction led to a liquidity crunch. Wall Street had anticipated such a program, but the scale and urgency exceeded expectations, reflecting the Fed\u2019s concern over recent market behaviors. Overall, the initiative is designed to preempt deeper market disruptions by replenishing reserves and smoothing out short-term funding pressures.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1765408247.122,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investors.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-oct-rate-cut-end-qt-jerome-powell-sp-500/","title":"Fed Cuts Key Rate; Powell Says December Move No Sure Thing; S&P 500 Falls (Live Coverage)","snippet":"On October 29, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point interest rate cut, reducing the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%\u20134%, and declared an end to quantitative tightening starting in December. This reflects a shift toward easing monetary policy amid concerns over rising unemployment and moderated inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that a further rate cut in December is not guaranteed, citing economic uncertainties and mixed signals on growth and inflation. While core inflation excluding tariffs hovers near the Fed\u2019s 2% target, tariff-driven inflation could be more persistent. Powell also noted stronger-than-expected economic activity and hinted at future asset purchases as the Fed aims to maintain appropriate reserve levels. Market reactions were mixed, with the S&P 500 experiencing slight fluctuations. Meanwhile, new Fed board members displayed policy divisions, and the central bank reaffirmed its dual mandate of promoting employment and price stability. Mortgage-related securities will be reinvested into short-term Treasuries, reducing support for the mortgage market. Despite uncertainty, markets mostly expect another cut in December, though Powell's comments introduced some caution.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1761764280.0,"attribution":"www.investors.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_696e216a62408330a8ec53a83587e52b","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for official statements on Fed balance sheet runoff","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"0c4549d9-8a21-4bab-a956-43e0788ecbac","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"59aabb02-4605-4dc0-9cf0-d861c10aa24f","turn_exchange_id":"0aee8175-10ce-4361-b07e-7d4352d90d72","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"59aabb02-4605-4dc0-9cf0-d861c10aa24f","children":["5520a5db-37f6-4ee7-a58d-2030725a8b3b"]},"5520a5db-37f6-4ee7-a58d-2030725a8b3b":{"id":"5520a5db-37f6-4ee7-a58d-2030725a8b3b","message":{"id":"5520a5db-37f6-4ee7-a58d-2030725a8b3b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768825240.011599,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing gold's peak timing in past economic cycles","content":"To address the first question, we should analyze historical gold peaks relative to stock market or economic declines.

The year began with a record high for the S&P 500 in February, followed by a sharp crash and the fastest bear market in history, triggered by lockdown-induced economic fears. The bear market lasted only 23 trading days, ending on March 23 when the Federal Reserve intervened with massive monetary stimulus, complemented by a $2 trillion fiscal package from the federal government. This support helped fuel a rapid stock market rebound, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all closing the year at record highs, gaining 16.3%, 7.2%, and 43.6% respectively.\n\nInvestors shifted focus later in the year toward cyclical and small-cap stocks, anticipating economic recovery, though technology and growth stocks continued to outperform. Tesla became the top-performing and most-traded stock with a 743% gain, while stay-at-home beneficiaries like Etsy also soared. In contrast, industries like cruise lines suffered heavily. The rise of retail investors, aided by low-cost trading apps, resulted in a surge in trading activity and a spike in new stock offerings. Overall, 2020 was the most volatile year for the S&P 500 in over a decade.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1609438204.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032616/what-if-you-had-invested-10000-2008s-low.asp","title":"Investing $10,000 at 2009 Financial Crisis Lows: What Are Your Returns?","snippet":"If you had invested $10,000 at the market bottom during the 2008-2009 financial crisis (March 9, 2009), your returns by October 2020 would have been significant, depending on the index chosen. Investing in the S&P 500 through the SPDR ETF (SPY) would have yielded approximately $51,334, a 413% gain. A similar investment in the Dow Jones through the DIA ETF would have grown to around $43,747. The Nasdaq performed the best, with a $10,000 investment in Fidelity\u2019s ONEQ ETF growing to about $89,068, an 791% return, driven by the tech sector\u2019s strong performance.\n\nThe analysis notes that while these past gains were impressive, repeating such high returns over the next decade is unlikely. Future expectations point toward more moderate, historical average returns of 8\u201310% annually, particularly with evolving central bank policies and interest rate adjustments.

Analysts noted that while earlier downturns had been dismissed by investors as anticipated consequences of the pandemic, the severity of the economic contraction, particularly in consumer-driven sectors, began to affect market sentiment. Economist Michael Pearce warned of even steeper economic declines in April and the second quarter overall. Although Wall Street had rebounded around 26% from its March 23 bear market low, buoyed by government stimulus and slowing virus cases in hotspots like New York, experts like Larry Adam cautioned about the ongoing struggle between hope and reality.

This move comes shortly after the Fed halted QT on December 1, amid rising concerns over strained overnight lending markets, notably the repo market, where interest rates had become disconnected from the Fed's target rates. The program will target Treasury debt maturing within four weeks to a year and aims to bolster banking system reserves ahead of April\u2019s tax season, which typically drains liquidity.\n\nFed Chair Jay Powell clarified that the purchases are not intended as a return to broader monetary stimulus but rather as a technical intervention to maintain reserve stability. Analysts likened the move to the 2019 repo market crisis, where a similar miscalculation in balance sheet reduction led to a liquidity crunch. Wall Street had anticipated such a program, but the scale and urgency exceeded expectations, reflecting the Fed\u2019s concern over recent market behaviors.
