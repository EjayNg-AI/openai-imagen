You can monitor/stop it anytime. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n3) (Optional) Set table partition expiration to control storage costs; BigQuery has a free usage level, but normal BQ storage/query pricing applies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n**What lands in BQ:** tables like `searchdata_site_impression`, `searchdata_url_impression`, plus an `ExportLog`. (Google\u2019s docs list the exact schema.) \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search0\ue201\n\n## Option A2 \u2014 Roll your own **daily API export** (CSV/Sheets/DB)\nWhat you get: complete control; works without BQ. Use the **Search Analytics API** with `rowLimit=25000` and paginate via `startRow` to pull *all* rows you need each day. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n**Minimal outline:**\n- Create a GCP project, enable **Search Console API**, create OAuth or a **service account**. Add the service account email as a **user/owner** on your GSC property. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search0\ue201\n- Nightly job: request **yesterday\u2019s** data for dimensions you care about (e.g., `[\"date\",\"page\",\"query\"]`), page through 25k-row windows until zero rows returned, then **upsert** into your store.\n- Schedule with cron/GitHub Actions. Keep a simple **dedupe key** on `(date,page,query,device,country)`.\n\n> Caveats that apply to both A1/A2: the **16-month limit** is only in the GSC UI/API history; once you export daily, you own the full history. GSC still **filters/suppresses some queries** for privacy; bulk export documents this explicitly. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n# B) \u201cSeparate crawler index\u201d for backlinks (beyond GSC Links)\n\nThink in tiers\u2014from zero maintenance to fully self-hosted.\n\n## Tier B1 \u2014 **Bing Webmaster Tools (free)**\nVerify your site and use **Backlinks**: referring domains/pages and anchor text, exportable\u2014complements Google\u2019s sample with Microsoft\u2019s index. No cookies/scripts on your site. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search13\ue201\n\n## Tier B2 \u2014 **Third-party indexes** (data-rich, external)\nTools like Ahrefs/Majestic/Moz maintain independent web-wide link graphs. You verify ownership and read their index; no on-site tags required. (Good coverage, but you are sharing your domain with a vendor\u2014not user data.)\n\n## Tier B3 \u2014 **Self-hosted discovery via Common Crawl** (heavyweight)\nIf you truly want to avoid any vendor index, you can mine the open **Common Crawl** corpus for **outlinks to your domain**. In practice this means:\n1) Use the monthly **WAT** files (they contain extracted **links** from each crawled page). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search8\ue201  \n2) Spin up an AWS EMR/Spark (or similar) job to scan the WATs and filter link objects whose URL matches `*.yourdomain.tld`. Store distinct `(source_url \u2192 target_url, anchor)` in your DB. (Expect **multi-TB scans** per month.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n3) Re-run monthly and de-dupe.\n\n> This is feasible but **non-trivial** (cost, ops, and lag). Unless you need strict vendor independence, **B1** covers most real-world needs with minimal overhead.\n\n---\n\n## Which should you pick?\n\n- **Most robust + minimal ops:** Turn on **Bulk Data Export to BigQuery** (A1) + add **Bing Webmaster Tools** (B1). That gives you full, permanent performance history and a broader backlink view\u2014still cookie-free and privacy-respecting. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- **Lowest cost, DIY:** API script to CSV/DB (A2) + periodic **Bing exports** (B1). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- **Vendor-free backlinks:** Common Crawl pipeline (B3)\u2014only if you truly need it; otherwise it\u2019s overkill. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search8\ue202turn0search14\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can drop in a ready-to-run Python script (Search Console \u2192 CSV with pagination + cron snippet) and a one-time checklist to switch on BQ Bulk Export."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201","start_idx":591,"end_idx":610,"safe_urls":["https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/bulk-data-export?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/bulk-data-export?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Bulk data export: a new and powerful way to access your ...","url":"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/bulk-data-export?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In this post, we discuss bulk data export, a new Search Console feature that allows you to export data to Google BigQuery on an ongoing basis.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Google for Developers"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201","start_idx":686,"end_idx":706,"safe_urls":["https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/12917675?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google Help](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/12917675?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Start a new bulk data export - Search Console Help","url":"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/12917675?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Configure and start an ongoing bulk data export.

Exports are **once per day**, with **partitioned** tables you can retain forever (or expire via partition TTL). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n**A. In Google Cloud Console**\n1) Create/select a GCP project; **enable billing** and **enable BigQuery + BigQuery Storage API**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n2) **IAM \u2192 Grant access** to the principal:  \n   `search-console-data-export@system.gserviceaccount.com`  \n   Roles (both): **BigQuery Data Editor** and **BigQuery Job User**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201\n\n**B. In Search Console (for your property)**\n1) Go to **Settings \u2192 Bulk data export**.  \n2) Enter your **Cloud project ID** (not project number). Choose a **dataset name** (defaults to `searchconsole`, you can customize; if exporting multiple properties into one project, use different dataset names). Choose a **location** (US/EU). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n3) Click **Continue** to start. First export may take **up to 48h** and includes the **day of setup**; missed days are retried for about a week if there are transient errors. Don\u2019t modify table schemas. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n4) (Optional) In BigQuery, set a **partition expiration** on the dataset/tables if you want to cap storage growth. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n**Table reference & behavior**\n- Tables: `searchdata_site_impression`, `searchdata_url_impression`, `ExportLog`.  \n- Fields include `data_date`, `site_url`, `url` (in URL table), `query`, `country`, `device`, `impressions`, `clicks`, and **sum of top position** for computing average position. **Anonymized** queries are flagged. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Why keep both (CSV job + BQ export)?\n\n- **CSV job** gives you portable, easy-to-diff daily extracts and redundancy.  \n- **BQ export** gives you **full-fidelity history** with SQL power and no API pagination. Google explicitly designed Bulk Export for this use case. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can also drop a sample **BigQuery SQL** to compute monthly page\u00d7query trends and a tiny **Makefile** to bundle the exporter + cron + venv

Here\u2019s the clean, minimal way for each case, with WSL called out first since you\u2019re on Windows.\n\n# WSL (Ubuntu) \u2014 recommended\n## 1) Ensure services work (systemd in WSL2)\n```bash\n# inside WSL\nsudo tee /etc/wsl.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'\n[boot]\nsystemd=true\nEOF\n```\nIn Windows PowerShell:\n```powershell\nwsl --shutdown\n```\nRe-open WSL. Verify:\n```bash\nsystemctl is-system-running    # should not say \"stopped\"\n```\n\n## 2) Install & start cron\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y cron\nsudo systemctl enable --now cron\nsystemctl status cron\n```\n\n## 3) Add your job\nUse absolute paths and a venv-activating wrapper (`run.sh`) as we set up earlier.\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/gsc-export/logs\ncrontab -e\n```\nAdd (example paths):\n```\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n# run daily; logs appended\n15 17 * * * /home/ejay/gsc-export/run.sh >> /home/ejay/gsc-export/logs/cron.log 2>&1\n```\nWhy **17:15 SGT**? That\u2019s **02:15 PT** (GSC\u2019s date semantics). Your script already queries **\u201cyesterday (PT)\u201d**, so it\u2019s robust, but aligning to PT avoids edge cases.\n\n## 4) Sanity-check\n- List jobs: `crontab -l`  \n- Tail logs: `tail -f ~/gsc-export/logs/cron.log`  \n- Force a run now: `bash ~/gsc-export/run.sh`\n\n> If you don\u2019t enable systemd, you can still `sudo service cron start` each session, but it won\u2019t auto-start reliably in WSL.\n\n---\n\n# Windows (no WSL) \u2014 Task Scheduler\nIf you prefer native Windows:\n1) Create `C:\\Users\\<you>\\gsc-export\\run_gsc_export.bat`:\n   ```bat\n   @echo off\n   cd /d C:\\Users\\<you>\\gsc-export\n   call .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   python gsc_export.py --property \"sc-domain:sgmathtuition.com\" >> logs\\task.log 2>&1\n   ```\n2) Task Scheduler \u2192 **Create Task**  \n   - Triggers: Daily at **17:15**  \n   - Actions: *Start a program* \u2192 `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe`  \n     Arguments: `/c C:\\Users\\<you>\\gsc-export\\run_gsc_export.bat`  \n     Start in: `C:\\Users\\<you>\\gsc-export`  \n   - Run whether user is logged on or not.\n\n(If you want to run the WSL build from Task Scheduler instead, make the BAT call:  \n`wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-22.04 /bin/bash -lc 'cd ~/gsc-export && ./run.sh'`)\n\n---\n\n# macOS (for completeness)\nUse `launchd` (cron is legacy here).\n\n1) `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ejay.gsc-export.plist`:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\"><dict>\n  <key>Label</key><string>com.ejay.gsc-export</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array><string>/bin/bash</string><string>-lc</string>\n    <string>cd /Users/ejay/gsc-export && ./run.sh</string></array>\n  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key><dict><key>Hour</key><integer>17</integer><key>Minute</key><integer>15</integer></dict>\n  <key>WorkingDirectory</key><string>/Users/ejay/gsc-export</string>\n  <key>StandardOutPath</key><string>/Users/ejay/gsc-export/logs/launchd.out</string>\n  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string>/Users/ejay/gsc-export/logs/launchd.err</string>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>\n</dict></plist>\n```\n2) Load:\n```bash\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ejay.gsc-export.plist\nlaunchctl start com.ejay.gsc-export\n```\n\n---\n\n## Practical tips (don\u2019t skip)\n- **Absolute paths only** in cron/launchd; cron\u2019s PATH is minimal.  \n- **LF line endings** for shell scripts (run `dos2unix run.sh` if edited on Windows).  \n- **Permissions**: `chmod +x run.sh` and ensure your venv lives at a stable path.  \n- **Machine sleep**: If your PC isn\u2019t always on at 17:15 SGT, consider:\n  - Install **anacron** (Linux) to run missed daily jobs on next boot, or  \n  - Schedule **two runs/day** (e.g., 08:15 and 17:15) \u2014 exports are idempotent if you keep one CSV per date.  \n- **GSC delay**: Data can lag 2\u20133 days; your job will simply write fewer rows some days. Optionally add a weekly \u201cbackfill last 7 days\u201d runner that de-dupes by `(date,page,query,device,country)`.\n\nIf you want that backfill wrapper (tiny Bash loop that calls your exporter for the past N days), say the word and I\u2019ll drop it in."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":4089,"end_idx":4089,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"981a5b90cccd1a58-MAA","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"3c23b3b5-8dbd-4261-babe-610f4a1641f5","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3c23b3b5-8dbd-4261-babe-610f4a1641f5","children":[]}}}
