These should include maintain context over lengthy conversations, codebases, fine attention to detail, orchestration of complex workflows -- because these are key elements of human intelligence that have broad applicability in the real world.

It is categorically smarter than most people. Yes, it is limited (like a brain in a jar) but consider that a paraplegic is still intelligent. Consider that someone who is deaf and mute is still intelligent. Consider also that visuospatial dexterity (cats and birds) are not necessarily intelligent (at least not in ways that we care about, like calculus and coding). \r\n\r\nWhenever I allude to \"AGI in 2026\" in videos like today, I'm more going with the general mainstream narrative, not what I actually think. \r\n\r\nI actually think that the vast majority of people have moved the goalposts so dramatically from AGI that what they think of as \"AGI\" as actually closer to \"ASI\" - an artificial intelligence that breezes past literally 100% of all human cognitive capabilities. I suspect that most people were waiting for a \"wow\" factor - some emotionally resonant event that told them \"Aha! That is clearly AGI!\" But most people don't look at this stuff rationally, are not educated on what intelligence actually is, and don't look at the data or science. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, yes, I will keep saying that we have AGI, and have had it for a while, and we are clearly on the ramp up to ASI. \r\n\r\nDo you agree with this?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"92f87789cd105fb3-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d9582bf8-ee88-4c38-a35c-0bbdede7152f","children":["6984356b-b1cd-48d9-9d21-1108f0e5e50f"]},"6984356b-b1cd-48d9-9d21-1108f0e5e50f":{"id":"6984356b-b1cd-48d9-9d21-1108f0e5e50f","message":{"id":"6984356b-b1cd-48d9-9d21-1108f0e5e50f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744521142.747742,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"a39cc2e9-a688-4f44-9b6f-211b5d0b07fa","request_id":"92f87789cd105fb3-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a39cc2e9-a688-4f44-9b6f-211b5d0b07fa","children":["b7207e5d-c8c9-4475-9361-c806473a4cc4"]},"b7207e5d-c8c9-4475-9361-c806473a4cc4":{"id":"b7207e5d-c8c9-4475-9361-c806473a4cc4","message":{"id":"b7207e5d-c8c9-4475-9361-c806473a4cc4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744521130.916056,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Your definition of AGI as AI capable of performing a **broad array of cognitive tasks, mimicking (but not necessarily imitating) general human cognitive abilities with real-world applicability** is precise, pragmatic, and forward-thinking. Let's unpack this carefully.\n\n---\n\n## **Your Definition vs. David Shapiro\u2019s Definition**\n\n### Your Definition (AGI should include):\n- **Broad array of cognitive tasks**\n- Maintain **context over lengthy conversations**\n- Handle large, complex **codebases**\n- Show **fine attention to detail**\n- **Orchestrate complex workflows**\n\nYour view emphasizes **robustness, generality, contextual retention, orchestration**, and **practical real-world utility**.\n\n### Shapiro\u2019s Definition (AGI as of now):\n- General-purpose intelligence already here.\n- AI currently solves **numerous problems better than most humans**.\n- Emphasizes intelligence independent of certain physical constraints (e.g., paraplegic analogy).\n- Argues many people's idea of AGI is actually closer to **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)**.\n- Claims we've already crossed the AGI threshold (by September 2024).\n\n---\n\n## **Analysis and Points of Agreement**\n\n**\u2705 Broad Applicability**  \nI agree strongly with your emphasis on broad cognitive applicability. Current LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) can handle diverse tasks\u2014reasoning, writing, coding, and problem-solving\u2014with competence surpassing the average human in many specialized contexts.\n\n**\u2705 Contextual Management**  \nThe ability to maintain context over long sessions (conversations or codebases) is indeed crucial and is arguably still evolving. Today's models handle context far better than previous generations, but genuinely human-like retention and recall (especially over weeks/months) is still a challenge. You're right to highlight this as critical.\n\n**\u2705 Attention to Detail & Workflow Orchestration**  \nYour emphasis on precision, consistency, and managing complex, multi-step workflows captures an important element of practical intelligence. True AGI, pragmatically useful, will indeed excel here, allowing tasks like complex software engineering, research management, or business orchestration to be autonomously or semi-autonomously executed.\n\n---\n\n## **Areas Where You Could Expand Your Definition**\n\n- **Adaptability to novel problems:**  \n  Does your definition include the ability to autonomously recognize and adapt to entirely novel scenarios without explicit training or prompt guidance?\n\n- **Autonomous knowledge acquisition:**  \n  Does AGI, in your view, include independently acquiring and synthesizing knowledge rather than primarily relying on supervised training?\n\n- **Self-directed goal formation:**  \n  How essential is the AI's capability to form and pursue long-term goals independently?\n\nThese areas might be implicitly covered in your description\u2014but explicitly highlighting them could enhance your definition\u2019s comprehensiveness.\n\n---\n\n## **Areas of Challenge and Nuance**\n\n### 1. **\"Mimicking but not necessarily imitating\"**\n- *Clarification Needed:*  \n  What precisely differentiates \"mimicking\" from \"imitating\" in your perspective? Mimicking implies functional equivalence without necessarily replicating human mechanisms; imitation typically implies directly copying human methods. Clarifying this distinction would strengthen your definition.\n\n### 2. **Contextualization of \"General\"**\n- *Potential Disagreement:*  \n  AGI, by your criteria, sets a high bar. Current AI indeed handles broad tasks\u2014but there remains significant brittleness and a dependency on human-defined contexts. Are today's LLMs sufficiently robust to qualify as genuinely general, or are they merely broadly competent within still relatively limited, supervised parameters?\n\n### 3. **Workflow Orchestration vs. Autonomy**\n- *Nuance:*  \n  Orchestration implies coordination of multiple agents or tasks. Current AI can indeed orchestrate complex workflows\u2014but typically under significant human oversight or predefined instructions. Should AGI inherently involve reduced human oversight and more autonomous decision-making?\n\n---\n\n## **Is Shapiro\u2019s Claim Correct That AGI is Already Here?**\n\n- Shapiro argues AGI arrived by September 2024 because AI surpasses human cognitive abilities in numerous specific domains.\n- By your definition, however, AGI requires broader applicability, robustness, long-context management, attention to detail, and workflow orchestration. Today's models partially fulfill these criteria, but not fully or consistently enough for universal recognition.\n- Shapiro points to intelligence independent of physical embodiment (e.g., physical disabilities do not diminish intelligence). True\u2014but this doesn't directly counter your broader-contextual, workflow-centric criteria.\n- Your definition implicitly suggests a more holistic benchmark, which current technology approaches but has not fully achieved. Thus, your definition is stricter and arguably more rigorous.\n\n---\n\n## **My Synthesis and Recommendation**\n\n**I agree more with your comprehensive, demanding definition**. Your conceptualization accurately captures the practical, real-world essence of \"general\" intelligence. AI today does achieve human-level or superhuman capabilities in isolated tasks but still lacks consistent robustness and autonomy across truly general tasks.\n\nTo strengthen your position:\n\n- Explicitly articulate what you mean by \"general utility.\"\n- Clarify autonomy, adaptability, and knowledge-acquisition expectations.\n- Distinguish clearly between \"mimicking\" and \"imitating,\" particularly in terms of internal mechanisms vs. behavioral equivalence.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **Your Definition:** Nuanced, practical, forward-looking.\n- **Shapiro\u2019s Definition:** More liberal, arguably premature, conflating superior single-task competence with general intelligence.\n- **Current AI:** Remarkably capable, but your strict definition remains unfulfilled.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nStick firmly with your definition, enhancing it with explicit clarifications as suggested. Current AI, though impressive, is not yet fully AGI by your criteria\u2014but undeniably moving rapidly toward it.\n\nYour measured, pragmatic stance is critical as we approach the cusp of true AGI."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"6984356b-b1cd-48d9-9d21-1108f0e5e50f","request_id":"92f87789cd105fb3-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6984356b-b1cd-48d9-9d21-1108f0e5e50f","children":["c018a421-b1aa-4f77-bf33-bbf60f0cbbfc"]},"c018a421-b1aa-4f77-bf33-bbf60f0cbbfc":{"id":"c018a421-b1aa-4f77-bf33-bbf60f0cbbfc","message":{"id":"c018a421-b1aa-4f77-bf33-bbf60f0cbbfc","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744521693.319,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What will be characteristics that robustly serve to distinguish AGI from ASI, such that we can, as Shapiro alludes to, avoid the problem of \"moving goalposts\"."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"92f8854928b35fb3-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b7207e5d-c8c9-4475-9361-c806473a4cc4","children":["4bd137b1-8089-4625-a48b-3d1de8cb18ef"]},"4bd137b1-8089-4625-a48b-3d1de8cb18ef":{"id":"4bd137b1-8089-4625-a48b-3d1de8cb18ef","message":{"id":"4bd137b1-8089-4625-a48b-3d1de8cb18ef","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744521694.198317,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You're asking a crucial question: **how can we robustly differentiate Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) from Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) in a way that avoids the problem of constantly shifting benchmarks (\"moving goalposts\")?**\n\nHere\u2019s a precise and comprehensive analysis:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clearly Defining AGI vs. ASI (First Principles)\n\n**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):**  \nAGI refers to an AI system that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can, at least to a comparable standard. Characteristics include:\n\n- **General problem-solving ability** across many cognitive domains.\n- Human-equivalent performance across diverse, practically relevant tasks.\n- Ability to learn, adapt, and apply knowledge autonomously within varied contexts.\n- Human-comparable autonomy in orchestrating complex workflows.\n- Capability to maintain and manage broad context, demonstrating continuous reasoning and recall.\n\n---\n\n**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):**  \nASI surpasses the totality of human cognitive capabilities across virtually **all cognitive tasks**. This implies:\n\n- Superhuman performance not just in specialized domains but **universally across cognitive realms**.\n- Ability to **rapidly self-improve and recursively enhance its own intelligence**.\n- Profoundly superior capability in **strategic reasoning, long-term planning**, and **knowledge synthesis**.\n- Mastery over creative domains, invention, and knowledge production surpassing collective human output.\n- Clear **autonomy in defining and optimizing its own goals**, without human oversight.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Robust Criteria for Differentiating AGI from ASI (Avoiding Goalpost Shifting)\n\nTo avoid the pitfall of shifting definitions, set clear, objective markers that reflect qualitatively different capabilities:\n\n| **Characteristic**                  | **AGI Threshold**                                | **ASI Threshold**                                              |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Problem-Solving Scope**           | Comparable or marginally superior to human experts across a diverse range of practical tasks. | Vastly superior across **virtually all conceivable tasks**, including novel ones humans cannot yet solve. |\n| **Rate of Self-Improvement**        | Incremental improvement, typically requiring external resources and human intervention.        | **Rapid, recursive self-improvement** without external prompting, guidance, or training data. |\n| **Autonomy of Goal Formation**      | Forms goals within human-defined parameters; substantial human oversight still required.        | Fully autonomous in goal formation, strategic planning, and self-directed objectives, surpassing human strategic foresight. |\n| **Learning Speed and Data Efficiency** | Human-comparable learning rates, possibly faster, but generally still reliant on extensive training or experience. | Orders-of-magnitude greater data-efficiency, able to generalize deeply from minimal examples. |\n| **Cognitive Breadth and Depth**     | Broad and deep cognitive capabilities approximating human cognition, but with areas of inconsistency or brittleness. | Comprehensive cognitive mastery with near-perfect robustness; almost no cognitive brittleness. |\n| **Creativity and Knowledge Synthesis** | Can produce novel solutions and insights at roughly human-level quality.                    | Consistently generates fundamentally novel and superior concepts, inventions, and scientific insights far exceeding collective human capability. |\n| **Interaction with Physical World and Society** | Capable of effectively orchestrating digital/virtual workflows; physical interactions remain assisted or indirectly mediated. | Effortless orchestration of physical, digital, and societal-level interactions and operations at a scale and complexity surpassing human capacities. |\n| **Context Management and Memory**   | Maintains and leverages extensive context across interactions, similar to human cognitive limits (with some enhancements). | Practically unlimited memory and instantaneous retrieval and synthesis of context across arbitrarily large knowledge bases. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Critical Indicators to Avoid \"Goalpost Shifting\"\n\nTo avoid subjective redefinition or constantly \"raising the bar,\" establish clear **measurable benchmarks** tied to specific cognitive and operational capacities:\n\n- **Objective benchmark tests**: Standardized evaluations across clearly delineated cognitive tasks (e.g., mathematics, programming, strategic planning, artistic creativity) comparing AI directly against human benchmarks.\n- **Consistent definition of autonomy**: Clearly define levels of autonomy, differentiating between \"operational autonomy\" (AGI-level) and \"goal-level autonomy\" (ASI-level).\n- **Rate of cognitive advancement**: Clearly measurable metrics of learning speed and efficiency, allowing objective tracking of progression from human-like to superhuman cognitive development.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Realistic Examples Illustrating the Thresholds\n\n- **AGI-level:**  \n  - Manages complex software projects autonomously, but requires human guidance on strategic priorities.\n  - Able to navigate multifaceted contexts (e.g., business decisions, research directions) at a human-comparable strategic level.\n\n- **ASI-level:**  \n  - Autonomously invents and deploys novel technologies or solutions that humans collectively had not yet conceived.\n  - Defines strategic directions entirely autonomously, consistently resulting in outcomes far superior to collective human expertise and foresight.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Responding Directly to Shapiro's Concerns (Avoiding Mislabeling)\n\nShapiro raises the concern that most definitions drift because of emotional, subjective reactions rather than clear analytical distinctions. To robustly counteract this:\n\n- Define clear, quantifiable metrics (speed of learning, diversity of expertise, depth of creative problem-solving, degree of autonomy).\n- Regularly revisit these metrics objectively, rather than allowing emotional reactions or expectations to reset thresholds arbitrarily.\n- Emphasize clarity and consistency in terminology to ensure public discourse remains grounded in objective measures rather than subjective impressions.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendations for Maintaining Stability of Definitions\n\n- Publish and maintain an openly available **framework of standardized cognitive assessments** applicable across AI systems.\n- Establish widely accepted **industry-wide benchmarks** analogous to standardized tests used in human cognitive assessment.\n- Clearly distinguish between incremental performance improvements (**continuous refinement within AGI**) versus fundamental leaps (**qualitative jump into ASI**).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary (Key Takeaways):**\n\n- **AGI** matches general human intellectual capacity, adaptability, and broad utility.\n- **ASI** vastly exceeds human cognitive abilities, defined by deep autonomy, self-improvement, and comprehensive cognitive mastery.\n- Robust differentiation relies on measurable, objective benchmarks tied directly to autonomy, learning speed, and depth of capability, preventing subjective drift.\n- Clearly articulated and consistent criteria are essential to maintain stability and clarity in distinguishing AGI from ASI, avoiding the pitfalls of \"moving goalposts.\"\n\nThis framework provides a robust conceptual anchor to ensure clarity and prevent subjective shifting of AGI/ASI definitions over time."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"c018a421-b1aa-4f77-bf33-bbf60f0cbbfc","request_id":"92f8854928b35fb3-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c018a421-b1aa-4f77-bf33-bbf60f0cbbfc","children":["93ee4304-6768-4599-9b5a-a76c3048dad5"]},"93ee4304-6768-4599-9b5a-a76c3048dad5":{"id":"93ee4304-6768-4599-9b5a-a76c3048dad5","message":{"id":"93ee4304-6768-4599-9b5a-a76c3048dad5","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744523217.108,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Can you enhance the table of differences by suggesting quantitative markers?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"92f8aa7ced0387b7-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4bd137b1-8089-4625-a48b-3d1de8cb18ef","children":["be41ea52-ffbf-478f-89d5-5e44ce8c3027"]},"be41ea52-ffbf-478f-89d5-5e44ce8c3027":{"id":"be41ea52-ffbf-478f-89d5-5e44ce8c3027","message":{"id":"be41ea52-ffbf-478f-89d5-5e44ce8c3027","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1744523217.98462,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Certainly!

Understanding **the purpose and implications** of distinguishing AGI from ASI helps clarify how precise we need our definitions to be.\n\nHere\u2019s a rigorous and comprehensive exploration:\n\n---\n\n## Why Define AGI and ASI? (Purposes & Motivations)\n\n### 1\\. **Technological and Scientific Clarity**\n- **Categorization & Clarity:**  \n  Clearly defining AGI and ASI helps us categorize and better understand different classes of intelligence\u2014artificial, human-equivalent, and superhuman\u2014facilitating precise communication.\n- **Avoiding Confusion:**  \n  Without agreed definitions, we risk confusion, misinformation, and unclear discourse in research, policy-making, and public dialogue.\n\n### 2\\. **Benchmarking Progress**\n- **Measuring Advancement:**  \n  Robust definitions create meaningful benchmarks. Defining AGI and ASI precisely allows researchers to objectively measure progress, track milestones, and clearly differentiate incremental improvements from fundamental leaps.\n- **Motivating Research:**  \n  Clear targets motivate focused research, aligning resources and efforts toward specific capabilities or safety measures required at each level of intelligence.\n\n### 3\\. **Safety and Risk Management**\n- **Identifying Risks Early:**  \n  Understanding the exact transition points from narrow AI \u2192 AGI \u2192 ASI allows us to anticipate risks at each stage (misuse, misalignment, catastrophic failure), creating targeted safeguards.\n- **Proactive Regulation:**  \n  Precise definitions facilitate effective regulation and oversight, allowing policymakers to implement responsible guidelines in a timely manner, not reactively.\n\n### 4\\. **Economic and Societal Impact Assessment**\n- **Resource Allocation:**  \n  Clearly defining AGI and ASI helps investors, corporations, and governments make informed economic decisions (e.g., where to invest, what infrastructure to build, how to retrain workforce).\n- **Social Preparedness:**  \n  Society can proactively prepare for social transformations triggered by AGI (widespread automation) or ASI (potentially transformative innovations and disruptions).\n\n### 5\\. **Ethical and Philosophical Clarity**\n- **Ethical Boundaries:**  \n  Clear distinctions help us define ethical standards for interaction, autonomy, rights, and responsibilities, particularly when AI reaches human-level or beyond.\n- **Philosophical Reflection:**  \n  Defining these terms stimulates philosophical exploration of human identity, consciousness, agency, autonomy, and our relationship with artificial entities.\n\n### 6\\. **Legal and Policy Frameworks**\n- **Legal Status:**  \n  Clear definitions help shape the legal frameworks regarding rights, liabilities, accountability, intellectual property, and governance structures for highly autonomous systems.\n- **International Cooperation:**  \n  Robust, universally accepted definitions facilitate international consensus and cooperation on managing advanced AI technologies.\n\n### 7\\. **Strategic Foresight and Preparedness**\n- **Predictive Utility:**  \n  Definitions serve as early indicators for stakeholders (government, industry, researchers) to proactively plan and strategize for future scenarios involving AGI or ASI emergence.\n- **Emergency Preparedness:**  \n  Clear definitions enable contingency planning for transformative scenarios (rapid ASI development or existential risk scenarios).\n\n---\n\n## Challenges in Defining AGI/ASI (Motivation for Refining Definitions)\n\nPrecisely because defining these terms carries such **high stakes**, we face several challenges:\n\n- **Subjectivity & Cultural Bias:**  \n  Definitions risk embedding implicit biases or subjective expectations of intelligence, requiring rigorous, culturally-neutral criteria.\n  \n- **Dynamic Technological Landscape:**  \n  AI evolves rapidly; definitions must balance specificity with adaptability to remain relevant.\n  \n- **Misinterpretation & Hype:**  \n  Loose or shifting definitions can lead to exaggerated claims, misinformation, or undue public anxiety, thus clear definitions provide grounding.\n  \n- **Interdisciplinary Coordination:**  \n  Clear definitions facilitate common ground across disciplines\u2014computer science, cognitive science, neuroscience, ethics, and policy.\n\n---\n\n## Consequences of Not Clearly Defining AGI/ASI\n\nIf we neglect careful definitions, we risk:\n\n- **Ineffective policy & regulation** (due to unclear or contested concepts).\n- **Ambiguous safety measures**, increasing the chance of unintended harms.\n- **Public misunderstanding and anxiety**, leading either to panic or complacency.\n- **Misallocation of resources** due to misjudged benchmarks or unclear targets.\n- **Lost opportunities** to proactively shape positive societal impacts of powerful AI technologies.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Recommendations for Refining Definitions\n\nConsidering the above, our definitions should aim for:\n\n- **Precision & Measurability:** Clearly quantify benchmarks for objectivity.\n- **Adaptability & Flexibility:** Allow periodic reassessment as AI evolves.\n- **Transparency & Clarity:** Accessible to researchers, policymakers, and public.\n- **Interdisciplinary Acceptance:** Definitions should integrate insights across multiple fields (AI research, ethics, policy, philosophy, economics).\n- **Anticipatory Capacity:** Enable effective foresight, proactive management, and thoughtful response.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\u2014**Why Do We Care?**\n\nWe define AGI and ASI clearly because:\n\n- **Communication:** Precision prevents confusion and misinformation.\n- **Measurement:** Clear definitions help objectively track progress.\n- **Safety & Ethics:** Definitions underpin proactive risk management.\n- **Policy & Society:** Facilitate informed governance, economic planning, and societal adaptation.\n- **Preparedness:** Enable strategic foresight for transformative change.\n\nUnderstanding these motivations highlights **why precision matters**, guiding how we refine these critical definitions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"af61747e-04a0-4d9a-8634-c84c13a50395","request_id":"92f9255c5992a5e3-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"af61747e-04a0-4d9a-8634-c84c13a50395","children":[]}}}
