Judge William Alsup, while acknowledging the complexity of distributing the funds, deemed the settlement fair. Authors and publishers will receive approximately $3,000 for each book included in the agreement, which covers past but not future works.\n\nThe Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers hailed the outcome as a milestone in safeguarding authors\u2019 rights. They emphasized that this settlement sets a precedent for holding AI developers accountable for unauthorized use of copyrighted content. The judge previously ruled that although AI training using copyrighted books could be considered transformative fair use, Anthropic had illegally obtained the books from pirate sites.\n\nAnthropic expressed satisfaction with the resolution, stating it permits them to focus on developing safe and helpful AI tools. The court also stressed transparency in the claims process to ensure authors\u2014especially lesser-known ones\u2014aren\u2019t disadvantaged.

This settlement, if approved by a judge, would provide about $3,000 per book for approximately 500,000 works. The lawsuit, initiated by authors including Andrea Bartz, accused Anthropic of acquiring millions of books through piracy, notably from sites like Books3, LibGen, and Pirate Library Mirror. A June 2025 ruling found the AI training itself was not illegal but condemned the method of data acquisition. To resolve the claims, Anthropic will also destroy the pirated files and has since adopted legal methods to obtain training content. The case highlights growing legal pressure on AI companies accused of copyright infringement and could influence similar lawsuits against firms like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple. While some critics argue such settlements are just \u201ccosts of doing business,\u201d supporters see it as a pivotal victory for copyright holders. The Authors Guild praised the outcome for holding AI firms accountable, though concerns remain for international authors unaffiliated with the U.S. copyright system.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1757099576.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-judge-approves-15-billion-anthropic-copyright-settlement-with-authors-2025-09-25/","title":"US judge preliminarily approves $1.5 billion Anthropic copyright settlement","snippet":"A U.S. federal judge in California has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement in a landmark copyright class-action case between a group of authors and artificial intelligence company Anthropic.

While Judge William Alsup previously ruled that Anthropic\u2019s use of the books for training was fair use, he also found the company violated the authors' rights by storing more than 7 million pirated books in a central library. A trial had been scheduled for December to assess damages, which could have reached hundreds of billions of dollars. The preliminary approval marks the first major settlement among several similar lawsuits pending against companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta.

A U.S. federal judge (William Alsup) **preliminarily approved** a **$1.5B** class-action settlement with authors. The deal pays about **$3,000 per covered book**, applies to **past** works only, and requires Anthropic to **destroy the pirated book files** it downloaded (not the model weights). Final approval still has to follow class notice and claims. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0news44\ue202turn0news53\ue201\n\n## What exactly was approved\n- **Preliminary approval (Sept 25, 2025):** Court found the proposed settlement \u201cfair\u201d at this stage; final approval comes after notice/objections. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news44\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **Payments:** Roughly **$3k per book** (~465k\u2013500k books). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- **Data deletion:** Anthropic must **delete the pirated source files (and copies)** after final judgment (dataset destruction), but the agreement **does not require deleting or retraining Claude** (\u201cmodel disgorgement\u201d was not ordered). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1news30\ue201  \n- **Key legal backdrop:** Alsup earlier held that **training on lawfully acquired books is fair use**, but **building/keeping a \u201ccentral library\u201d of pirated books** infringed. The settlement leaves that fair-use holding intact (no appeal). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n## My take\n1. **Fair-use line is sharpening:** Courts are signaling a practical boundary: **provenance matters more than purpose**. If your training corpora are clean/licensed, you\u2019re on stronger ground; if you touched infringing caches, you face massive exposure\u2014even if the training might otherwise be \u201ctransformative.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n2. **No model disgorgement (this time):** Requiring **dataset deletion without model deletion** is a big operational win for Anthropic. It avoids a costly re-train and preserves performance gains\u2014while still imposing a serious monetary and compliance penalty. Expect plaintiffs in future cases to **push harder for model remedies**; this settlement doesn\u2019t foreclose that elsewhere. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news30\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n3. **Precedent pressure on rivals:** This is the **first mega-payout** in the AI-copyright wave. It will influence settlement math for suits against OpenAI/Meta/Microsoft et al., especially where plaintiffs can document pirated sources (e.g., LibGen/Books3 mirrors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n4. **Compliance era for datasets:** Expect rapid standardization around **data lineage, audit trails, deletion SLAs, and vendor warranties**. \u201cWe later bought a clean copy\u201d is not a defense to earlier mass copying\u2014Alsup flagged that explicitly.

This settlement, if approved by a judge, would provide about $3,000 per book for approximately 500,000 works. The lawsuit, initiated by authors including Andrea Bartz, accused Anthropic of acquiring millions of books through piracy, notably from sites like Books3, LibGen, and Pirate Library Mirror. A June 2025 ruling found the AI training itself was not illegal but condemned the method of data acquisition. To resolve the claims, Anthropic will also destroy the pirated files and has since adopted legal methods to obtain training content. The case highlights growing legal pressure on AI companies accused of copyright infringement and could influence similar lawsuits against firms like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple. While some critics argue such settlements are just \u201ccosts of doing business,\u201d supporters see it as a pivotal victory for copyright holders.

This marks the largest copyright recovery in history and the first major settlement of its kind in the AI era. Filed in San Francisco, the case was brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, and alleged that Anthropic used millions of pirated books for AI training. The settlement includes the destruction of the downloaded books in question and allows for additional claims if more works are discovered.\n\nWhile U.S. District Judge William Alsup previously ruled that the company made fair use of the content for training, he found Anthropic violated copyright by storing over 7 million pirated books in a \"central library.\" The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, preempts a trial scheduled for December that could have resulted in damages worth hundreds of billions. Anthropic, backed by Amazon and Alphabet, did not admit liability. The agreement occurs amid broader legal battles involving other tech giants like OpenAI and Meta, as debates over fair use of copyrighted material in AI training continue.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AI firm Anthropic reaches landmark $1.5B copyright deal with book ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/05/anthropic-book-authors-copyright-settlement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The settlement allows Anthropic to avoid trial over claims that it violated copyrights by downloading millions of books without permission and ...","attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":18}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news30\ue202turn1search7\ue201","start_idx":2808,"end_idx":2839,"safe_urls":["https://www.allaboutadvertisinglaw.com/2025/06/court-holds-that-anthropics-training-of-ai-using-legally-obtained-books-is-fair-use-but-storage-of-pirated-books-is-not.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/anthropic-to-pay-landmark-settlement-over-claude-training?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/anthropic-to-pay-landmark-settlement-over-claude-training?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Anthropic to pay $1.5B over pirated books in Claude AI training - payouts of roughly $3,000 per infringed work","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/anthropic-to-pay-landmark-settlement-over-claude-training?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1757164137.0,"snippet":"Anthropic, the company behind Claude AI, has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in response to a class-action lawsuit over the use of pirated books in training its AI models.

The viable path is **weights stay, pirated source files go, future training uses clean inputs**.\n\nHere\u2019s how they (and others) can still train strong models:\n\n## What they can still use\n1. **Existing weights as initialization.** The deal (as reported) targets *dataset destruction*, not \u201cmodel disgorgement.\u201d So they can continue from current checkpoints and **further pretrain/fine-tune on clean corpora**. That\u2019s the single biggest lever.\n\n2. **Licensed text at scale.**\n   - Direct publisher deals (trade & education), collective licensing, newspaper consortia, subscription/\u201cdata trust\u201d models.\n   - Aggregators of out-of-print/backlist works.\n   - Government/open-license datasets with clear provenance.\n\n3. **Public-domain + permissive corpora.**\n   - Not just 19th-century literature: court opinions, government documents, standards, patents, arXiv (respecting licenses), Wikipedia, Stack Exchange under CC BY-SA, Git repos with permissive licenses, etc.\n   - Modernize/annotate public-domain works (this *adds* value without infringement).\n\n4. **Opt-in user and enterprise data.**\n   - Chat logs and documents from consenting customers under strong data-use terms.\n   - Data donations/data dividends programs with transparent revocation.\n\n5. **Synthetic and teacher-student training (carefully).**\n   - Preference datasets from **RLAIF/RLHF**, self-play tasks, tool-use traces, reasoning chains from higher-capability teachers.\n   - **Risk controls:** avoid \u201cmodel collapse\u201d (training on your own outputs only), preserve long-tail diversity, and keep a real-world validation set with clean provenance.\n\n6. **Retrieval instead of memorization.**\n   - Build **RAG over licensed libraries**: don\u2019t bake the text into weights; fetch it at inference time with license checks/audit trails. This reduces the need to pretrain on sensitive works while improving factuality.\n\n7. **Data curation & provenance engineering.**\n   - Content-addressed storage, hash registries, near-duplicate/PII filters, license ledgers, revocation workflows, and third-party auditability. Future-proofs against the next lawsuit.\n\n## Why \u201cparaphrase the whole database\u201d is a bad idea\n- **Legal:** Paraphrases made from infringing copies are often still **derivative works**; using them to replace the originals looks like an attempt to launder infringement and can trigger sanctions.\n- **Contractual/compliance:** Settlements typically prohibit **functionally equivalent copies**. Generating near-substitutable paraphrases would be risky.\n- **Technical:** Training predominantly on your own paraphrases increases **distributional drift** and **mode collapse**; you lose stylistic/genre coverage and rare patterns that drive capability.\n\n## Likely trade-offs & how to mitigate\n- **Cost:** Licensed data is expensive. Mitigation: staged pretraining (cheap broad crawl that\u2019s clean + targeted licensed slices for style/coverage), plus **curriculum schedules** that maximize sample efficiency.\n- **Coverage/style loss:** Fill gaps with **licensed verticals** (journals, newswires, fiction) and **public-domain modernization** projects to regain contemporary style without infringement.\n- **Governance overhead:** Bake provenance into the MLOps stack (deletion SLAs, audit logs, reproducible data BOMs). Treat \u201cerase this slice and prove it\u201d as a first-class capability.\n\n## Bottom line\nThey don\u2019t need the \u201cpirated database\u201d to keep advancing. Keeping the **weights**, switching to **licensed/opt-in/public-domain data**, augmenting with **careful synthetic generation**, and leaning on **RAG** gives a fully workable\u2014and more legally durable\u2014training pipeline. Paraphrase-to-evade isn\u2019t just ethically dubious; it\u2019s a legal and technical trap."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3927,"end_idx":3927,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"985119e05ee79610-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"b6ef4a93-61c9-463e-8492-92c318e1c8e8","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"b6ef4a93-61c9-463e-8492-92c318e1c8e8","children":["e88bd008-7ab0-428d-aaf2-ca8adbba3c98"]},"e88bd008-7ab0-428d-aaf2-ca8adbba3c98":{"id":"e88bd008-7ab0-428d-aaf2-ca8adbba3c98","message":{"id":"e88bd008-7ab0-428d-aaf2-ca8adbba3c98","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758872469.782,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Or they (and everything can just buy the books)"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98511e0a8a839610-LAX","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b221bc2c-415f-46b3-ac9f-944c7dfa2b13","children":["9168bd57-7d41-49cb-9221-d2bfa57834b7"]},"9168bd57-7d41-49cb-9221-d2bfa57834b7":{"id":"9168bd57-7d41-49cb-9221-d2bfa57834b7","message":{"id":"9168bd57-7d41-49cb-9221-d2bfa57834b7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758872471.587593,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing book purchasing and licensing","content":"To respond, I should focus on the feasibility of simply buying books for digital purposes, emphasizing legal aspects.

For that you need a **copyright/license** that grants text/data mining (TDM) or ML training rights. Three concrete blockers:\n\n1. **Copyright law:** First-sale lets you resell the physical book; it does **not** grant reproduction rights. Scanning the book to text is a reproduction; using that text in training is another copy/derivative use.  \n2. **Contract/EULAs:** Most eBooks explicitly **forbid scraping, text extraction, or TDM**. Circumventing DRM to extract text is an independent DMCA/anti-circumvention violation in the U.S.  \n3. **Compliance/provenance:** Post-settlement, labs must prove **lawful acquisition + license scope** across *every* shard. \u201cWe bought a copy\u201d won\u2019t satisfy auditors or courts.\n\nWhat *does* work\n- **Publisher/collective licenses:** Negotiate corpus-level rights with publishers/collectives (e.g., per-title or per-catalog TDM/ML licenses). Expect terms that specify allowed uses (pretraining vs RAG), retention, derivatives, security, audit, and deletion SLAs.  \n- **Licensed aggregators:** Backlist/education/scientific aggregators that sell explicit TDM rights (often API or bulk text with hashes and revocation).  \n- **Public-domain & permissive sources:** Gutenberg, government docs, many standards/patents, CC-BY/CC-BY-SA content\u2014clearly licensed and auditable.  \n- **Opt-in enterprise/user data** with unambiguous consent.  \n- **RAG over licensed libraries** (fetch at inference time instead of baking into weights), which reduces the need to pretrain on sensitive books.\n\nIs licensing economically feasible?\n- Yes, in principle. Suppose you want 1 million modern titles with true ML/TDM rights. Even at a rough **$20\u2013$200/title one-off** (or **$0.001\u2013$0.02 per 1k tokens** metered), you\u2019re looking at **$20M\u2013$200M** (or comparable ongoing spend)\u2014large, but **far cheaper** than a single multi-billion-dollar lawsuit or a forced retrain.  \n- Costs drop with **tiered coverage** (license only high-value genres), **token caps**, sunset clauses, and **revenue share** models. And you can mix in public-domain + opt-in data to reach scale.\n\nOperationally, a sane path forward\n- **Data BOM & lineage:** Content-addressed storage, signed manifests, per-slice licenses, revocation workflows.  \n- **Deletion-ready pipelines:** If a rightsholder opts out, you can **prove** and **execute** deletion and retraining deltas.  \n- **Risk-aware curriculum:** Use licensed books for style/long-form coherence; use permissive/web technical text for breadth; use RAG for coverage you can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) license.\n\nBottom line: \u201cjust buy the books\u201d (as a consumer) won\u2019t cut it legally or operationally. **\u201cLicense the text\u201d**\u2014via publishers/collectives/aggregators, with auditable provenance and revocation\u2014is the durable route."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2994,"end_idx":2994,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"98511e0a8a839610-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"a4e1ece0-62a7-4667-8bd3-1ef03f10874b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"a4e1ece0-62a7-4667-8bd3-1ef03f10874b","children":["414b456a-8576-4975-a5e8-229bd5a4b9c8"]},"414b456a-8576-4975-a5e8-229bd5a4b9c8":{"id":"414b456a-8576-4975-a5e8-229bd5a4b9c8","message":{"id":"414b456a-8576-4975-a5e8-229bd5a4b9c8","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758872593.775,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["When students read textbooks, they are also training themselves on copyrighted materials.

The \u201cstudents = models\u201d analogy is tempting, but it breaks on both **law** and **mechanics**. Here\u2019s the clean separation.\n\n# 1) What counts as \u201ccopying\u201d\n- **Humans learning:** Reading a book doesn\u2019t create a legally relevant *copy* of the book. Your memory isn\u2019t a \u201cfixed\u201d reproduction. Copyright law targets *fixed* copies and *public* reproductions, not cognition.\n- **Model training today:** Labs typically **ingest, store, and duplicate** full texts (often at Internet scale) to tokenize, shuffle, shard, and reprocess them. Those are **actual copies** made and kept in storage pipelines. That\u2019s the first, crucial difference\u2014even before we talk about outputs.\n\n# 2) Using what you learned vs reproducing the expression\n- **Students/teachers/writers:** You\u2019re free to use **ideas, facts, methods, styles** you learned. When you need the *expression* (verbatim quotes, figures, tables), you rely on **fair use/fair dealing**, licenses, or short quotations with attribution. Coursepacks and e-reserves often **do require licenses**\u2014and courts have said so in multiple cases.  \n- **Models & outputs:** A well-behaved model should paraphrase and synthesize, not **regurgitate** lengthy copyrighted passages. If it **memorizes and emits** non-trivial portions on prompt (verbatim or near-verbatim), that looks like **reproduction** of protected expression\u2014legally risky. This is why labs work hard on **anti-memorization** and **contamination testing**.\n\n# 3) Purpose, scale, and market effects\nCourts weigh purpose/transformative use, the amount copied, and market harm.\n- **Students:** Personal study, scholarship, teaching\u2014typically **favored purposes**. The scale is tiny; market substitution risk is low (a student learning calculus doesn\u2019t substitute for the textbook market).\n- **Training stacks:** Even if the *purpose* (research/AI training) can be argued \u201ctransformative,\u201d the **amount** is often 100% of many works, the **scale** is millions of titles, and the **use can substitute** for parts of the market (e.g., models generating in-the-style summaries/excerpts). Those factors cut against fair use unless the data is **lawfully licensed** or within a statutory **TDM exception** (where available).\n\n# 4) Contracts and DRM\n- **Humans:** Buying a book lets you read it; quoting small bits with attribution is usually fine.  \n- **Labs:** Buying consumer copies (paperback/Kindle) **doesn\u2019t grant** rights to scan, strip DRM, or bulk-extract text for ML. EULAs often *forbid* text/data mining; circumventing DRM is a separate violation. Labs need **explicit TDM/ML licenses** or applicable statutory exceptions.\n\n# 5) Idea\u2013expression boundary (the heart of the difference)\n- **Students:** You internalize **ideas** and produce **new expression** (a lecture, a paper, a brief). If you copy substantial protected **expression**, you cite/quote within limits or get permission.  \n- **Models:** Training requires **copying expression** to process it; later, some models can **recreate** that expression if prompted. The legal friction is mostly about the **intermediate copies** and the **risk of expressive reproduction** at the output stage\u2014not about the high-level \u201clearning.\u201d\n\n# 6) Where the analogy *does* hold\u2014and where it doesn\u2019t\n- **Holds:** Using *knowledge* from copyrighted materials to produce **original** work is fine for both people and machines (ideas aren\u2019t protected).  \n- **Breaks:** People generally don\u2019t create and store **perfect digital copies** of entire libraries as a prerequisite to learn; ML systems do. That storage and the possibility of **systematic, scalable reproduction** changes the legal calculus.\n\n# 7) Practical takeaways (for labs and heavy users of LLMs)\n- **License or rely on clear exceptions:** Use **publisher/collective TDM licenses**, open licenses, or statutory TDM exceptions (EU/UK/Japan\u2014watch each regime\u2019s opt-out rules).  \n- **Provenance and deletability:** Keep a **data bill of materials**, audit trails, and **deletion workflows**.  \n- **Limit memorization:** De-duplication, rarity caps, and evals for **extractable verbatim text**.  \n- **Prefer retrieval for sensitive content:** Use **RAG over licensed sources** so the model **references** rather than reproduces embedded text.  \n- **Outputs discipline:** For high-risk use (long-form, fiction, code with unique license), enforce **quote limits**, **style-guardrails**, and **attribution links**.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n- **Humans**: learning is not copying; expression is regulated at the point of **quoting/reproducing**.  \n- **Models**: training generally **requires copying**, and outputs can **reproduce**. That\u2019s the legal/technical gap your analogy misses. The durable fix isn\u2019t to stop learning; it\u2019s to **stop unlicensed copying** (license/exception), **prove provenance**, and **design systems that don\u2019t emit protected expression**."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":4875,"end_idx":4875,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"98512111891a9610-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"49be6bc7-4924-4a30-84a3-a44a8c9e30e4","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"49be6bc7-4924-4a30-84a3-a44a8c9e30e4","children":[]}}}
