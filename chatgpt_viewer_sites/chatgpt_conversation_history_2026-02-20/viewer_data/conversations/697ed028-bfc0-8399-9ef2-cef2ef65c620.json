It\u2019s just\n\n\\[\nd=\\frac{\\bar x_1-\\bar x_2}{s_{\\text{pooled}}}\n\\quad\\text{where}\\quad\ns_{\\text{pooled}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2+(n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}.\n\\]\n\nSo if nothing else changes (same populations, same measurement, same inclusion criteria), **increasing \\(n\\)** mainly **shrinks uncertainty** around \\(d\\); the *point estimate* can still go up or down.\n\nHere are the main circumstances where a *bigger surveyed group* can plausibly yield a **larger reported \\(d\\)**:\n\n### 1) Sampling variability: the small sample happened to underestimate the true effect\nEven if the true standardized effect \\(\\delta\\) is fixed, your observed \\(\\bar x_1-\\bar x_2\\) and \\(s_{\\text{pooled}}\\) are random. With a small pilot, you can easily get:\n- a **smaller-than-true mean difference**, or\n- a **larger-than-true pooled SD**,\n\nwhich makes \\(d\\) small. With more data, estimates often move closer to their population values; if the pilot was low, the updated \\(d\\) can be higher.\n\n*Key point:* larger \\(n\\) doesn\u2019t force \\(d\\) upward; it just makes \u201cweird\u201d small-sample realizations less likely.\n\n### 2) The denominator changes because pooled SD is **weighted by group sizes**\nIf the researcher \u201csurveys more people\u201d but **adds them unevenly** to one group, the pooled SD can shift.\n\nExample mechanism:\n- Group 1 has **lower variance** than Group 2 (\\(s_1 < s_2\\)).\n- You add many more participants to Group 1 than Group 2.\n- Because \\(s_{\\text{pooled}}\\) is weighted by \\((n_i-1)\\), it moves **toward \\(s_1\\)** \u2192 **smaller denominator** \u2192 larger \\(d\\), even if the mean difference stays similar.\n\nThis is a real, purely algebraic way \u201cbigger sample\u201d (in an unbalanced way) can increase \\(d\\).\n\n### 3) Range restriction / homogeneity increases: SD shrinks because the *sample* is more uniform\nIf the larger survey uses **tighter inclusion criteria** (or recruits from a more homogeneous pool), the within-group SDs can be smaller. Since \\(d\\) divides by SD, you can get a bigger effect size even if the raw mean difference is unchanged.\n\nCommon ways this happens:\n- switching from a broad population to a targeted subgroup,\n- adding screening criteria,\n- excluding \u201cnoncompliant\u201d/noisy respondents more aggressively in the larger wave.\n\n### 4) Composition shifts (Simpson\u2019s-paradox-style): the bigger sample is \u201cdifferent people\u201d\nIf the extra respondents come disproportionately from subgroups where the effect is stronger (or where baseline differs), the overall mean difference can increase.\n\nThis is especially common when:\n- recruitment channels change (online panel \u2192 clinic sample, different region, different age mix),\n- response rates differ by subgroup (nonresponse bias changes as you scale),\n- you go from convenience sampling to something closer to the intended population (or vice versa).\n\n### 5) Measurement reliability improves, reducing noise\nIf the bigger study also improves the instrument (better wording, more items, better standardization), **measurement error variance** can drop, shrinking SD and/or sharpening group separation\u2014often increasing \\(d\\).\n\n### 6) Data-processing choices differ between waves\nEffect sizes are sensitive to choices like:\n- trimming/winsorizing outliers,\n- handling missing data (complete-case vs imputation),\n- using post-stratification weights,\n- switching from independent-groups \\(d\\) to paired/within-subject \\(d\\) (or change-score SD),\n- switching which SD is used (control SD only vs pooled SD).\n\nAny of these can change the numerator and denominator, and scaling up often comes with \u201cprocess upgrades.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### A useful sanity check\nIf you truly sampled the *same* underlying populations in the *same* way, you should expect **more stable** estimates as \\(n\\) grows. Also note a subtlety: **Cohen\u2019s d is actually slightly biased upward in small samples** as an estimator of the population standardized effect; this is why people use **Hedges\u2019 g** (a small-sample correction). So if you repeatedly re-ran studies under identical conditions, you\u2019d *more often* see \\(d\\) drift **downward** with larger \\(n\\), not upward\u2014meaning when you do see it increase, it\u2019s usually because of one of the mechanisms above (sampling fluctuation, composition/selection changes, SD changes, or analysis changes).\n\nIf you tell me whether this is **two independent groups**, **pre\u2013post**, or something else\u2014and whether the larger sample was **added evenly** to each group\u2014I can point to the most likely mechanism and even show how much of the \\(d\\) change could come from shifting SD vs shifting means."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"a7f522fc-c3fb-4420-91ee-dddecf8ce280","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"50461a7b-1025-4d66-b4ec-05f59b8a1aaf","turn_exchange_id":"cd9a3fff-9612-444a-97f6-404f6ac6bb25","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"50461a7b-1025-4d66-b4ec-05f59b8a1aaf","children":[]}}}
