you can **comment on the diff**, and the agent can incorporate that feedback. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- Built-in Git actions include **stage/revert chunks**, commit, push, and even create pull requests (depending on mode/config). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \nThis matters for multi-agent work because you can run many threads and still keep quality control tight.\n\n### 4) Multiple execution modes per thread (Local / Worktree / Cloud)\n- Each thread runs in a selected **mode**:\n  - **Local** (works directly in your project directory),\n  - **Worktree** (isolated changes),\n  - **Cloud** (remote execution in a configured environment). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \nThis lets you choose: keep small tasks local, isolate risky tasks in worktrees, and offload heavy/long tasks to cloud. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n### 5) \u201cSkills\u201d make agents reusable and consistent\n- The app supports **agent skills**: packaged instructions/resources/scripts that Codex can invoke to follow a workflow reliably. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- Skills are shareable across the app, CLI, and IDE extension\u2014useful when you have multiple agents and want them to behave consistently (same conventions, same checks, same tooling). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n### 6) Automations let \u201cagents\u201d run recurring jobs in the background\n- The app supports **automations** (often paired with skills) for routine tasks like checks, reporting, or other scheduled workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \nThis is a different flavor of multi-agent: you can have \u201calways-on\u201d background threads doing maintenance while you run interactive threads for feature work.\n\n### 7) It\u2019s designed to sit on top of your existing Codex workflows (CLI/IDE sync)\n- The app picks up history/config from Codex CLI and can sync with the IDE extension in the same project, including \u201cauto context\u201d based on files you\u2019re viewing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \nThat reduces friction when you\u2019re coordinating multiple threads: you can bounce between app \u2194 editor without losing the plot.\n\n## What it does *not* automatically do (important nuance)\n- It\u2019s not \u201cmulti-agent orchestration\u201d in the sense of agents autonomously messaging/negotiating with each other. The app is more like an **air-traffic control tower** where *you* coordinate parallel threads. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- If you want **programmatic** multi-agent pipelines (specialized agents with deterministic handoffs), \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"OpenAI\",\"ai research company\"]\ue201 points you to orchestrating Codex (typically via the CLI exposed as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server) using the Agents SDK. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n## A concrete way to use it as a multi-agent \u201cteam\u201d\nExample setup for a repo:\n1. **Thread A (Worktree):** \u201cFix failing tests + minimal code changes.\u201d\n2. **Thread B (Worktree):** \u201cRefactor module X for readability; no behavior change.\u201d\n3. **Thread C (Cloud):** \u201cRun full test suite + lint + generate a failure report.\u201d\n4. Review diffs for A/B, leave inline comments, stage only the chunks you accept, then merge/PR.\n\nThat pattern\u2014**parallel threads + isolated worktrees + diff-based supervision + reusable skills**\u2014is the app\u2019s main multi-agent story. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":234,"end_idx":279,"safe_urls":["https://developers.openai.com/codex/app","https://developers.openai.com/codex/app?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/codex/","https://openai.com/codex/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/","https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Introducing the Codex app","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"4 hours ago \u2014 The Codex app provides a focused space for multi-tasking with agents.

Required fields:  \n- `name`: non-empty, \u2264100 chars, single line  \n- `description`: non-empty, \u2264500 chars, single line  \nThe rest of the file is Markdown instructions. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue201\n\nExample `SKILL.md` skeleton:\n\n```md\n---\nname: draft-commit-message\ndescription: Draft a Conventional Commits message when the user asks for help writing a commit message.\n---\n\n## What to do\n- Ask for the change summary if missing\n- Output `type(scope): summary` (<= 72 chars)\n- Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer if needed\n```\n\nCodex also supports a standard skill directory layout where you keep scripts/templates/docs on disk (so they don\u2019t bloat context): \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue201\n\n```text\nmy-skill/\n  SKILL.md\n  scripts/        # optional\n  references/     # optional\n  assets/         # optional\n  agents/\n    openai.yaml   # optional (UI + dependencies)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill the \u201cCodex-native\u201d way (recommended)\nCodex ships with a built-in skill that scaffolds new skills:\n\n```text\n$skill-creator\n```\n\nYou can add extra instructions after invoking it, e.g.:\n\n```text\n$skill-creator\n\nCreate a skill that drafts a conventional commit message based on a short summary of changes.\n```\n\nThe creator helps you decide:\n- what the skill does,\n- when it should trigger,\n- whether it should be **instruction-only** (recommended default) or script-backed. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill manually (fast + explicit)\nChoose a scope, create a folder, add `SKILL.md`, then restart Codex. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue201\n\n```bash\n# User-scoped (macOS/Linux default)\nmkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/my-skill\n\n# Repo-scoped (commit to your repo)\nmkdir -p .codex/skills/my-skill\n```\n\nThen create:\n\n```bash\n$EDITOR .codex/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\n---\n\n## Enabling / disabling skills (and why yours \u201cdoesn\u2019t show up\u201d)\nYou can disable a specific skill (experimental) via `~/.codex/config.toml` using `[[skills.config]]` and a path, then restart Codex. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue202turn1view2\ue201\n\n```toml\n[[skills.config]]\npath = \"/path/to/skill\"\nenabled = false\n```\n\nIf a skill doesn\u2019t appear, the docs call out the usual causes: wrong filename (`SKILL.md`), wrong location, not restarting, malformed YAML, or name/description length issues. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue202turn1view1\ue201\n\nCodex configuration is layered: user defaults live in `~/.codex/config.toml`, with optional project overrides in `.codex/config.toml` (only loaded for trusted projects). \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## How to invoke skills in practice (App vs CLI vs IDE)\n\n### Codex app (macOS)\n- Type **`$`** in the thread composer to explicitly invoke a skill. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- Enabled skills can also show up as **slash commands** (e.g. `/imagegen`). \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n### Codex CLI / IDE extension\n- Skills can be explicitly selected via **`/skills`** or by referencing them with **`$skill-name`**. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n\nA reliable pattern while you\u2019re developing a skill is to start with explicit invocation (so you can see exactly how it behaves), then later rely on implicit triggering once your `description` is tight. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue202turn3view2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Installing skills from a catalog\nCodex also ships a `$skill-installer` flow for pulling skills (including experimental ones) from a curated GitHub catalog. Example from the docs: \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201\n\n```text\n$skill-installer install the create-plan skill from the .experimental folder\n```\n\n(After installing, restart Codex to load the new skill.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: make a skill \u201capp-friendly\u201d + declare tool dependencies\nIf you add `agents/openai.yaml`, you can:\n1) customize how the skill appears in the Codex app (name/icon/color), and  \n2) declare **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** dependencies the skill needs.\n\nExample (as documented): \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n```yaml\ninterface:\n  display_name: \"Docs helper\"\n  short_description: \"Search OpenAI dev docs and cite results\"\n  icon_small: \"./assets/small-logo.svg\"\n  icon_large: \"./assets/large-logo.png\"\n  brand_color: \"#3B82F6\"\n  default_prompt: \"Use this skill to answer API questions with citations.\"\n\ndependencies:\n  tools:\n    - type: \"mcp\"\n      value: \"openaiDeveloperDocs\"\n      description: \"OpenAI Docs MCP server\"\n      transport: \"streamable_http\"\n      url: \"https://developers.openai.com/mcp\"\n```\n\nIf a dependency requires OAuth, Codex will kick off the auth flow automatically when the skill is used. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Making skills *reliable* (how people usually mess this up)\nThe `description` is not \u201cmarketing copy.\u201d It\u2019s **agent-facing trigger logic**. If it\u2019s vague, you\u2019ll get:\n- false negatives (skill won\u2019t trigger),\n- false positives (skill triggers when you didn\u2019t want it). \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n\nA practical hardening loop from OpenAI\u2019s evals guidance:\n1) Define what \u201csuccess\u201d means (outcome/process/style/efficiency). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \n2) Manually trigger the skill via `/skills` or `$\u2026` to expose hidden assumptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \n3) Add a small prompt set (10\u201320 cases) including \u201cshould not trigger\u201d negatives. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \n4) For automation/CI runs, prefer `codex exec`; if the task needs to write files, use `--full-auto` (least privilege still applies). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n\nExample run pattern from the same guidance:\n\n```bash\ncodex exec --full-auto \\\n  'Use the $setup-demo-app skill to create the project in this directory.'\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what kind of skills you want (e.g., \u201crepo-specific lint+test gate,\u201d \u201cPR template generator,\u201d \u201cmath worksheet pipeline\u201d), I\u2019ll draft a `SKILL.md` + an `agents/openai.yaml` that\u2019s tight on triggers and safe on

a **fully worked \u201cmath tutoring worksheet factory\u201d skill** you can drop into Codex. It\u2019s designed for a one-teacher tutoring workflow: you specify level/topics/difficulty mix, and the agent reliably produces a LaTeX worksheet with **questions first**, then a **two-column concise answer key**.\n\nThis example uses (1) a **repo-scoped skill**, (2) an optional **script-backed generator** (Python + SymPy), and (3) an optional `agents/openai.yaml` so it shows nicely in the Codex app and can declare Model Context Protocol (MCP) dependencies if you have them. Skills are folder-based with a required `SKILL.md`; Codex only injects the skill name/description until you invoke it. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 1) Folder layout to add to your repo\n\nCreate this under your repo root:\n\n```text\n.codex/\n  skills/\n    sgmath-worksheet/\n      SKILL.md\n      agents/\n        openai.yaml\n      scripts/\n        gen_worksheet.py\n      assets/\n        worksheet_template.tex\n      references/\n        house_style.md\n```\n\nWhy this structure: Codex skills are a folder with `SKILL.md` plus optional scripts/resources; `agents/openai.yaml` is optional for appearance + MCP dependencies. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 2) `SKILL.md` (the heart of the skill)\n\nCopy/paste:\n\n```md\n---\nname: sgmath-worksheet\ndescription: Generate a math tutoring worksheet (LaTeX) with questions + concise solutions at the end (2-column, smaller font). Use when the user asks for weekly practice sheets, topic drills, mixed revision papers, or \u201cmake N questions with answers\u201d for secondary/JC math.\n---\n\n## Goal\nProduce a LaTeX worksheet that matches a tutoring-house style:\n- Questions first (numbered).\n- Solutions consolidated at the end on a fresh page in smaller font, two-column format.\n- Concise answers and minimal working (unless the user requests full solutions).\n- No cartoons/extraneous text.\n\n## Required inputs (ask if missing)\n1) Level: e.g. Sec 1/2/3, O-Level E-Math, A-Math, JC H2\n2) Topics list\n3) Number of questions (and whether subparts count as one question)\n4) Difficulty mix (e.g. 40% easy, 40% medium, 20% hard)\n5) Constraints (e.g. avoid absolute value symbols; avoid piecewise; integers only; etc.)\n6) Output preference:\n   - \"Just output the LaTeX here\" OR\n   - \"Write files into the repo\"\n\n## Default assumptions (use if user is vague)\n- N = 12 questions\n- Mix = 4 easy, 5 medium, 3 hard\n- Concise solutions only\n- Produce LaTeX\n- Use a reproducible seed and record it in the LaTeX header comment.\n\n## Procedure\n1) Restate the spec you will follow (level, topics, counts, constraints, seed).\n2) Choose generation mode:\n   A) Instruction-only mode: write LaTeX directly in chat using the template in assets/worksheet_template.tex.\n   B) Script-backed mode: if scripts/gen_worksheet.py exists, run it to generate LaTeX deterministically.\n3) Quality checks (must do):\n   - No duplicates / near-duplicates.\n   - Covers all requested topics.\n   - Difficulty mix matches spec.\n   - All answers are present and correspond to each question.\n4) Output:\n   - If user asked \u201cwrite files\u201d, create:\n     worksheets/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<short-topic-slug>/\n       worksheet.tex\n       spec.json\n   - Otherwise, paste the final LaTeX.\n\n## If running commands\n- Prefer safe local commands (python, latexmk/pdflatex).\n- If compilation tools aren\u2019t installed, do NOT thrash. Just output LaTeX.\n\n## Definition of done\n- A compilable LaTeX file with:\n  - Title, level, topic list, date, seed\n  - Questions section\n  - New page\n  - Two-column concise solutions section in smaller font\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The `description` is intentionally explicit because Codex uses it to decide when the skill should trigger. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3) `agents/openai.yaml` (optional, but nice in the app)\n\nThis makes the skill show up cleanly in the Codex app UI and lets you declare MCP tool dependencies if you have them. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n```yaml\ninterface:\n  display_name: \"SGMath Worksheet Factory\"\n  short_description: \"Generate LaTeX worksheets + 2-col concise solutions for tutoring\"\n  brand_color: \"#2563EB\"\n  default_prompt: \"Create a worksheet from the spec; ensure solutions are concise and consolidated.\"\n\n# Optional: declare MCP tools if you have them.\n# Example: a private MCP server that exposes your question bank or syllabus notes.\n# dependencies:\n#   tools:\n#     - type: \"mcp\"\n#       value: \"sgmathQuestionBank\"\n#       description: \"Private question-bank MCP server\"\n#       transport: \"streamable_http\"\n#       url: \"http://localhost:7337/mcp\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) `assets/worksheet_template.tex` (LaTeX template)\n\nMinimal, robust, and matches your \u201csolutions at end, smaller font, two columns\u201d pattern:\n\n```tex\n% === Worksheet generated by Codex skill: sgmath-worksheet ===\n% Level: %%LEVEL%%\n% Topics: %%TOPICS%%\n% Date: %%DATE%%\n% Seed: %%SEED%%\n\n\\documentclass[11pt]{article}\n\\usepackage[a4paper,margin=1in]{geometry}\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}\n\\usepackage{enumitem}\n\\usepackage{multicol}\n\n\\setlist[enumerate]{itemsep=0.6em}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{center}\n    {\\Large \\textbf{%%TITLE%%}}\\\\\n    \\vspace{2mm}\n    {\\normalsize %%SUBTITLE%%}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\n\\section*{Questions}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n%%QUESTIONS%%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\newpage\n\\section*{Solutions (concise)}\n{\\small\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n%%SOLUTIONS%%\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{multicols}\n}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5) `scripts/gen_worksheet.py` (script-backed deterministic generator)\n\nThis is a *starter library* of question templates typical for tutoring (linear equations, expansion/factorisation, indices, quadratics). It produces a ready-to-compile `.tex`.\n\n**Install deps** (once) in the project environment:\n- `pip install sympy`\n\nThen script:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nGenerate a LaTeX math worksheet + concise solutions.\n\nUsage:\n  python scripts/gen_worksheet.py --level \"Sec 3 A-Math\" \\\n    --title \"Algebra Drill\" \\\n    --topics \"linear equations,expansion,factorisation,indices,quadratics\" \\\n    --n 12 --easy 4 --medium 5 --hard 3 \\\n    --seed 20260203 \\\n    --out worksheets/2026-02-03_algebra/worksheet.tex \\\n    --spec worksheets/2026-02-03_algebra/spec.json\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nimport argparse\nimport json\nimport os\nimport random\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom typing import Callable, Dict, List, Tuple\n\nimport sympy as sp\n\n\n# ---------------------------\n# Question template framework\n# ---------------------------\n\nDifficulty = str  #
