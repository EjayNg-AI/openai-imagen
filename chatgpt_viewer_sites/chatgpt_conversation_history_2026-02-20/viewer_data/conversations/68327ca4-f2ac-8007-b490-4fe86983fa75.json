Follow these precise steps:\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys\n\nIn WSL, run:\n```bash\nls -al ~/.ssh\n```\n\nIf you see files named `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, skip to Step 3. Otherwise, continue to Step 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate SSH Keys\n\nRun the following command in WSL:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n```\n\n- Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub-associated email.\n- Press Enter to accept the default file location.\n- Optionally, set a passphrase (or press Enter twice to skip).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Start SSH-Agent and Add Key\n\nRun the following commands to start the SSH agent and add your SSH key:\n\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Add SSH Key to GitHub Account\n\n- Display your SSH public key:\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n```\n\n- Copy the entire output.\n\n- Go to [GitHub \u2192 Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).\n\n- Click **New SSH Key**, paste the copied SSH key, and give it a meaningful title.\n\n- Click **Add SSH Key**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Configure Git Remote to Use SSH\n\nIn your existing repositories, ensure the remote uses SSH instead of HTTPS.\n\nCheck your current remote URL:\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nChange the URL if it's HTTPS. Use the format:\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git\n```\n\nReplace `username/repository` accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Test Your SSH Setup\n\nRun the following to test your configuration:\n\n```bash\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\n\nIf configured correctly, you'll see a message like:\n\n```\nHi username! You've successfully authenticated...\n```\n\n---\n\n### Now, you no longer need to manually enter your username and password each time you interact with GitHub."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"7f918f10-b85e-4baa-8125-744939f43796","request_id":"945182a5da2b40ca-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7f918f10-b85e-4baa-8125-744939f43796","children":["9f96a52f-a4f7-4498-94f7-298d727247bc"]},"9f96a52f-a4f7-4498-94f7-298d727247bc":{"id":"9f96a52f-a4f7-4498-94f7-298d727247bc","message":{"id":"9f96a52f-a4f7-4498-94f7-298d727247bc","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748139321.15,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["i currently do not need to enter username and password for existing cloned repos, but i was prompted for these for a newly cloned repo"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"945186460e6940ca-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3cd3e37f-f288-4662-af11-af7a228b1aba","children":["80b41c27-a5a0-45c6-8085-19d85b678dff"]},"80b41c27-a5a0-45c6-8085-19d85b678dff":{"id":"80b41c27-a5a0-45c6-8085-19d85b678dff","message":{"id":"80b41c27-a5a0-45c6-8085-19d85b678dff","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748139321.858822,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If your existing cloned repos do **not** prompt for credentials, but a newly cloned repo **does**, it's almost certainly because you've cloned it using HTTPS instead of SSH.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Confirm the Repo URL Type**\n\nRun this in the newly cloned repo to check your remote URL type:\n\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nYou'll likely see something like:\n\n- **HTTPS (prompts username/password)**:\n```\norigin  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)\n```\n\n- **SSH (no username/password)**:\n```\norigin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (push)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 **How to Fix (Change from HTTPS to SSH)**\n\nSimply run:\n\n```bash\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git\n```\n\nReplace `username/repository` with your actual repository details.\n\nThen verify it again:\n\n```bash\ngit remote -v\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f **Why Existing Repos Work Without Password**\n\nYour existing repositories are probably configured to use SSH.
