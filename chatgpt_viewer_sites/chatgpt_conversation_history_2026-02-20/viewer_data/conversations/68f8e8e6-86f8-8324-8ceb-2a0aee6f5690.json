Built on a cut-down Navi 32 GPU, it features 2,560 Stream Processors and 40 Compute Units, compared to the RX 7700 XT\u2019s more powerful 3,456 SPs and 54 CUs. The RX 7700 offers 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM over a 256-bit bus, providing 624 GB/s bandwidth, which matches the RX 7800 XT and surpasses the 7700 XT's 432 GB/s. Despite the higher memory capacity, the card delivers around 20% lower gaming performance than the 7700 XT and consumes more power at 263W versus 245W.\n\nA notable addition is its 80 AI accelerators, which, when combined with the 16 GB VRAM, may make it a viable option for local AI workloads if priced competitively. AMD has not announced pricing or availability, suggesting it may be aimed at OEMs rather than the retail market. ASRock has revealed a custom variant, but key details like pricing remain unknown. If launched above $350, the RX 7700 could face stiff competition from AMD\u2019s own RX 7600 XT and 7800 XT offerings.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1758295665.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-launches-on-june-5-starting-at-usd299","title":"AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT launches on June 5, starting at $299","snippet":"AMD has launched its Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics card, the latest addition to the RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9000 series. Set to hit the market on June 5, the RX 9060 XT comes in 8GB and 16GB models priced at $299 and $349, respectively. It succeeds the RX 7600 XT and uses the new Navi 44 silicon fabricated on TSMC\u2019s 4nm N4P process, offering 2.2 times more transistors at a smaller die size. With 2,048 stream processors, a 3,130 MHz boost clock, and up to 25.6 TFLOPS of FP32 performance, it delivers up to 6% better performance than Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB at 1440p. The RX 9060 XT supports DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b, offers 320GB/s bandwidth, and consumes 150W (8GB) to 160W (16GB). It features upgraded ray tracing and AI cores and supports AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4, with FSR Redstone expected later in 2025. The launch positions AMD competitively, offering better performance-per-dollar metrics compared to Nvidia\u2019s counterpart.

The RX 9070 GRE is a slightly cut-down version of the RX 9070 XT, with 48 compute units and a 192-bit memory bus, compared to the XT's 64 CUs and 256-bit bus. The upgrade might aim to meet market demand or strategically counter Nvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 50 Super series, which is rumored to offer cards with 18 to 24 GB of VRAM. The move suggests AMD might be preparing a global launch and stockpiling better-performing Navi 48 chips capable of supporting 16 GB of memory. If AMD prices the 16 GB RX 9070 GRE competitively, it could appeal strongly to the mid-range gaming market. However, confusion may arise from AMD\u2019s inconsistent naming conventions\u2014particularly what \u201cGRE\u201d stands for\u2014as it was changed to \"Great Radeon Edition\". This potential new offering could intensify competition with Nvidia and bring more options to PC gamers worldwide.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1756299486.0,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrydVwdhMD4","title":"The ULTIMATE New Gaming GPU Tier List for 2025! - YouTube","snippet":"My new GPU finder website* - https://gpus.gg/ \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 AMD Radeon Graphics Cards: RX 9060 XT 16GB: https://pcbuilds.gg/p/4GzDm9 RX 9070: ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1752278400.0,"attribution":"www.youtube.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7viPUaVDEOo","title":"Best Graphics Cards to Buy RIGHT NOW! - July 2025 - YouTube","snippet":"GPUs to buy in July 2025 linked below*_ *Intel ARC Graphics Cards ...

I\u2019ll also point out caveats (since VRAM is only one part of the story).  \n\n---\n\n## \u2705 What \u201cat least 16 GB VRAM\u201d means and why it matters  \n- Many recent titles (4K resolution, high-texture mods, ray tracing, AI upscaling) and certain workflows (video editing, machine learning, large datasets) benefit from 16 GB or more of video RAM. For example, reviewers say that cards like the \ue200entity\ue202[\"gpu_model\", \"GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB\", 0]\ue201, \ue200entity\ue202[\"gpu_model\", \"GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB\", 0]\ue201 or \ue200entity\ue202[\"gpu_model\", \"Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB\", 0]\ue201 are probably the \u201cminimum\u201d for 1080p/1440p ray tracing without running VRAM-bound. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- But: *VRAM alone* doesn\u2019t guarantee high performance. You still want the GPU\u2019s core architecture, memory bus width, clock speeds, feature support (ray tracing, tensor/AI cores if you need them) to be strong.  \n- Also: \u201c16 GB VRAM\u201d is often used as a marketing marker of being \u201cfuture-proofer,\u201d but with rising resolutions and VRAM demands (texture sets, frame buffers, AI models) even 16 GB may become limiting in some use cases. So it\u2019s a good baseline, not a guarantee of no bottlenecks later.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Good Consumer GPU Examples with \u2265 16 GB VRAM  \nHere are some concrete cards you can shop for.

Here you get 24 GB VRAM, which is very good for high-end 4K, heavy workloads, future-proofing.  \n- \ue200product_entity\ue202[\"turn1product4\",\"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB\"]\ue201: A previous-generation flagship (from Nvidia) with 24 GB; still relevant in certain workflows (content creation, ML) although newer cards may beat it.  \n- \ue200product_entity\ue202[\"turn1product1\",\"ASRock Radeon RX 7900 XTX 24 GB\"]\ue201: Same spec class as the earlier 24 GB AMD example\u2014enthusiast tier.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Things to watch / critique  \nSince you are a math/ML researcher (which you mentioned), a few extra points from that lens:\n\n- If you\u2019re doing machine-learning, VRAM is important (for large batch sizes, big models), but also **compute capability**, **CUDA/ROCm support**, **tensor cores**, **driver ecosystem**, and whether the card supports mixed precision, etc. Some \u201cgaming\u201d cards with 16 GB VRAM might be good for gaming but less ideal for heavy ML workloads compared to workstation/enterprise cards.  \n- Memory bus width & bandwidth matter: a 16 GB card with narrow 128-bit bus may have less bandwidth than a 12 GB card with 192-bit. So VRAM quantity isn\u2019t the full story. For instance: some lower tier \u201c16 GB VRAM\u201d cards are still limited by memory subsystem. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- Power draw, thermals, and compatibility: High VRAM + high-performance GPU will demand more power, better cooling, good PSU. Just because the VRAM is there doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the card will meet your latency/throughput/feature needs.  \n- Future proofing: 16 GB VRAM is increasingly expected at the mid-to-high tier in 2025. If you buy a card now and hope it lasts several years for heavy workloads, you might want to consider 24 GB or more, especially for content creation, ML, or 4K/8K gaming.  \n- Cost-effectiveness: Sometimes you\u2019ll pay *premium* just for \u201c16 GB VRAM\u201d branding without massive performance uplift vs a cheaper 12-GB or 10-GB card, depending on your workload. So you\u2019ll want to check actual benchmarks relevant to your tasks.  \n- Availability & local pricing (Singapore): Import duties, shipping, power specifications, local vendor support matter.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddd0 My Recommendation (given your profile)  \nSince you said your interests include coding, machine learning & AI, and you presumably have mathematical/analytical background, here\u2019s what I\u2019d lean toward:\n\n- If you mainly game + do moderate ML/AI work: a **16 GB VRAM card** from a strong architecture (like the RTX 5070 Ti or RX 9070 XT) should strike a good balance.  \n- If you are going to train larger models, do heavy data/ML work, or want more \u201cheadroom\u201d for the future: aim for **24 GB or more VRAM**, and pay closer attention to architecture (tensor cores, FP16/FP32 throughput, driver support).  \n- Don\u2019t buy solely for high VRAM \u2014 make sure the GPU\u2019s other specs align with your workflows (for instance, CUDA capability if you're using Nvidia-centric ML libraries).  \n- Also consider the rest of your system: CPU, motherboard, cooling, PSU, and whether you\u2019ll do multi-GPU or high-bandwidth data transfers (NVMe, PCIe 5.0 etc).\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can **pull together a more complete list** (say 20+ GPUs currently available globally with \u226516 GB VRAM, with pricing in Singapore/SEA and a \u201cvalue for ML/AI workloads\u201d ranking).
