This involved detailed regulatory exploration. | 2024-04-17 |\n| **Tenancy Agreement Legal Review** | You requested a **clause-by-clause legal review** of a tuition center lease renewal, looking at **Singapore legal standards** and **best practices for commercial rental**. | 2024-04-17 |\n| **Operational Non-Compliance Investigation** | You conducted a forensic-style inquiry into **legal responsibility** tied to operating a tuition center when obligations were neglected, even without directorship or shareholding. | 2024-04-09 |\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **Excluded (Normal Chat or No Formal Search)**\n\nThese were general or exploratory conversations without specific legal/regulatory research:\n- Discussions about **SEO**, **parent updates**, or **curriculum planning**\n- High-level business or strategy discussions (e.g., pivoting from one center to another)\n- Casual brainstorming on tuition center workflows or expansion\n\n---\n\n### Summary Judgment\n\n**Yes**, you\u2019ve already done **multiple deep research-based dives** into **Singapore tuition center compliance**, especially covering:\n- Land use approval and planning regulations\n- Tenancy and legal liabilities\n- Change-of-use procedures\n- Operational non-compliance consequences\n\nIf you're preparing a full **compliance checklist** or planning a new center, you\u2019re well-positioned \u2014 but if you need a **structured compliance framework or pre-opening audit**, we can consolidate it next.
