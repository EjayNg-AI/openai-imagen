If under/over, revise until it lands in range. \r\n\r\n## **Diversity rules** \r\n\r\n* Vary **setting** (e.g., orbital interior, semi-open terraces, lunar or Martian exteriors, Venus aerostat decks, deep-space bays). \r\n* Vary **design language** (biomorphic white composites, basalt monocoque minimalism, Zen membranes, neo-deco pearlescent, biotech living light, etc.). \r\n* Optionally include a **small number of people and/or gentle robots** to provide scale; keep them quiet and unobtrusive. \r\n* At least one prompt should be **open-air or semi-open** (force-field or pressure-screen). \r\n\r\n## **For each prompt, include:** \r\n\r\n1. **Title** (4\u201312 words). \r\n2. **Scene description**: subject, setting, era (150\u2013300 years ahead), and **artificial gravity cues** when relevant. \r\n3. **Design & materials**: architecture, furnishings, notable objects. \r\n4. **Lighting & mood**: soft, indirect, glare-free; balance warm interior with cool space/planet light. \r\n5. **Cinematography**: lens (24\u201328mm wide), eye level, GI/PBR, subtle volumetrics; aspect ratio suggestion (16:9 or 21:9). \r\n6. If a prompt is one of the **two TNG variants**, explicitly mention **LCARS-style consoles**.\r\n\r\n## **Tone & constraints** \r\n\r\n* Keep language **precise, visual, and directive** (no story prose). \r\n* Emphasize **quiet scale, clean composition, controlled reflections**, and **breathable emptiness** over spectacle. \r\n* Do not contradict yourself; avoid synonyms piles. \r\n\r\n## **Output format** \r\n* Numbered 1\u20135. \r\n* For each: **Title**, then one block of text (250\u2013350 words), then a single **Negative:** line, then **Aspect ratio:** suggestion."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"4451e408-5f05-4c63-9c29-1481c150c1c5","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"ea13e203-c2d2-4437-9a69-74d55039c522","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4cbb2a52-5081-4348-80c4-642259d5610a","children":["8d6a922b-cd98-4600-a743-325064fcb48e"]},"8d6a922b-cd98-4600-a743-325064fcb48e":{"id":"8d6a922b-cd98-4600-a743-325064fcb48e","message":{"id":"8d6a922b-cd98-4600-a743-325064fcb48e","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765093683.9958122,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"4451e408-5f05-4c63-9c29-1481c150c1c5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7f40d4ed-87fb-4cda-a94c-8398d61ae632","turn_exchange_id":"ea13e203-c2d2-4437-9a69-74d55039c522","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7f40d4ed-87fb-4cda-a94c-8398d61ae632","children":["ed63f0bd-7368-4bdf-83f5-d24eb88582a7"]},"ed63f0bd-7368-4bdf-83f5-d24eb88582a7":{"id":"ed63f0bd-7368-4bdf-83f5-d24eb88582a7","message":{"id":"ed63f0bd-7368-4bdf-83f5-d24eb88582a7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765093684.1706824,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"4451e408-5f05-4c63-9c29-1481c150c1c5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8d6a922b-cd98-4600-a743-325064fcb48e","turn_exchange_id":"ea13e203-c2d2-4437-9a69-74d55039c522","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8d6a922b-cd98-4600-a743-325064fcb48e","children":["924053df-b63a-426d-bae4-f32e7ff36c71"]},"924053df-b63a-426d-bae4-f32e7ff36c71":{"id":"924053df-b63a-426d-bae4-f32e7ff36c71","message":{"id":"924053df-b63a-426d-bae4-f32e7ff36c71","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765093685.256779,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Preparing image generation prompts for GPT-5","content":"The user wants me to create five image generation prompts, each between 250 and 350 words.

Foreground shows a broad, gently curving terrace paved in pale basalt composite, edges softened and chamfered, leading toward a minimal clear pressure-screen that arcs overhead, invisible except for faint diffraction glints and HUD markers along its frame. Beyond the screen, the raw lunar basin falls away, bathed in sharp sunlit highlights and deep indigo shadow, with a distant Earth hanging low on the horizon. Terrace architecture uses biomorphic white composites and thin structural ribs that grow like branches, supporting floating planters of hardy engineered plants, muted greens and silver leaves. A few meditative benches face the view, low and monolithic, with integrated footrests and subtle underlighting. Two distant figures sit quietly, silhouettes small against the scale of crater and sky, not interacting with the camera. Lighting is soft and indirect under the terrace canopy, warm gold from concealed strips, balancing the harsh, cool lunar sunlight filtered by the pressure-screen.

Beyond the screen, the raw lunar basin falls away, bathed in sharp sunlit highlights and deep indigo shadow, with a distant Earth hanging low on the horizon. Terrace architecture uses biomorphic white composites and thin structural ribs that grow like branches, supporting floating planters of hardy engineered plants, muted greens and silver leaves.

Physically based rendering (PBR) with global illumination (GI), very mild volumetric haze near the floor, crisp shadows, limited palette of charcoals, steel, and gentle accent lights, all arranged for calm, disciplined composition.\"\nlen(text5.split())","end_time":1765093845.8273106,"final_expression_output":"260","in_kernel_exception":null,"system_exception":null,"messages":[],"jupyter_messages":[{"msg_type":"status","parent_header":{"msg_id":"19a8aa9f-28210b4d2ff6102c2d379bba_3_12","version":"5.3"},"content":{"execution_state":"busy"}},{"msg_type":"execute_input","parent_header":{"msg_id":"19a8aa9f-28210b4d2ff6102c2d379bba_3_12","version":"5.3"}},{"parent_header":{"msg_id":"19a8aa9f-28210b4d2ff6102c2d379bba_3_12","version":"5.3"},"msg_type":"execute_result","content":{"data":{"text/plain":"260"}}},{"msg_type":"status","parent_header":{"msg_id":"19a8aa9f-28210b4d2ff6102c2d379bba_3_12","version":"5.3"},"content":{"execution_state":"idle"}}],"timeout_triggered":null},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Generating futuristic space station description","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"4451e408-5f05-4c63-9c29-1481c150c1c5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"37fbf622-d2e8-4431-a92e-25db96f48fa0","turn_exchange_id":"ea13e203-c2d2-4437-9a69-74d55039c522","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"37fbf622-d2e8-4431-a92e-25db96f48fa0","children":["da215787-f4c4-4fe7-bf5d-c08a3cb2114d"]},"da215787-f4c4-4fe7-bf5d-c08a3cb2114d":{"id":"da215787-f4c4-4fe7-bf5d-c08a3cb2114d","message":{"id":"da215787-f4c4-4fe7-bf5d-c08a3cb2114d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765093854.287498,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 2m 49s"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":169,"request_id":"4451e408-5f05-4c63-9c29-1481c150c1c5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8a32b1f5-bde6-4f86-bf13-94e74a4218ae","turn_exchange_id":"ea13e203-c2d2-4437-9a69-74d55039c522","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8a32b1f5-bde6-4f86-bf13-94e74a4218ae","children":["29362825-1984-4f45-b4f9-a109f61ad7ef"]},"29362825-1984-4f45-b4f9-a109f61ad7ef":{"id":"29362825-1984-4f45-b4f9-a109f61ad7ef","message":{"id":"29362825-1984-4f45-b4f9-a109f61ad7ef","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765093854.19794,"update_time":1765093871.466906,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["1. **Quiet Observation Lounge Above Blue Earth**  \nInterior of a serene orbital observation lounge facing Earth, 200 years in the future, artificial gravity steady so chairs, plants, and a few relaxed officers rest naturally on the floor. Wide curved panoramic window dominates the frame, showing a quiet blue Earth, thin atmosphere glowing, sparse satellite traffic. Architecture uses smooth pearlescent composites and brushed metal ribs, with soft chamfered edges and no exposed cables. Along the left wall, integrated LCARS-style consoles form pastel interface ribbons, rounded modules and pill-shaped panels hovering just above the surface, displaying calm telemetry, star charts, and environmental readouts in muted pinks, ambers, and cool blues. Low-profile sofas and a single translucent coffee table sit near the glass, with a small bonsai-like tree growing from a recessed planter, leaves gently lit from below. Ceiling features shallow luminous bands that adapt in color temperature, providing soft indirect light without glare. Reflections in the glass are controlled and subtle, just enough to hint at interior volume without obscuring Earth. A single compact service robot waits beside the consoles, powered down yet upright, adding scale without drawing attention. Outside, discreet structural arcs frame the viewport edges, hinting at the larger station while keeping the main vista open and uncluttered. Camera at seated eye level, framed from one corner to emphasize depth and horizontal scale, using a 24mm wide-angle lens. Physically based rendering (PBR) with global illumination (GI), fine microtexture on materials, faint volumetric haze near the floor, and a very light depth of field roll-off toward the far bulkhead. Palette stays calm and desaturated, prioritizing breathable emptiness and legible interfaces over spectacle, no clutter, no drama.  \nNegative: crowds, cluttered desktops, harsh spotlights, overexposed highlights, weapons, explosions, text or logos, heavy bloom, fisheye distortion, non-photorealistic rendering.  \nAspect ratio: 21:9  \n\n---\n\n2. **Lunar Crater Garden on Semi-Open Terrace**  \nSemi-open lunar crater garden terrace at local dawn, perched on the rim of a vast impact basin under low artificial gravity so people move with slightly lighter, graceful steps but objects rest firmly on the stone-like floor. Foreground shows a broad, gently curving terrace paved in pale basalt composite, edges softened and chamfered, leading toward a minimal clear pressure-screen that arcs overhead, invisible except for faint diffraction glints and HUD markers along its frame. Beyond the screen, the raw lunar basin falls away, bathed in sharp sunlit highlights and deep indigo shadow, with a distant Earth hanging low on the horizon. Terrace architecture uses biomorphic white composites and thin structural ribs that grow like branches, supporting floating planters of hardy engineered plants, muted greens and silver leaves. A few meditative benches face the view, low and monolithic, with integrated footrests and subtle underlighting. Two distant figures sit quietly, silhouettes small against the scale of crater and sky, not interacting with the camera. Lighting is soft and indirect under the terrace canopy, warm gold from concealed strips, balancing the harsh, cool lunar sunlight filtered by the pressure-screen. Reflections on the floor and bench surfaces are controlled, satin rather than glossy, preventing glare while still catching subtle sky gradients. Camera positioned at human eye level near the terrace edge, using a 26mm wide lens to exaggerate horizontal reach without distortion. Physically based rendering (PBR) with global illumination (GI), very delicate volumetric dust near the floor and around planter bases, cinematic but understated depth of field, everything composed for calm, spacious clarity.  \nNegative: busy crowds, aggressive gestures, advertising, graffiti, trash, strong lens flare, smeared motion blur, extreme contrast, foggy low-res rendering, comic-book stylization.  \nAspect ratio: 21:9  \n\n---\n\n3. **Stellar Cartography Amphitheater with LCARS Ribbons**  \nQuiet stellar cartography amphitheater deep within a starship, 180 years ahead, artificial gravity stable so steps, railings, and consoles feel firmly anchored even as the galaxy rotates in holographic projection. Central area holds a suspended, semi-transparent 3D star volume, faintly glowing in blues and violets, rendered as layered fog and pinpoint lights. Surrounding it, stepped seating and standing platforms flow in smooth curves, built from matte charcoal composites trimmed with soft metallic accents. LCARS-style consoles wrap the lower perimeter in continuous ribbons, pastel interface bands bending smoothly around corners, rounded display modules and touch surfaces showing sector maps, spectral data, and unobtrusive status readouts. Interface colors remain gentle: peach, lavender, soft cyan, no flashing alerts. A single officer stands at one console, hands resting lightly, posture relaxed, face turned toward the hologram, providing scale without drama. Overhead, the ceiling fades into a dark acoustic canopy punctuated by minimal linear luminaires that emit warm, indirect light, balanced by the cool glow of the hologram and a few recessed floor lights defining step edges. Surfaces exhibit controlled reflections, mostly satin, allowing soft highlights but no mirror glare. Deep backdrop walls remain clean and unadorned, emphasizing the central volume of stars. Camera at slightly elevated eye level from the back row, using a 24mm lens to capture the full width of the amphitheater and the floating galaxy. Physically based rendering (PBR) with global illumination (GI), accurate subsurface scattering on composite surfaces, gentle volumetric haze around the projection, and a very subtle bokeh on distant consoles, prioritizing clear composition and contemplative mood.  \nNegative: chaotic UI elements, bright warning alerts, crowds, dramatic action poses, weapons, text labels, exaggerated bloom, heavy noise, low-poly models, stylized outlines.  \nAspect ratio: 16:9  \n\n---\n\n4. **Venus Cloudtop Aerostat Meditation Deck**  \nOpen aerostat deck floating high in the golden cloud tops of Venus, 220 years in the future, with artificial gravity tuned to Earth-normal so people stand and walk naturally while the platform gently drifts. Foreground shows a broad, semi-circular deck framed by smooth Zen-like membrane structures, pale off-white tensile surfaces stretched over slender carbon arches, edges softened into organic curves. The outer perimeter is protected by an almost invisible pressure-field, indicated only by faint ripples of refracted light and a delicate line of embedded emitters, allowing an unobstructed, open feeling to the immense cloudscape beyond. Below, endless stratified clouds glow in layered oranges, creams, and muted gold, lit from a low sun filtered through haze. Deck flooring is a warm, matte composite resembling fine-grained stone, with narrow channels of embedded biotech lighting that emit a soft bioluminescent cyan. Scattered along the deck are low meditation platforms and a few reclined loungers, extremely minimal, some with integrated living moss pads. Three distant figures stand near the invisible rail, silhouettes small and still, gazes turned outward. Interior lighting comes from concealed strips under the membranes, warm and indirect, balancing the cool cyan pathways and the rich diffuse glow of the Venusian clouds. No signage, no clutter, only a few discrete safety markers. Camera at calm eye level near the deck centerline, shot with a 28mm wide lens to emphasize horizontal openness and edge-to-edge sky. Physically based rendering (PBR), global illumination (GI), gentle volumetric scattering in the clouds, subtle atmosphere bloom, crisp yet quiet image, composed for serenity and expansive scale.  \nNegative: storms, lightning strikes, crowded tourist scene, bright signage, text, logos, cartoon clouds, extreme HDR, tilted horizon, low-resolution artifacts.  \nAspect ratio: 21:9  \n\n---\n\n5. **Deep-Space Basalt Repair Bay with Shuttle**  \nSilent deep-space repair bay carved into a dark monolithic structure, 160 years in the future, artificial gravity steady so tools, rail tracks, and gantries sit firmly despite the void outside. The scene looks out along a long axial bay where a single sleek shuttle hull rests in a cradle, nose pointed toward a distant rectangular aperture revealing starfield and a faint nebula. Walls and ceiling form a continuous basalt-like monocoque shell, matte charcoal with subtle mineral specks, geometry clean and faceted with large uninterrupted planes. Structural ribs are integrated as shallow reliefs rather than protruding beams, keeping the space visually quiet. Floor is a smooth, slightly reflective composite with faint embedded guidance lines and a few recessed light strips marking pathways. There are no cluttered tool racks, only a handful of low modular cases parked neatly to one side. A compact maintenance robot stands near the shuttle\u2019s aft quarter, arms retracted, body design minimal and functional. Overhead, soft linear luminaires run along the bay edges, emitting even, glare-free illumination, tuned warm enough to separate interior from the cool starlight spilling in from the open aperture. Reflections on the shuttle hull are controlled and clean, showing elongated highlights and subtle hints of the bay geometry without distortion. Camera at human eye height slightly off-center, aimed down the bay length, using a 24mm lens to accentuate depth and converging lines. Physically based rendering (PBR) with global illumination (GI), very mild volumetric haze near the floor, crisp shadows, limited palette of charcoals, steel, and gentle accent lights, all arranged for calm, disciplined composition.  \nNegative: messy tool clutter, sparks, active welding, smoke, aggressive motion blur, text overlays, logos, extreme wide-angle distortion, garish colors, game-like shaders.  \nAspect ratio: 16:9"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"4451e408-5f05-4c63-9c29-1481c150c1c5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"da215787-f4c4-4fe7-bf5d-c08a3cb2114d","turn_exchange_id":"ea13e203-c2d2-4437-9a69-74d55039c522","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"da215787-f4c4-4fe7-bf5d-c08a3cb2114d","children":[]}}}
