The mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left.\n- **Negative Skew (Left Skew)**: The left tail (smaller values) is longer or fatter than the right tail. The mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right.\n- **Zero Skewness**: Indicates a symmetric distribution. However, it doesn't necessarily mean the distribution is normal.\n\n**Formula**: \n\\[ \\text{Skewness} = \\frac{E[(X - \\mu)^3]}{\\sigma^3} \\]\nwhere \\( E \\) is the expected value, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n\n### Kurtosis\n\n**Definition**: Kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. It indicates how much of the data is in the tails and the peak of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.\n\n- **Positive Kurtosis (Leptokurtic)**: Distribution has heavier tails and a sharper peak than the normal distribution. Indicates outliers are more likely.\n- **Negative Kurtosis (Platykurtic)**: Distribution has lighter tails and a flatter peak than the normal distribution. Indicates fewer outliers.\n- **Zero Kurtosis (Mesokurtic)**: Indicates a distribution with the same kurtosis as a normal distribution (kurtosis of 3).\n\n**Formula**:\n\\[ \\text{Kurtosis} = \\frac{E[(X - \\mu)^4]}{\\sigma^4} \\]\nTo compare with a normal distribution, excess kurtosis is often used:\n\\[ \\text{Excess Kurtosis} = \\text{Kurtosis} - 3 \\]\nwhere a normal distribution has an excess kurtosis of 0.\n\n### Applications\n\n- **Skewness**: Useful in finance, quality control, and various fields where understanding the asymmetry of data is crucial.\n- **Kurtosis**: Applied in risk management, insurance, and fields where the probability of extreme values (outliers) is important.\n\nThese measures help in understanding the shape and characteristics of a data distribution, beyond just the central tendency and variability."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"e07b9817-b782-408c-ac06-fb03ac93c151","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"8949c5f8c9f75f8d-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e07b9817-b782-408c-ac06-fb03ac93c151","children":[]}}}
