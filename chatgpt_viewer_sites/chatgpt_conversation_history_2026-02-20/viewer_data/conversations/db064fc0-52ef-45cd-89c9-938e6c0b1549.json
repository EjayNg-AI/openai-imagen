Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Install VSCode:**\n   - If you haven't already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n2. **Install a LaTeX distribution:**\n   - You need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. Common choices are:\n     - **TeX Live** (cross-platform): [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)\n     - **MiKTeX** (Windows): [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)\n     - **MacTeX** (macOS): [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)\n\n3. **Install LaTeX Workshop extension:**\n   - Open VSCode.\n   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.\n   - Search for \"LaTeX Workshop\" and install it.\n\n4. **Configure LaTeX Workshop:**\n   - The default configuration should work for most users, but you might want to customize it to fit your needs. You can do this by modifying the settings in VSCode:\n     - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).\n     - Type \"Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)\" and select it.\n     - Add your custom settings. For example:\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"latex-workshop.latex.tools\": [\n           {\n             \"name\": \"pdflatex\",\n             \"command\": \"pdflatex\",\n             \"args\": [\n               \"-synctex=1\",\n               \"-interaction=nonstopmode\",\n               \"-file-line-error\",\n               \"%DOC%\"\n             ]\n           },\n           {\n             \"name\": \"bibtex\",\n             \"command\": \"bibtex\",\n             \"args\": [\n               \"%DOCFILE%\"\n             ]\n           },\n           {\n             \"name\": \"latexmk\",\n             \"command\": \"latexmk\",\n             \"args\": [\n               \"-synctex=1\",\n               \"-interaction=nonstopmode\",\n               \"-file-line-error\",\n               \"-pdf\",\n               \"-outdir=%OUTDIR%\",\n               \"%DOC%\"\n             ]\n           }\n         ],\n         \"latex-workshop.latex.recipes\": [\n           {\n             \"name\": \"latexmk \ud83d\udd03\",\n             \"tools\": [\n               \"latexmk\"\n             ]\n           },\n           {\n             \"name\": \"pdflatex \u279e bibtex \u279e pdflatex\u200a\u00d7\u200a2\",\n             \"tools\": [\n               \"pdflatex\",\n               \"bibtex\",\n               \"pdflatex\",\n               \"pdflatex\"\n             ]\n           }\n         ]\n       }\n       ```\n\n5. **Create a LaTeX document:**\n   - Open or create a new `.tex` file.\n   - Write your LaTeX code.\n\n6. **Compile your LaTeX document:**\n   - To compile your document, you can use the build commands provided by LaTeX Workshop:\n     - Click on the \"TeX\" icon on the left side of the VSCode window.\n     - Click on the \"Build LaTeX project\" button (usually a play button icon).\n     - Alternatively, you can use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type \"LaTeX Workshop: Build with recipe\" and select the desired recipe.\n\n7. **View the output:**\n   - LaTeX Workshop provides a built-in PDF viewer. After compilation, you can view the output directly in VSCode.\n   - You can also configure it to open the PDF in an external viewer if preferred.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run and compile LaTeX documents in VSCode effectively."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAA","parent_id":"34b8ada4-2956-4f21-96b7-c7d89e79a551","request_id":"8869bf8e0eb891bd-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"34b8ada4-2956-4f21-96b7-c7d89e79a551","children":["aaa298d9-69da-4b97-8b9b-effb0ccb6b15"]},"aaa298d9-69da-4b97-8b9b-effb0ccb6b15":{"id":"aaa298d9-69da-4b97-8b9b-effb0ccb6b15","message":{"id":"aaa298d9-69da-4b97-8b9b-effb0ccb6b15","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1716181780.661537,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["In the each sub-directory, I will also be saving the answer to every question in a separate .txt file, named, for instance, Q22ans.txt.

It assumes that the answer files are named in the format `Q<question_number>ans.txt`.\n\n3. **Append Answers**: The `append_answers` function appends a new section titled \"Answers\" at the end of the LaTeX document and adds each answer in the order the questions are listed. It formats the answers with LaTeX commands for readability.\n\n4. **Main Integration**: The `main` function integrates the process. It extracts the questions and appends the answers to the LaTeX document.\n\n### Usage:\n\n1. Save the script as `append_answers.py`.\n2. Ensure that your project directory structure matches the assumed pattern (e.g., `project/main.tex`, `project/Q1/Q1.tex`, `project/Q1/Q1ans.txt`, etc.).\n3. Run the script from the terminal or command prompt in the `project` directory:\n   ```sh\n   python append_answers.py\n   ```\n\nThis script will modify the `main.tex` file by appending the answers to the end in the correct order."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2846a-004a-4d00-b877-69dac46c7fb9","request_id":"8869d1f4ebcc44a0-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2846a-004a-4d00-b877-69dac46c7fb9","children":[]}}}
