So GPU-to-GPU comm is over PCIe.\n- Some stacks support tensor parallel well (e.g., vLLM), others are more fiddly.\n- For a single user generating 1 stream of text, one huge GPU can feel \u201csnappier\u201d than multiple smaller GPUs, unless you\u2019re specifically optimizing the stack.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Inference software stacks that people use (practical options)\n\nYou can broadly split local LLM usage into two worlds:\n\n### A) \u201cQuantized-first\u201d (best for fitting big models, easiest locally)\n- **llama.cpp** (GGUF) and frontends like LM Studio / Koboldcpp\n  - Strength: runs on lots of hardware, excellent quantized support, easy offload tuning.\n  - Typical: Q4/Q5 models, partial GPU offload, CPU fallback.\n\n### B) \u201cGPU-first / serving\u201d (best throughput; more setup)\n- **vLLM**, **TensorRT\u2011LLM**, **text-generation-inference**, etc.\n  - Strength: high throughput, good for multi-user / multi-request.\n  - Typical: tensor parallel, batching, paged KV cache, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 5) NVIDIA vs AMD for local open LLMs (Feb 2026)\n\n### NVIDIA (CUDA): simplest path today\nIf your goal is \u201crun lots of open models with minimal pain,\u201d NVIDIA is still the default because almost every toolchain targets CUDA first.\n\n### AMD Radeon (ROCm / HIP / Vulkan): improving, but check compatibility carefully\nAMD has been pushing ROCm onto consumer Radeon more aggressively. AMD\u2019s own blog states that **native PyTorch support on Windows and Linux** is available as a **public preview** for **Radeon 7000 and 9000 series** (among others). ([amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2025/the-road-to-rocm-on-radeon-for-windows-and-linux.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nAt the same time, earlier coverage noted ROCm releases that **lacked RDNA 4 enablement** (at least at that point in time), which is why many people still treat \u201cnewest Radeon + ML\u201d as something to validate before buying. ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amds-latest-rocm-6-4-release-continues-to-lack-rdna-4-support?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Practical AMD advice**\n- If you want \u201cmaximum certainty,\u201d NVIDIA is easier.\n- If you\u2019re fine tinkering:\n  - llama.cpp via **Vulkan** can be a useful fallback path on AMD,\n  - ROCm support exists but may still have version-specific quirks.\n\n---\n\n## 6) What\u2019s realistic for fine-tuning on this kind of rig?\n\n### Full training from scratch\n- Not realistic on \u201cconsumer GPU(s)\u201d for modern frontier-scale LLMs.\n\n### Fine-tuning (LoRA / QLoRA)\nVery doable, depending on VRAM and model size:\n\n- **16 GB GPU**: commonly fine-tune **7B** models (and sometimes 13B with careful configs)\n- **32 GB GPU**: fine-tune **7B\u201313B** very comfortably; **30B-ish** may be possible with aggressive memory tricks and small batch sizes\n- **Multi\u2011GPU**: makes 13B\u201334B fine-tunes much more comfortable, and increases batch/context options\n\nYour HEDT CPU helps here because you can throw **lots of RAM** at dataloading, caching, preprocessing, and you can keep multiple datasets and checkpoints on fast NVMe.\n\n---\n\n## 7) \u201cSo what kind of open LLMs can I run?\u201d (quick answer)\n\nWith a **current HEDT CPU** and:\n\n- **A 16 GB \u201cSOTA\u201d consumer GPU** (e.g., RTX 5080 16GB ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5080/?utm_source=openai)) / RX 9070 XT 16GB ([techpowerup.com](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-9070-xt.c4229?utm_source=openai))):\n  - Best experience: **7B\u201315B** class (chat + code + RAG)\n  - Possible: **~30B** class with 4-bit quantization and context tradeoffs\n\n- **A 32 GB top consumer GPU** (e.g., RTX 5090 32GB ([techpowerup.com](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5090.c4216?utm_source=openai))):\n  - Best experience: **30B\u201340B** class at high-quality quantization\n  - Possible: **70B** class with heavier quantization and/or RAM offload\n\n- **2\u20134 GPUs on HEDT** (enabled by high PCIe lane budgets ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/threadripper-9000-cpus-will-revive-the-hedt-market-on-july-31-starting-at-usd1-499-for-24-cores-the-flagship-64-core-chip-will-set-you-back-usd4-999?utm_source=openai))):\n  - Comfortable 70B-class inference (especially quantized) with fewer compromises\n  - Much better throughput / concurrency if you\u2019re serving multiple users or doing agent workloads\n\n---\n\n## Two questions that let me give you a precise \u201cmodels you can run\u201d list\n1) Are you targeting **single-GPU** or **multi-GPU** (and how many GPUs)?\n2) Which GPU vendor are you planning (**NVIDIA vs AMD**), and what VRAM target (**16 / 24 / 32 GB**)?\n\nIf you answer those, I\u2019ll propose:\n- a concrete set of model sizes (7B/14B/32B/70B) that will fit cleanly,\n- recommended quantization formats (GGUF Q4/Q5 vs GPTQ/AWQ/EXL2),\n- and the simplest software stack to run them on your OS."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"can_save":true,"model_slug":"gpt-5.2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5.2"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b9c8ee43-9953-4ca5-97ea-a32dbf944892","children":["01e7a4ce-b8f0-4179-a04c-6ee157a743e1"]},"01e7a4ce-b8f0-4179-a04c-6ee157a743e1":{"id":"01e7a4ce-b8f0-4179-a04c-6ee157a743e1","message":{"id":"01e7a4ce-b8f0-4179-a04c-6ee157a743e1","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771630391.4771938,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["single non-HEDT CPU and single high end GPU"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"60a5c9af-a166-4a28-a4f3-f4da1232f96e","children":["ae64f45d-ab54-4339-a0c8-afd96d526845"]},"ae64f45d-ab54-4339-a0c8-afd96d526845":{"id":"ae64f45d-ab54-4339-a0c8-afd96d526845","message":{"id":"ae64f45d-ab54-4339-a0c8-afd96d526845","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771630391.4771938,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["With a **single mainstream (non\u2011HEDT) CPU** and a **single high-end consumer GPU**, you can run essentially the same *classes* of open\u2011weight LLMs that HEDT users run\u2014just with less flexibility for **multi\u2011GPU sharding** and **big RAM offload**.\n\nIn practice, the question becomes:\n\n1) **How much GPU VRAM do you have?** (this is the #1 limiter)  \n2) **How long of a context window do you need?** (KV cache can be the #2 limiter)  \n3) Do you care about **max quality (FP16)** or **max size (quantized 4-bit/3-bit)**?\n\nBelow is a very practical guide by VRAM tier, plus what \u201ckinds\u201d of open models fit well.\n\n---\n\n## 1) The CPU matters less than you think (as long as it\u2019s not ancient)\n\nFor **LLM inference** on a single GPU, a normal modern desktop CPU (Ryzen 7 / Core i7 class, 8\u201316 cores) is typically fine if you have:\n\n- **PCIe x16** slot wired properly (Gen4/Gen5 helps, but Gen4 is already fine)\n- **32 GB RAM minimum**, **64 GB recommended** if you plan to:\n  - run >30B models with some offload,\n  - use very long context,\n  - do RAG with a local vector DB + reranker,\n  - keep multiple models loaded.\n- **NVMe SSD** (models are big;

On 32 GB it\u2019s typically **3-bit** or **4-bit with partial offload**.\n\n---\n\n## 3) What \u201ckinds\u201d of open(-weight) LLMs fit these tiers?\n\nRather than listing one \u201cbest model\u201d (that changes constantly), here are the **categories** you can run well locally, plus common example families you\u2019ll see in the open ecosystem.\n\n### A) General chat / instruction models\nThese exist in many sizes; for single GPU they usually break down like:\n\n- **7B\u20139B class** (best on 12\u201316 GB)\n  - Good for: everyday chat, summarization, basic reasoning, tool use, small agents\n  - Common families you\u2019ll encounter: *Llama-class 8B instruct*, *Mistral-class 7B instruct*, *Qwen-class 7B instruct*, *Gemma-class ~9B instruct*.\n\n- **13B\u201315B class** (best on 16\u201324 GB)\n  - Noticeably better instruction following and robustness than 7B for many tasks\n  - Great \u201csingle GPU daily driver\u201d if you can fit it comfortably\n\n- **27B\u201334B class** (best on 24\u201332 GB with 4-bit)\n  - Often the \u201cI can finally feel the difference\u201d tier for:\n    - long-form writing,\n    - more consistent multi-step answers,\n    - better coding + explanations,\n    - stronger RAG answers (less hallucination vs tiny models, though still not perfect).\n\n- **70B class** (possible on 24\u201332 GB only with heavier quant/offload)\n  - Best for: higher-quality writing/reasoning when you can tolerate lower speed and more setup\n  - If you want 70B to feel *good* on one GPU, VRAM above consumer tiers is where it becomes easy.\n\n### B) Coding-focused models (often best ROI locally)\nCoding models are extremely practical on single-GPU rigs because:\n- they perform well even at 7B\u201315B sizes,\n- they don\u2019t always require giant context to be useful (though bigger helps).\n\nWhat fits well:\n- **16 GB VRAM:** excellent with **7B\u201315B** code models (4-bit or 8-bit)\n- **24\u201332 GB VRAM:** can run **bigger code models** or keep **larger context** comfortably\n\n### C) \u201cReasoning-tuned\u201d / \u201cthinking\u201d models\nMany \u201creasoning\u201d releases come as:\n- smaller distilled variants (7B\u201314B) that run great on 16\u201324 GB\n- larger \u201cteacher\u201d or \u201cmax\u201d variants that push you into 34B/70B territory\n\nFor a single consumer GPU, the sweet spot is often:\n- **14B-ish reasoning models** (fast enough to iterate)\n- **32\u201334B reasoning models** if you have 24\u201332 GB VRAM\n\n### D) Long-context models (8k/32k/100k+)\nLong context is where people get surprised: you fit the weights, then you OOM on KV cache.\n\nRules of thumb:\n- If you want **very long context**, prefer:\n  - smaller models (7B\u201314B), or\n  - architectures optimized for long context, and/or\n  - quantized KV cache / paged attention implementations (depends on runtime).\n- On **16 GB**, 7B long-context is feasible; 34B long-context usually isn\u2019t pleasant.\n- On **32 GB**, long context becomes more viable on 13B\u201334B, but you still need to tune.\n\n### E) Multimodal (vision-language) models\nYou *can* run open VLMs locally (image+text), but they often require:\n- extra VRAM for vision encoder / image tokens,\n- more complex runtimes.\n\nPractical:\n- **16 GB:** smaller VLMs, lower resolution, shorter context\n- **24\u201332 GB:** much better experience\n\n---\n\n## 4) What you can do besides inference: fine-tuning (on one GPU)\n\nIf by \u201crun\u201d you also mean \u201cfine-tune\u201d:\n\n### LoRA / QLoRA fine-tuning (realistic)\n- **16 GB VRAM:** commonly fine-tune **7B** models (QLoRA), sometimes 13B with tight configs\n- **24 GB:** **7B\u201313B** is comfortable; some **~30B-ish** experiments are possible but fiddly\n- **32 GB:** **13B** is very comfortable; **30B-ish** fine-tunes become more realistic (still depends on sequence length, batch size, optimizer, etc.)\n\n### Full fine-tuning\nStill generally impractical for large modern LLMs on a single consumer GPU unless the model is small and your goals are modest.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Recommended \u201ceasy mode\u201d ways to run these locally\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for tooling, but it\u2019s tightly coupled to \u201cwhat can I run\u201d, because model format/quantization matters.\n\n### Easiest path (especially for quantized models)\n- **GGUF + llama.cpp** (and GUIs like LM Studio / others)\n  - Great for: Q4/Q5 quantized 7B\u201370B, partial GPU offload, \u201cit just works\u201d\n  - Especially useful if you\u2019re VRAM-limited and need to trade speed vs fit\n\n### Fast \u201cGPU server\u201d path (best throughput)\n- **vLLM / TensorRT-LLM / HF Transformers**\n  - Great for: running FP16/8-bit models at high speed, serving multiple concurrent chats, tool calling\n  - Most straightforward on NVIDIA; doable elsewhere with more caveats\n\n---\n\n## 6) If you tell me your VRAM, I\u2019ll give you a concrete shortlist\n\nTo turn this into a precise answer, I need just one spec:\n\n**How much VRAM does your \u201chigh end GPU\u201d have?** (e.g., 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 GB)\n\nAnd optionally:\n- OS: Windows or Linux?\n- Primary use: gaming+assistant, coding, writing, RAG, or experimentation?\n\nThen I can give you:\n- \u201cPick 1\u20132 daily-driver models\u201d (size + quant type),\n- the biggest model you can run *comfortably*,\n- the biggest model you can run *at all* (with compromises),\n- and the simplest runtime stack for your setup."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"can_save":true,"model_slug":"gpt-5.2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5.2"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"01e7a4ce-b8f0-4179-a04c-6ee157a743e1","children":[]}}}
