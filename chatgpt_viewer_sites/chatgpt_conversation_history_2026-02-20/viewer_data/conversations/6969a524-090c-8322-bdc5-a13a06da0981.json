Typical adult max: **\u2264 3,000\u20134,000 mg/day** (many clinicians advise staying \u22643,000 mg/day, especially long-term).\n   - Avoid combining multiple paracetamol-containing products (cold/flu combos often include it).\n\n2. **Liver considerations**  \n   - Use lower doses or avoid if you have **significant liver disease** or **heavy alcohol use** (\u22652\u20133 drinks/day).\n\n3. **Long-term daily use**  \n   - Chronic high-dose paracetamol has been associated (in some studies) with **small BP increases**. This is not an acute interaction, but worth noting if you plan daily use for weeks.\n\n---\n\n## What to avoid (unless your doctor says otherwise)\n\n- **NSAIDs** (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac):  \n  Can **raise blood pressure**, **reduce perindopril\u2019s effectiveness**, and **increase kidney risk**, especially when combined with ACE inhibitors.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\nFor occasional pain or fever while on amlodipine and perindopril, **Panadol is appropriate and safe** when used within recommended doses.  \nIf you\u2019re considering **regular daily use** or have **liver issues**, it\u2019s sensible to check with your doctor for individualized advice."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"f5641d7d-da26-4719-b36d-c680ad2eeee9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"d04c5243-64da-48ad-a6e8-fb02d00a71d9","turn_exchange_id":"274a68c1-e049-4f69-a3e4-52131c487a4e","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"d04c5243-64da-48ad-a6e8-fb02d00a71d9","children":[]}}}
