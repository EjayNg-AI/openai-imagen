Below is a **brutally honest**, Singapore\u2011specific strategy that (a) widens your option set, (b) ranks each path by feasibility for *you*, and (c) gives you a concrete 90\u2011day plan to test the best options without betting the farm.\n\n---\n\n## Executive takeaways (what I\u2019d do in your shoes)\n\n1) **Run a two\u2011track experiment for 90 days**:\n   - **Track A (Assessment & Public Sector)**: Aim at **SEAB / MOE\u2011HQ (CPDD)** first; in parallel, probe **Poly/ITE lecturer** roles. These are high\u2011fit to your PhD + depth in pedagogy, with lower age\u2011bias risk and strong stability. SEAB explicitly invests in **adaptive testing** and **Gen\u2011AI for assessment**, which matches your math + analytical strengths. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n   - **Track B (Niche AI/ML portfolio)**: Build a **domain\u2011specific AI+assessment portfolio** (see project briefs below) aimed at **GovTech DSAID/OGP**, **A*STAR/DSO/DSTA** research\u2011engineering, and **edtech** (Geniebook/KooBits/Practicle). This avoids head\u2011to\u2011head competition with 20\u2011somethings by leaning on measurement theory and serious math. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn8search2\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search3\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search2\ue201\n\n2) **Keep an industry fallback**: If you discover the real problem is your current centre (not tutoring per se), **switch centre** while preserving Track B portfolio time. Test the hypothesis before burning bridges.\n\n3) **Leverage mid\u2011career subsidies** *surgically* (only where they accelerate the plan): **SkillsFuture Mid\u2011Career Enhanced Subsidy** (up to ~90% fees) and the **Mid\u2011Career Training Allowance** (24\u2011month lifetime cap) can defray upskilling cost and income risk if you take a short full\u2011time programme\u2014use these as optional accelerants, not detours. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn3search11\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n4) **About ageism**: As of **Jan 2025**, the **Workplace Fairness Act** explicitly bans discrimination on *age* (and other protected characteristics). It won\u2019t erase subtle bias, but it strengthens your position\u2014especially in the public sector. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Ranked paths for you (from most to least feasible **for your profile**)\n\n### 1) **SEAB (Assessment/Research) or MOE\u2011HQ (CPDD)**\n- **Why you fit**: Deep math + long pedagogy experience \u2192 **assessment design, psychometrics, equating, curriculum policy**. SEAB showcases **adaptive testing** and **Gen\u2011AI for assessments**, so a mathematically rigorous candidate who can talk **IRT/Rasch, DIF, test form assembly** is valuable. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- **Pros**: Intellectual growth (measurement science), national\u2011level impact, stability, reduced age risk. **Directly leverages your domain knowledge.**  \n- **Hard truths**: Hiring cycles can be long; psychometrics vocabulary matters.  \n- **Positioning**: Title yourself **\u201cMathematics & Assessment Scientist\u201d**; highlight any statistical analysis you\u2019ve done on exam items; speak the language of **IRT, reliability (\u03b1/\u03c9/Info), linking/equating**.  \n- **Evidence of fit**: SEAB\u2019s mandate is national examinations and assessment R&D; CPDD drives syllabus design/review\u2014both match your background. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n### 2) **Polytechnic / ITE Lecturer (full\u2011time or adjunct)**\n- **Why you fit**: You have 15+ years teaching across levels + PhD. Polys value teaching excellence and curriculum development; openings exist (e.g., Singapore Polytechnic\u2019s Math school). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue201  \n- **Pros**: High feasibility, clear progression (Lecturer \u2192 Senior \u2192 Principal), applied projects, stability.  \n- **Hard truths**: Admin load; research expectations vary by school; salary ceiling vs private tutoring upside.\n\n### 3) **GovTech (DSAID) / Open Government Products (OGP)**\n- **Why you fit**: You can bring **measurement rigor** to citizen\u2011facing AI, analytics, and decision systems. DSAID is the government\u2019s AI capability centre; OGP builds shipped products quickly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn8search2\ue201  \n- **Pros**: Strong intellectual growth, public impact, quality engineering culture.  \n- **Hard truths**: You\u2019ll compete with strong engineers; you **must** show a portfolio that deploys AI beyond notebooks (data pipelines, evaluation harnesses).  \n- **Angle**: Showcase **assessment/education AI** work with production\u2011grade repos; align with GovTech\u2019s data/AI mission. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n### 4) **Applied Research Engineer** at **A*STAR (IHPC/I\u00b2R)**, **DSTA**, or **DSO**\n- **Why you fit**: Math\u2011heavy R&D (optimization, ML, simulation) where maturity is valued. These orgs hire research engineers/scientists across AI/analytics. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search1\ue202turn4search3\ue201  \n- **Pros**: High technical depth, publications possible, national mission.  \n- **Hard truths**: Security clearance in some roles; interviews are technical; you\u2019ll need modern ML engineering chops.\n\n### 5) **EdTech (curriculum + AI product)** \u2014 Geniebook, KooBits, Practicle, ACE\u2011Learning\n- **Why you fit**: Combine **content authority** with **AI\u2011enabled learning**. These firms explicitly market AI/personalisation aligned to SG syllabus. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search2\ue201  \n- **Pros**: Direct domain leverage, fast iteration, real learners.  \n- **Hard truths**: Start\u2011up volatility; metrics\u2011driven culture; you may start as **Curriculum Lead/Assessment Scientist \u2192 move into Product/AI**.\n\n### 6) **AI Singapore** \u2014 AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP) or LLM Application Developer Programme (LADP)\n- **Why you fit**: Structured, nationally backed applied AI training; AIAP is 9 months; LADP focuses on shipping LLM apps. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n- **Pros**: Real projects, mentorship, credibility in local market.  \n- **Hard truths (brutal)**: **Competition is fierce**; without a standout portfolio, you\u2019ll be compared against younger engineers who already deploy to prod. You must bring a **niche differentiator** (assessment/psychometrics + LLM eval).\n\n### 7) **Stay in tutoring, but reposition to a premium niche**\n- **How to make it non\u2011stagnant**: Move to **IB HL AA / A\u2011Level H2/H3, Olympiad, Uni bridge modules**, and **teacher training**. Package **diagnostic/IRT\u2011informed** progress reports as your product moats. This can be paired with Track B.\n\n---\n\n## \u201cIs ageism a blocker?\u201d \u2014 The realistic view\n\n- **Law**: The **Workplace Fairness Act** passed in **Jan 2025** prohibits adverse employment decisions based on age across hiring, appraisal, training, promotion, dismissal. Enforcement builds on TAFEP/TGFEP. This **reduces** institutional age barriers, especially in the public sector. It does not erase subtle bias\u2014so you must **de\u2011risk** yourself with evidence (portfolio, referees, shipped work). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 90\u2011day plan (no\u2011excuses version)\n\n### Weeks 0\u20132 \u2014 Reposition & choose two tracks\n- **Decide**: Track A (Assessment/Public sector) + Track B (AI portfolio).  \n- **CV/Li profile**: Headline **\u201cMathematics PhD | Assessment & Measurement | AI\u2011for\u2011Learning\u201d**.
