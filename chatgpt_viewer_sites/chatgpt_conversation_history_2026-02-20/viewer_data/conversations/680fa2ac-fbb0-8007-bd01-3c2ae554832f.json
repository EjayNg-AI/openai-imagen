first 100 days: America First president is overturning world order","snippet":"In his first 100 days back in office, President Donald Trump has aggressively pursued an \"America First\" agenda that has significantly disrupted long-standing global alliances and trade systems. His administration has initiated sweeping tariffs, reduced foreign aid, and questioned NATO's value while expressing openness toward annexing territories like Greenland and reclaiming the Panama Canal. Trump's confrontational stance has alarmed allies and emboldened adversaries, provoking defensive responses from Europe, Canada, South Korea, and Japan, which are reassessing their diplomatic and military strategies. Critics argue his erratic leadership undermines U.S. credibility and risks democratic backsliding at home, citing attacks on judicial institutions and universities. Despite some adjustments to his policies, Trump's overall approach has increased global uncertainty, sparking concerns about long-term geopolitical shifts and encouraging some nations to strengthen economic and security ties with China. While some analysts believe the global system may still recover, many warn of lasting damage if current trends persist. Trump's administration defends its actions as necessary corrections to failures under previous leadership and emphasizes its efforts to address global threats such as the Russia-Ukraine war and fentanyl trafficking. Nonetheless, growing international unease underscores the high stakes of America\u2019s shifting role on the world stage.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745774500.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-waives-tariffs-some-us-goods-denies-trumps-claim-that-talks-are-underway-2025-04-25/","title":"Conflicting US-China talks statements add to global trade confusion","snippet":"\"China and the U.S. are NOT having any consultation or negotiation on #tariffs,\" China shot back in a foreign ministry statement posted by the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745595975.21475,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"immigrationforum.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://immigrationforum.org/article/legislative-bulletin-friday-march-28-2025/","title":"Legislative Bulletin \u2014 Friday, March 28, 2025","snippet":"Administration Directs USCIS to Halt Processing Green Cards for Refugees and Asylees.

antisemitic incidents dip in  for 2024","snippet":"In 2024, Arkansas experienced a slight decrease in antisemitic incidents, dropping from 25 reported cases in 2023 to 23, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). However, this remains a significant increase from 2022, when only seven incidents were recorded. Nationally, antisemitic actions have surged nearly 900% over the past decade, with 2024 marking the highest level in nearly 50 years, totaling 9,354 cases of assault, harassment, and vandalism. The rise in incidents follows the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which intensified tensions, especially on college campuses. This environment has led to controversial political actions, including proposals from the Trump administration to cut college funding and revoke student visas linked to protests. Critics, including some Jewish leaders, have cautioned that such moves may make Jewish communities scapegoats. In response, Arkansas enacted a new law in early 2025 prohibiting antisemitism in public schools, part of a broader legislative trend in the state. The ADL notes that while they exclude general criticism of Israel, they count incidents as antisemitic when they involve calls for Israel's destruction or antisemitic stereotypes in discussions about Israel.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745839320.0,"attribution":"Axios"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.adl.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/audit-antisemitic-incidents-2024","title":"Audit of Antisemitic Incidents 2024 - ADL","snippet":"Each year, ADL (Anti-Defamation League) tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745422733.487034,"attribution":"ADL"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/antisemitic-incident-data-breaks-all-previous-annual-records-2024-fourth","title":"Antisemitic Incident Data Breaks All Previous Annual Records in ...","snippet":"There were 9,354 incidents of antisemitic assault, harassment and vandalism across the country in 2024, according to ADL's (the Anti-Defamation ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745336775.516398,"attribution":"ADL"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.adl.org/adl-tracker","title":"ADL Tracker","snippet":"Follow Us on Twitter to View ADL Tracker ...

A federal judge in Louisiana condemned the deportation of VML as potentially unconstitutional and scheduled a hearing to address concerns that a U.S. citizen was wrongfully removed. VML was taken to Honduras after her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, was detained during a routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) check-in. Federal prosecutors claimed the mother voluntarily chose to take the child with her.\n\nIn Florida, S\u00e1nchez, still breastfeeding her medically fragile daughter, was denied due process and deported to Cuba, despite her lawyer's attempt to file paperwork contesting the deportation. These incidents are part of a broader, aggressive immigration crackdown under Trump's policies, which civil rights groups like the ACLU label as abuses of power. These measures have included deporting individuals regardless of citizenship or legal status, sparking significant legal and public backlash. Recent comments by Trump about deporting U.S. citizens raised further alarm among legal and civil rights experts.

His comments contrast with Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who recently expressed confidence in achieving a deal during her US visit, though no significant progress was reported. Concerns persist that President Trump\u2019s tariffs, including a 25% duty on cars, steel, and aluminum, could harm UK jobs. The UK has offered to lower tariffs on US agricultural and car imports but is unwilling to lift bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-injected beef.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK is optimistic about an impending agreement with the EU, due to be signed at the Lancaster House summit. The deal would streamline UK-EU agricultural trade by eliminating post-Brexit paperwork and checks, aligning UK standards with the EU\u2019s. This alignment would exclude a comprehensive US deal. The EU pact also includes provisions for continued EU fishing quotas and UK access to a \u20ac150 billion EU defense fund, in addition to cooperation on youth mobility, electricity trading, and carbon emission trading systems.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745774749.0,"attribution":"The Times"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-starmer-nears-eu-defence-pact-shadow-trump-trade-talks-2025-04-24/","title":"UK PM Starmer nears EU defence pact in shadow of Trump trade talks","snippet":"Britain is edging towards a new defence agreement with the European Union that officials on both sides hope will help to improve post-Brexit ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745509133.490749,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN6I2KZmCtM","title":"Trump Shocked as Canada Targets US Energy Exports ... - YouTube","snippet":"Trump Shocked as Canada Targets US Energy Exports Amid Growing Global Backlash: A Bluff? ...

Using the anecdote of Oliver Smoot\u2014who humorously became a unit of measurement after MIT fraternity pledges measured the Harvard Bridge in his height\u2014the editorial contrasts the harmless whimsy of one Smoot with the economic damage caused by Senator Reed Smoot's protectionist legislation. The piece argues that Trump's unpredictable and broad tariff measures have disrupted global markets, alienated allies, stalled corporate growth, and harmed farmers and consumers, particularly in Texas, the nation's top trading state. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas forecasts a $47 billion loss for Texas, and the Yale Budget Lab estimates an average annual household cost increase of $2,700 due to tariffs. The editorial condemns the administration\u2019s personnel decisions and lack of internal checks, urging Congress to resist these harmful policies before further long-term damage occurs.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745751614.0,"attribution":"Houston Chronicle"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sfchronicle.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/trump-tariff-free-trade-20289300.php","title":"A brief history of the 80 years of global economic cooperation that Trump has blown up in a month","snippet":"In just a month, President Donald Trump upended an 80-year global economic system founded after World War II to promote free trade and peace. This system began with the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and culminated in the formation of the World Trade Organization in 1994. These efforts, under U.S. leadership, drastically lowered tariffs, boosted economic growth, and improved living standards. However, free trade also produced winners and losers, with some U.S. industries affected by foreign competition and countries like China accused of violating trade norms.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has pursued a protectionist approach, imposing tariffs to combat perceived imbalances. While aiming to protect American interests, these measures have created economic uncertainty, disrupted supply chains, raised consumer prices, and prompted retaliatory tariffs, notably hurting sectors like agriculture and technology. Historical parallels to pre-World War II protectionism caution against such strategies, as they previously led to economic collapse and global conflict.\n\nInstead of resorting to tariffs, the article advocates for enhanced trade adjustment assistance to support adversely affected workers and communities. A balanced approach\u2014combining fair trade enforcement, diplomatic engagement, and domestic investment\u2014could preserve the benefits of global trade while addressing its flaws.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745665214.0,"attribution":"San Francisco Chronicle"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"history.state.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/protectionism","title":"Milestones: 1921\u20131936: Protectionism in the Interwar Period","snippet":"Smoot-Hawley marked the end of the line for high tariffs in 20th century American trade policy.

This often overlooked chapter in American history saw widespread deportations under the guise of returning individuals to their country due to massive unemployment and economic strain. The forced repatriation was partly driven by a belief that \"real Americans\" should hold jobs and a racialized perspective towards Mexican-Americans. Furthermore, this history is connected to the broader narrative of U.S. territorial expansion and disputes with Mexico, including events like the Mexican-American War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The repatriation program, heavily criticized for its coercive nature and disregard for due process, left long-lasting impacts on Mexican-American communities. Despite limited governmental recognition and historical marginalization, there have been recent efforts to bring this history to light and incorporate it into educational curricula. This revelation of history is a reminder of the profound contributions and struggles of Mexican-Americans in the U.S. and challenges contemporary anti-immigrant rhetoric.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1504094400.0,"attribution":"Teen Vogue"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_680fa2c64d848007b1c9879f4dda7530","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"10423ea7-1f69-45ed-aa36-287fda50e1e0","request_id":"9377b0563d374649-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"10423ea7-1f69-45ed-aa36-287fda50e1e0","children":["1dfac145-d1a9-4291-bd4e-6b8cbf69837e"]},"1dfac145-d1a9-4291-bd4e-6b8cbf69837e":{"id":"1dfac145-d1a9-4291-bd4e-6b8cbf69837e","message":{"id":"1dfac145-d1a9-4291-bd4e-6b8cbf69837e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745855250.719639,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"search_query\": [\n    {\n      \"q\": \"Operation Wetback 1954 mass deportation Mexican immigrants\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": [\"history.com\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Operation Wetback 1954 mass deportation Mexican immigrants"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"e9e34346-8188-4ec7-9b1b-e404508b5564","debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_680fa2c64d848007b1c9879f4dda7530","request_id":"9377b0563d374649-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"e9e34346-8188-4ec7-9b1b-e404508b5564","children":["9c938c50-51d1-4dae-865a-2fb866c6f1a5"]},"9c938c50-51d1-4dae-865a-2fb866c6f1a5":{"id":"9c938c50-51d1-4dae-865a-2fb866c6f1a5","message":{"id":"9c938c50-51d1-4dae-865a-2fb866c6f1a5","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1745855253.989472,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.history.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.history.com/news/operation-wetback-eisenhower-1954-deportation","title":"The Largest Mass Deportation in American History","snippet":"These Mexican immigrants had been caught in the snare of Operation Wetback, the biggest mass deportation of undocumented workers in United States history.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1521763200.0,"attribution":"HISTORY"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.history.com/articles/the-brutal-history-of-anti-latino-discrimination-in-america","title":"The Long History of Anti-Latino Discrimination in America","snippet":"...

Every element you describe\u2014surging antisemitism, public sympathy for violent extremist movements, protectionist trade wars, mass deportations, visa crack-downs on scholars, and deliberate friction with close allies\u2014has a clear American precedent.  What is novel in 2024-25 is their simultaneity, their breadth, and the speed with which they are being driven by a single administration in a hyper-connected world.  The closest analogue is the early-1930s \u201cperfect storm\u201d of Smoot-Hawley tariffs, the Mexican Repatriation, and an openly antisemitic America-First movement, but even that period lacked today\u2019s globalised supply chains, digital speech platforms and U.S. super-power entanglements.  Below is a comparative tour:\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What is happening right now (2024-25 snapshot)  \n\n| Domain | Current development | Key recent evidence |\n|--------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Antisemitism & Gaza protests | Record-high 9,354 antisemitic assaults/harassment/vandalism in 2024; Trump\u2019s January 28 executive order links campus Gaza protests to antisemitism and has already led to hundreds of student visa cancellations and some deportations | ADL annual audit\ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201; NPR campus-crackdown report\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 |\n| Immigration | \u201cOperation Aurora\u201d mass-deportation campaign, termination of CHNV parole, and a USCIS freeze on green-cards for refugees/asylees; ICE contracting for 100 000 new detention beds | National Immigration Forum bulletin\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201; USA Today detention story\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue201 |\n| Skilled visas | Vetting rules causing top researchers (especially in AI and quantum) to lose visa renewals; DHS cites Executive Order 14161 national-security screening | same bulletin\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201 |\n| Trade | Universal 10 % \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d plus 145 % average duty on Chinese imports; WTO complaints piling up; EU & Canada preparing retaliation | Al Jazeera trade-war explainer\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201 |\n| Allies | Trump\u2019s first-100-days foreign-policy reset: ridiculing NATO, cutting aid, threatening to annex Greenland & make Canada the 51st state; UK courting the EU instead | Reuters overview\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201; Reuters UK-EU defence talks\ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Earlier episodes with close parallels  \n\n| Period | What looked similar | What was different |\n|--------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| **Great Depression (1929-36)** | *Trade*: Smoot-Hawley Tariff triggered global retaliation \ue200cite\ue202turn9search0\ue201.  *Mass deportations*: 400 000-1.8 million people of Mexican descent forced out (Mexican Repatriation) \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201.  *Antisemitism*: Father Coughlin radio sermons, pro-Nazi rallies (20 000 in Madison Sq Garden, 1939).  *Isolationism*: \u201cAmerica First\u201d rejected League of Nations. | U.S. was not yet the hub of global value chains; no large-scale visa system to choke off scientific talent; the state of Israel and Hamas did not exist. |\n| **WW II era (1942-45)** | Internment of 120 000 Japanese Americans under the Alien Enemies Act; similar legal tool now eyed for \u201cOperation Aurora\u201d. | Internment targeted one ethnicity tied to an enemy state, not a diverse undocumented population of ~11 million. |\n| **McCarthy era + Operation Wetback (1950-54)** | Loyalty oaths, denial of visas to \u201cundesirable\u201d foreign scientists; Operation Wetback deported up to 1.3 million Mexicans \ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue201; NATO allies worried about \u201creckless unilateralism\u201d during Suez (1956). | No major tariff war; antisemitism was declining after the Holocaust\u2019s revelation. |\n| **Vietnam / late-1960s** | Massive campus protests, some antisemitic New Left rhetoric; draft-card burnings; strained alliances (de Gaulle withdraws France from NATO command 1966). | U.S. still lowering tariffs under GATT; immigration policy liberalised (1965 Act). |\n| **Trump\u2019s first term (2017-2021)** | Section 232 tariffs on allies, China trade war, \u201cMuslim-ban\u201d, DACA limbo; antisemitic incidents spike. | Mass-deportation machinery and revocation of birthright citizenship were threatened but not executed; alliances bent but did not fracture to today\u2019s extent. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Why the 2020s configuration feels *more* unprecedented  \n\n1. **Concurrency & scale** \u2013 Protectionism, xenophobia, and geopolitical estrangement are advancing together, rather than in separate waves.  \n2. **Target set** \u2013 Today\u2019s dragnet sweeps refugees, STEM PhDs and even green-card holders, whereas the 1930s/1950s drives focused on manual-labour Mexicans.  \n3. **Digital amplification** \u2013 Social media multiplies extremist content and harassment in real time; ADL data record an 893 % ten-year rise in antisemitic incidents \ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201.  \n4. **Systemic stakes** \u2013 The U.S. is now the keystone of global supply chains and security alliances; when Washington imposes 145 % tariffs or talks of annexing Canada, the reverberations are worldwide.  \n5. **Legal tools revived** \u2013 The Alien Enemies Act (1798) was last used in WWII; its current revival for civilian deportations is legally untested since Korematsu.  \n6. **Expansionist rhetoric** \u2013 Threatening to seize Greenland or the Panama Canal is qualitatively different from past \u201cwithdrawal\u201d isolationism.  \n\n---\n\n### 4.  Lessons history offers  \n\n| Past outcome | What it suggests for 2025 |\n|--------------|--------------------------|\n| Smoot-Hawley deepened the Great Depression and provoked retaliatory blocs | Expect higher consumer prices, lost export markets, and accelerated de-dollarisation if tariffs persist. |\n| Mexican Repatriation and Operation Wetback are now condemned as civil-rights abuses; many deportees were U.S. citizens | Large-scale removals risk due-process failures, foreign-policy fallout, and decades-long stigma. |\n| McCarthy visa denials fuelled a scientific brain drain to Europe and Canada | Cancelled green cards for researchers could undercut U.S. leadership in AI, quantum, biotech. |\n| Post-war alliances eventually stabilised because U.S. presidents reversed isolationism (FDR, JFK, Reagan) | Repair is possible, but the longer rupture continues, the more allies hedge with China/EU. |\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Bottom line  \n\nThe United States **has** experienced each of these pathologies before, sometimes more severely in isolation.  What *is* historically unique is seeing them rolled out together by the same administration, in a fully globalised economy, with instantaneous information flow and unprecedented executive power over digital platforms, immigration databases and supply-chain chokepoints.  The 1930s offer the starkest cautionary tale: protectionism, xenophobia and ally-alienation fed international instability that ultimately demanded a catastrophic war to resolve.  \n\nIf the question is whether America has *ever* been in quite this configuration before, the honest answer is **\u201cno\u2014this is a new permutation built from very old ingredients.\u201d**  \n\n---\n\n*Happy to drill deeper into any specific thread (trade economics, constitutional law, campus politics, or immigration logistics) if that serves your research.*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201","start_idx":1213,"end_idx":1232,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":1261,"end_idx":1278,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":1511,"end_idx":1528,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue201","start_idx":1555,"end_idx":1574,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":1762,"end_idx":1779,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201","start_idx":1963,"end_idx":1980,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201","start_idx":2175,"end_idx":2192,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue201","start_idx":2221,"end_idx":2240,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn9search0\ue201","start_idx":2498,"end_idx":2517,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201","start_idx":2621,"end_idx":2641,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[]},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue201","start_idx":3402,"end_idx":3422,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The

Reports indicate that Chinese tech giant Huawei is preparing to test its most powerful AI processor, the Ascend 910D, which is being manufactured by SMIC. Huawei aims for the chip to outperform Nvidia's H100 processor, released in 2022. Despite U.S. sanctions, Huawei continues making progress with prior chip versions, like the 910B and 910C. A Reuters report suggested the 910C matches the H100 in performance, though the Wall Street Journal disputed this claim. Additionally, recent U.S. government restrictions have banned Nvidia from selling certain AI chips, including the H20, to China. China\u2019s broader goal is to become self-sufficient in semiconductors. Nonetheless, analysts remain skeptical that Huawei can compete with Nvidia without access to advanced manufacturing tools from companies like ASML. Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson emphasized the limitations posed by SMIC\u2019s 7-nanometer process, though he acknowledged Huawei's potential to compete outside China.

The need for roles such as applications administrators and solutions architects is expected to rise, especially in non-tech industries looking to incorporate off-the-shelf AI tools. Major companies like Salesforce and SoftBank are already ramping up hiring efforts, with thousands of positions related to AI. Despite the growing market, there remains a scarcity of talent in specialized AI roles, such as natural language processing and predictive modeling. Employers find it particularly challenging to hire senior-level AI experts. Nonetheless, the demand for AI skills is anticipated to keep expanding, with a greater expectation for fluency in AI tools across various job roles.

During a federal court hearing in Washington, a Justice Department attorney announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will pause revocations while developing a new policy. Until then, visas will not be rescinded based solely on crime database entries. Students whose visas were already canceled, including for minor or dismissed offenses, will have them reinstated. However, ICE will continue to target individuals deemed national security risks, such as those allegedly supporting designated terrorist groups.\n\nThe decision follows legal challenges, with over 1,500 students affected and many filing lawsuits asserting that they had not committed serious crimes. Federal judges issued restraining orders against the pilot program, prompting the administration's reversal. Despite this pause, ICE retains the authority to terminate visas for other violations. The State Department emphasized a \"zero tolerance\" policy toward foreign students involved in unlawful activities, especially those related to anti-Israel protests. Nearly 1.1 million students currently hold F-1 visas in the U.S., and over 4,700 records have been removed from ICE's database since Trump's term began.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745618125.0,"attribution":"New York Post"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/07/us-news/us-revokes-first-visa-of-foreign-student-linked-to-hamas-supporting-disruptions-on-college-campus/","title":"US yanks first visa of foreign student linked to 'Hamas-supporting ...","snippet":"US yanks first visa of foreign student linked to 'Hamas-supporting disruptions' on college campus \u00b7 The State Department has revoked the first ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1741305600.0,"attribution":"New York Post"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/22/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-palestinian-activist-son-birth/","title":"Columbia protester missed son's birth after ICE denied release, wife says","snippet":"Mahmoud Khalil, a detained Columbia University graduate student and legal U.S. permanent resident, missed the birth of his first child after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) denied a request for his temporary release. His wife, Noor Abdalla, gave birth alone in New York while Khalil was held in a detention center in Louisiana. Khalil, known for his activism during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, was arrested in March and his green-card status revoked. An immigration judge ruled he was eligible for deportation due to his activism, labeling him a threat to U.S. foreign policy. His legal team is appealing the ruling and has filed a federal lawsuit claiming his arrest was unconstitutional. Khalil may be deported to Syria or Algeria. His case is part of a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on international students and academics involved in activism, with other high-profile detentions also reported.

The Greenland system enables tracking, sharing of idle resources, and reallocation of GPUs from underperforming projects.

The Greenland system enables tracking, sharing of idle resources, and reallocation of GPUs from underperforming projects. These measures, along with tightened approval protocols and strategic prioritization, helped Amazon regain control of its internal GPU supply chain.\n\nBy late 2024, Amazon\u2019s retail unit forecasted supply improvements for 2025, expecting a surplus of GPU capacity.

These statements followed a Politburo meeting focused on sustaining growth despite slowing exports. China has retaliated with import duties of 125% on U.S. products and rejected claims that any negotiations are currently underway. Officials criticized the U.S.'s tariff strategy as detrimental to global trade norms. Despite concerns, China remains optimistic about achieving its 5% growth target for 2025, supported by internal measures such as increased urbanization, domestic demand stimulation, and reduced reliance on U.S. energy and agricultural imports. The central bank signaled readiness to cut interest rates and adjust reserve requirements if necessary.

In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and imposed export controls on certain rare earth elements critical to high-tech and defense industries. The WTO confirmed receipt of China's request for consultations, which marks the first step in the dispute resolution process.

Despite the miss, this represents a 22% increase from A$101.2 million a year earlier. The shortfall in estimates was attributed to lower market pricing for rare earths and heightened global trade volatility. Specifically, recent policy shifts and tariffs from both the United States and China have disrupted the flow of rare earth materials between the two nations, significantly impacting the market. Lynas warned that market instability is likely to persist into the June 2025 quarter due to the ongoing impact of new global tariffs and China's export restrictions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745797012.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/trumps-low-pain-threshold-limits-economic-damage-2025-04-28/","title":"Breakingviews: Trump's low pain threshold limits economic damage","snippet":"President Donald Trump's low tolerance for economic disruption is acting as a limiting factor on the potential damage his policies could cause. He has shown a tendency to reverse course when faced with negative financial market reactions, notably pausing tariffs and refraining from firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after markets slumped. Trump's focus on market performance, which he equates with his economic success, makes him sensitive to stock and bond declines and their implications for government borrowing and tax policy. His trade war with China, once aggressive, has softened under political and corporate pressure, particularly from retailers concerned about consumer impact. On the domestic front, Trump is battling legal and institutional resistance to his efforts to sideline traditional checks and balances, with pushback from courts, universities, and law firms. Despite support for some policies, such as on immigration, public opinion strongly favors adherence to legal norms. His tendency to blink under economic or political pressure acts as a check on unilateral power, with markets, judicial rulings, and impending elections serving as imperfect yet effective constraints on potentially disruptive policies.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745835179.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/","title":"China hits back at US tariffs with export controls on key rare earths","snippet":"China placed export restrictions on rare earth elements on Friday as part of its sweeping response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743724800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-rare-earth-exports-grind-halt-trade-war-controls-bite-2025-04-11/","title":"China's rare earth exports grind to a halt as trade war controls bite","snippet":"Shipments of seven rare earths placed on an export control list last week by Beijing have ground to halt, three sources said, raising the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744329600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china-impose-tariffs-34-all-us-goods-april-10-2025-04-04/","title":"China strikes back at Trump with own tariffs, export curbs - Reuters","snippet":"China imposes extra 34% tariffs on all US goods from April 10; China puts export restrictions on some rare earths from April 4; China adds 11 ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743724800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/tech-bank-stocks-bear-brunt-china-retaliates-trump-tariffs-2025-04-04/","title":"Tesla, chips, and banks tumble as China's retaliation stokes fears of ...","snippet":"China slapped additional duties of 34% on U.S. goods, set to go into effect April 10.

In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and imposed export controls on certain rare earth elements critical to high-tech and defense industries. The WTO confirmed receipt of China's request for consultations, which marks the first step in the dispute resolution process. If both parties fail to reach an agreement within 60 days, China may escalate the matter to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body.

The RCEP includes countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and members of ASEAN, and aims to reduce trade barriers and facilitate business among the member nations. The agreement, encompassing 30% of the world's economic output, symbolizes China's growing influence and the decline of American dominance in the region. With the RCEP, companies within the member nations will benefit from lower tariffs and streamlined processes, giving them an advantage over non-members like the U.S.\n\nThis agreement presents challenges for the U.S., which had withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) under President Trump, losing leverage to influence China's trade practices and standards. Experts suggest the U.S. needs to re-engage with its allies to counter China's growing economic influence and consider rejoining multilateral trade agreements. The RCEP may compel the Biden administration to re-evaluate its trade policies in the Asia-Pacific region to avoid falling behind in this economically significant area.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1605611208.0,"attribution":"Time"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68103ba442288007941c37450ee0c093","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"e60cbeff-8f14-46b8-9b36-365c76f727db","request_id":"937b6c33e8b6fd2b-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e60cbeff-8f14-46b8-9b36-365c76f727db","children":["19d1d811-048f-453b-b73a-3d7d8059ccdd"]},"19d1d811-048f-453b-b73a-3d7d8059ccdd":{"id":"19d1d811-048f-453b-b73a-3d7d8059ccdd","message":{"id":"19d1d811-048f-453b-b73a-3d7d8059ccdd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745894351.621752,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting a strategy for Singapore","content":"I\u2019ve gathered my sources: PIIE PDF discussing a $186bn gain and others on Singapore\u2019s digital economy.

On American campuses, a wave of antisemitic incidents linked to Gaza-war demonstrations has prompted extraordinary visa cancellations and has begun to empty graduate programmes of the foreign talent that fuels frontier laboratories.

Canada has shown a swift transition from attempting diplomatic charm with Trump to taking a firm retaliatory stance, which gained significant public approval. Prime Minister Mark Carney's more confrontational rhetoric has led to a dramatic polling surge, turning support away from Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who previously boasted of negotiating with Trump. In Australia, Peter Dutton\u2019s similar claims about leveraging U.S. ties to bypass tariffs have become liabilities rather than strengths, with former leaders cautioning against trusting Trump. The broader implication highlights a global lesson\u2014firm resistance, rather than appeasement, yields better political and economic outcomes in dealing with Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies. Meanwhile, other major U.S. trading partners like China and Japan show growing disdain for negotiating under Trump's terms, with retaliatory tariffs largely avoided to prevent self-inflicted damage.

While targeting American firms might be counterproductive, China's significant influence over the tech supply chains of U.S. Asian allies like Japan and South Korea puts companies like Toyota and Samsung in a vulnerable position. This threat could be enough to dissuade these nations from actively supporting U.S. measures against China.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1734342353.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mfa.gov.sg","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Statements-Transcripts-and-Photos/2024/02/FM-COS-2025-Speech","title":"FM COS Speech - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore","snippet":"Speech by Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan during the Committee of Supply Debate, 3 March 2025. 03 March 2025.

This move addresses security concerns and was supported by Congress, which authorized an auction for advanced 5G wireless spectrum in the AWS-3 band to meet consumer demand. Previously, the FCC returned about 200 AWS-3 licenses due to payment defaults from some auction winners. Removals are estimated to cost $4.98 billion, but only $1.9 billion had been approved before this auction. Chair Brendan Carr emphasized that not addressing the funding shortfall would expose networks to security risks. The FCC also discussed auctioning additional mid-band spectrum in the Upper C-band, considering the impact on airplane altimeters, with collaboration from telecom and airline sectors to ensure safe

Promising an \"America First\" agenda focused on ending wars, securing borders, and establishing fair trade, Trump has instead implemented erratic policies including threats of annexations, imposition of global trade tariffs, and strained alliances. His administration has failed to secure peace deals in Ukraine and the Middle East, while attempts to engage adversaries like Russia and China have largely faltered. Allies have been unsettled by Trump's transactional and imperialistic rhetoric, with countries like Canada and Europe responding critically. Efforts to use power politics for diplomacy have produced limited success, such as increased foreign investment and stronger border security with Mexico and Canada. Trump\u2019s new initiatives aim to reduce reliance on China and re-shore vital industries, but peace efforts and trade deals remain elusive. Critics argue that he undermines trust built over decades and promotes instability, as key allies distance themselves. Despite internal confidence in eventual gains, Trump's impulsive approach and unmet promises have led to declining approval ratings and rising skepticism at home and abroad.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745931600.0,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517","title":"Trump's Plan for NATO Is Emerging - POLITICO","snippet":"Donald Trump has threatened to leave NATO so many times \u2014 or has appeared to, anyway \u2014 that for many of his critics, it's a question of when ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1719878400.0,"attribution":"Politico"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/columbia-university-trump-administration-review-federal-contracts-00209900","title":"Columbia University faces Trump administration review of federal ...","snippet":"The Trump administration said Monday that it had launched a review of federal grants and contracts with Columbia University over allegations the school failed ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1740960000.0,"attribution":"Politico"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/","title":"US starts collecting Trump's 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms","snippet":"US starts collecting Trump's 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms \u00b7 Trump's tariffs impact global markets, causing $5 trillion loss in S&P 500 ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743811200.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/analysis-can-diversity-inclusion-survive-trumps-war-woke-2025-02-17/","title":"Analysis: Can diversity and inclusion survive Trump's war on 'woke'","snippet":"On Inauguration Day, Donald Trump launched a slew of executive orders revoking liberal policies, from transgender rights to Biden administration ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1739750400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/inside-trumps-plan-mass-deportations-who-wants-stop-him-2024-11-06/","title":"Inside Trump's plan for mass deportations - and who wants to stop him","snippet":"Donald Trump is expected to mobilize agencies across the US government to help him deport record numbers of immigrants.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1730851200.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-foreign-policy-rethink-nato-troops-mexico-end-ukraine-war-2024-11-25/","title":"Trump's foreign policy: buy Greenland and end the Ukraine war","snippet":"Trump cut defense funding to NATO during the latter part of his first term ...

Ideologically anchored in \u201cAmerica-First\u201d mercantilism** | \u2022 Imposed a *universal 10 % tariff* within 75 days of inauguration, ignoring WTO rules and allied pleas \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201  <br>\u2022 Resurrected talk of replacing NAFTA-2.0 with bilateral \u201ctribute deals.\u201d | First-term tariffs were framed as bargaining chips; this time they are a *doctrine*, applied even to close partners (UK, Australia, Canada). |\n| **2.  Culture-war maximalist** | \u2022 Inaugural-day executive-order package scrapped Biden-era DEI mandates and transgender protections \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201. <br>\u2022 Created a White House \u201cOffice of Anti-Woke Review\u201d to police federal grants; Harvard and Columbia now face funding probes \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search11\ue201. | Rhetoric has morphed from rally slogans into sustained federal policymaking aimed at universities, media and even Fortune 500 boards. |\n| **3.  Uninhibited toward allies** | \u2022 Publicly threatened to leave NATO unless Europe funds \u201cback dues,\u201d and floated troop withdrawals from Korea and Germany \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search10\ue201. <br>\u2022 Suggested annexing Greenland and Panama Canal zones, alarming close partners \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201. | First-term advisers (Mattis, Tillerson) often moderated impulses; the second-term team is stacked with *Project 2025* loyalists who share the hard line. |\n| **4.  Zero-sum, \u201cwin-lose\u201d mindset intensified** | \u2022 Sets numeric targets\u2014*\u201cone million deportations\u201d* in the first year \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201\u2014and frames them as score-keeping. <br>\u2022 Celebrates allied market losses after tariff shocks (\u201c*the market has spoken*\u201d). | The instinct for victory metrics was visible in 2018 trade fights; now it permeates every portfolio, including science visas and development aid. |\n| **5.  \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d brinkmanship\u2014on steroids** | \u2022 Opens negotiations with maximalist threats (e.g., 60 % retaliatory tariff \u201cunless Europe bans Chinese EVs\u201d); then extracts concessions through waivers. <br>\u2022 Signals comfort with *controlled chaos*: abrupt policy reversals keep counterparts off-balance \ue200cite\ue202turn0news38\ue201. | Fewer institutional guard-rails: civil-service protections weakened by Schedule F revival; NSC and Treasury leadership personally loyal to Trump. |\n\n---\n\n#### Psychological sub-text (inferred from public behaviour)\n\n| Dimension | Evident markers |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Dominance & extraversion** | Rallies, social-media \u201cdirectives,\u201d public shaming of allies; thrives on high-conflict settings. |\n| **Narcissistic sensitivity** | Quick to reward personal flattery (e.g., Saudi praise on tariffs) and to punish perceived disrespect (Harvard \u201cjoke\u201d remarks). |\n| **High risk-tolerance** | Willing to trigger stock-market swings and WTO litigation as *credible threats*; sees volatility as leverage, not liability. |\n| **Transactional world-view** | Alliances treated as business contracts: *\u201cPay up or we walk.\u201d* No intrinsic value placed on shared history or norms. |\n\n---\n\n### Implications for counterparties (Singapore included)\n\n1. **Never look option-less** \u2013 Trump\u2019s negotiating heuristic is to *squeeze visible weakness.* Maintain well-publicised fall-backs (RCEP, EU digital pacts, sovereign cloud options).  \n2. **Anchor on *tangible* U.S. wins** \u2013 Frame proposals in jobs, tariff revenue, or defence-burden numbers that he can declare victory on.  \n3. **Deploy personalised diplomacy** \u2013 Public compliments, rapid follow-up calls, and visible implementation feed his need for adulation and momentum.  \n4. **Expect rapid mood swings** \u2013 Build \u201csnap-back clauses\u201d and time-boxed review windows into any agreement.  \n5. **Keep alliances compartmentalised** \u2013 Separate defence (Changi access) from trade or tech talks; a clash in one area need not poison the whole relationship.\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s second-term *political personality* is a **more doctrinaire, more zero-sum, more institution-stripping version** of his first.  The through-lines\u2014tariff fundamentalism, cultural-war offensives, and transactional ally management\u2014have hardened into core ideology, reinforced by an inner circle that shares his instincts rather than restrains them.  For small states like Singapore, the task is not to *change* this personality but to **game-theorise around it**: be visibly self-reliant, package proposals in Trump-friendly optics, and keep multiple exit doors ajar."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201","start_idx":415,"end_idx":447,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/22/trump-trade-tariffs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com),

Promising an \"America First\" agenda focused on ending wars, securing borders, and establishing fair trade, Trump has instead implemented erratic policies including threats of annexations, imposition of global trade tariffs, and strained alliances. His administration has failed to secure peace deals in Ukraine and the Middle East, while attempts to engage adversaries like Russia and China have largely faltered. Allies have been unsettled by Trump's transactional and imperialistic rhetoric, with countries like Canada and Europe responding critically. Efforts to use power politics for diplomacy have produced limited success, such as increased foreign investment and stronger border security with Mexico and Canada. Trump\u2019s new initiatives aim to reduce reliance on China and re-shore vital industries, but peace efforts and trade deals remain elusive. Critics argue that he undermines trust built over decades and promotes instability, as key allies distance themselves. Despite internal confidence in eventual gains, Trump's impulsive approach and unmet promises have led to declining approval ratings and rising skepticism at home and abroad.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Politico"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":4646,"end_idx":4646,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"US starts collecting Trump's 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Trump vows massive new tariffs if elected, risking global economic war","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/22/trump-trade-tariffs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"The Washington Post"},{"title":"Trump says Harvard has 'lost its way,' doesn't deserve federal funding","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-lashes-out-joke-harvard-after-cutting-federal-funds-lost-its-way?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Fox News"},{"title":"Columbia University faces Trump administration review of federal ...","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/columbia-university-trump-administration-review-federal-contracts-00209900?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Politico"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-starts-collecting-trumps-new-10-tariff-smashing-global-trade-norms-2025-04-05/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/22/trump-trade-tariffs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/analysis-can-diversity-inclusion-survive-trumps-war-woke-2025-02-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-lashes-out-joke-harvard-after-cutting-federal-funds-lost-its-way?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/columbia-university-trump-administration-review-federal-contracts-00209900?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-foreign-policy-rethink-nato-troops-mexico-end-ukraine-war-2024-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-foreign-policy-rethink-nato-troops-mexico-end-ukraine-war-2024-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/inside-trumps-plan-mass-deportations-who-wants-stop-him-2024-11-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/12/one-million-deportations-goal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/29/trump-vows-wars-trade-delivered-00314664?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"citations":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"32cc5d0c-519b-478b-bc5f-80b944aa4c9a","request_id":"93850b955cea448f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"32cc5d0c-519b-478b-bc5f-80b944aa4c9a","children":["64db4207-e696-4d22-80fd-dbb3e8695929"]},"64db4207-e696-4d22-80fd-dbb3e8695929":{"id":"64db4207-e696-4d22-80fd-dbb3e8695929","message":{"id":"64db4207-e696-4d22-80fd-dbb3e8695929","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1746674706.781,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Any emerging crisis in America seems to be the accelerating brain drain particularly in science and in the technology sector.

Unveiled at Sorbonne University in Paris, the \"Choose Europe\" initiative offers substantial incentives, such as \"super grants,\" longer contracts, and relocation bonuses, through the European Council Research. This move coincides with the Trump administration's freezing and slashing of billions in federal research funding, sparking concerns in the U.S. about a potential brain drain and diminished global scientific leadership. Without naming the U.S. directly, von der Leyen criticized the cuts, calling them a \"gigantic miscalculation\" and emphasized Europe\u2019s commitment to scientific freedom. Experts warn that the abrupt halt in U.S. funding jeopardizes major medical research projects and threatens long-term innovation, with some universities like Harvard and Princeton already facing severe grant suspensions.

Judge Michael Farbiarz instructed the administration to disclose all past cases where the immigration law cited against Khalil has been used and to clarify Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s rationale that Khalil poses a foreign policy risk. Arrested in March without charges, Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident, is accused of creating a hostile environment for Jewish students through his activism. His attorneys argue that his actions do not pose foreign policy threats and are protected under free speech. Legal experts note the lack of precedent for using this law in such a manner, referencing a 1995 case as the only known instance. The judge has temporarily blocked Khalil\u2019s deportation as constitutional questions are reviewed. The case highlights broader efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on pro-Palestinian activism amid tensions over the Gaza conflict.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746645943.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-harvard-rejects-trump-demands-columbia-still-talks-over-federal-funding-2025-04-15/","title":"After Harvard rejects US demands, Trump adds new threat | Reuters","snippet":"Columbia, a private school in New York City, agreed to negotiations over demands to tighten its protest rules after the Trump administration ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744761600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-homeland-security-chief-cancels-two-grants-harvard-university-2025-04-17/","title":"Trump administration says Harvard may lose ability to enroll foreign ...","snippet":"Trump has threatened universities with funding cuts over pro-Palestinian protests that he calls antisemitic \u00b7 Human rights advocates have raised ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744848000.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.state.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.state.gov/report/custom/2f989377f9-3/","title":"Custom Report Excerpts - Department of State","snippet":"Authorities dismissed hundreds of state employees who expressed political dissent or participated in protests after the presidential election, including ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"U.S. Department of State"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.state.gov/report/custom/5429d01629/","title":"Custom Report Excerpts - State Department","snippet":"The unrest was marked by violence, looting, arson, and large-scale destruction of property.

Administration Immigration Policies Are Pushing International Students Away from the United States, Experts Say","snippet":"The Trump administration's recent immigration policies have led to a chilling effect on international students in the U.S., prompting many to reconsider or abandon plans to study in the country. With the revocation of over 1,800 student visas due to minor infractions or politically charged activities, fears among current and prospective international students are intensifying. Incidents such as the removal of a Turkish graduate student have gone viral, increasing anxiety and discouraging enrollment. International students are crucial to U.S. higher education, representing 6% of students and significantly supporting STEM fields and university finances through higher tuition. Despite some visa revocations being reversed following lawsuits, the administration\u2019s new guidelines expand ICE's authority, making visa holders vulnerable to sudden deportations. Students now feel unsafe, suppress their identities, and avoid political expression online, fearing repercussions. Colleges, while sympathetic, have limited power against federal immigration enforcements.

Various enforcement actions, including detentions, deportations, and legal proceedings, have targeted not only undocumented immigrants but also visa and green-card holders, students, scientists, and even U.S. citizens. Many individuals, especially those linked to pro-Palestinian protests or critical of U.S. foreign policy, found themselves detained without due process or deported under questionable legal justifications. Students from institutions like Columbia and Tufts, along with professionals from countries such as Iran, Palestine, and Russia, were apprehended in sweeping ICE operations, often based on vague or unsubstantiated claims. The administration reversed some mass visa terminations after legal challenges but continued to detain and deport individuals using outdated or obscure laws. Shocking incidents include U.S. citizens receiving deportation threats and children being removed with deported parents, facing criticism from judges for violating constitutional protections. Detentions extended even to international visitors and artists, with some speculating political motivations behind their treatment. The wave of actions, characterized by a disregard for due process and civil liberties, has raised alarms about authoritarian overreach and systemic violations of human rights.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746643222.0,"attribution":"The Guardian"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.chronicle.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-has-revoked-student-visas-at-dozens-of-colleges-heres-what-that-means","title":"Trump Has Revoked Student Visas at Dozens of Colleges.

Various enforcement actions, including detentions, deportations, and legal proceedings, have targeted not only undocumented immigrants but also visa and green-card holders, students, scientists, and even U.S. citizens. Many individuals, especially those linked to pro-Palestinian protests or critical of U.S. foreign policy, found themselves detained without due process or deported under questionable legal justifications. Students from institutions like Columbia and Tufts, along with professionals from countries such as Iran, Palestine, and Russia, were apprehended in sweeping ICE operations, often based on vague or unsubstantiated claims. The administration reversed some mass visa terminations after legal challenges but continued to detain and deport individuals using outdated or obscure laws. Shocking incidents include U.S. citizens receiving deportation threats and children being removed with deported parents, facing criticism from judges for violating constitutional protections. Detentions extended even to international visitors and artists, with some speculating political motivations behind their treatment.
