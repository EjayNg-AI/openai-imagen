The decision by the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA), announced at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, reflects the heightened frequency of military activities and rising tensions among global powers. Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles noted that Australia will contribute F-35 Joint Strike Fighters for the first time in the Bersama Lima exercise, an annual drill involving the five nations. New Zealand will send a P-8 Poseidon aircraft, highlighting the advanced capabilities being incorporated into the exercises. These efforts are aimed at enhancing cooperative defense without directly targeting China, despite regional strategic interests. Additionally, Britain plans to send an aircraft carrier to the region in 2025, coordinating with the FPDA's exercise programs. The exercises will feature non-conventional elements such as drones, further increasing their complexity and ambition.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":1037,"end_idx":1038,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1038,"end_idx":1039,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Five powers plan bigger, deeper Asia military drills","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/five-powers-plan-bigger-deeper-asia-military-drills-2024-05-31/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1717140341.0,"snippet":"Australia, Britain, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore have agreed to stage more complex military drills in the region this year involving drones, fifth-generation fighter planes and surveillance ai...","attribution_segments":["685-0"],"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Five powers plan bigger, deeper Asia military drills -
