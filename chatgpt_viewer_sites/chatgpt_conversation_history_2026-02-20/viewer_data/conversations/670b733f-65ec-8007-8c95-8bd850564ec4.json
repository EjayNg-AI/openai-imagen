Unfortunately, Google Drive doesn't have a built-in \"copy folder\" function, so you'll need to use a workaround to copy all the contents to your own Drive.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step process:\n\n### Method 1: Using Google Drive Web Interface\n\n1. **Open the Shared Folder**: Navigate to the Google Drive folder that you want to clone.\n   \n2. **Select All Files**: Inside the folder, press `Ctrl + A` (Windows) or `Cmd + A` (Mac) to select all the files and subfolders.\n\n3. **Right-click and Select 'Make a Copy'**: Once all the items are selected, right-click on them and select \"Make a Copy.\" This will create duplicate copies of all the files in the shared folder and place them in the root directory of your Google Drive.\n\n4. **Move the Copies into a New Folder**:\n   - Go to your Google Drive's root folder where the copies have been created (they will have names starting with \"Copy of ...\").\n   - Select all the copied files, right-click, and choose \"Move to\" > \"New Folder.\" Name the new folder as you like and confirm the move.\n\nThis method works well if the number of files and folders is manageable. However, if there are a large number of files, it can be a bit slow.\n\n### Method 2: Using Google Colab (for large or complex folders)\n\nIf you have a large folder or many subfolders, using **Google Colab** can make the process more efficient. Here's how:\n\n1. **Open Google Colab**:\n   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n\n2. **Mount Google Drive**:\n   In a Colab notebook, run the following code to mount your Google Drive:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import drive\n   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n   ```\n\n   This will prompt you to authorize Google Colab to access your Drive.\n\n3. **Copy the Folder**:\n   You can now use shell commands to copy the folder and all its contents. Here\u2019s an example of how to copy a shared folder (replace `source_folder_id` with the actual folder ID from the shared folder link):\n\n   ```python\n   !cp -r /content/drive/MyDrive/shared_folder_path /content/drive/MyDrive/destination_folder_path\n   ```\n\n   This command recursively copies all files and subfolders from the shared folder to your own Google Drive.\n\n4. **Check the Results**:\n   After the copy process is complete, navigate to your Google Drive and verify that the folder was cloned successfully.\n\nThis method is more efficient for large folders or for folders with complex structures, especially when working with many files."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"e038de38-9db2-49e0-8c8b-5eaa1fae2cbe","request_id":"8d1d87eb98b68950-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e038de38-9db2-49e0-8c8b-5eaa1fae2cbe","children":["aaa28233-c217-4395-96b1-331c675a4dbe"]},"aaa28233-c217-4395-96b1-331c675a4dbe":{"id":"aaa28233-c217-4395-96b1-331c675a4dbe","message":{"id":"aaa28233-c217-4395-96b1-331c675a4dbe","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728803766.802267,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Can i key in the directory path like this: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PpievMLtrakCb_HifYeevf-BFpyVJwWy"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8d1d8ad47d8e8950-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"94e29933-826e-452b-b086-bf050584ca2d","children":["a3d45cfb-bb1a-442f-8de4-ceb72afdbe61"]},"a3d45cfb-bb1a-442f-8de4-ceb72afdbe61":{"id":"a3d45cfb-bb1a-442f-8de4-ceb72afdbe61","message":{"id":"a3d45cfb-bb1a-442f-8de4-ceb72afdbe61","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728803778.528052,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["In Google Colab, you cannot directly use a URL like `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/...` as a directory path. However, you can extract the **folder ID** from the URL and use it to access the folder via the Google Drive filesystem after mounting it.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Extract the Folder ID**:\n   From the URL you provided, the folder ID is `1PpievMLtrakCb_HifYeevf-BFpyVJwWy`. This is the unique identifier for the folder on Google Drive.\n\n2. **Mount Google Drive**:\n   In your Google Colab notebook, you need to mount your Google Drive first:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import drive\n   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n   ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the Folder**:\n   Once the Drive is mounted, you can navigate to the folder using its folder path. Unfortunately, you can't use the URL directly, but once mounted, you can find the folder in the `Shared with me` section of your Google Drive or access it using the folder's ID.\n\n   Here's how you can do that:\n\n   - First, list the contents of your shared folders to identify the right path:\n\n     ```bash\n     !ls \"/content/drive/My Drive\"\n     ```\n\n   - If you know the exact path, you can directly use it, or navigate step by step to identify the correct folder structure.\n\n4. **Copy the Folder Using its Path**:\n   Once you have located the folder's path, you can copy it to your own Drive:\n\n   ```python\n   !cp -r \"/content/drive/My Drive/shared_folder_path\" \"/content/drive/My Drive/destination_folder\"\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `shared_folder_path` with the actual path of the folder you are cloning, and `destination_folder` with the path where you want to copy the folder.\n\n### Tips for Locating the Folder\n\nIf the folder is shared with you, it may be under `Shared with me` and not directly accessible from the root of your drive (`My Drive`). Unfortunately, Google Drive's `Shared with me` section is not directly accessible through Colab. You will have to manually drag it to your `My Drive` from the Google Drive interface, after which you can proceed with the above steps in Colab.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further clarification!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa28233-c217-4395-96b1-331c675a4dbe","request_id":"8d1d8ad47d8e8950-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa28233-c217-4395-96b1-331c675a4dbe","children":["aaa21375-0380-4e4d-bb68-2e50284d0401"]},"aaa21375-0380-4e4d-bb68-2e50284d0401":{"id":"aaa21375-0380-4e4d-bb68-2e50284d0401","message":{"id":"aaa21375-0380-4e4d-bb68-2e50284d0401","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728804197.292487,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How do I  manually drag a folder under \"Shared with me\" to the My Drive from the Google Drive interface"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8d1d9557182d8950-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a3d45cfb-bb1a-442f-8de4-ceb72afdbe61","children":["23a28ba0-3d31-46ec-9c76-6d5a26e1a441"]},"23a28ba0-3d31-46ec-9c76-6d5a26e1a441":{"id":"23a28ba0-3d31-46ec-9c76-6d5a26e1a441","message":{"id":"23a28ba0-3d31-46ec-9c76-6d5a26e1a441","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1728804207.711521,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's how you can manually drag a folder from the \"Shared with me\" section to \"My Drive\" in Google Drive:\n\n### Steps to Move a Shared Folder to \"My Drive\"\n\n1. **Open Google Drive**:\n   - Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and make sure you're logged into the account where the folder is shared with you.\n\n2. **Go to \"Shared with me\"**:\n   - On the left sidebar of Google Drive, click on **\"Shared with me\"**.
