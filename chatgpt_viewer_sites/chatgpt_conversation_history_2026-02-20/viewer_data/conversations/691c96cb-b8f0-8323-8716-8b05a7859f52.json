I\u2019ll focus on offering precise analysis while carefully suggesting plausible directions for future research, including open problems in unbounded derived categories, triangulated categories, and related work by Neeman, Krause, and others. All without overstepping the current understanding.\n\n**Exploring Brown representability in \u221e-categories and triangulated categories**\n\nIn stable \u221e-categories, like those in Lurie\u2019s Higher Topos Theory, the Brown representability theorem (BRT) applies to compactly generated or accessible presentable categories. In triangulated categories, it applies to cohomological functors. The enriched version for stable \u221e-categories involves exact functors F: C\u1d52\u1d56 -> spectra, with similar representability criteria.\n\n**Clarifying Brown and Adams representability in cohomology theories**\n\nThe original Brown representability (1962) applies to cohomology theories represented by a pointed CW complex, capturing how homotopy-invariant functors behave with coproducts and homotopy pushouts. Adams representability, in contrast, concerns functors from the stable homotopy category. I\u2019ll define a few necessary abbreviations to keep things precise.\n\n**Exploring Brown representability in algebraic geometry and triangulated categories**\n\nIn algebraic geometry, Brown representability applies to derived categories of sheaves and schemes, with important results regarding compactly generated categories for quasi-compact schemes. It's used to construct adjoints and show generation by a single perfect complex. In triangulated categories, it relates to Hom functors and adjoints to exact functors.\n\n**Clarifying Brown representability in duals and stable \u221e-categories**\n\nBrown representability for covariant functors doesn't always hold without strong conditions, as seen in Neeman's counterexamples. For stable \u221e-categories, I need to emphasize the role of presentability and how functors preserving colimits/limits are representable. Classical Brown apply to CW complexes; the stable version involves spectra.\n\n**Clarifying Brown and Adams representability in algebraic geometry and \u221e-categories**\n\nBrown representability applies to exact functors in compactly generated categories, ensuring right adjoints, such as in Grothendieck duality. I should mention negative results like dual Brown failing for some categories, and Neeman's contributions. Adams representability is stronger but fails without strong conditions, like in well-generated categories or under Vop\u011bnka's principle.\n\n**Exploring Brown representability and related research directions**\n\nResearch directions in \u221e-categorical and spectral algebraic geometry include enriched functors, Brown representability in equivariant and motivic stable homotopy, and pro-categories. Topics include t-structures, gluing, and the telescope conjecture. There's also potential study of phantom maps and their effect on Adams representability, especially in algebraic geometry.\n\n**Exploring Brown representability and related open questions**\n\nThere are open questions about cocomplete well-generated triangulated categories that are not phantomless but satisfy Adams representability. Dual Brown representability is more delicate and refers to categories with products and compact generation. Other directions include Brown representability in noncommutative motives, parametrized \u221e-categories, and implications of large-cardinal axioms.\n\n**Summarizing key representability concepts**\n\nTo clarify: Classical Brown representability links cohomology theories to CW complexes or spectra. The stable version works with the stable homotopy category. Adams representability relates cohomological functors to objects, and for morphisms, it holds where phantom maps are absent. Definitions like \"well-generated\" and \"cohomological functors\" are essential for precise statements.\n\n**Clarifying Adams representability for triangulated categories**\n\nAdams representability holds in compactly generated triangulated categories when dealing with objects. For morphisms, it holds if the category is phantomless. For cohomological functors, an extension can be considered with Brown representability. The focus here is on giving precise definitions, research directions, and open questions, especially related to algebraic geometry and \u221e-categories.\n\n**Exploring Brown representability and research directions**\n\nIn stable \u221e-categories, Brown representability holds when a functor preserves small products and is exact. There are open questions about Brown representability in non-well-generated triangulated categories, equivariant motivic homotopy theory, and pro-categories. There's also potential research on Brown representability in operator algebras and analyzing the applicability to derived analytic geometry and modular representations.\n\n**Researching Brown representability and open problems**\n\nI\u2019m considering several research topics on Brown representability, such as dual representability for certain categories, Adams representability in motivic categories, and the interaction between Brown representability and t-structures. I also have open questions about classifying when Brown representability holds, especially under conditions like gluing and descent. Some problems involve chromatic localization categories and pro-motivic stable homotopy categories. There\u2019s also a need for precise definitions and distinctions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 20m 30s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-151aaa69-f9bd-4e96-9420-1c89ead2ed83:IN","parent_id":"281cd4ae-f68b-4a07-8435-64156ebe3c6d","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":30,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_691c96cd627c8191a044d1fc91b94280","async_task_conversation_id":"691c96cd-62b8-8324-8ad6-7f8e680e5041","async_task_created_at":"2025-11-18T15:54:53.892460Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"281cd4ae-f68b-4a07-8435-64156ebe3c6d","request_id":"151aaa69-f9bd-4e96-9420-1c89ead2ed83","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","turn_exchange_id":"892a545c-4d81-4e8d-a6fc-c177da704c83","timestamp_":"absolute","finished_duration_sec":1230,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"281cd4ae-f68b-4a07-8435-64156ebe3c6d","children":["0d89b3a7-a6d1-4cb5-a297-3eacd4ec3518"]},"0d89b3a7-a6d1-4cb5-a297-3eacd4ec3518":{"id":"0d89b3a7-a6d1-4cb5-a297-3eacd4ec3518","message":{"id":"0d89b3a7-a6d1-4cb5-a297-3eacd4ec3518","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763481294.2616708,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"async_task_id":"promode_691c96cd627c8191a044d1fc91b94280","async_task_type":"pro_mode","request_id":"151aaa69-f9bd-4e96-9420-1c89ead2ed83","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"a3fd5d9b-431d-4653-9927-79fe1f8e78db","turn_exchange_id":"892a545c-4d81-4e8d-a6fc-c177da704c83","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a3fd5d9b-431d-4653-9927-79fe1f8e78db","children":["a111f8f0-463b-48cf-997a-bc98bf501939"]},"a111f8f0-463b-48cf-997a-bc98bf501939":{"id":"a111f8f0-463b-48cf-997a-bc98bf501939","message":{"id":"a111f8f0-463b-48cf-997a-bc98bf501939","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763482524.753659,"update_time":1763481982.344125,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is a compact \u201catlas\u201d of Brown representability across the settings you named, followed by what I see as the most promising directions and concrete open (or only-partially-resolved) problems.\n\n> **Abbreviations used.**  \n> **BR** = Brown representability for *contravariant cohomological* functors.  \n> **BR\\*** = the **dual** Brown representability for *covariant homological* functors.  \n> **T** = a triangulated category.  \n> **Sp** = the \u221e\u2011category of spectra.  \n> **\\(D_{\\mathrm{qc}}(X)\\)** = the unbounded derived category of quasi\u2011coherent sheaves on a scheme/stack \\(X\\).  \n> **HTT/HA** = Lurie\u2019s *Higher Topos Theory* / *Higher Algebra*.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Classical homotopy theory & algebraic topology\n\n**Brown\u2019s original theorem (CW complexes).**  \nIf \\(F\\colon \\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathrm{CW}_* )^{op}\\to \\mathbf{Set}\\) is a contravariant functor that (i) sends coproducts (wedges) to products and (ii) sends homotopy pushouts to pullbacks (Mayer\u2013Vietoris), then \\(F\\) is representable: \\(F(-)\\cong[-,Y]\\) for some pointed CW complex \\(Y\\).

This viewpoint is the precursor of the modern stable (triangulated/\u221e\u2011categorical) statements below. A good survey of the classical-to-axiomatic bridge is in Hovey\u2013Palmieri\u2013Strickland (HPS). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n**Variants beyond sets.**  \nThere are BR\u2011type results for space\u2011valued or spectrum\u2011valued functors (representability up to homotopy), notably in work of Jardine and of Blanc\u2013Chorny. These replace exactness axioms on \\(\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathrm{CW}_*)\\) by homotopy\u2011invariant axioms in model/\u221e\u2011categorical settings. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search1\ue202turn10search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 2) BR in triangulated categories (axiomatic stable homotopy)\n\n**Neeman\u2013HPS version (cohomological BR).**  \nLet \\(T\\) be a triangulated category with small coproducts that is compactly generated (or, more generally, well generated). Any **cohomological** functor \\(H\\colon T^{op}\\to \\mathbf{Ab}\\) that sends coproducts to products is representable: \\(H\\cong \\mathrm{Hom}_T(-,X)\\) for some \\(X\\in T\\). A key corollary: if \\(F\\colon T\\to T'\\) is exact and preserves all coproducts, then \\(F\\) has a right adjoint. (This is the triangulated \u201cadjoint functor theorem.\u201d) Concise statements appear in the Stacks Project, with proofs following Neeman. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n**Dual BR (BR\\*).**  \nThe dual statement\u2014homological functors \\(H\\colon T\\to \\mathbf{Ab}\\) preserving products are corepresentable \\(H\\cong \\mathrm{Hom}_T(X,-)\\)\u2014often **fails** without extra hypotheses. There are positive criteria (e.g. for certain derived/homotopy categories of complexes and for triangulated categories admitting \u201cperfect cogenerators\u201d), but BR\\* is delicate. See Neeman\u2019s \u201cBrown representability for the dual,\u201d and later work of Modoi giving formal criteria and examples. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn9search0\ue202turn9search1\ue201\n\n**Axiomatic stable homotopy & localizations.**  \nHPS place BR into an axiomatic framework for \u201cstable homotopy categories,\u201d where BR underlies existence of (co)localizations, Bousfield classes, and the telescope/smashing dichotomy (see also Krause\u2019s algebraic approach). BR is used repeatedly to manufacture adjoints to exact functors preserving (co)limits. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn13search3\ue201\n\n**Approximable triangulated categories.**  \nNeeman\u2019s recent \u201capproximable\u201d framework (single compact generator; metrics) yields two BR theorems and refines when one gets adjoints/representability in large T. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n**Failures & Adams\u2011type representability.**  \nThere are explicit failures of \u201cAdams representability\u201d (a stronger property related to reconstructing objects/morphisms from values on compacts) in derived categories of rings, and more generally failures of BR\\*; this maps the boundary of what triangulated hypotheses suffice. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3) Algebraic geometry (derived categories)\n\n**BR in \\(D_{\\mathrm{qc}}(X)\\) and Grothendieck duality.**  \nFor a quasi\u2011compact, quasi\u2011separated scheme (and many stacks), \\(D_{\\mathrm{qc}}(X)\\) is compactly generated (compacts \u2243 perfect complexes). If \\(f\\colon X\\to Y\\) is quasi\u2011compact and separated, then \\(Rf_\\*\\colon D_{\\mathrm{qc}}(X)\\to D_{\\mathrm{qc}}(Y)\\) preserves coproducts, so by BR it has a right adjoint \\(f^!\\) (a cornerstone for Grothendieck duality).

Neeman\u2019s recent work suggests a roadmap. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n### D) **BR for motivic/stable sheaf theories on large sites and stacks**\n- **Question.** For stacks and higher stacks (including spectral stacks) beyond the quasi\u2011compact/quasi\u2011separated regime: what smallness/presentability hypotheses ensure BR so that the six\u2011functor formalism exists? How far can Naumann\u2013Spitzweck\u2019s motivic BR extend?  \n- **Impact.** Would solidify duality and base\u2011change in spectral algebraic geometry and in arithmetic geometry. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201\n\n### E) **Computability/constructivity of representing objects**\n- **Problem.** Given values of a cohomological functor on a set of compact generators (and compatibility data), devise effective procedures (or obstruction theories) to build the representing object and control Postnikov towers, phantom maps, and error terms. This sits between classical Adams spectral sequences and modern \u221e\u2011categorical obstruction\u2011theory. Failures of Adams representability (Christensen\u2013Keller\u2013Neeman) show sharp boundaries to respect. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search1\ue201\n\n### F) **Interplay with smashing localizations and the telescope conjecture**\n- **Perspective.** BR provides the adjoints needed to form smashing localizations; classifying these in various geometric contexts is linked to telescope\u2011type conjectures (true in many algebraic settings, false in general for spectra; still nuanced in equivariant/motivic worlds).  \n- **Concrete tasks.** Extend Krause\u2019s algebraic strategies to new geometric contexts (derived stacks); characterize when localizations preserve/perfectly reflect compact objects, and how BR detects this. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search3\ue202turn13search6\ue201\n\n### G) **Set\u2011theory vs. ZFC: how necessary are large cardinals?**\n- **Problem.** Separate results that **genuinely** need Vop\u011bnka\u2011type assumptions from those that can be reproved in ZFC by refined accessibility/definability arguments. Progress here would clarify the logical strength of BR\u2011type statements for homotopy localizations and reflectivity. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 9) Quick \u201chow\u2011to\u201d checks in practice\n\n- **Stable \u221e\u2011categorical shortcut.** If you are in a **presentable stable** \u221e\u2011category that is compactly generated, then any exact functor \\(F\\colon \\mathcal C^{op}\\to \\mathcal S\\) (spaces) that preserves small limits is representable. This subsumes most day\u2011to\u2011day uses of BR in modern homotopy theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search5\ue201\n- **Triangulated shortcut.** If \\(T\\) is compactly (or well) generated and \\(H\\colon T^{op}\\to\\mathbf{Ab}\\) is cohomological and preserves coproducts, it is representable; to force a right adjoint to \\(F\\colon T\\to T'\\), check that \\(F\\) is exact and preserves coproducts. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n- **Geometry.** For \\(f\\colon X\\to Y\\) quasi\u2011compact/separated, \\(Rf_\\*\\) preserves coproducts on \\(D_{\\mathrm{qc}}(X)\\); apply BR to get \\(f^!\\). This is the engine behind Grothendieck duality in the unbounded derived setting. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## References you can cite right away\n\n- **Classical BR.** E. H.
