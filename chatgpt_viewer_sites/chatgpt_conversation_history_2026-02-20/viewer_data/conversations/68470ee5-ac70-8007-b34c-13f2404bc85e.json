As the twin spectre of capital flight and currency speculation descended on South Korea, the Won lost half its value. The govt had to go hat-in-hand to the IMF for a $58 billion emergency bailout. \r\n\r\nThe US Treasury-influenced IMF made Korea eat austerity like it was a spendthrift 3rd world basket case despite the fact the crisis was caused by a private-sector led liquidity freeze. Korea was in fact in excellent fiscal shape.\r\n\r\nIn national solidarity, women donated gold jewelry to pay down the debt. 200 tonnes of wedding bands, heirloom jewelries etc were collected to be melted down. But it was nothing compared to what Korea suddenly owed. \r\n\r\nKorea's social contract broke. There was no longer the expectation of lifetime employment and stability. Suicide spiked. The generation of \"IMF Kids\" who came of age after the crisis lost their faith in their national destiny. The hellish, hypercompetitive Korea of Parasite and Squid Game was all downstream from that moment.\r\n\r\nHong Kong was expected to be next. With an astronomically overvalued stock and property markets, a delicate peg to the US dollar and no way to control its own financial destiny by printing money, it look like prime pickings for the vulture of international finance. \r\n\r\nAt the time of the crisis Scott Bessent was heading Macro Strategy at George Soro's Quantum Fund. It's widely inferred that Bassent placed \"double bets\", shorting the HK Dollar as well as the Heng Seng Index. It's like throwing two babies into the air and making the Hong Kong Monetary Authority choose between which one to save. \r\n\r\nThe hunter got hunted. HKMA shocked the world, not just by increasing interest rates to 300% to torch the shorts, but also buying $15 billion worth of blue chip stocks directly to shore up the Heng Seng. Nominally it acted independently as a part of 1C2S. In reality, none of it could have happened without a quiet nod from Zhu Rongji, who also made sure the Yuan held rock steady in support.\r\n\r\nSoros' Quantum Fund suffered heavy losses in 1998, widely believed to be tied to HK-related trades.\r\n\r\nWhat was clear: the peg held, Hong Kong aura-ed up and Beijing can breath a quiet sigh of relief that they didn't have Hong Kong fall into financial disaster so soon after the handover. \r\n\r\nIt's kinda ironic that the US criticizes China for being so mercantilist and not opening up their capital markets and spending more. \r\n\r\nIt's kind of like complaining that your friends don't like going out drinking with you anymore when the last time they did, you mugged them. The more US sings the praises of financial liberalization, the harder Asian countries hoards US dollars. \r\n\r\nWell, Bessent is now US Treasury secretary and here in London today as a part of the high-stakes US China trade talks. I don't know what's going on exactly, but this I know for sure:\r\n\r\nHe remembers them...and they remember him."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"94d214ba2a42b4cd-IAD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"577fc7fe-af66-4a97-8a06-95a4765c0d86","children":["6ee0d06f-3efb-4e5f-bb6a-8e744b9042d2"]},"6ee0d06f-3efb-4e5f-bb6a-8e744b9042d2":{"id":"6ee0d06f-3efb-4e5f-bb6a-8e744b9042d2","message":{"id":"6ee0d06f-3efb-4e5f-bb6a-8e744b9042d2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1749487345.780156,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"9e698ab1-6baf-423c-b74b-f2151c762c10","request_id":"94d214ba2a42b4cd-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9e698ab1-6baf-423c-b74b-f2151c762c10","children":["0a52e061-25ab-435d-8c17-3ecb38449cbb"]},"0a52e061-25ab-435d-8c17-3ecb38449cbb":{"id":"0a52e061-25ab-435d-8c17-3ecb38449cbb","message":{"id":"0a52e061-25ab-435d-8c17-3ecb38449cbb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1749487345.780305,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating claims in user submission","content":"The user shared a detailed message about the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, including several key figures and events.

Below is a point-by-point fact check and a forward-looking analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 1  South Korea in 1997-98  \n| Claim in thread | Reality |\n|---|---|\n| **\u201c$58 bn IMF bailout\u201d** | The standby agreement Korea signed in Dec 1997 totalled **US $58 bn** (IMF + World Bank + ADB) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 |\n| **\u201cCrisis was private-sector liquidity freeze; Korea\u2019s public finances were sound\u201d** | Largely true. Korea\u2019s fiscal deficit was <2 % GDP, but **$100 bn of short-term foreign-currency corporate debt** was rolling over in a frozen market. |\n| **\u201cIMF imposed harsh austerity\u201d** | The programme did tighten fiscal/monetary policy and forced sweeping bank/corporate restructuring. Many Korean economists still judge those conditions *too* pro-cyclical for what was essentially a liquidity crisis. |\n| **Gold-donation drive of \u2018200 t\u2019** | Koreans famously turned in **\u2248227 t** of jewellery worth \u2248US $2.1 bn in early 1998\u2014symbolically powerful but <4 % of the bailout total. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 |\n\n**Social scars** \u2013 suicide rates and precarious labour contracts did spike, birthing the so-called \u201cIMF generation\u201d. The cultural link to *Parasite*/*Squid Game* is anecdotal but not far-fetched.\n\n---\n\n## 2  Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cdouble-bet\u201d showdown, 1997-98  \n| Key episode | Evidence & nuance |\n|---|---|\n| **Overnight rates hit \u201c300 %\u201d** | The HKMA allowed the **overnight interbank rate to spike to ~300 %** briefly in Oct 1997, deliberately starving speculators of HK$. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201 |\n| **US$15 bn equity intervention (Aug 1998)** | Confirmed: HKMA bought ~HK$118 bn (\u2248US$15 bn) of blue-chips and futures in Aug 1998. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201 |\n| **Mainland back-stopping the peg** | Beijing *did* keep the renminbi stable and signalled quiet support, but HKMA executed the defence autonomously under the currency-board rules. |\n\n### Soros, Bessent and the \u201cdouble play\u201d\n\n- Hedge-fund manuals of the era describe a *text-book* \u201cdouble play\u201d: short HK$ *and* short Hang Seng futures to force a policy dilemma.  \n- Scott **Bessent** was **Head of Macro Strategy/CIO** at Soros\u2019s Quantum Fund in 1998; several contemporary and recent retrospectives cite him as the architect of that trade. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search0\ue201  \n- Quantum did post heavy losses in 1998, but Soros never disclosed the exact hit from Hong Kong versus LTCM/Russia.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Is the \u201cIMF mugging\u201d analogy why Asia hoards dollars?\n\nPartly. After 1998 most Asian central banks *tripled* their FX-reserves, viewing large war-chests and, in China\u2019s case, capital controls as the price of autonomy. But the motive is as much about export-led growth models and precautionary demand as about distrust of Washington.\n\n---\n\n## 4  2025: *Rematch* in London?\n\n| Today\u2019s facts | Strategic take |\n|---|---|\n| **Scott Bessent is indeed the 79\u1d57\u02b0 U.S. Treasury Secretary (sworn-in 28 Jan 2025)** \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201 |\n| He is in London this week for high-level U.S.\u2013China talks (per press and Substack reports). \ue200cite\ue202turn13search3\ue201 |\n| HKMA just carried out its **largest FX intervention in 4\u00bd years** (HK$46.5 bn sell order on 6 May) as the HK$ hit the strong side of its trading band. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search2\ue201 |\n\n### Why both sides \u201cremember\u201d\n\n| Memory | Implication for 2025 |\n|---|---|\n| **Bessent\u2019s 1998 short** | Beijing & HK officials know his playbook; they may treat any *adverse* Treasury commentary on the peg as strategic pressure, not mere economics. |\n| **HK\u2019s 1998 victory** | HKMA\u2019s current FX reserves exceed **US $400 bn**\u2014> a repeat attack would require far deeper pockets than in 1998. |\n| **U.S. leverage** | Treasury controls dollar-clearing access and could weaponise secondary sanctions; that was not on the table in 1998. |\n| **China\u2019s toolkit** | Beyond holding >US $3 trn reserves, China now has CIPS (a SWIFT alternative) and the digital CNY to soften settlement shocks. |\n\n---\n\n## 5  Forward-looking scenarios\n\n| Risk vector | Likely 2025-26 dynamics |\n|---|---|\n| **Currency-peg pressure** | Any large, co-ordinated short of the HK$ would need *derivatives* rather than spot shorts (HK$ funding costs can again be driven sky-high). HKMA has shown it will still \u201cburn the boats\u201d if needed. |\n| **Treasury market sanctions** | Bessent could threaten tighter dollar-funding or Fed swap-line access for banks facilitating sanctioned mainland entities\u2014subtler than a direct peg assault but still painful. |\n| **Capital-flow liberalisation quid pro quo** | Washington may dangle narrower tariffs in exchange for more open Chinese capital markets. Beijing is unlikely to buy in: post-1997 memories + domestic deleveraging push argue for *less* openness. |\n| **Financial decoupling \u201clite\u201d** | The most plausible medium-term path is incremental segregation: tighter U.S. controls on portfolio flows, while HK/China keep bolstering non-USD alternatives. Full-scale peg break still looks remote while reserves remain abundant. |\n\n---\n\n## 6  Bottom line for policy-watchers\n\n1. **Angelica\u2019s narrative is directionally correct**\u2014especially on Korea\u2019s social trauma and HKMA\u2019s shock-and-awe\u2014but compresses many complexities.  \n2. **Bessent\u2019s new role does re-open old fault-lines**: the *personnel* now matches the *playbook*, even if balance-sheet sizes and geopolitical tools have evolved.  \n3. **Expect negotiation brinkmanship, not a replay of 1998**. Today\u2019s defences (HK$400 bn reserves, swap lines with the PBoC, digital-currency pilots) mean speculators need a macro catalyst *plus* official U.S. pressure to have a chance.  \n4. **Asia\u2019s dollar hoarding is rational insurance**, not just post-traumatic distrust; unless Washington offers credible reforms to global safety-net mechanisms, the pile-up will endure.  \n\nFor your own economic-history files, the episodes remain textbook cases in crisis management, moral hazard, and the geopolitics of liquidity."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201","start_idx":545,"end_idx":564,"safe_urls":["https://kellogg.nd.edu/sites/default/files/old_files/documents/272.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([kellogg.nd.edu](https://kellogg.nd.edu/sites/default/files/old_files/documents/272.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] THE 1997 FINANCIAL CRISIS AND GOVERNANCE","url":"https://kellogg.nd.edu/sites/default/files/old_files/documents/272.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1321389073.0,"snippet":"The Korean government, realizing that the nation was in serious financial crisis, agreed in December 1997 to a $58 billion bailout led by the International ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"kellogg.nd.edu"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":1238,"end_idx":1257,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold-collecting_campaign?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold-collecting_campaign?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gold-collecting campaign - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold-collecting_campaign?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1529929850.0,"snippet":"The campaign, involving about 3.51 million people nationwide, collected about 227 tons of gold worth about $2.13 billion. ...
