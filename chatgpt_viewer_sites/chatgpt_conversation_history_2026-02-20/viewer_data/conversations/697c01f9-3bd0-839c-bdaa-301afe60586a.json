We'll do a numeric evaluation, but also explore analytic reasoning. I wonder if this relates to hypergeometric or elliptic integrals, maybe even Bessel functions. I'll focus on checking the math rigorously, possibly using Meijer G integrals and Mellin transforms to compute the integral.\n\n**Verifying step-by-step and considering methods**\n\nWe need to verify the solution by analyzing the integral. I'll check the Mellin transform, employing Parseval's formula. The weight x^-1/2 suggests a Mellin convolution. An easier path might involve that Beta integral or Bessel form. If algebraic transformations reduce it, I should still confirm with a high-precision numeric approach.\n\n**Preparing to compute the integral**\n\nI\u2019ll use Python's mpmath to handle the integral. The function involves the 3F2 hypergeometric function, and the integrand decays potentially like x^-5/8 with oscillations at infinity. I need to check both near 0 and at infinity for convergence. I\u2019ll compute carefully using quadts or a suitable transformation for the range.\n\n**Approaching the integral with substitution**\n\nI\u2019ll approximate the function as f(x)  c * x^(-5/8) for large x, which makes the integral manageable. Using substitution, x = t^2, eliminates the square root and simplifies the integral. I'll compute this numerically with high precision, likely using Python's mpmath library with about 50 digits.\n\n**Computing the closed form**\n\nI\u2019ve computed the numeric result as approximately 2.4607. Now, I\u2019ll check Cleo's closed form expression: (50 \u03c0^(3/2) / (3 \u0393(1/4)^2)) * (ln(3 + \u221a8) - \u221a2). Let\u2019s calculate this to see whether it matches the numeric result.\n\n**Checking result match**\n\nI\u2019ve compared the computed result with the closed form to high precision, and they seem to match closely. Now I\u2019m wondering about any small differences. I should check for rounding errors or if there\u2019s some minor factor influencing the discrepancy in the results.\n\n**Verifying with analytic method**\n\nThe difference between the numerical result and the closed form is about 4e-81, which is negligible, so the numeric verification is solid. The user may want an analytic proof, so I\u2019m considering reconstructing it. I\u2019ll explore the possibility of using the Mellin transform with Meijer G representation and maybe even Bessel functions or elliptic integrals to match the integral and expression. Let\u2019s try that.\n\n**Exploring a possible representation for f(x)**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that f(x) might connect to an integral involving Bessel or Beta functions. Considering the parameters of the hypergeometric function 3F2(5/8, 5/8, 9/8; 1/2, 13/8; -x), I notice that certain terms (like b2 - 1/2) could open the possibility for expressing it in terms of Bessel functions. Let\u2019s try.\n\n**Considering alternative representation for f(x)**\n\nI'm exploring another way to express f(x) using an Euler-type integral for the 3F2 function, where I want to take into account the relationship between the parameters, like b2 > a3. After setting c = 9/8 and e = 13/8, I attempt to write f(x) in terms of a known integral and function, potentially involving cosine integrals. Let's see how it works.\n\n**Attempting analytic verification for 3F2 function**\n\nI'm checking whether I can express _2F1 in terms of simpler functions, like using Gegenbauer polynomials or a combination of terms. It seems tricky, but there is a formula that might help simplify it. However, for now, numeric verification should be enough, though I'd like to produce an exact analytical equivalence using known formulas, such as Mellin transforms. Let's see if I can make it work.\n\n**Verifying using Meijer G and integral approach**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about using the standard Meijer G formula to express the equation. I'll verify using high-precision number checks first, then maybe try a more analytic proof using Mellin transforms and Parseval's identity. I'll provide an outline of the steps, and decide whether to dive into more details if needed.\n\n**Verifying solution using Mellin and Parseval**\n\nWe can attempt an independent proof by evaluating the integral using standard tools like the Mellin transform and applying Parseval's formula. By adjusting for the weight \\(x^{-1/2}\\), we can proceed with a formulated approach, using a modified function to compute the integral and finalize the verification.\n\n**Computing Mellin transform for Meijer G**\n\nWe want to compute the Mellin transform of a function \\( f(x) = _3F_2, \\) using the known Meijer G formula. After setting up the correct parameters based on the formula for the Mellin transform, we aim to derive the integral expression for it. This involves using gamma functions in the numerator and denominator, ensuring we meet given conditions.\n\n**Simplifying gamma functions for Mellin transform**\n\nWe've derived the Mellin transform \\( M_G(s) \\) of the function, which involves several gamma functions. After simplifying the transform, we apply Parseval's theorem to evaluate the integral. This involves computing a contour integral by evaluating residues using the form of \\( M_G(s) \\) and its counterpart at \\( s = 1/2 - s \\).\n\n**Simplifying the integrand and applying Barnes integral**\n\nAfter simplifying the product of Mellin transforms, the integrand \\( M_{\\text{prod}}(s) \\) involves a complex ratio of gamma functions. The constant \\( C^2 \\) is defined, and now we look to evaluate the integral via the sum of residues at the poles of gamma functions. This setup might let us use Barnes' lemmas for a more explicit solution.\n\n**Simplifying integrand with partial fractions**\n\nUsing properties of gamma functions, we've simplified the integrand into a cleaner product of four gamma functions divided by linear factors. The integral now involves partial fractions and focuses on poles tied to the gamma function zeros. I computed the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), both equaling \\( 4/3 \\).\n\n**Relating integrand to Barnes lemma and digamma differences**\n\nAfter simplifying the integrand, I've realized it's related to Barnes' first lemma, but with some added complexity due to rational factors. These factors can be represented as digamma differences. I think I\u2019ll proceed by expressing the integrand in terms of gamma products and partial fraction decompositions for easier evaluation involving digamma functions. This may eventually yield logarithmic expressions.\n\n**Evaluating integral and approaching logs and digamma connections**\n\nThe plan is to compute the integral by summing residues, focusing on poles and considering the Barnes Lemma. I might express it with a combination of digamma differences to ultimately produce the logarithmic result \u2014 specifically the expression involving log(3+\u221a8) and \u221a2. The crucial factor here is understanding how to handle the digamma terms in this context.\n\n**Testing combination with digamma differences**\n\nI've calculated the constant (7.0601) and multiplied it by the bracket (0.348533) to get around 2.4607. Now, I'm thinking the bracket might be a result of a digamma difference, like [\u03c8(7/8) - \u03c8(3/8)]. I'll try to compute this combination and check the digamma differences with Python.\n\n**Testing bracket combinations**\n\nHmm, the value is 5.63449, not matching the bracket 0.3485. I wonder if it\u2019s a scaled version. Maybe the bracket equals (1/2)(\u03c8(3/8) - \u03c8(1/8))? That gives 2.817. Or possibly (1/4)(\u03c8(3/8) - \u03c8(1/8))/\u03c0? Let\u2019s check the bracket multiplied by \u03c0 to see if it works.\n\n**Verifying solution with analytic and numeric methods**\n\nThe bracket calculation doesn\u2019t seem to match yet, but I\u2019m considering alternatives like ln(3+\u221a8) - \u221a2 or ln(1+\u221a2)^2 - \u221a2. To verify the solution, I\u2019ll try numeric integration and a short analytic check, using Meijer G and Barnes lemma. I\u2019ll aim to compute the integral symbolically with Barnes integrals and gamma/digamma evaluations to produce a self-contained proof.\n\n**Rich idea about expressing functions and applying transforms**\n\nI\u2019m looking to express the hypergeometric function f(x) as a Meijer G function. I\u2019ll also use its Mellin transform for g(x), then apply Parseval's formula for the integral of their product. With Meijer G, it looks like there's a standard formula for this type of computation, and I\u2019ll also consider Barnes' lemma for contour evaluation. Time to work through this and compute!\n\n**Exploring direct evaluation using formulas and transforms**\n\nI\u2019m aiming to compute the integral using the Meijer G formula, applying the Mellin transform and Parseval's formula. We can simplify and then try evaluating directly, possibly using Barnes\u2019 lemma or digamma differences. I might also test converting the 3F2 function to a simpler 2F1 form for easier evaluation. Let's see how to proceed.\n\n**Evaluating hypergeometric functions using integral representations**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about starting from the Barnes integral representation to evaluate the hypergeometric function. By using the Beta integral representation, I can express the 3F2 function as an integral involving 2F1. Trying to relate it to cosine or hyperbolic functions might help, but I\u2019ll need to be cautious with the analytic continuation in certain cases. Let\u2019s test these alternatives.\n\n**Working through contour integral simplifications**\n\nI'm simplifying the constant factor \\( C \\) for the integral with Barnes' lemma. After some manipulations using Gamma identities, I\u2019ve confirmed that \\( C^2 \\) simplifies to \\( 25 \\pi / (\\Gamma(5/8)^2 \\Gamma(1/8)^2) \\). Now I can try to integrate the remaining expression and evaluate the contour integral in terms of \\( J \\), aiming for a manageable result.\n\n**Exploring J via partial fraction and residue approach**\n\nI\u2019m trying to compute \\( J \\) analytically by breaking it into two parts using a partial fraction decomposition, followed by Barnes\u2019 lemma and possible residue calculations. The integrand suggests potential double poles due to the coincidence of gamma function poles and the denominator\u2019s behavior. I'll experiment with a residue approach, evaluating the contour, and checking for possible hypergeometric series simplifications.\n\n**Computing J using residues and digamma**\n\nAt \\( s = 5/8 \\), there's a double pole from the gamma function and denominator, and similarly, at \\( s = -1/8 \\), there's another double pole. These double poles could introduce digamma terms. I might attempt computing \\( J \\) by summing residues or using known formulas involving Meijer G functions or hypergeometric functions\u2014both could lead to useful simplifications.\n\n**Evaluating J analytically with known methods**\n\nTo finalize this expression, I could either numerically compute the integral to match the closed form or verify it analytically. I favor demonstrating the formula using Python for precision and providing an analytic check via Mellin transforms or Barnes' lemma. A step-by-step approach like this can help tackle the derivation.\n\n**Exploring the integral and Barnes lemma approach**\n\nI might attempt to evaluate J1 by applying Barnes' lemma with a parameter shift. An interesting opportunity could be to use the relationship between digamma functions and derivatives in the integral, differentiating with respect to 'a' and leveraging the relationships between gamma and digamma to help simplify the integral. Let\u2019s try that!\n\n**Reforming J1 with digamma shifts and derivation approach**\n\nI\u2019m trying to express J1 using digamma functions and derivatives. The identity with \u03c8(a+s+1) = \u03c8(a+s) + 1/(a+s) doesn't seem useful right now. Instead, I might consider combining derivatives of J with respect to 'a' and 'c' to tackle the denominator structure, which includes both (a+s) and (c-s). Let's see how that works!\n\n**Breaking down residue calculation for J1 and gamma series**\n\nLooks like I\u2019m focusing on decomposing the J1 integral into terms with residues and gamma functions. The residues for the Gamma functions at the poles give me a series for J1, which can potentially be evaluated using hypergeometric identities. I'm now verifying the series sum using known gamma function relations at half-integers. Let\u2019s see how this works out!\n\n**Simplifying T_n and U_n expressions with Pochhammer symbols**\n\nI'm looking at the expressions for \\( T_n \\) and \\( U_n \\), and the use of Gamma functions and Pochhammer symbols is helping simplify some of the terms, like for \\( 1/(a+n) \\). The goal is to make these formulas easier by factoring in properties of these symbols, possibly combining them into hypergeometric series, though things seem a bit messy right now. The integration and digamma formulas might help further streamline things.\n\n**Evaluating mathematical approach and considering verification method**\n\nThe mathematical steps involve various complex gamma function transformations and possible applications of Barnes' second lemma. The process tries to relate derivatives and integrals in a way that closely relates to specific known functions like Meijer G, but it's a bit challenging. I\u2019ll ultimately verify the user\u2019s solution numerically\u2014evaluating the integrity of the formulas via high-precision integration. I\u2019ll also explain the steps analytically, but I\u2019ll be careful not to make exaggerated claims about simplifications or validation.\n\n**Verifying solution with numeric verification and brief analytic sketch**\n\nI'll focus on performing numeric verification, comparing the integral to Cleo's expression, which checks to about 70 digits. The numeric check will be enough, but I may also offer a brief analytic confirmation\u2014like showing the integrand is positive, the evaluation makes sense, and the result is plausible. If needed, I\u2019ll outline Meijer G conversion and Barnes lemma briefly, but will avoid claiming a full analytic proof.\n\n**Verifying through analytic continuation and numeric check**\n\nI\u2019ll consider analytic continuation for the series involved, which suggests a logarithmic behavior. For U_n, I\u2019m thinking of using hypergeometric functions or evaluating the associated Barnes integral for expression in terms of digamma values. However, numeric verification should be sufficient, with an analytic skeleton confirming the steps. Let\u2019s compute constants via the Barnes lemmas and explore digamma differences.\n\n**Evaluating constant for I**\n\nI\u2019m working with the constant for the integral expression \u2014 it seems like J0 is approximately 0.6960. Now, I need to evaluate the expression for I, which involves a constant outside. The constant is 25\u03c0, divided by the square of Gamma functions at 5/8 and 1/8. Let's compute this.\n\n**Computing J_total**\n\nNow I\u2019m looking at J_total, which is I divided by C2. Based on my current calculations, this should result in something around 3.659. I\u2019ll go ahead and compute it to check if that holds up.\n\n**Computing J_total in terms of J0**\n\nSo, J_total is about 3.6595. If J_total were equal to J0 times the digamma difference, then I\u2019m thinking J_total divided by J0 might be around 5.258. I\u2019ll go ahead and compute this to verify if that\u2019s the case.\n\n**Checking the digamma difference**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the expression could be equal to the difference between \u03c8(3/4) and \u03c8(1/4). Let me double-check this to see if it holds true! I\u2019ll calculate this difference and confirm if it matches the result I\u2019m expecting.\n\n**Considering another digamma difference**\n\nI initially thought it was \u03c0, but I might be wrong. Now I\u2019m wondering if this could actually be the difference between \u03c8(5/8) and \u03c8(1/8). I\u2019ll check this possibility to confirm if this new comparison makes more sense and gives the result I\u2019m looking for.\n\n**Reconsidering the J_total expression**\n\nOkay, looks like the earlier thought doesn\u2019t hold up. Maybe J_total could be expressed as J0 multiplied by a constant, something like 2\u03c0 times the natural log of (3 + \u221a8) minus \u221a2. Doing some quick checks on the calculation, but I\u2019ll need to confirm if this actually works out.\n\n**Reworking the formula for J_total**\n\nThe earlier value of 5.2576 doesn\u2019t seem to fit right. I\u2019m considering that J_total might equal a constant multiplied by a bracketed term instead. Let me compute this by dividing the J_total number by the bracket value and see if that gets me a better result.\n\n**Determining J_total constant and evaluation approach**\n\nI\u2019m considering how J_total could maybe be expressed in terms of the digamma function, though the expression seems quite complex. To verify the solution, I\u2019ll focus on high-precision numerical integration, using substitution and checking with mpmath. The user may want confirmation that the closed form is correct, so I'll show the computed difference, ensuring the integration is done properly while noting its convergence behavior.\n\n**Crafting response with both numeric and analytic verification**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on providing both a numeric check (up to 60 digits) and an analytic outline. The numeric check will verify the result precisely, and I'll give an outline for the derivation, mentioning Meijer G, Mellin transform, Parseval, and Barnes integral steps, but without overcomplicating or overselling it to the user.\n\n**Attempting full derivation for thorough verification**\n\nI could try to provide a full analytic proof or at least show the key steps with formulas. I\u2019ll start with the function \\( f(x) = 3F2(...;-x) \\), use the Meijer G representation, then reduce it to a Barnes integral using the Mellin transform and Parseval, before evaluating it with a Barnes first lemma approach. This would make the verification more thorough.\n\n**Attempting to compute J_total analytically**\n\nI\u2019m trying to compute \\( J_{\\text{total}} \\) using Barnes' lemma and its derivatives. The final expression seems to involve a constant multiplied by \\( \\ln(3 + \\sqrt{8}) - \\sqrt{2} \\), and I want to compute digamma values at fractional arguments, like \\( 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8 \\), which yield multiples of \\( \\pi \\cot \\). Let\u2019s compute these values and look for a matching expression.\n\n**Exploring the digamma differences and resulting bracket formula**\n\nThe differences between the digamma values, like \\( \\psi(3/8) - \\psi(1/8) \\), suggest a combination of terms involving logarithms and square roots. Given the formula for \\( \\psi(p/q) \\), I realize it simplifies into a relation involving \\( \\cot(\\pi/8) \\), and I can represent the logarithmic part as \\( 2 \\ln(\\cot(\\pi/8)) - \\sqrt{2} \\). This is a critical insight for the final expression!\n\n**Exploring the combination of terms for J_total**\n\nBy analyzing the digamma term differences, I see that the cancellation of constants leads to a combination of cotangent terms and logarithms of sines. These terms, including \\( \\ln(\\sqrt{2} \\pm 1) \\), seem to lead toward the bracket involving \\( \\ln(\\sqrt{2} + 1)^2 \\), and might explain the appearance of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) in the final expression. Not bad!\n\n**Looking into the ratio of constants**\n\nI'm trying to compute the ratio between the constant in the Cleo answer and our constant \\( C_2 \\) times \\( J_0 \\). I'll attempt to derive an exact formula. Maybe \\( J_{\\text{total}} \\) equals \\( \\pi \\times J_0 \\times \\) some expression. The final constant might involve \\( \\pi^{3/2} \\) and \\( \\Gamma(1/4)^2 \\). I'll check the gamma identities to verify.\n\n**Computing the final constant ratio**\n\nRight, this isn't simple\u2014maybe it\u2019s something like 12/??. I\u2019m considering \\( J_{\\text{total}} \\) itself now. If \\( J_{\\text{total\\_num}} = \\frac{I}{C_2} \\), then \\( J_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\text{const\\_final} \\times \\text{bracket}}{C_2} \\). So, I\u2019ll focus on calculating \\( \\text{const\\_final} / C_2 \\).\n\n**Confirming the J_total ratio**\n\nAh, I see it now\u2014this is exactly \\( J_{\\text{total\\_num}} / \\text{bracket} \\) from earlier (approx 10.4997). So, \\( J_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\text{const\\_final}}{C_2} \\times \\text{bracket} \\). The ratio \\( \\frac{\\text{const\\_final}}{C_2} \\) is about 10.5, which is close to \\( \\frac{21}{2} \\). Let\u2019s check if it\u2019s an exact match.\n\n**Exploring a possible \u03c0 relationship**\n\nAlright, so this doesn\u2019t seem to match exactly. But could it be related to \u03c0 somehow? Dividing 10.4997 by \u03c0 gives around 3.342\u2014could that be related to a square root, maybe? Let\u2019s check if that works out or if I\u2019m overlooking something.\n\n**Approaching J_total with digamma differences**\n\nIt seems this might not work out, but let\u2019s try another approach. I could attempt to compute J_total analytically, maybe by involving the digamma differences. The final bracket might relate to digamma values at 1/8 and 3/8, possibly involving \u03c0. I'll see if I can express the bracket as a combination of those.\n\n**Trying a new approach with digamma values**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the bracket might be expressed as (1/8)(\u03c8(5/8) - \u03c8(1/8)). I\u2019ll check to see if this fits better with what I\u2019m expecting, as comparing this to the previous \u03c8 difference doesn\u2019t seem to align exactly. Let\u2019s give this a shot and see what comes up.\n\n**Testing another digamma approach**\n\nI\u2019m now thinking the bracket might be expressed as (1/4)(\u03c8(7/8) - \u03c8(1/8)). This could be a better fit, so I\u2019ll check it out and see if it aligns with the previous calculations. It\u2019s another possibility worth testing.\n\n**Exploring other ways to express the bracket**\n\nI\u2019m considering expressing the bracket as a combination of digamma functions, such as \u03c8(1/8), plus a cotangent term. The idea is to use the formula for digamma at rational values and potentially cancel out certain constants. However, I'll first try verifying this numerically and address any doubts later.\n\n**Final response and verification approach**\n\nThe numerical result for the integral is approximately 2.4607, with the closed form expression yielding almost the same value, differing by only 4e-81, confirming the accuracy. I'll show the integration method with substitution and mpmath for high precision, along with a comparison. Should be quite robust!\n\n**Additional numeric verification for stability**\n\nTo ensure the result is stable, I'll perform additional checks. First, I'll set the precision to 100 decimal places, then use two integration methods \u2014 one with x and another with t for substitution. Afterward, I\u2019ll compare the results with the expression to quickly verify reliability.\n\n**Adjusting integration method to ensure fast results**\n\nThe second integration method with x took too long, so I'll focus on the t-substitution method instead, which is faster. The earlier results with 80 dps were successful and showed minimal difference, indicating correctness. I'll try 70 dps for a quick check and provide efficient code that\u2019s easy for the user to replicate. Let's run it with 80 dps and confirm.\n\n**Choosing best method for user code**\n\nI'll use high precision (50 digits) and integrate directly over [0, \u221e] with t-substitution, as it worked before. Splitting into intervals might be a bit slower, but I'll also propose that option. I'll ensure the code runs within a typical time frame, adjusting precision if needed. Let's test with 60 digits for now!\n\n**Verifying small difference with higher precision**\n\nThe difference is about 1e-60, likely due to numerical error, which is good. I'll test with a higher precision of 80 digits to see if we get the 1e-80 difference we calculated earlier. I'll recompute the integral over [0, 1, \u221e] and check the result.\n\n**Evaluating integration speed and precision**\n\nAt mp.dps=80, the integration was too slow and interrupted after 60 seconds. However, at dps=60 or 50, it worked fine for demonstration purposes. Our previous test at mp.dps=50 to 80 showed a fast result with a difference of about 4e-81. The slower performance with interval splitting could be due to convergence issues when evaluating around 1 or infinity. We\u2019ll stick to using [0, mp.inf] for faster results at high precision.\n\n**Providing final verification and code**\n\nThe integration was successful! We\u2019ll provide the code using `mp.quad(..., [0, mp.inf])` without splitting the intervals. The mathematical verification message for Cleo\u2019s claim would reference the integral:\n\nI = \u222b_0^\u221e ( _3F_2(...) )^2 x^{-1/2} dx.\n\nWe\u2019ll verify numerically using substitution x=t^2 and provide the high precision computation code.\n\n**Finalizing response and verification of solution**\n\nTo verify Cleo's solution, we calculated the difference with 80-digit precision, yielding 4\u00d710^{-81}. I\u2019ll mention the logarithmic relationship: ln(3+\u221a8) = 2 ln(1+\u221a2), or 2 asinh 1. We can offer this as an approximation but will focus on the verified result of the computation, showing correct parameterization."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 26m 51s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-japanwest-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-b39fdb6e-44c0-428b-8a78-2c084307737b:JP","parent_id":"0cc79b71-ef1f-4507-b2e2-7d4d08d5c100","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_697c01fabd5c8191b3a5b92c743d3d95","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"697c01fa-be88-839b-a733-d9cad907eb59","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-30T00:57:31.090484Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"0cc79b71-ef1f-4507-b2e2-7d4d08d5c100","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"b39fdb6e-44c0-428b-8a78-2c084307737b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"f60dd06d-7bb3-4ce7-846a-e810a55965bf","finished_duration_sec":1611,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0cc79b71-ef1f-4507-b2e2-7d4d08d5c100","children":["d453065a-1aaa-4df8-9dfe-c067fd0d42af"]},"d453065a-1aaa-4df8-9dfe-c067fd0d42af":{"id":"d453065a-1aaa-4df8-9dfe-c067fd0d42af","message":{"id":"d453065a-1aaa-4df8-9dfe-c067fd0d42af","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769736262.296647,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The integral in the screenshot is  \n\\[\nI=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left[\\,{}_3F_{2}\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\frac58,\\frac58,\\frac98\\\\[2pt]\\frac12,\\frac{13}{8}\\end{matrix};-x\\right)\\right]^2\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x}},\n\\]\nand \u201cCleo\u201d claims\n\\[\nI=\\frac{50\\,\\pi^{3/2}}{3\\,\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\tfrac14\\right)^2}\\Bigl(\\ln(3+\\sqrt8)-\\sqrt2\\Bigr).\n\\]\n\nBelow is a clean verification (with an independent high\u2011precision numerical check at the end).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Reduce the \\({}_3F_2\\) to a real part of a \\({}_2F_1\\)\n\nWrite the generalized hypergeometric series (Pochhammer \\((a)_n=\\Gamma(a+n)/\\Gamma(a)\\)):\n\\[\n{}_3F_2\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}a,a,a+\\tfrac12\\\\[2pt]\\tfrac12,a+1\\end{matrix};-x\\right)\n=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\n\\frac{(a)_n^2\\,(a+\\tfrac12)_n}{(\\tfrac12)_n\\,(a+1)_n}\\frac{(-x)^n}{n!}.\n\\]\n\nConsider instead\n\\[\n\\Re\\left[\\,{}_2F_1\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}2a,2a\\\\[2pt]2a+1\\end{matrix};\\,i\\sqrt{x}\\right)\\right]\n=\\Re\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(2a)_n^2}{(2a+1)_n}\\frac{(i\\sqrt{x})^n}{n!}.\n\\]\nOnly even \\(n=2k\\) contribute to the real part, with \\(\\Re(i^{2k})=(-1)^k\\):\n\\[\n\\Re\\left[{}_2F_1(2a,2a;2a+1;i\\sqrt{x})\\right]\n=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\n\\frac{(2a)_{2k}^2}{(2a+1)_{2k}}\\frac{(-1)^k x^k}{(2k)!}.\n\\]\n\nNow use the duplication identities (from the Gamma duplication formula):\n\\[\n(2a)_{2k}=4^k(a)_k\\left(a+\\tfrac12\\right)_k,\\qquad\n(2a+1)_{2k}=4^k\\left(a+\\tfrac12\\right)_k(a+1)_k,\\qquad\n(2k)!=4^k\\left(\\tfrac12\\right)_k k!.\n\\]\nPlugging these in,\n\\[\n\\frac{(2a)_{2k}^2}{(2a+1)_{2k}(2k)!}\n=\n\\frac{(a)_k^2\\,(a+\\tfrac12)_k}{(a+1)_k\\,(\\tfrac12)_k\\,k!}.\n\\]\nSo the coefficients match term\u2011by\u2011term, and we have the identity (for \\(x>0\\)):\n\\[\n{}_3F_2\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}a,a,a+\\tfrac12\\\\[2pt]\\tfrac12,a+1\\end{matrix};-x\\right)\n=\\Re\\left[\\,{}_2F_1\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}2a,2a\\\\[2pt]2a+1\\end{matrix};\\,i\\sqrt{x}\\right)\\right].\n\\]\n\nFor the problem\u2019s parameters \\(a=\\tfrac58\\), so \\(2a=\\alpha=\\tfrac54\\):\n\\[\n{}_3F_2\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\frac58,\\frac58,\\frac98\\\\[2pt]\\frac12,\\frac{13}{8}\\end{matrix};-x\\right)\n=\\Re\\left[\\,{}_2F_1\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\frac54,\\frac54\\\\[2pt]\\frac94\\end{matrix};\\,i\\sqrt{x}\\right)\\right].\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 2) Remove the \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) in the measure\n\nLet \\(x=t^2\\).

The structure should include: introduction, problem statement, notation, background (hypergeometric functions, Pochhammer, gamma), relevant lemmas, and Python code for recomputing the integral with precision. Also, instructions for reproducibility, integral evaluation, and convergence checks, followed by an example output.\n\n**Providing citations without web access**\n\nThe user asked for \"appropriate citations,\" and since they didn't specify web-based sources, I can include standard bibliographic references like DLMF, Gradshteyn & Ryzhik, and Erdelyi. These references don't rely on web access, so I won\u2019t use the web tool. They are stable and reliable for this task.\n\n**Crafting report outline for Cleo solution verification**\n\nThe outline should include: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Statement of Results, Notation and Preliminaries, Lemmas (hypergeometric series, duplication formula, 3F2 identity, Euler integral representation, Laplace/Parseval transforms, Fubini conditions, and integral evaluation). We should also have a section for Justification of convergence, and a code appendix using mpmath for numerical verification. The code should split intervals for integration and show the outputs.\n\n**Including computational stability and numeric guidance**\n\nI should mention computational stability for large t, where f(t) decays as t^{-alpha} but the integral is still convergent. I'll include guidance on splitting intervals for numerical integration. The user asked for reproducible output, so I\u2019ll provide Python code using mpmath to compute high precision results and show the expected output.\n\n**Ensuring reproducible output with precision**\n\nThe difference is about 4e-81, which looks good. However, for reproducible output, I might show the result with a precision of dps=50, which will give a difference around 1e-50. Let\u2019s compute with lower precision next to demonstrate typical output.\n\n**Ensuring stability and reproducibility**\n\nThe difference is about -2.1e-50, which is good. However, mp.quad might be unstable at times, so it\u2019s better to split the intervals further, even though the current [0,1] and [1,inf] should be fine. To ensure reproducibility, let's compute the result using a 3F2 integrand and include it as an optional check.\n\n**Proposing report structure and code**\n\nThe direct integration with 3F2 is too slow, so we might use a transformation to 2F1 or approximate the 3F2 series for each x, avoiding unnecessary integration over x. The report should be around 10 pages, including sections like notation definitions, lemmas with citations, main theorem, and proof. We\u2019ll include Python code with reproducible output in the report, but just as code blocks (no downloads). It will be tailored for mathematicians, covering special functions, convergence, and auxiliary remarks.\n\n**Including well-known lemmas with references**\n\nThe report should clearly state the lemmas used, with citations for each. For example:\n\n- Generalized hypergeometric pFq definition (DLMF \u00a716.2).\n- Euler integral representation for 2F1 (DLMF \u00a715.6.1).\n- Gamma duplication formula (DLMF \u00a75.5.5).\n- Parseval theorem for Fourier cosine transform (Stein & Shakarchi, Bracewell).\n- Laplace transform representation.\n- Tonelli/Fubini (Rudin, Folland).\n- Exponential integral E1 (DLMF \u00a76).\n\nWe should provide proofs where possible but can also just cite references.\n\n**Proposing report structure with numerical verification**\n\nThe report should include:\n- Title page, abstract, main sections, appendices, references.\n- Proof of lemma converting 3F2 to the real part of 2F1 using the Gamma duplication formula.\n- Lemmas involving Euler integral, Laplace transform, Parseval, and Fubini with Beta substitution.\n- A \"numerical verification\" section with code for reproducibility, showing values and differences like:\n  - `mp.dps = 80`\n  - `I_num = ...`, `I_closed = ...`\n  - Abs diff and relative error\n\n**Suggesting integration methods and code for verification**\n\nTo resolve the potential `mp.dps` and `mp.quad` errors, we could suggest alternative integration methods, such as using Parseval to integrate \u03c6\u00b2, which might provide an easier numeric check. We can compare two methods: integrating via 2F1 and integrating using the built-in `mp.e1(x)` or `mp.expint`. Providing both methods and code would make the verification more robust.\n\n**Computing I from J**\n\nThe next step would be to compute I from J using the formula \\( I = \\frac{25\\pi}{\\Gamma(1/4)^2} \\). This involves taking the value of J and multiplying by the constant factor, and computing the Gamma function \\(\\Gamma(1/4)\\), which should give us the desired result for I.\n\n**Proposing report structure and numerical verification**\n\nFor numerical verification, we can compute \\( I \\) through both the 2F1 and E1 integrals and compare them to the closed form. Regarding the report structure, I'd suggest this:\n\n- Title\n- Abstract\n- Sections: Introduction, Notation & Preliminaries, Lemmas, Proof, Numerical Verification, Conclusion\n- Appendices: Derivations, Python Code\n- References\n\nCitations (e.g., DLMF) will be included for each lemma. We could discuss errors in `mp.quad` and suggest alternatives, but it may not be necessary.\n\n**Creating robust code for I and J calculations**\n\nTo compute \\( I \\) and \\( J \\), I\u2019ll write a function that uses `mpmath`. First, set the desired precision, then compute \\( I \\) using the integral for \\( 2F1 \\), and also a closed-form formula. For \\( J \\), we\u2019ll use an integral involving \\( e1(y) \\). I'll include code for both, and provide sample output for reproducibility, although results may vary slightly across `mpmath` versions.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath as mp\n\ndef compute_I(dps=80):\n    mp.mp.dps = dps\n    alpha = mp.mpf(5)/4\n    f = lambda t: mp.re(mp.hyper([alpha, alpha], [alpha+1], 1j*t))\n    I_num = mp.quad(lambda t: 2*f(t)**2, [0, 1, mp.inf])\n    I_closed = (50*mp.pi**(mp.mpf(3)/2))/(3*mp.gamma(mp.mpf(1)/4)**2) * (mp.log(3+mp.sqrt(8)) - mp.sqrt(2))\n    err = I_num - I_closed\n    rel = abs(err)/abs(I_closed)\n    return I_num, I_closed, err, rel\n\n# Usage\nI_num, I_closed, err, rel = compute_I()\n\n# For J calculation:\nJ_num = mp.quad(lambda y: mp.sqrt(y)*mp.e1(y)**2, [0, 1, mp.inf])\nJ_closed = (2*mp.sqrt(mp.pi)/3)*(mp.log(3+mp.sqrt(8)) - mp.sqrt(2))\n\nprint(\"I_num:\", I_num, \"I_closed:\", I_closed)\nprint(\"J_num:\", J_num, \"J_closed:\", J_closed)\n```\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll print the results with digits using `mp.nstr` for reproducibility.\n\n**Printing output with precision and crafting a report structure**\n\nFor the output, I'll print the values of \\( I_{\\text{num}} \\), \\( I_{\\text{closed}} \\), error calculations, and relative errors using `mp.nstr` for 50-digit precision.\n\nNext, here's a sample code for output:\n\n```python\nmp.mp.dps = 80\nI_num, I_closed, err, rel = compute_I(80)\nprint(\"I_num   =\", mp.nstr(I_num, 50))\nprint(\"I_closed =\", mp.nstr(I_closed, 50))\nprint(\"abs error =\", mp.nstr(abs(err), 5), \"( 10^{%d})\" % mp.floor(mp.log10(abs(err))))\nprint(\"rel error =\", mp.nstr(rel, 5))\n```\n\nFor the report structure, here\u2019s an outline based on the user\u2019s request:\n\n1. **Title**\n2. **Abstract**\n3. **Section 1: Introduction and problem statement**\n4. **Section 2: Notation and preliminaries**\n5. **Section 3: Lemmas**\n6. **Section 4: Proof**\n7. **Section 5: Numerical verification**\n8. **Section 6: Conclusion**\n9. **Appendix A: Derivations**\n10. **Appendix B: Python code**\n11. **References**\n\nSince the user appreciates precision and mathematical typesetting, I can suggest using LaTeX (without file details). Here\u2019s a simple skeleton:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\n    \\title{Report Title}\n    \\author{Author}\n    \\maketitle\n    \\begin{abstract}\n        This is the abstract.\n    \\end{abstract}\n    % Sections go below\n    \\section{Introduction}\n    \\section{Notation}\n    % And so on\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis provides a quick skeleton without overwhelming the user with a full LaTeX setup.\n\n**Crafting the structure for a self-contained report**\n\nFor a structured report based on the user\u2019s request, I would suggest an outline that organizes the information clearly. Here's what it might look like:\n\n- **Title**: \"Evaluation of an integral involving a squared generalized hypergeometric function\".\n- **Abstract**: One paragraph summarizing the project.\n- **1. Introduction**: Describe the integral, provide context (like StackExchange), and state the main theorem.\n- **2. Definitions and Notation**: Include definitions for terms like Pochhammer, Gamma, generalized hypergeometric functions, etc.\n- **3. Statement of Main Theorem**: State the theorem and its variations.\n- **4. Preliminaries**: Discuss convergence analysis, integrand behavior, and series expansions.\n\nThis keeps things clear and concise and aligns with their request for a self-contained report structure. I can also include code in the appendix.\n\n**Outlining lemmas and proof structure**\n\nI\u2019ll include several lemmas as part of the report, such as:\n\n1. Duplication identity for Pochhammer.\n2. Reduction identity for 3F2 and 2F1.\n3. Euler representation for 2F1.\n4. Laplace transform representation for integrals.\n5. Parseval\u2019s formula for cosine transformations.\n6. Interchanging integrals using Tonelli/Fubini.\n7. Solving the integral for E1(y).\n\nThe proof of the main theorem involves substitution, applying lemmas, and simplifying with special identities. I'll contain detailed numerical verification with Python code, discussing efficiency and sensitivity. The structure will also include appendices for proofs, Python code, and relevant references in the bibliography for clarity and completeness.\n\n**Crafting the report structure for a mathematical proof**\n\nI'm structuring the report with clear section numbers and detailed bullet points for each part. I'll handle highly technical terminology with proper definitions before use, as per the user\u2019s requirements, and avoid casual language. For example, terms like the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) will be fully defined before referencing them.\n\nThe outline includes:\n- Title, Abstract, Keywords\n- Problem statement and result\n- Notation and conventions\n- Background lemmas\n- Main proof steps\n- Numerical verification\n\nI'll provide a LaTeX skeleton, code blocks for Python, and key formulae with citation references, especially for lemmas.\n\n**Citing sources and preparing code output**\n\nI\u2019m planning to correctly cite sources without the exact equation numbers. For example, I can reference sections of the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) like DLMF \u00a715.6(i) and cite other resources like Stein & Shakarchi for Parseval and Folland for Fubini/Tonelli.\n\nFor the code, I\u2019ll provide Python examples that print results, such as the 50-digit `mp.nstr` output of I_num to the console. I will compute the value with 80 decimal points and display it.\n\n**Crafting a detailed report and code example**\n\nI'll structure the report with a table of contents that includes sections like \"Reproducibility\" with Python and library versions, although it\u2019s not essential. I\u2019ll include a list of lemmas, provide a skeleton for the theorem proof, and offer full Python code and output samples.\n\nAlso, for numerical integration, I\u2019ll highlight using `mp.quad` with domain splitting and mention adjustments for better results, like splitting at intervals [0,1],[1,10], and [10, infinity].\n\n**Addressing potential computational challenges and gotchas**\n\nDirect integration using 3F2 is computationally heavy, so it's better to use the transformed 2F1 integrand for efficiency. I'll also note some potential gotchas: for branch cuts, we use the principal branch, ensuring continuity when \\(t, u \\geq 0\\). Additionally, when exchanging integrals, we use Tonelli because the integrand is nonnegative after squaring. We should also handle absolute convergence and provide bounding, as the integral is absolutely convergent for our chosen \\( \\alpha = 5/4 \\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 14m 59s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-koreacentral-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-e357e3cd-f2e4-46d3-8ddd-017b271c9b95:KR","parent_id":"ab4922a0-398a-4668-9e16-e5cd9d85f6ba","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_697c11fdedbc81918bad8059be242562","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"697c11fd-f794-8399-a414-120b5fa92ad9","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-30T02:05:50.647669Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"ab4922a0-398a-4668-9e16-e5cd9d85f6ba","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"e357e3cd-f2e4-46d3-8ddd-017b271c9b95","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"c81131b5-d007-44b8-9a60-cf4485e4fc6c","finished_duration_sec":899,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ab4922a0-398a-4668-9e16-e5cd9d85f6ba","children":["7644ef4b-067f-453d-9de1-88b7aaa25578"]},"7644ef4b-067f-453d-9de1-88b7aaa25578":{"id":"7644ef4b-067f-453d-9de1-88b7aaa25578","message":{"id":"7644ef4b-067f-453d-9de1-88b7aaa25578","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769739650.223904,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is a report structure that would let a reader (i) understand the problem with minimal prerequisites, (ii) see exactly which external facts you are using (with references), (iii) follow a logically complete proof, and (iv) reproduce a numerical verification end\u2011to\u2011end in Python.\n\nI\u2019ll phrase it around the specific theorem you just verified.\n\n---\n\n# Proposed report structure (self\u2011contained)\n\n## Front matter\n- **Title:** *Evaluation of an integral involving a squared generalized hypergeometric function*\n- **Abstract (5\u20138 lines):**\n  - State the integral \\(I\\).\n  - State the closed form.\n  - Summarize the proof strategy (reduction \\({}_3F_2 \\to \\Re\\,{}_2F_1\\), cosine transform + Parseval, evaluation via exponential integral).\n  - Mention numerical verification and precision achieved.\n- **Keywords:** hypergeometric function, generalized hypergeometric function, Fourier cosine transform, Parseval/Plancherel, exponential integral, Gamma function.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

I'll search for \"Cleo\" or related expressions to pinpoint the right section quickly. Let's try that and see where it lands.\n\n**Researching and expanding citations for alternative solutions**\n\nGreat, I found where Cleo's answer is, along with Chen Wang's contributions. Now, I need to expand the citations list and adjust the framework. I'll also look for alternatives across platforms like WolframAlpha, MSE posts, and YouTube. Including Teruo's 2022 solution with the Mellin transform and others should strengthen the document.\n\n**Planning citations and searching for alternative references**\n\nI could cite Wikipedia for Ramanujan\u2019s master theorem, but the DLMF and textbooks might be better. The user wants references from published solutions already online, so I\u2019ll include the MSE page with solution and lemma references. I might check out YouTube for Cleo\u2019s answer, but maybe I\u2019ll skip it. Time to refine my search and look for more related blog posts.\n\n**Reviewing search results and finalizing citations**\n\nThe search results have some irrelevant links, but I found the key MSE page, plus another MSE about hypergeometric identity, although it's not directly related to the integral. The main relevant solutions on MSE include Cleo's closed form, Chen Wang\u2019s generalization, and Teruo\u2019s proof using Ramanujan\u2019s Master theorem. I'll cite these, along with necessary lemmas, ensuring I expand the citation list as requested.\n\n**Adjusting framework and citations**\n\nThe Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) and the Plancherel theorem will be mentioned, as well as other relevant concepts like Mellin transform and Meijer G. I\u2019ll ensure the report structure aligns with the user\u2019s instructions, reorganizing it by adding a \"Related work and existing solutions\" section. This will include citations to MSE, mpmath functions, and related methodologies. I\u2019ll also make sure no files are created, just copy-friendly code blocks.\n\n**Citing resources for integrals and lemmas**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of including sympy along with mpmath, though mpmath is essential. I\u2019ll cite MSE for the integral solution and associated answers. Wikipedia might be helpful for Parseval or Ramanujan's master theorem, but DLMF could be more authoritative. I\u2019ll refine searches to focus on DLMF sources and include citations correctly.\n\n**Reworking the report framework and citations**\n\nThe MSE thread already uses Ramanujan's master theorem and Plancherel's theorem (with links to Wikipedia). I'll also cite these sources separately when needed. I need to expand the report with solutions and improve the outline, including sections for Meijer G and Mellin transform. Appendices will also help, and I'll provide complete definitions, lemma statements, proofs, and code.\n\n**Structuring the self-contained report for the user**\n\nThe user requested an improved structure and expanded citations. I\u2019ll outline the report with sections like alternative proofs, bibliography, and citations outside of any formatting\u2014no bold, italics, or code fences should contain citations. I'll search for DLMF, mpmath, Ramanujan\u2019s theorem, and relevant open resources for citations, ensuring they come from trusted sources.\n\n**Looking for Euler integral representation of 2F1**\n\nI found useful DLMF sources including the gamma duplication formula and generalized hypergeometric functions. However, I couldn't locate the Euler integral representation for 2F1 in chapter 15. I\u2019ll search again specifically for DLMF chapter 15.6 to find the integral representation details for 2F1.\n\n**Searching for Euler integral representation in DLMF**\n\nI couldn't find the Euler integral representation in the previous search, so I think it might be in section 15.6 or 15.6.1 of DLMF. I'll try searching for \u201c15.6.1\u201d to locate it directly, or maybe I\u2019ll open this section directly from the DLMF website. Let\u2019s give it a go.\n\n**Looking for Euler integral in DLMF 15.6.1**\n\nIt looks like Euler's integral representation might be in section 15.6.1, but the formula is missing due to a word limit. The text cuts off at line 39, so I think I\u2019ll open lines 35-50 to capture the missing formula. Hopefully, I can find it there.\n\n**Handling DLMF missing formula**\n\nThe formula I\u2019m looking for is omitted due to word limits in the DLMF snippet, or it might be represented as an image. It\u2019s fine; I can cite the page itself, even if the exact formula isn\u2019t included in the text snippet. For accuracy, I could open the \"TeX\" or \"png\" encoding for the equation.\n\n**Opening TeX link for accuracy**\n\nI\u2019ve found that the DLMF snippet includes encoding options for TeX, pMML, and png at lines 51-52. Each encoding has its own link ID. To ensure I reference the correct formula, I\u2019ll click on the TeX link, which corresponds to ID 47. This should open the formula more precisely.\n\n**Referencing formula from DLMF**\n\nClicking the TeX link gave an error, but the PNG link worked, providing the formula as an image. It's good to know that I can cite the image source. I'll reference the DLMF page citation to support the Euler integral representation formula explicitly, ensuring it matches with the correct equation.\n\n**Citing generalized hypergeometric functions**\n\nIt seems the definition for the generalized hypergeometric function might be in DLMF chapter 16, specifically section 16.2, but I'll need to double-check. It looks like sections 16.2 might be where the generalized hypergeometric function is defined, so I think I should open this section for clarification.\n\n**Considering citation and verification structure**\n\nDLMF 16.2 indeed has the definition and properties we need. I also want to cite relevant formulas, like DLMF 5.5 for the duplication formula and maybe DLMF 5.12 for the Beta function integral. The user is asking for citations and structure for verifying Cleo's solution, not the derivation itself, so I'll need to plan how to lay that out.\n\n**Defining report structure and citing proof methods**\n\nThe user is now asking for the structure of the report, which should define terms, prove the theorem, and include code. We need to propose an outline with all elements, such as the final theorem statement and the proof method. The user is asking for structure, not the full proof, so I'll include enough details for reproducibility. I'll check the MSE thread for reference to guide our approach.\n\n**Designing proof structure using Mellin transform**\n\nBased on the three answers in the thread\u2014Cleo's result, Chen Wang's Meijer G generalization, and Teruo's alternative proof\u2014our report structure will incorporate all of these. We\u2019ll propose using the Mellin transform and Plancherel theorem for the proof. This leads to representing the given function as a Mellin transform and evaluating the integral using Beta and Gamma functions, ultimately simplifying into a rational integral.\n\n**Outlining report structure**\n\nThis analytic approach easily leads to a closed-form solution and can be shown to match Cleo's formula. I also plan to include an alternative approach using Meijer G functions, though it\u2019s more complicated\u2014likely as an appendix. A numerical verification section will compare computed values against the closed form, supported by reproducible code. \n\nThe outline might include:\n\n- Title and abstract\n- Section 1: Problem statement and integral definition\n- Section 2: Notation and definitions (Gamma, Beta, Pochhammer symbol, hypergeometric function, Meijer G, Mellin transform, etc.)\n\n**Citing references and structuring lemmas**\n\nFor Section 3, I'll include known results and lemmas such as the series definition of the general hypergeometric function, Mellin transforms, and the duplication formula for the Gamma function. I\u2019ll also reference standard results like the Beta integral and the Fourier transform of the Cauchy function. For authoritative sources, I can cite Wikipedia and other established integral tables. I'll review the Plancherel theorem for Mellin transforms for reliable citations.\n\n**Citing integral formulas and references**\n\nI'll likely cite sources like Wikipedia for the Mellin transform, the Ramanujan master theorem, and the Parseval-like theorem. For the Fourier transform of the Cauchy distribution, citing Wikipedia and perhaps a PDF of Fourier transforms could be helpful. I'll search for the specific formula related to the Laplace transform and Cauchy distribution on Wikipedia.\n\n**Citing known formulas and references**\n\nI\u2019ll use Wikipedia for the Cauchy distribution's characteristic function, which links to the Fourier transform identity for 1/(x\u00b2 + \u03b3\u00b2). I\u2019ll also cite MSE for the cosine integral and related theorems like archiving Mellin transforms using Parseval. Additionally, I plan to use DLMF references for hypergeometric functions and Euler integrals.\n\n**Choosing citations and structuring the report**\n\nI\u2019m considering citing authoritative sources such as the MSE Q&A or a PDF on the Mellin-Plancherel theorem, but prefer to focus on standard academic literature. I\u2019ll also include citations to mpmath for numerical verification. Now, I need to adjust the report structure, starting with an introduction and stating the results.\n\n**Summarizing the proof structure with references**\n\nI\u2019ll summarize the three approaches: Cleo\u2019s closed form, Chen Wang\u2019s generalization with Meijer G, and Teruo\u2019s proof using Ramanujan\u2019s master and Mellin transforms. Then, I\u2019ll outline the main proof steps, starting from a series representation of _3F_2, using the Mellin-Plancherel theorem, and applying gamma and Beta integrals. I\u2019ll also explore cross-checks with alternative derivations.\n\n**Outlining the report structure with citations**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on providing a structured outline for the report, clearly defining terminology and notation, and listing important lemmas with their purpose. I\u2019ll showcase the proof, include Python code for numerical verification, and provide a full citations list. Since the user may want this in LaTeX later, I\u2019ll ensure the outline includes proper numbering.\n\n**Proposing report structure with key details**\n\nThe report structure will include explicit theorems and lemmas, along with a code snippet and sample output. I\u2019ll provide the skeleton of the proof along with key steps, as well as the Python code for verifying the integral numerically. I\u2019ll outline sections and propose placeholders like \"Theorem\" and \"Proof.\"\n\n**Producing final response with structure and verification**\n\nWe\u2019ll provide a full mini-report that includes a structured layout with notation, lemmas, proofs, and references to public domain solutions, along with the code and sample output. We'll project it in markdown format, making sure to incorporate numerically verified results and citations such as the mpmath docs.\n\n**Crafting the proof using Teruo's approach**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of following Teruo's proof approach, adding more details along the way to fill in the gaps. I\u2019ll check the relevant sections of the MSE thread to make sure I\u2019m replicating his steps accurately. I\u2019ll use Cleo's expression and numeric checks to verify the result.\n\n**Building a self-contained proof**\n\nTeruo's proof is a good starting point, but we need to make it self-contained. The core will involve verifying or re-deriving the series representation of the hypergeometric function and the Mellin transform. I think we should begin from the 3F2 series definition, apply gamma identities, and then use Ramanujan's master theorem.\n\n**Proof strategy and citation handling**\n\nWe could adopt the Mellin transform lemma from Teruo\u2019s work but need to prove it ourselves. For clarity, we\u2019ll reference Ramanujan\u2019s master theorem, the Plancherel theorem, and use the proper convention for the Mellin transform formula. We\u2019ll ensure correct citations, possibly from Wikipedia for the necessary formulas.\n\n**Searching for the Plancherel theorem**\n\nI need to find the Plancherel theorem on the page. The snippet doesn\u2019t show it, so I\u2019ll search for keywords like \"Parseval\" or \"Plancherel\" within the document to pinpoint it quickly and make sure I have the right section.\n\n**Locating the Plancherel theorem formula**\n\nThe find results show a section titled \"Properties -> Parseval's theorem and Plancherel's theorem.\" To capture the formula for citation, I\u2019ll open the section around line 200, where the relevant content starts. I\u2019ll use the search function again to make sure I locate the specific formula.\n\n**Citing necessary theorems & formulas**\n\nThe Wikipedia page covers both Parseval's formula and the Plancherel theorem, which I can cite. For Ramanujan's master theorem, I'll reference its Wikipedia page. To express hypergeometric function coefficients, I'll use the pFq series and cite DLMF for the gamma duplication formula. I\u2019ll open the respective DLMF page.\n\n**Saving tool calls while gathering sources**\n\nI realized the link I opened was an errata instead of the duplication formula. With only two calls left, I need to be careful. I'll try a targeted search to find the formula directly and consider citing search results if needed. I\u2019ll aim to gather everything with minimal tool calls.\n\n**Refining the search to find the right source**\n\nIt looks like our search result was incorrect, leading to an errata page instead of the gamma function formula. I need to revisit earlier search results to check if one of them is the right one, particularly focusing on the DLMF Gamma function references. I\u2019ll carefully check these to get the correct source.\n\n**Reassessing citation options**\n\nIt seems the search result led to the DLMF errata page instead of the correct gamma function page. Maybe the query triggered that result by mistake. I\u2019m considering citing the Wikipedia \"Gamma function\" page instead since the user requested citations. We could use one of our remaining calls to find that.\n\n**Managing citation sources and conserving tool calls**\n\nWe're nearing the limit for web calls, so we\u2019ll rely on existing sources like mpmath docs and any available pages. However, for the gamma duplication formula, we might cite the DLMF 5.5 search result if it\u2019s sufficient. At this point, avoiding more tool calls is crucial to stay within limits.\n\n**Finalizing citation approach and formula checking**\n\nI can cite the DLMF page without reading the formula directly, though I need to verify it's actually on the page. It seems I mis-checked the errata PDF earlier instead of the formula. No need to track down the gamma duplication formula right now, since Teruo\u2019s proof may not explicitly use it.\n\n**Exploring series representation and formula options**\n\nWe can represent the series using the Pochhammer symbol in place of the duplication formula, leveraging gamma identities and rising factorials. While Teruo\u2019s approach likely simplified using duplication, we might rederive it ourselves. Alternatively, we could use an integral approach with Beta and 2F1 representations. Could cite standard references instead of duplication formula if needed.\n\n**Deciding on citations for Beta and Gamma**\n\nFor the Pochhammer-gamma relation, citing DLMF 16.2 should be sufficient. For Beta and Gamma functions, we might aim to cite DLMF or Wikipedia, but we need to balance citation needs with our web call limit. We can make do with existing sources, like the MSE answer or Cauchy distribution, which might be acceptable.\n\n**Planning tool calls for citations**\n\nWe\u2019ve used 16 tool calls and have about 2 left. We might need to use one call for the Gamma duplication formula and another for the Beta function integral. Instead of the duplication formula, maybe we can stick with the Beta function citation from Wikipedia or DLMF for the proof.\n\n**Using MSE thread and sources for citations**\n\nWe can use existing sources like the MSE thread to cite the Beta function identity, avoiding extra web calls. While MSE isn\u2019t the most authoritative, it\u2019s widely known and should suffice. We\u2019ll also cite relevant parts of the MSE thread for Cleo, Chen Wang, and Teruo's work.\n\n**Choosing citations for integral and transform formulas**\n\nWe can cite search sources since they include credible snippets, though it\u2019s better to directly reference open views. For formulas like the Plancherel theorem, Mellin transform, and Euler integral, we\u2019ll use DLMF and MSE resources. For the Cauchy distribution, MSE or Wikipedia is appropriate based on available snippets.\n\n**Planning the integral computation and report structure**\n\nI\u2019m working on computing an integral numerically using mpmath and ensuring that my report is well-rounded, with expanded citations like MSE, DLMF, Wikipedia, and mpmath documentation. I'll need to perform numerical checks on hypergeometric functions, potentially using high precision for stability. The core aim is clarity in my report, backed up with reproducible results.\n\n**Computing with high precision**\n\nAlright, let's calculate using mpmath with high precision. I\u2019ll make sure I use enough digits to ensure stability in the results. Precision is key here, so I\u2019ll set a high level of digits and proceed carefully with numerical integration and the hypergeometric functions.\n\n**Implementing integral with substitution**\n\nI\u2019m going to integrate over \\( x \\) from 0 to infinity. Using the substitution \\( x = t^2 \\), the integrand becomes \\( 2 \\cdot F(t^2)^2 \\). Time to implement this approach and compute the result. This should simplify things numerically. Let\u2019s give it a go!\n\n**Testing integral computation with intervals**\n\nI'm thinking of splitting the integral into intervals [0,1], [1,5], [5,20], and [20,\u221e] to better handle the computation. This way, I can avoid any potential issues with convergence and precision. Time to test this approach and see how it works! Let's go ahead!\n\n**Computing closed form expression**\n\nI got the numerical value 2.4606853024494251... Now, let's focus on finding the closed form expression. The formula involves \u03c0, \u0393(1/4), and a logarithmic expression. After breaking down the logarithms, I confirmed that ln(3+\u221a8) can be rewritten as 2 ln(1+\u221a2). Now, let's compute the closed form.\n\n**Calculating error**\n\nThe closed form seems to match the numerical integral, with a very small difference, around 2e-23. I\u2019ll compute the error now to confirm how close the results really are and whether this small difference is within the acceptable tolerance. Let's try to quantify the error more precisely.\n\n**Providing methodology and proof**\n\nThe error is small, likely due to the precision used in the calculation, so that's great. For reproducibility, we'll provide code that outputs the numeric value, closed form, and difference. I'll also mention integration issues for infinite ranges but present the method we used. As for the proof, we\u2019ll ensure detailed steps, including justifications and proper definitions such as the Mellin transform, Beta function, and others. Citations will be included as needed.\n\n**Explaining the approach using Mellin transform**\n\nI\u2019m starting by defining f(x) as the function from the series. We want to compute the integral I = \u222b_0^\u221e f(x)^2 x^{-1/2} dx. I\u2019ll use the Mellin transform, with Ramanujan\u2019s master theorem to express f(x) in a form we can analyze. The coefficient formula needs to be simplified using gamma functions, and I\u2019ll establish the identity for the series.\n\n**Explaining coefficient simplification**\n\nI\u2019m trying to simplify the ratio between Pochhammer symbols. It looks like we can use the relation (a)_n/(a+1)_n = a/(a+n), which works well for this case, especially with the duplication formula for Pochhammer symbols. This would help combine (5/8)_n and (9/8)_n using the identity for (a)_n and (a+1/2)_n.\n\n**Simplifying the coefficient formula**\n\nI\u2019m simplifying the expression for the coefficient \\( c_n \\). Using properties of Pochhammer symbols, I derive that \\( c_n = \\frac{(5/8) 2^{-2n} (5/4)_{2n}}{(1/2)_n (5/8 + n)} \\). Now, I can express \\( (5/4)_{2n} \\) and \\( (1/2)_n \\) in terms of Gamma functions to refine the coefficient further.\n\n**Final steps in using Ramanujan's theorem**\n\nI now have the function \\( f(x) \\) and its series expression in terms of \\( \\phi(s) \\), which matches the form required by Ramanujan's master theorem. In order to apply the theorem, I've defined \\( \\phi(s) \\). Now, to find the integral, I'll use Plancherel's theorem with a Mellin transform for \\( c = 1/4 \\), to evaluate \\( I \\).\n\n**Simplifying the Mellin transform calculation**\n\nNow that we've plugged in the Mellin transform formula, simplifying the constants and parameters seems to mostly lead to \\( C^2 \\) and the ratio of Gamma functions. After adjusting the modulus of terms where needed, we can express the integral for \\( I \\), and finally, I matched Teruo\u2019s formula, but there\u2019s a little discrepancy in the constant factor.\n\n**Aligning constants and adjustments in the integral**\n\nI need to align the constants properly with Teruo's derivation. By focusing on the scaling and variable changes, I realize my constant mismatch comes from the \\( t \\)-variable scaling. After carefully cross-checking, I find that replacing the variable correctly will adjust the denominator and refine the constant results.\n\n**Finalizing constant removal and simplifying integral**\n\nI can now plug in the simplifications for the constants and the integral terms. The expression simplifies as expected, scaling down to a cleaner form based on Teruo's steps. From there, I focus on evaluating the integral, handling the log term, and ensuring consistency in factors related to omega (\u03c9).\n\n**Finalizing integral evaluation and preparing justification**\n\nThe integral simplifies to a form involving logarithmic terms and rational functions, yielding an expression that's consistent with Cleo's result, and I confirm it by simplifying the logarithmic ratio. Now, I need to address convergence by justifying decay with the Plancherel theorem and hypergeometric function behavior for large values of x.\n\n**Clarifying references and structure for the paper**\n\nThe Mellin transform suggests the fundamental strip for convergence is between 0 and 5/8, which includes c=1/4. We should mention conditions for square-integrability and convergence using gamma asymptotics and the Stirling formula, but perhaps not in full detail. I\u2019ll also need to properly structure sections with citations, particularly for the Beta function and related integrals.\n\n**Finalizing citation strategy for Beta function**\n\nI think pulling up the Wikipedia Beta function page might be the easiest way to get a reliable citation. The page includes necessary formulas and integral representations. We have two calls left, so I\u2019ll use one for this, making sure to stay within the call limits.\n\n**Finalizing citations and response structure**\n\nWe now have the Beta function page with all the formulas, including the integral definition and its relation to Gamma, which we're citing properly. I\u2019ll avoid further web calls since we're close to the call limit. I'll carefully place citations at the end of sentences and avoid citing within code blocks to maintain clarity.\n\n**Finalizing sources and citations for integral identity**\n\nWe have a good set of references now, including the DLMF page, Beta function, Mellin transform, and more. Regarding the integral identity, I\u2019ll cite the relevant MSE thread for Teruo\u2019s formula, alongside the Cauchy distribution snippet that appears relevant. I\u2019ll work with what's available and avoid any further web calls.\n\n**Citing Cauchy distribution characteristic function**\n\nThe MSE page containing the Cauchy distribution characteristic function gives us the relevant formula for our integral, so I'll cite that directly. I should also include an independent reference like the Wikipedia Beta function for completeness. I might additionally cite the Cauchy distribution page for context.\n\n**Finalizing citations for integral formula**\n\nThe formula we need is equivalent to the one for the Cauchy distribution, so I'll cite that page. We'll also include the mpmath docs (for the code), DLMF for Pochhammer relations, and the MSE thread for the integral identity. It\u2019ll be good to cover everything for completeness.\n\n**Crafting the report structure**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to structure the report around the user\u2019s request. We\u2019ll include the \"Related work/ prior solutions\" section summarizing contributions from Cleo, Chen Wang, and Teruo. I\u2019ll also add an appendix detailing Chen Wang\u2019s generalization, with a equations inclusion. I should include citations and use Markdown sections, adjusting for clarity and assumptions.\n\n**Organizing the report structure**\n\nI should structure the report with the requested sections: start with the problem statement and claimed evaluation. Then, move into background, existing solutions, and a section on notation and definitions\u2014listing things like Gamma, Mellin transform, and Pochhammer symbol. I'll include lemmas, proof steps, numerical verifications, the public-domain solutions comparison, and a references section.\n\n**Including conditions, verification, and public solutions**\n\nI need to mention the conditions for convergence in the fundamental strip where Mellin transform holds, specifically that it\u2019s valid for \\( 0 < \\text{Re}(s) < 5/8 \\). I\u2019ll clarify this, then proceed to the Python code for numerical verification, referencing mpmath. Also, I'll mention the generalizations seen in public-domain solutions like Chen Wang's generalization.\n\n**Clarifying citations and structure for the report**\n\nIt looks like we need to clarify references, especially with \"Cleo's\" result from Mathematics Stack Exchange and also correct the mention of \"Stack Overflow\". I'll deliver a comprehensive report with citations, ensuring that they don\u2019t appear in code fences. A sample output block will be included for reproducible results, and citations will appear separately.\n\n**Crafting report structure and defining terms**\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for clarity and precision in the report. For instance, define abbreviations like \"MSE\" as \"Mathematics Stack Exchange\" and terms like \"mpmath\" or \"Meijer G-function\" where appropriate. The report structure will include sections like introduction, comparison to prior solutions, notation, proof, numerical verification, and references. I'll be careful to ensure full explanation of each specialized term. Let's now move to structuring the proof.\n\n**Deriving identity directly without external references**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of deriving the identity involving Pochhammer symbols using basic product manipulations instead of relying on the gamma duplication formula. The steps involve expanding the product for the symbols, ultimately simplifying it into a form that matches the desired identity. This way, we avoid needing a citation for a duplication formula."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 23m 39s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiaeast-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-bb76e83b-d2b8-4ff7-bb1a-594dfc80c9e1:AU","parent_id":"3a2c8f96-7d5a-4623-a2b1-84944ad5a111","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_697c1b21ac4c819186167736f5d54432","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"697c1b21-eb70-83a0-8c32-4d52d309f1c3","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-30T02:44:50.220022Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"3a2c8f96-7d5a-4623-a2b1-84944ad5a111","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"bb76e83b-d2b8-4ff7-bb1a-594dfc80c9e1","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"177d9443-c190-4157-852a-8febcbc0b08c","finished_duration_sec":1419,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3a2c8f96-7d5a-4623-a2b1-84944ad5a111","children":["0058bb99-2b3d-4e68-b766-9fa5f544c9b1"]},"0058bb99-2b3d-4e68-b766-9fa5f544c9b1":{"id":"0058bb99-2b3d-4e68-b766-9fa5f544c9b1","message":{"id":"0058bb99-2b3d-4e68-b766-9fa5f544c9b1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1769742509.942411,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s what the web search turned up, and how it should change the structure/citation plan of a \u201cself\u2011contained verification report\u201d.\n\n## What\u2019s already in the public domain\n\nThe integral in your screenshot is from a **Mathematics Stack Exchange** thread (not Stack Overflow, though it\u2019s the same Stack Exchange network). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201\n\nThat thread contains three relevant public-domain pieces:\n\n1. **Cleo (2014)**: states the closed form\n\\[\nI=\\frac{50\\pi^{3/2}}{3\\,\\Gamma(\\tfrac14)^2}\\Bigl(\\ln(3+\\sqrt8)-\\sqrt2\\Bigr).\n\\]\nNo proof is provided in the post. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201\n\n2. **Chen Wang (2014)**: gives a **parameterized generalization** \\(I(a)\\) expressed in terms of a **Meijer \\(G\\)-function**, and for the specific parameter value reduces correctness to evaluating a particular \\(G^{2,2}_{3,3}(1)\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn6view1\ue202turn6view2\ue201\n\n3. **Teruo (2022)**: gives an **explicit proof** of Cleo\u2019s formula using **Ramanujan\u2019s Master Theorem** + a **Plancherel/Parseval identity for the Mellin transform**, reducing the problem to an elementary integral and producing the same closed form. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view2\ue202turn6view3\ue201\n\nSo: if your report\u2019s purpose is \u201cverify Cleo\u2019s answer\u201d, it\u2019s now reasonable to (a) cite these as prior art, and (b) choose one of the existing complete derivations (Teruo) as the main proof, while optionally adding an independent proof (e.g., a cosine/Fourier approach) as an appendix.\n\n---\n\n## Reworked structure for a self-contained report\n\nBelow is a structure that is both self-contained and properly positions/credits what already exists publicly.\n\n### Title page\n- Title: \u201cEvaluation of a squared \\({}_3F_2\\) integral and verification of Cleo\u2019s closed form\u201d\n- Author, date, software environment (Python, mpmath versions).\n\n### Abstract\n- One paragraph:\n  - Define \\(I\\).\n  - State the closed form.\n  - Summarize proof method(s): Mellin/Parseval (main), Meijer \\(G\\) (cross-check), numerical verification.\n\n### 1.

\ue200cite\ue202turn6view2\ue202turn6view3\ue201  \n- Use **Chen Wang\u2019s Meijer \\(G\\)** as a brief cross-check/alternative representation (plus your Python can verify it independently). \ue200cite\ue202turn6view1\ue202turn6view2\ue201  \n- Put any \u201cnew\u201d derivation you like (cosine-transform, \\(E_1\\)-reduction, etc.) into an appendix so it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re ignoring existing public work.\n\nIf you want, I can turn this structure into an actual writeup (full prose, full derivations, and a fully spelled-out lemma/proof chain) while keeping it self-contained and properly

The user wants a proper references section, so I\u2019ll gather accurate citations before including them. I can't directly use raw URLs, but I\u2019ll list references with titles, including citation numbers as footnotes, instead of raw markdown links unless explicitly asked.\n\n**Preparing markdown with citations**\n\nI need to embed citations in the markdown, avoiding raw URLs and instead providing clickable links. The student should see the references properly without raw links. I\u2019ll also include bibliographic entries and avoid mentioning \"(website)\" or similar terms outside of citations. Finally, I\u2019ll ensure to deliver markdown content directly in the chat instead of as a downloadable file.\n\n**Structuring report and citations**\n\nThe report needs to be structured with definitions, lemmas, theorems, Python code, and numerical output. We\u2019ll need to guide the user through each section, including recommended methodology and logical flow. The references section will be comprehensive and include citations to sources like the DLMF and academic papers, using proper formatting.\n\n**Finalizing references and methodology**\n\nThe user wants a comprehensive references section, so I should include key sources, like the MSE thread and specific chapters from the DLMF. For the Ramanujan Master Theorem, I can cite the arXiv or Straub's PDF. I\u2019ll also highlight the methodology, prioritizing Teruo\u2019s method for the main proof with an optional alternative.\n\n**Creating a step-by-step guide and gathering sources**\n\nI need to outline the process for solving the integral, detailing each step and justifying decisions like interchanging integrals and applying the Ramanujan Master Theorem. I will provide Python code guidelines, ensuring high precision with mpmath, and include placeholders for the student to fill in. I\u2019ll also gather up-to-date sources for references.\n\n**Refining search for MSE thread**\n\nIt seems the previous search didn\u2019t return the specific MSE thread I need, possibly due to recency. I\u2019ll try a more direct query to focus on that particular thread and see if it's a better match. Hopefully, this will give me the relevant result!\n\n**Refining search for integral thread**\n\nI still haven\u2019t found the specific integral thread I\u2019m looking for. To improve the search, I\u2019ll try using the exact expression from the query. Hopefully, this will lead me straight to the right thread! Trying more specific details should help narrow it down.\n\n**Opening the page with the specific MSE thread**\n\nI found an MSE badge page that mentions the thread, along with some top posts by the user Chen Wang. Now, I need to find the actual question: the \u201cCrazy \u222b0^\u221e 3F2...\u201d one. I\u2019ll open the badge page, which might contain a link to the question. Let's go ahead and explore.\n\n**Opening the MSE thread using available links**\n\nI\u2019ve got links with ids 28 and 49 that should lead me to the question. I\u2019ll go ahead and click on them to open the thread. Let\u2019s start with either view0 (id 28) or view1 (id 49) to see which one leads to the correct page.\n\n**Gathering final citations**\n\nWe now have the question page with answers from Cleo, Chen, and Teruo\u2014I'll cite that for public domain solutions. I already have citations for the DLMF pages. Next, I need to find and include the mpmath documentation. I\u2019ll search for that to round out the references.\n\n**Searching for Meijer G documentation**\n\nI have the mpmath docs for hypergeometric, quad, and exponential integrals, but I still need the Meijer G docs. I\u2019ll start by checking the hypergeometric page, which may include references to Meijer G, though I\u2019m not sure. If not, I\u2019ll search specifically for \"mpmath Meijer G\" to locate the page.\n\n**Locating Parseval formula for Mellin**\n\nWe already have the DLMF pages, but I now need to find the specific Parseval Mellin formula, which is mentioned in DLMF 1.14 (iv). I\u2019ll try opening the DLMF pages and searching for \"Parseval\" to locate the relevant equation. I\u2019ll check the nearby sections to pinpoint the correct formula to cite.\n\n**Organizing the markdown document for a graduate student report**\n\nAlright, the task is clear: create a markdown document outlining the report structure for a graduate-level math student. I\u2019ll include a full statement of the desired result, a comprehensive citations section, and instructions for methodology, phrasing, and logical flow. I won\u2019t include raw URLs, and I need to ensure the references are cited properly, including the DLMF pages, Ramanujan\u2019s master theorem, and other sources.\n\n**Guiding the citations in the report**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019ll need to provide citations in a format that makes them clickable without raw URLs. For instance, I can create references like \"NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, \u00a716.2 Definition...\". Since the user didn't explicitly ask for raw links, I'll include the (website) citation instead. I'll also remind the student to follow a standard bibliographic style and include proper references or DOIs in their report. This will align the citations with academic standards.\n\n**Formatting citations for the student**\n\nI can format the references in a human-readable style like: \"NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF), \u00a716.2, 'Definition and Analytic Properties' (Generalized hypergeometric functions).\" Since I can't include raw URLs, I'll advise the student to replace the text with proper hyperlinks, and suggest including the stable permalink for DLMF, such as \"http://dlmf.nist.gov/1.14.E36.\"\n\n**Guidelines for report citations and methodology**\n\nWe can tell the student to use DLMF permalinks (like 1.14.E36) and avoid raw URLs. In the references section, they should cite equations like \"DLMF (1.14.36)\" or \"DLMF \u00a71.14(iv), Eq. (1.14.36)\", and for MSE threads, cite authors with details. For the Ramanujan master theorem, use appropriate citation style. We should also guide them on algorithmic verification and using Teruo's proof. If they prefer another proof, they should ensure it's well-supported.\n\n**Creating the markdown structure and guidelines**\n\nWe need to outline the structure for the report. This includes defining functions and expressing key equations step by step, using Ramanujan\u2019s Master Theorem to compute the Mellin transform, applying Parseval\u2019s theorem, and evaluating necessary integrals. We\u2019ll suggest a second independent derivation, like Meijer G representation for cross-checking. The user needs to ensure the report defines all variables, avoids ambiguity, and justifies interchanges. Python code and reproducible output should be included as well. Don't forget to emphasize this should be self-contained, with clear citations.\n\n**Designing the report structure and citation guidelines**\n\nWe need to create a clear structure for the report, starting with the specification and moving through sections like Abstract, Introduction, Preliminaries (with key definitions and citations), Lemmas with references, and the Main Proof following Teruo\u2019s steps. We should also include an Alternative cross-check (Meijer G representation), numerical verification with Python code (ensuring reproducible output), and cite everything properly, avoiding certain formatting like markdown bold/italic for citations.\n\n**Providing output instructions and citation guidance**\n\nIn the report, the student will run code and include output, possibly using example output with a disclaimer on minor differences. The code snippet will include `mpmath.hyper`, `mpmath.meijerg`, and `mp.quad`. Also, the report should have a \"Reproducibility section\" with environment info. References should be comprehensive, including sources like DLMF and relevant papers, along with citations to web sources for tools like mpmath and SciPy.\n\n**Crafting markdown doc guidance and citing sources**\n\nTo ensure a precise and comprehensive markdown, I\u2019ll craft sections with objectives, required content, and"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 10m 14s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiaeast-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-bb5abd4d-7881-4ab7-a5a0-59a27b082f09:AU","parent_id":"c3670d49-1269-4ed0-8953-9e2181e15f3a","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_697c229882548191b8a8d4868f4d77b2","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"697c2298-8554-839e-81d4-2c15d1ae95a9","async_task_created_at":"2026-01-30T03:16:40.797290Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"c3670d49-1269-4ed0-8953-9e2181e15f3a","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"bb5abd4d-7881-4ab7-a5a0-59a27b082f09","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"2f4131b9-c13a-47c7-8608-2111ae480653","finished_duration_sec":614,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c3670d49-1269-4ed0-8953-9e2181e15f3a","children":["bdf01f3e-90b5-475c-a87d-2f6ccad96491"]},"bdf01f3e-90b5-475c-a87d-2f6ccad96491":{"id":"bdf01f3e-90b5-475c-a87d-2f6ccad96491","message":{"id":"bdf01f3e-90b5-475c-a87d-2f6ccad96491","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769743615.229467,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["```markdown\n# Writing Specification: Verification Report for a Hypergeometric Integral (Graduate Level)\n\nThis document specifies **exactly** what your report must contain, how it should be organized, and what level of rigor and reproducibility is expected.

Full statement of the desired result\n\n### 1.1 Definition of the integral\n\nDefine\n\\[\nI \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left[\\,{}_3F_{2}\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\tfrac58,\\tfrac58,\\tfrac98\\\\[2pt]\\tfrac12,\\tfrac{13}{8}\\end{matrix}\\Big|-x\\right)\\right]^{2}\\,\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x}}.\n\\]\n\n### 1.2 Theorem (target closed form)\n\nYou must prove:\n\n> **Theorem.**  \n> \\[\n> \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left[\\,{}_3F_{2}\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\tfrac58,\\tfrac58,\\tfrac98\\\\[2pt]\\tfrac12,\\tfrac{13}{8}\\end{matrix}\\Big|-x\\right)\\right]^{2}\\,\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x}}\n> \\;=\\;\n> \\frac{50\\,\\pi^{3/2}}{3\\,\\Gamma(\\tfrac14)^{2}}\\Bigl(\\ln(3+\\sqrt8)-\\sqrt2\\Bigr).\n> \\]\n>\n> Optionally note the identity \\(\\ln(3+\\sqrt8)=2\\ln(1+\\sqrt2)\\), hence the bracket equals \\(2\\ln(1+\\sqrt2)-\\sqrt2\\).\n\n### 1.3 Attribution / prior public domain context (must be included)\n\nYou must include a short \u201cprior art\u201d paragraph attributing:\n\n- The **closed form statement** to \u201cCleo\u201d on Mathematics Stack Exchange.\n- A **generalization / Meijer \\(G\\)** representation by Chen Wang (same thread).\n- A **complete Mellin-transform proof** by Teruo (same thread).\n\nYour report is allowed to reproduce the proof strategy, but must be written in your own exposition and must clearly cite where the approach appears in the public domain.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Required report structure (with methodology and phrasing guidance)\n\nYour report must have the sections below, in the order given.\n\n### 2.1 Title, Abstract, and metadata\n\n#### Title\nA descriptive title, e.g.\n> *Evaluation of a squared \\({}_3F_2\\) integral and verification of a closed form*\n\n#### Abstract (5\u201310 lines)\n- State the integral \\(I\\).\n- State the closed form.\n- Summarize the proof route (recommended: Mellin transform + Parseval; optional cross-checks).\n- Mention numerical verification: precision used and agreement.\n\n#### Computational metadata (1 short paragraph)\nRecord:\n- Python version\n- package versions (at minimum: `mpmath`)\n- working precision used (digits)\n\n**Recommended phrasing:**  \n\u201cWe computed the numerical integral using `mpmath.quad` at `mp.mp.dps = 80` digits and report the agreement with the closed form.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Introduction and prior art\n\n#### Required contents\n- A clear restatement of the problem and why it is nontrivial.\n- A short subsection **\u201cPrior Art / Public Domain Solutions\u201d**:\n  - cite the Math Stack Exchange thread, and briefly describe the three contributions (Cleo, Chen Wang, Teruo).\n- A sentence stating what your report contributes: *a self-contained, fully justified proof plus reproducible verification.*\n\n**Recommended phrasing style**\n- Short, factual, non-promotional.\n- Do not assume the reader has seen the thread.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Notation and definitions\n\nThis section must make the paper self-contained.\n\n#### Must define (with references)\n- Gamma function \\(\\Gamma(z)\\).\n- Pochhammer symbol \\((a)_n\\).\n- Generalized hypergeometric series \\({}_pF_q\\).\n- Any integral transform you use (recommended: Mellin transform).\n- Any special functions introduced in auxiliary steps (e.g. Meijer \\(G\\), exponential integral \\(E_1\\)), if used.\n\n#### Required conventions\n- Branch conventions for complex powers if relevant (e.g. principal branch for \\((1-zu)^{-\\alpha}\\) if you ever use it).\n- Your normalization for the Mellin transform:\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{M}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,x^{s-1}\\,dx\n  \\]\n  (or whichever you choose, but it must be stated explicitly).\n\n**Recommended phrasing:**  \n\u201cWe use the Mellin transform \\(\\mathcal M\\{f\\}(s)=\\int_0^\\infty f(x)x^{s-1}\\,dx\\) whenever the integral converges.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Convergence and justification of manipulations\n\nBefore proving the theorem, you must address legitimacy of:\n- termwise expansions,\n- swapping integrals (Tonelli/Fubini),\n- moving contours (if any),\n- applying Parseval/Plancherel identities.\n\n#### Required components\n1. **Local behavior at 0 and \\(\\infty\\)**: show the integral defining \\(I\\) converges.\n2. **A clear statement** of which theorem you invoke when swapping order:\n   - Tonelli (nonnegative integrand),\n   - Fubini (absolute integrability),\n   - dominated convergence (uniform domination).\n\n**Recommended phrasing:**  \n\u201cSince the integrand is nonnegative, Tonelli\u2019s theorem applies and we may interchange the order of integration.\u201d\n\nYou must cite a real analysis reference for Tonelli/Fubini if you use them nontrivially.\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Toolbox: Lemmas and cited facts\n\nCreate a section titled **\u201cLemmas and Standard Results\u201d**. Each lemma must include:\n- statement,\n- proof (if short) or a precise citation,\n- where it is used later (e.g. \u201cUsed in Step 3 of the proof.\u201d)\n\n#### Required lemma list (minimum)\n\nYou must include at least the following (with citations):\n\n1. **Definition/series for \\({}_pF_q\\)**  \n   Used to expand the function and identify coefficients.\n\n2. **Ramanujan\u2019s Master Theorem (RMT)**  \n   You must state a version adequate for your application and explicitly discuss conditions (or analytic continuation) in your setting.\n\n3. **Parseval/Plancherel identity for the Mellin transform**  \n   State with your normalization and constants.\n\n4. **Gamma function identities** used in simplification  \n   - duplication formula and/or reflection formula as needed,\n   - shift: \\(\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)\\).\n\n5. **Beta function identity and integral representation**  \n   \\(B(p,q)=\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(q)/\\Gamma(p+q)\\) and \\(B(p,q)=\\int_0^1 t^{p-1}(1-t)^{q-1}\\,dt\\).\n\n6. **A standard Fourier-type integral** if you evaluate an integral of the form  \n   \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{iaz}}{b^{2}+z^{2}}dz\\)  \n   If you use this, either provide a short residue proof (preferred) or cite a complex analysis reference.\n\n#### Optional (only if used)\n- Meijer \\(G\\)-function definition / Mellin\u2013Barnes form.\n- Euler integral representation for \\({}_2F_1\\).\n- Exponential integral \\(E_1\\) definition and asymptotics.\n\n---\n\n### 2.6 Main proof of the theorem (recommended methodology)\n\n#### Strong recommendation for the main proof route\nUse **Teruo\u2019s Mellin-transform approach** as the primary proof framework, because it is clean, systematic, and produces the logarithmic constant naturally.\n\nYour exposition must be self-contained: you may follow the strategy, but you must supply all missing details and justify all interchanges.\n\n#### Required logical flow (outline to implement)\n\nWrite the proof as **numbered steps**:\n\n**Step 1: Define the hypergeometric function**\nLet\n\\[\nf(x):={}_3F_2\\!\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\tfrac58,\\tfrac58,\\tfrac98\\\\[2pt]\\tfrac12,\\tfrac{13}{8}\\end{matrix}\\Big|-x\\right).\n\\]\nThen \\(I=\\int_0^\\infty f(x)^2 x^{-1/2}\\,dx\\).\n\n**Step 2: Expand \\(f\\) into a power series**\nUse the \\({}_pF_q\\) definition to write:\n\\[\nf(x)=\\sum_{n\\ge 0} c_n (-x)^n,\n\\qquad c_n=\\frac{(\\tfrac58)_n(\\tfrac58)_n(\\tfrac98)_n}{(\\tfrac12)_n(\\tfrac{13}{8})_n}\\frac1{n!}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Apply Ramanujan\u2019s Master Theorem**\nIdentify the coefficient function \\(\\varphi(n)\\) appearing in the RMT format and compute the Mellin transform \\(\\mathcal M\\{f\\}(s)\\).\nBe explicit about the range of \\(\\Re(s)\\) where the Mellin transform converges and how you extend if needed.\n\n**Step 4: Use Mellin Parseval/Plancherel**\nConvert\n\\[\nI=\\int_0^\\infty f(x)^2 x^{-1/2}\\,dx\n\\]\ninto an integral involving \\(\\mathcal M\\{f\\}(s)\\) along a vertical line in the complex plane.\nState the Mellin Parseval formula with your constants and show the hypotheses are satisfied.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the gamma products**\nUse gamma identities (duplication, shift, etc.) to simplify the Mellin-side integrand. Keep the algebra transparent:\n- show intermediate expressions,\n- avoid \u201cafter simplification\u201d leaps without at least one displayed intermediate line.\n\n**Step 6: Convert gamma ratios to beta integrals**\nAt the point where you have ratios like \\(\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(q)/\\Gamma(p+q)\\), introduce a beta integral to reduce the expression.\n\n**Step 7: Evaluate the remaining contour/real integral**\nPerform the remaining integral(s). If you use residues, provide a short computation and show the decay estimate needed for closing the contour.\n\n**Step 8: Reduce to an elementary real integral**\nYou should arrive at an elementary one-dimensional integral over \\([0,1/2]\\) of the form\n\\[\n\\int_0^{1/2}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega}}{1-\\omega}\\,d\\omega\n\\]\n(or an equivalent expression) and evaluate it explicitly. Show the substitution(s) and the final simplification to\n\\[\n2\\ln(1+\\sqrt2)-\\sqrt2\n\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\n\\ln(3+\\sqrt8)-\\sqrt2.\n\\]\n\n**Step 9: Assemble constants**\nCombine all prefactors carefully and use \\(\\Gamma(\\tfrac54)=\\tfrac14\\Gamma(\\tfrac14)\\) to produce the final closed form.\n\n#### Writing/phrasing requirements for the proof\n- Each step begins with a short sentence: \u201cWe now compute\u2026\u201d, \u201cWe apply\u2026\u201d, \u201cWe justify\u2026\u201d\n- Every lemma used must be referenced by number: \u201cBy Lemma 3\u2026\u201d\n- Every nontrivial interchange (\u201cswap integrals\u201d, \u201cswap sum and integral\u201d, \u201cmove contour\u201d) must have:\n  - the theorem invoked, and\n  - a one-line reason it applies (nonnegative integrand / absolute integrability / domination).\n\n---\n\n### 2.7 Optional sections (recommended, but not required)\n\n#### (A) Cross-check via Meijer \\(G\\) (Chen Wang)\nInclude a short section showing that Chen Wang\u2019s representation specializes to your case. You do **not** need to re-derive Meijer \\(G\\) theory, but you must:\n- state the representation,\n- define Meijer \\(G\\) (or cite DLMF for the definition),\n- use it as a consistency check (and verify numerically in Python).\n\n#### (B) Alternative proof appendix (only if you add your own approach)\nIf you include any independent derivation (e.g., a Fourier/cosine transform reduction), put it in an appendix and treat it as supplementary. The main proof should remain the Mellin approach for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### 2.8 Numerical verification (Python, reproducible output)\n\nThis must be an explicit, executable section.\n\n#### Required features\n1. Use **high precision** arithmetic and print the working precision.\n2. Compute the integral numerically in at least **one robust way**.\n3. Compute the closed form numerically.\n4. Print:\n   - numerical value,\n   - closed form value,\n   - absolute difference (and optionally relative error).\n5. Record the output in the report.\n\n#### Strong recommendation: use two independent numerical checks\n- **Check 1:** numerical quadrature of the defining integral, with a substitution removing the \\(x^{-1/2}\\) factor:\n  - let \\(x=t^2\\), so \\(dx/\\sqrt{x}=2dt\\) and\n    \\[\n    I=2\\int_0^\\infty f(t^2)^2\\,dt.\n    \\]\n- **Check 2 (cross-check):** evaluate Chen Wang\u2019s Meijer \\(G\\) expression numerically and compare to the closed form.\n\n#### Required code style\n- Put code in a single block.\n- Avoid hidden state; set `mp.mp.dps` explicitly.\n- Split integrals into `[0, 1]` and `[1, mp.inf]` to help the integrator.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Reference list to include at the end of the report (comprehensive)\n\nInclude a **References** section with entries that look like standard bibliographic citations.

Final note on style and rigor\n\nThis is a verification report, not an informal solution sketch.
