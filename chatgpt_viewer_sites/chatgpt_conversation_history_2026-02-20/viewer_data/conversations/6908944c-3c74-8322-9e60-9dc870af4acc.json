Previously accessed via the terminal, Ollama's newly bundled desktop app allows users to run models, input prompts, and interact in a more user-friendly environment. It supports features like multimodal input (e.g., dragging and dropping images and code files), expanding its utility with models that can interpret different file types. The app includes basic settings, such as context window size, which trades off system memory use for functionality.\n\nWhile advanced features like pushing and managing models still require the CLI, the GUI improves accessibility for everyday users. Installation is straightforward via Ollama's website, and the app runs in the background, accessible from the system tray or Start Menu. System requirements include at least an 11th Gen Intel or Zen 4 AMD CPU, with 16GB of RAM recommended for optimal performance, though some smaller models run on as little as 8GB. GPU support isn\u2019t mandatory but enhances performance. Though web search isn\u2019t included, Ollama supports powerful offline capabilities, enhancing privacy and independence from cloud-based models.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":85},"pub_date":1754397282.0,"attribution":"www.windowscentral.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/ditch-ollama-and-use-lm-studio-for-local-ai-if-you-have-a-laptop-or-mini-pc","title":"You NEED to ditch Ollama and use LM Studio for local AI if you have a laptop or mini PC - here's why","snippet":"The article advocates for using LM Studio over Ollama for running local large language models (LLMs), especially on laptops and mini PCs that rely on integrated graphics rather than dedicated GPUs. While Ollama is praised for its simplicity and powerful performance on high-end systems with dedicated GPUs like the RTX 5080 or 5090, it lacks official support for integrated GPUs on Windows, defaulting to CPU usage which results in slower performance.\n\nLM Studio, on the other hand, excels on systems with integrated GPUs, such as the Geekom A9 Max mini PC. It offers seamless GPU offloading using Vulkan for both AMD and Intel integrated graphics, allowing users to bypass CPU limitations and get better performance. The application also features an intuitive and advanced GUI, eliminating the need for third-party tools to enhance usability. The setup process is straightforward\u2014simply load a model, adjust GPU offload settings, and start working.\n\nOverall, LM Studio provides a more efficient and user-friendly experience for local AI tasks on less powerful hardware, making it the recommended choice for non-desktop environments lacking a dedicated graphics card.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":86},"pub_date":1755601920.0,"attribution":"www.windowscentral.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/how-to-install-and-use-ollama-to-run-ai-llms-on-your-windows-11-pc","title":"How to install and use Ollama to run AI LLMs locally on your Windows 11 PC","snippet":"This guide explains how to install and use Ollama, a tool that allows users to run AI large language models (LLMs) locally on a Windows 11 PC. Unlike cloud-based AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot that require internet connectivity, Ollama enables you to operate LLMs natively without cloud reliance \u2014 ideal for developers or privacy-conscious users.\n\nOllama is compatible with Windows 11, macOS, and Linux (including WSL), and supports running models via CPU or GPU. To use larger models efficiently, a modern PC with a dedicated GPU and at least 8GB RAM is recommended, though smaller models can also run on CPU-only systems.\n\nInstallation is straightforward \u2014 users can download the installer from Ollama\u2019s official site or GitHub. Once installed, Ollama runs in the background and can be verified at localhost:11434.\n\nOllama includes both a GUI and CLI interface, and supports integrations like Page Assist and OpenWebUI for advanced model management. To run a model, users can use terminal commands like `ollama run gemma:1b`. The GUI also allows simple interactions and model selection. This setup makes running local LLMs highly accessible, even for non-experts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":87},"pub_date":1755792465.0,"attribution":"www.windowscentral.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69089484c2308320a6c84486a664ed81","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Creating a roadmap for practicing with open-source LLMs","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"e257c550-0ace-406e-8450-fc236386a4d3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"2e8129a6-cba9-4abd-b9e5-b8d74c998b02","turn_exchange_id":"bd5a2df6-a82a-4ba7-beaf-dfbdb8db1a12","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2e8129a6-cba9-4abd-b9e5-b8d74c998b02","children":["537729a9-81dd-49a1-b4e2-a96f01667c11"]},"537729a9-81dd-49a1-b4e2-a96f01667c11":{"id":"537729a9-81dd-49a1-b4e2-a96f01667c11","message":{"id":"537729a9-81dd-49a1-b4e2-a96f01667c11","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762169995.565491,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering TGI for inference","content":"I need to make sure I mention TGI (Text Generation Inference by Hugging Face), as it\u2019s likely essential for the user\u2019s needs, especially as they're looking into these model ecosystems.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria granted Meta summary judgment, ruling that the company's use of the books constitutes fair use. However, the judge emphasized that the decision was based on the plaintiffs' inadequate legal arguments rather than a definitive legal endorsement of Meta's methods. He dismissed two key arguments, stating that Meta's Llama AI doesn\u2019t reproduce enough content from the books to constitute infringement and that the authors do not have an exclusive right to license their works for AI training. Judge Chhabria acknowledged a potentially stronger argument \u2014 that Meta\u2019s AI could saturate the market with similar content \u2014 but criticized the plaintiffs for failing to support this claim convincingly. The ruling follows a similar fair use decision in favor of Anthropic, reinforcing a trend, but with cautionary notes about the legal complexities of AI training and copyright.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1750896824.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-ai-llama-3","title":"Meta's New Llama 3.1 AI Model Is Free, Powerful, and Risky","snippet":"Meta has unveiled Llama 3.1, an advanced AI model released for free, in a significant break from the closed models preferred by most AI companies. While Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg parallels Llama's potential impact to the open-source Linux operating system, concerns about the model's unrestricted application proliferate. Despite safeguards, Llama 3.1\u2019s openness raises fears of misuse in cybercrime and weapon development. Not truly open source due to usage restrictions, the model\u2019s development mirrors self-interest as Meta aims to influence AI research and development circles. Offering 405 billion parameters, Llama 3.1 surpasses its predecessors and requires cloud hosting for operation. The release aligns with Meta's strategy to enhance AI access while tackling safety and ethical implications. The model's potential to democratize AI advances is noteworthy, but balancing innovation with security remains critical.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1721747118.336,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/e77968015b94fbbf38234e3178ede578","title":"Judge dismisses authors' copyright lawsuit against Meta over AI training","snippet":"A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Meta Platforms by 13 prominent authors, including Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who accused the tech giant of using their books without permission to train its AI system, Llama. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that the plaintiffs failed to present appropriate legal arguments and evidence to support their claims. However, Chhabria emphasized that the ruling does not affirm the legality of Meta's actions, and other authors may pursue similar claims with stronger arguments. Meta welcomed the decision, reaffirming its stance on fair use in AI development. The judge criticized the notion that enforcing copyright laws would hinder technological advancement and underscored the potential profitability of AI, suggesting companies can afford to compensate authors. In a related case, another judge recently ruled that AI company Anthropic did not violate copyright laws when training its chatbot, Claude, although it must face trial for acquiring books from pirated sources. This ongoing legal struggle highlights growing tensions between AI development and copyright protections, with courts signaling that missteps in legal strategy\u2014not necessarily lack of merit\u2014can derail challenges to AI data practices. The dismissed case does not impact other potential plaintiffs similarly affected.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1750890445.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69089484c2308320a6c84486a664ed81","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching model family licenses and terms","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"e257c550-0ace-406e-8450-fc236386a4d3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"b1d001a2-2fdc-4f83-8230-638ce923e853","turn_exchange_id":"bd5a2df6-a82a-4ba7-beaf-dfbdb8db1a12","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b1d001a2-2fdc-4f83-8230-638ce923e853","children":["bb833652-5f49-4d3c-bcdf-601c10896c00"]},"bb833652-5f49-4d3c-bcdf-601c10896c00":{"id":"bb833652-5f49-4d3c-bcdf-601c10896c00","message":{"id":"bb833652-5f49-4d3c-bcdf-601c10896c00","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762170043.639066,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"MLOps basics","content":"I need to cover MLOps basics like DVC for dataset management, Weights & Biases or MLflow for experiment tracking, and Hydra for configs.

Unlike cloud-based AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot that require internet connectivity, Ollama enables you to operate LLMs natively without cloud reliance \u2014 ideal for developers or privacy-conscious users.\n\nOllama is compatible with Windows 11, macOS, and Linux (including WSL), and supports running models via CPU or GPU. To use larger models efficiently, a modern PC with a dedicated GPU and at least 8GB RAM is recommended, though smaller models can also run on CPU-only systems.\n\nInstallation is straightforward \u2014 users can download the installer from Ollama\u2019s official site or GitHub. Once installed, Ollama runs in the background and can be verified at localhost:11434.\n\nOllama includes both a GUI and CLI interface, and supports integrations like Page Assist and OpenWebUI for advanced model management. To run a model, users can use terminal commands like `ollama run gemma:1b`. The GUI also allows simple interactions and model selection. This setup makes running local LLMs highly accessible, even for non-experts.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"You NEED to ditch Ollama and use LM Studio for local AI if you have a laptop or mini PC - here's why","url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/ditch-ollama-and-use-lm-studio-for-local-ai-if-you-have-a-laptop-or-mini-pc?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The article advocates for using LM Studio over Ollama for running local large language models (LLMs), especially on laptops and mini PCs that rely on integrated graphics rather than dedicated GPUs. While Ollama is praised for its simplicity and powerful performance on high-end systems with dedicated GPUs like the RTX 5080 or 5090, it lacks official support for integrated GPUs on Windows, defaulting to CPU usage which results in slower performance.\n\nLM Studio, on the other hand, excels on systems with integrated GPUs, such as the Geekom A9 Max mini PC. It offers seamless GPU offloading using Vulkan for both AMD and Intel integrated graphics, allowing users to bypass CPU limitations and get better performance. The application also features an intuitive and advanced GUI, eliminating the need for third-party tools to enhance usability. The setup process is straightforward\u2014simply load a model, adjust GPU offload settings, and start working.\n\nOverall, LM Studio provides a more efficient and user-friendly experience for local AI tasks on less powerful hardware, making it the recommended choice for non-desktop environments lacking a dedicated graphics card.","attribution":"Windows Central"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":87},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":86}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Windows Central"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":1616,"end_idx":1635,"safe_urls":["https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"ggml-org/llama.cpp: LLM inference in C/C++","url":"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The main goal of llama.cpp is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of hardware - locally and in the ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"GitHub"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":1835,"end_idx":1867,"safe_urls":["https://docs.vllm.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([docs.vllm.ai](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI-Compatible Server - vLLM","url":"https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"vLLM provides an HTTP server that implements OpenAI's Completions API, Chat API, and more!
