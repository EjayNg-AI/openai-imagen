Despite intense lobbying from Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump, the vote's outcome remained uncertain due to slim Republican margins and internal dissent. Fiscal conservatives, particularly from the House Freedom Caucus, opposed the bill's deficit-increasing components, while moderates decried cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs. Trump maintained the bill would spur unprecedented economic growth and denied it included Medicaid cuts, contradicting independent analyses. The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, faces fierce opposition from Democrats who argue it benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable populations. Amid the legislative standoff, Trump also attacked critics on social media and threatened CNN over its reporting. Other highlights included a federal judge blocking Trump's asylum ban, the Pentagon halting some Ukraine aid, and controversy over \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a harsh migrant detention facility in Florida. Democrats and even former President Obama criticized the bill, urging lawmakers to reject it. Delays due to weather and internal disagreements continued to hinder progress toward Trump\u2019s targeted Independence Day passage.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751513479.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/a63fdc61d56b7e7fea1c3ea58d07392b","title":"With public ban on band Bob Vylan, Trump appears to ease visa privacy rules to make a point","snippet":"The Trump administration has publicly revoked the U.S. visas of British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan following a controversial chant led by the band\u2019s frontman at the Glastonbury Festival, where he encouraged the crowd to shout \"Death to the IDF\" in protest of the war in Gaza. Typically, visa decisions are confidential, but Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau announced the revocations on social media, citing the band's \"hateful tirade.\" The band denied allegations of antisemitism, claiming they are being targeted for expressing political views. This case is part of a broader Trump administration campaign to revoke visas from individuals it believes advocate antisemitic or pro-militant messages. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently stated that around 300 visas had been rescinded on similar grounds. This shift reflects a relaxed adherence to traditional privacy rules for visa decisions, aiming to highlight ideological standards for foreign visitors. Historical precedents of politically motivated visa revocations include figures like Charlie Chaplin and John Lennon. Amnesty International has criticized such ideological exclusions, viewing them as tools to suppress dissenting voices.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751485294.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-h1b-visa-trump-student-employment-tech-4b7e5d9d4abb4df27832c12574c79f42","title":"What is the highly coveted H-1B visa?

Truth Social applied for one","snippet":"Truth Social, the social media company founded by former President Donald Trump, applied for an H-1B visa in June 2022 to employ a worker with a salary of $65,000, although it ultimately did not hire the employee. This application comes despite Trump\u2019s frequent criticism of the H-1B visa program, suggesting it disadvantageous for U.S. workers and promoting an agenda to restrict such visas. Trump\u2019s investment firm, led by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had also been approved for hiring a foreign worker under the same visa program. This conflict highlights a discrepancy between Trump\u2019s political stance on protecting American jobs and his businesses utilizing such immigration tools. Trump Media & Technology Group claimed the application was made under prior management and it terminated the process in November 2022. The H-1B program is notably used by tech companies and fields requiring skilled labor, supporting small businesses' survival by enabling them to retain vital skilled employees.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1713844992.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/02/trump-labor-department/","title":"Trump to cut protections for home health aides, migrant farmworkers","snippet":"The U.S. Labor Department, under President Donald Trump's administration, announced plans to eliminate over 60 worker protection regulations. Key changes include rescinding overtime and minimum wage protections for home health care workers and removing union organizing rights for H-2A migrant farmworkers. These efforts align with Trump's aim to deregulate and promote economic growth, as outlined in a previous executive order requiring agencies to cut ten existing rules for each new one. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a Republican with bipartisan support, emphasized reducing regulatory burdens. Other proposed rollbacks encompass relaxed safety reporting requirements and the elimination of affirmative action mandates in registered apprenticeships, which critics argue could exacerbate gender and racial inequalities. The administration also plans to reverse Obama-era rules extending labor protections to in-home care workers, arguing they increase service costs, and to undo Biden-era protections for seasonal farmworker unionization, citing stricter immigration enforcement goals. However, no actions have yet been proposed on issues like independent contractors or ethical retirement investing.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751454037.969,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mayerbrown.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2024/12/h1b-modernization-bidens-final-move-trump-first-challenge","title":"H-1B Modernization: Biden's Final Move, Trump's First Challenge?","snippet":"The new regulation takes effect on January 17, 2025.

Initially, Trump opposed the H-1B program, but his stance softened, later leading to an executive order banning the visas, which was overturned by a federal court. Recently, tech leaders like Elon Musk defended the program, clashing with Trump's allies who see it as harmful. Critics argue the H-1B program depresses wages and promotes outsourcing, while supporters contend it fosters innovation and growth. Bipartisan reform efforts have emerged, calling for higher wages and better protection for U.S. workers, but the tech industry lobbies to maintain the status quo. The future of the program remains uncertain under Trump's administration, with both potential reforms and continued support from key figures in play.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1736204296.89,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-immigration-policy-ai-tech-worker-shortage-2024-11","title":"Silicon Valley is on edge as Trump's immigration policy sparks fears of a high-tech talent shortage","snippet":"Many in Silicon Valley fear the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies on the tech industry's workforce. Concerns have risen about potential restrictions on hiring skilled immigrants, notably through the H-1B visa program which plays a crucial role in staffing the tech sector. During his previous term, Trump increased visa-application denial rates and sought to restrict temporary work visas. Experts and industry leaders worry stricter immigration laws could exacerbate existing high-tech talent shortages, particularly in fields like AI. Despite some hope inspired by figures such as Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance, who may influence immigration policy favorably, many anticipate challenges ahead.

This appointment has revealed a divide between Trump's tech supporters and far-right followers. Krishnan, a general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has a notable background leading product teams at major tech companies. Defenders of Krishnan, including Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, praise his contributions and call for an appreciation of skilled immigrant workers.

Elon Musk and other tech executives, who support high-skilled legal immigration, clashed with critics on the right, who argue it suppresses American wages. Musk aggressively defended the H-1B program, attributing his and other talented individuals' contributions to America's strength. The dispute highlighted a split within the GOP, with pro-business factions supporting high-skilled immigration and nativist right factions opposing it. Stephen Miller, a key figure in shaping Trump's restrictive immigration policies, stands as Musk's main adversary. Miller, who will have another significant role in Trump's second term, aims to limit legal immigration. Despite Trump's occasional positive remarks about H-1B visas, Miller's influence suggests restrictive policies will likely prevail. Adding complexity, Trump's appointment of Stephen Miller's wife, Katie, to a position alongside Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at the Department of Government Efficiency, indicates Miller's continued strong influence in the administration's immigration stance.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1735593600.0,"attribution":"www.vox.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/everybodys-got-to-go-home-ex-trump-adviser-steve-bannon-demands-end-to-h-1b-visas-amid-mass-tech-layoffs/articleshow/121227860.cms","title":"'Everybody's got to go home': Ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon demands end to H-1B visas amid mass tech layoffs","snippet":"Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has strongly condemned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to approve over 135,000 H-1B visas in 2025, labeling it \"outrageous.\" His criticism stems from the context of widespread layoffs among entry-level tech workers in the U.S. and growing fears of job displacement due to advancements in artificial intelligence.

Initially, Trump opposed the H-1B program, but his stance softened, later leading to an executive order banning the visas, which was overturned by a federal court. Recently, tech leaders like Elon Musk defended the program, clashing with Trump's allies who see it as harmful. Critics argue the H-1B program depresses wages and promotes outsourcing, while supporters contend it fosters innovation and growth. Bipartisan reform efforts have emerged, calling for higher wages and better protection for U.S. workers, but the tech industry lobbies to maintain the status quo. The future of the program remains uncertain under Trump's administration, with both potential reforms and continued support from key figures in play.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Elon Musk is on a collision course with Stephen Miller","url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/392864/elon-musk-vivek-h1b-visas-trump-stephen-miller?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1735593600.0,"snippet":"Over the holidays, a public feud erupted within the MAGA movement over the H-1B visa program. Elon Musk and other tech executives, who support high-skilled legal immigration, clashed with critics on the right, who argue it suppresses American wages. Musk aggressively defended the H-1B program, attributing his and other talented individuals' contributions to America's strength. The dispute highlighted a split within the GOP, with pro-business factions supporting high-skilled immigration and nativist right factions opposing it. Stephen Miller, a key figure in shaping Trump's restrictive immigration policies, stands as Musk's main adversary. Miller, who will have another significant role in Trump's second term, aims to limit legal immigration. Despite Trump's occasional positive remarks about H-1B visas, Miller's influence suggests restrictive policies will likely prevail. Adding complexity, Trump's appointment of Stephen Miller's wife, Katie, to a position alongside Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at the Department of Government Efficiency, indicates Miller's continued strong influence in the administration's immigration stance.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Top

Despite his immense financial resources\u2014having spent $288 million to support Trump-aligned candidates\u2014Musk's political influence is waning. His efforts, including a high-profile but failed bid to influence the Wisconsin Supreme Court race and his controversial U.S. DOGE Service initiative, have undermined his popularity. Though third-party attempts have historically failed in U.S. politics, Musk's entry could still disrupt the system. He has pledged to oppose lawmakers like Rep. Thomas Massie who resist Trump\u2019s spending agenda. Despite overwhelming public support (58%) for a third party, experts doubt Musk's political viability, citing a polarized environment and Musk's polarizing presence. Critics, including Trump allies, ridicule Musk's plans, while scholars suggest the most successful role for him may be as a financial backer rather than a front person.

Despite Musk's commendation of Trump\u2019s international diplomacy, he has renewed criticism of Trump's flagship legislative initiative, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, labeling it as \"utterly insane\" and \"political suicide\" due to concerns over its fiscal impact and reduced green energy subsidies. Musk has pledged to support Rep. Thomas Massie, a formidable opponent of the bill. In response, Trump criticized Musk\u2019s reception of subsidies and even suggested a review of Musk\u2019s U.S. citizenship status, despite his naturalization in 2002.

Musk condemned the bill as destructive, wasteful, and harmful to future-focused industries, accusing lawmakers of undermining economic progress. He labeled the political landscape a \"one-party country\" and mocked it as the \"PORKY PIG PARTY,\" also calling for the formation of a new political party. The president responded by highlighting Musk\u2019s past endorsements and his opposition to electric vehicle mandates, which were rolled back in the new bill. The Senate passed the contentious bill by a narrow 51-50 vote.

The feud reignited following Musk's public criticism of the president and threats from Trump to investigate and potentially deport Musk. The billionaire predicted Bannon may return to prison, referencing his prior sentence for defying a congressional investigation. In retaliation, Bannon harshly criticized Musk, questioning his patriotism and urging him to return to South Africa. Tensions worsened as Musk labeled Bannon with offensive language and threatened political action against Trump and his allies, including launching a new political party. Meanwhile, Bannon has suggested nationalizing SpaceX and questioned Musk\u2019s loyalty to Trump's voter base.

The discussion reviews DOGE's evolution since January, highlighting Musk\u2019s and the Trump administration's controversial involvement.

Despite his immense financial resources\u2014having spent $288 million to support Trump-aligned candidates\u2014Musk's political influence is waning. His efforts, including a high-profile but failed bid to influence the Wisconsin Supreme Court race and his controversial U.S. DOGE Service initiative, have undermined his popularity. Though third-party attempts have historically failed in U.S. politics, Musk's entry could still disrupt the system. He has pledged to oppose lawmakers like Rep. Thomas Massie who resist Trump\u2019s spending agenda. Despite overwhelming public support (58%) for a third party, experts doubt Musk's political viability, citing a polarized environment and Musk's polarizing presence. Critics, including Trump allies, ridicule Musk's plans, while scholars suggest the most successful role for him may be as a financial backer rather than a front person. Musk has threatened swift action, stating the \u201cAmerica Party\u201d will be formed if the \u201cinsane\u201d spending bill is passed, signaling a volatile and unpredictable path forward for his political ambitions.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Musk Renews Promise to Start New Rival Political Party-With Patriotic Name-as Trump Debates Deporting Him","url":"https://time.com/7299223/musk-new-politcal-america-party-bill-trump-feud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1751390859.0,"snippet":"Elon Musk has renewed his pledge to establish a new political entity, the \"America Party,\" following the Senate's narrow approval of President Donald Trump's controversial \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Once a strong Trump supporter and his largest 2024 campaign donor, Musk condemned the bill as excessive and wasteful, calling it \"a disgusting abomination.\" He vowed that if the bill passed, his new party would form, targeting what he calls the \"Democrat-Republican uni-party.\" Musk's tensions with Trump have escalated since leaving his post at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with Trump responding by suggesting he might consider deporting Musk, a dual U.S.-South African citizen.\n\nMusk has mobilized his vast social media following to oppose the bill and has pledged to support primary challengers against Republicans who backed it. His America PAC spent around $200 million supporting Trump\u2019s campaign, highlighting a sharp reversal in their alliance. Musk\u2019s new party aims to represent the \"80% in the middle,\" though no detailed policies have been unveiled. Andrew Yang, founder of the Forward Party, has expressed interest in collaborating with Musk.
