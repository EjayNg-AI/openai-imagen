A standard counterexample is the **Sierpi\u0144ski space**: it is compactly generated in the usual sense (a quotient of \\([0,1]\\)) but your intersection test would force it to be discrete, so the \u201ciff\u201d fails. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201\n\nWhat *is* true:\n\n- **With the weak Hausdorff hypothesis** (the usual CGWH setting), your statement *does* become equivalent: if \\(X\\) is weak Hausdorff, then a set \\(A\\subseteq X\\) is k-closed iff \\(A\\cap K\\) is closed in \\(K\\) for every **compact Hausdorff** subspace \\(K\\subseteq X\\). (In a weak Hausdorff space, images of compact Hausdorff spaces are closed and, in fact, compact Hausdorff subspaces.) \ue200cite\ue202turn7view2\ue201\n\n- **Without** assuming weak Hausdorff, the correct purely \u201cinternal\u201d test is to use **all compact subspaces (not required Hausdorff)**:  \n  \\(A\\subseteq X\\) is closed in a compactly generated space iff \\(A\\cap K\\) is closed in \\(K\\) for every **compact subspace** \\(K\\subseteq X\\). This is one of the standard equivalent definitions of compactly generated spaces. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n- For **Hausdorff spaces**, the common definitions (via maps from compact Hausdorff domains, via intersections with compact subspaces, and via intersections with compact Hausdorff subspaces) **all coincide**, so your formulation is fine there. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nSo, to fix your statement: add \u201c**and \\(X\\) is weak Hausdorff**,\u201d or drop \u201cHausdorff\u201d from \u201ccompact Hausdorff subset.\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue201","start_idx":427,"end_idx":444,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactly_generated_space"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactly_generated_space))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Compactly generated space -

Here\u2019s a clean proof.\n\n# Theorem\nIf \\(X\\) is **weak Hausdorff** and \\(f:K\\to X\\) is continuous with \\(K\\) **compact Hausdorff**, then the image \\(Y:=f(K)\\subseteq X\\) (with the subspace topology) is **compact Hausdorff**.\n\n# Proof\n\n1) **Compactness and closedness of the image.**  \n\\(Y\\) is compact as the continuous image of a compact space. By weak Hausdorffness, the image of any compact Hausdorff space is **closed** in \\(X\\); hence \\(Y\\) is closed in \\(X\\).\n\n2) **The corestriction is a quotient map.**  \nLet \\(q:K\\to Y\\) be \\(f\\) with codomain restricted. For any \\(A\\subseteq Y\\),\n- if \\(A\\) is closed in \\(Y\\), then \\(q^{-1}(A)\\) is closed in \\(K\\) (continuity of \\(q\\));\n- conversely, if \\(q^{-1}(A)\\) is closed in \\(K\\), then \\(q^{-1}(A)\\) is compact Hausdorff, so its image \\(A=f(q^{-1}(A))\\) is closed in \\(X\\) by weak Hausdorffness, hence closed in \\(Y\\).\nThus \\(A\\) is closed in \\(Y\\) iff \\(q^{-1}(A)\\) is closed in \\(K\\); i.e. \\(q\\) is a **quotient map** onto \\(Y\\).\n\n3) **The identification relation is closed.**  \nLet\n\\[\nR=\\{(x,x')\\in K\\times K \\mid q(x)=q(x')\\}.\n\\]\nThen \\(R=(f\\times f)^{-1}(\\Delta_X)\\), where \\(\\Delta_X\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is the diagonal. A standard (equivalent) characterization of weak Hausdorffness is that \\(\\Delta_X\\) is **closed in the Kelleyfication** \\(k(X\\times X)\\). Since \\(K\\times K\\) is compact Hausdorff, the map \\(f\\times f:K\\times K\\to k(X\\times X)\\) is continuous (by definition of \\(k(-)\\)), so \\(R=(f\\times f)^{-1}(\\Delta_X)\\) is **closed** in \\(K\\times K\\).\n\n4) **Hausdorffness of the image.**  \nA quotient of a compact Hausdorff space by a **closed** equivalence relation is **compact Hausdorff**. Hence \\(K/R\\) is compact Hausdorff. Because \\(q\\) is a quotient and \\(R\\) is exactly the identification relation of \\(q\\), we have a canonical homeomorphism \\(K/R \\cong Y\\). Therefore \\(Y\\) is compact Hausdorff.\n\n\u220e\n\n**Remarks.**\n- Step (3) used the well-known equivalence: \\(X\\) is weak Hausdorff \\(\\Longleftrightarrow\\) \\(\\Delta_X\\) is closed in \\(k(X\\times X)\\).  \n- Consequently, in a weak Hausdorff space, *every* continuous image of a compact Hausdorff space sits as a **closed, compact Hausdorff subspace**.

All of these hold for **CGWH** (= compactly generated, weak Hausdorff) spaces and are exactly why algebraic topologists work there:\n\n## Category-theoretic \u201cconvenience\u201d\n- **Complete & cocomplete.** All small limits/colimits exist.  \n  Colimits are formed in **Top** and then *k-ified* (and WH-reflected), so cell attachments/pushouts are straightforward.\n- **Coreflective in Top.** The **k-ification** \\(k:\\mathrm{Top}\\to\\mathrm{CG}\\) is left adjoint to inclusion; you can \u201cfix\u201d a bad space by k-ifying without changing its maps out of compact Hausdorff sources.\n\n## Function spaces & closure properties\n- **Cartesian closed.** For \\(X,Y,Z\\) in CGWH, the compact-open topology makes \\(C(Y,Z)\\) again CGWH and\n  \\[\n  C(X\\times Y,Z)\\;\\cong\\; C\\!\\big(X,\\,C(Y,Z)\\big)\n  \\]\n  homeomorphically (the **exponential law**). This underpins homotopies, mapping cylinders, adjunctions, etc.\n- **Based version is closed symmetric monoidal.** With smash product \\(\\wedge\\) and internal hom \\(F_*(-,-)\\),\n  \\[\n  \\mathrm{Map}_*(X\\wedge Y,Z)\\;\\cong\\;\\mathrm{Map}_*\\!\\big(X,F_*(Y,Z)\\big).\n  \\]\n- **Weak Hausdorff payoffs.** Images of compact Hausdorff spaces are **closed and compact Hausdorff**; diagonals are \u201cclosed enough\u201d (closed in \\(k(X\\times X)\\)). This prevents many quotient/pathologies.\n\n## Stability under constructions used constantly\n- **Subspaces, products, coproducts, quotients** of CGWH spaces are CGWH (for quotients: by closed equivalence relations; in practice satisfied by standard gluings).\n- **Products with compact Hausdorff preserve good maps.** If \\(K\\) is compact Hausdorff, then \\(K\\times(-)\\) preserves quotient maps and closed embeddings\u2014crucial for cylinders \\(X\\times I\\), mapping paths, and cofibration stability.\n- **CW complexes live here.** CW complexes (with the weak topology) are CGWH; skeleta are closed; attaching-cell pushouts stay within CGWH.\n\n## Homotopy-theoretic infrastructure\n- **Topological enrichment.** CGWH is enriched/tensored/cotensored over itself:  \n  tensors \\(X\\otimes K=X\\times K\\), cotensors \\(X^K=C(K,X)\\). Path and cylinder objects exist internally (\\(X^I,\\,X\\times I\\)).\n- **Model-category friendliness.** With the usual (Serre/Hurewicz) choices, CGWH supports a **proper, cofibrantly generated, topological** model structure: mapping spaces encode hom-objects; pushout-product and SM7-type axioms hold in the needed forms for doing homotopy (co)limits, factorizations, and spectral constructions.\n- **Geometric realization & simplicial techniques behave.** Realization of simplicial CGWH spaces lands in CGWH and interacts well with products with compact Hausdorff factors\u2014used all over homotopy colimits and spectral sequences.\n\nIn one line: **CGWH** gives you compact-open mapping spaces that stay in the category, well-behaved quotients and gluings, closed images of compacts, and enough categorical muscle (limits/colimits, enrichment, exponentials) to run modern homotopy theory cleanly."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2990,"end_idx":2990,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-67edfc6c0ed48191847b196e079f709b","request_id":"31fefff8-a74e-4218-ab90-179b3293107c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e0f5181d-c251-41b4-9fd0-c85995269fa3","turn_exchange_id":"30e81633-3ce0-4632-861e-abf0345f9589","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"e0f5181d-c251-41b4-9fd0-c85995269fa3","children":[]}}}
