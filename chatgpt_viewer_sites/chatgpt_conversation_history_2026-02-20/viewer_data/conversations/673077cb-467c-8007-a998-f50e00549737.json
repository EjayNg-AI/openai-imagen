Deadpan Humor**\n- **Definition:** Humor delivered with an expressionless, emotionless tone and face, making it hard to tell if the speaker is joking.\n- **Key Features:** \n  - Relies heavily on delivery.\n  - The humor lies in the contrast between the absurdity of what\u2019s said and the lack of reaction by the speaker.\n- **Example:** \u201cI never forget a face, but in your case, I\u2019ll make an exception.\u201d (Said without a hint of expression or smile.)\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Sarcasm**\n- **Definition:** A form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Often cutting or biting.\n  - Requires the listener to interpret the opposite of the literal meaning.\n- **Example:** When it's pouring rain and someone says, \"Lovely weather we're having.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Sardonic Wit**\n- **Definition:** Humor that is grim, mocking, or cynical, often to make a point about a harsh truth.\n- **Key Features:**\n  - More biting and intellectual than sarcasm.\n  - Often used to critique societal norms or human nature.\n- **Example:** \u201cI did not attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it.\u201d (Mark Twain)\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Dry Humor**\n- **Definition:** Humor delivered in a subtle, understated way, often relying on irony or absurdity.\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Overlaps with deadpan but is broader.\n  - Relies on clever wordplay or an incongruity between content and delivery.\n- **Example:** \"I am on a seafood diet. I see food, and I eat it.\" (Said without fanfare.)\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Wry Humor**\n- **Definition:** A type of humor that is dry and ironic, often tinged with mild amusement or resignation about life\u2019s absurdities.\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Wry humor often feels less biting than sarcasm or sardonic wit.\n  - Frequently self-deprecating or pokes fun at the human condition.\n- **Example:** \u201cI can resist anything except temptation.\u201d (Oscar Wilde)\n\n---\n\n### Other Forms of Humor:\n\n#### **1. Slapstick**\n- Physical comedy involving exaggerated actions like pratfalls, pie-throwing, or other forms of clumsiness.\n- Example: Charlie Chaplin or Mr. Bean.\n\n#### **2. Satire**\n- Uses irony, exaggeration, and ridicule to criticize people, politics, or societal norms.\n- Example: Shows like *Saturday Night Live* or *The Onion*.\n\n#### **3. Parody**\n- Mimics the style of a work, genre, or individual for comedic effect.\n- Example: *Weird Al Yankovic*\u2019s musical parodies.\n\n#### **4. Black Humor (Dark Comedy)**\n- Makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious, taboo, or distressing.\n- Example: Jokes about mortality or existential despair.\n\n#### **5. Wordplay (Puns)**\n- Relies on the clever use of words with multiple meanings or similar sounds.\n- Example: \u201cTime flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.\u201d\n\n#### **6. Absurd Humor**\n- Based on illogical or nonsensical situations and ideas.\n- Example: Monty Python sketches.\n\n#### **7. Self-Deprecating Humor**\n- A person makes jokes at their own expense.\n- Example: \u201cI\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m just on energy-saving mode.\u201d\n\n#### **8. Observational Humor**\n- Highlights the humor in everyday situations or common experiences.\n- Example: Stand-up comedians like Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n#### **9. Juvenile Humor**\n- Simple, immature jokes, often involving bodily functions or slapstick.\n- Example: Bathroom humor.\n\n#### **10. Situational Comedy (Sitcom Humor)**\n- Humor arises from specific, often relatable, situations and character interactions.\n- Example: TV shows like *Friends* or *The Office*.\n\nHumor is incredibly diverse, and individual preferences often vary. Different types can overlap or blend, creating unique comedic styles."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"d0459ef6-abee-41bd-bb44-44e7a98febfa","request_id":"8e04e4557a5d9b93-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d0459ef6-abee-41bd-bb44-44e7a98febfa","children":[]}}}
