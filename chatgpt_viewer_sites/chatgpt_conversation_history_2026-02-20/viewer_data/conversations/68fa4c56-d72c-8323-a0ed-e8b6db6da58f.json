This declaration comes amid a heated international climate, with recent recognition of a Palestinian state by several countries such as France, Britain, and Canada. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to respond, while voices within his coalition, like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have opposed the idea of a Palestinian state.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement follows meetings with Arab leaders concerned about the repercussions of annexation, particularly given the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, violence has continued, with Israel conducting military operations in Gaza that have killed over 65,000 Palestinians. Trump also unveiled a new 21-point Middle East peace plan aimed at ending the near two-year Gaza war.\n\nInternational condemnation of Israeli settlements and efforts like the E1 project continue, while humanitarian aid struggles to reach Gaza.

Despite his close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Trump insisted \u201cit\u2019s time to stop,\u201d citing ongoing conflict in Gaza and regional instability.\n\nTrump\u2019s position comes amid Israel conducting a major offensive in famine-stricken Gaza and expanding settlements in the West Bank\u2014actions condemned by much of the international community, which largely views such settlements as illegal. Netanyahu\u2019s government, the most nationalist in Israeli history, opposes Palestinian statehood and supports annexation, risking internal coalition tensions.

In interviews with Bloomberg and BBC, Huckabee suggested any future Palestinian entity could originate from a Muslim country rather than involve Israeli territorial concessions. He dismissed the terms \"West Bank\" and \"occupation,\" referring instead to \"Judea and Samaria,\" aligning with Israeli right-wing narratives. Analysts view this as confirmation that the U.S. is abandoning the longstanding two-state solution framework. Critics, including scholars Khaled Elgindy and Yousef Munayyer, argue that this reflects a broader U.S. policy trend of undermining Palestinian sovereignty and rights, long masked by diplomatic language. Huckabee\u2019s evangelical beliefs and support for Israeli settlements influence his stance, reinforcing a narrative of Palestinian erasure. His comments come amid ongoing conflict in Gaza and coincide with new U.S. sanctions against Palestinian rights group Addameer and others, accused\u2014without corroborated evidence\u2014of supporting militant activity.

Trump highlighted the October 7 attacks, expressing that rewarding Hamas for such actions undermines peace. He reiterated his commitment to securing a cease-fire in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and called for the immediate release of hostages. \n\nTrump\u2019s statements contrast starkly with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently recognized Palestinian statehood as a step toward achieving peace and a two-state solution. Macron emphasized ending civilian suffering in Gaza, while Starmer described recognition as a move toward hope and a better future. Other countries, including Canada, Australia, and Portugal, have also declared support for Palestinian statehood.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich criticized these developments, with Smotrich advocating for West Bank annexation in response.

The survey results come ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington D.C. to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. The discussion between the leaders is expected to cover the future of the West Bank and normalization of ties with Arab nations. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has indicated that a Palestinian state is necessary for normalization with Israel, but over half of the Israeli respondents in the poll would not support a Palestinian state even with a Saudi peace deal. A significant portion of Israelis (80%) also supported the idea of Arab nations taking in more Palestinians from Gaza. The survey indicates a general shift in Israeli public opinion towards favoring sovereignty and security over a two-state solution.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1738619441.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Donald_Trump_Gaza_Strip_takeover_proposal","title":"2025 Donald Trump Gaza Strip takeover proposal","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1761196870.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_recognition_of_the_Golan_Heights_as_part_of_Israel","title":"United States recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1756837706.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Accords","title":"Abraham Accords","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1760441017.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_recognition_of_Jerusalem_as_capital_of_Israel","title":"United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1760762873.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Embassy_Act","title":"Jerusalem Embassy Act","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1755533466.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-10/19","title":"United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-10/19","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1755554848.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/09/06/israel-annex-west-bank-emirates-warning/","title":"Israel backs off talk of annexing West Bank after UAE warning","snippet":"In response to a strong warning from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed away from plans to formally annex large areas of the occupied West Bank. The UAE, a key Arab partner in the 2020 Abraham Accords, declared annexation a \"red line\" that could jeopardize regional integration and its normalization of relations with Israel. The warning, conveyed through public remarks and back-channel messages, prompted Israeli officials to remove annexation from a key political agenda. The situation exposes Netanyahu\u2019s dilemma: balancing pressure from domestic right-wing allies advocating annexation against the geopolitical need to preserve ties with Arab states, particularly the UAE and possibly Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile some Israeli ministers, like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, still push for annexation, other officials and analysts caution it would violate international law and provoke backlash across the Arab world. U.S. reactions have been muted, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio placing blame on European moves to recognize a Palestinian state. The broader concern includes preserving the Abraham Accords and maintaining Israel\u2019s international relationships amid ongoing war in Gaza and rising Palestinian casualties. Emirati leaders are increasingly wary of Israel's conduct, with fears that their alliance may become a political liability.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1757149200.06,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fa4c6895f88328937eeee0ddc75aa4","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"78f18972-4ba7-469e-9cc3-58c3dba9a6f3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"44034127-fe5b-4f15-8b31-dbc661401a80","turn_exchange_id":"6c3d2688-2554-4a33-94b0-682490adf8a3","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"44034127-fe5b-4f15-8b31-dbc661401a80","children":["c55eedf8-051e-42c3-bfbd-f7adf6cc4da4"]},"c55eedf8-051e-42c3-bfbd-f7adf6cc4da4":{"id":"c55eedf8-051e-42c3-bfbd-f7adf6cc4da4","message":{"id":"c55eedf8-051e-42c3-bfbd-f7adf6cc4da4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1761234026.050234,"update_time":1761234033.854505,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I couldn\u2019t find **definitive independent confirmation** that \ue200entity\ue202[\"people\", \"Donald Trump\", 0]\ue201 used *exactly* the wording shown in the screenshot \u2014 namely:  \n> \u201cIt won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. \u2026 Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.\u201d\n\nHere is what I *did* find, and what we can reasonably infer.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What *is* confirmed  \n1. Several news outlets report that Trump told \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\", \"TIME Magazine\", 0]\ue201 (in an interview) that Israel should *not* proceed with applying sovereignty/annexation over \ue200entity\ue202[\"place\", \"Judea and Samaria\", 0]\ue201 (i.e., the West Bank) because doing so would jeopardize U.S. support. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n2. The context is a Knesset bill (in Israel) which had a preliminary reading around 22 October 2025 to apply Israeli sovereignty to settlement areas in the West Bank. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n3. The Reuters / Associated Press reports: On 25 September 2025, Trump said he would \u201cnot allow Israel to annex the West Bank. \u2026 It\u2019s time to stop now.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue202turn0news9\ue201  \n4. In the interview with TIME (according to Israeli-media coverage), the President emphasised that he had given his \u201cword to the Arab countries\u201d that annexation would not occur, and that U.S. policy opposed such a step. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Important caveats & questions  \n- The quotes I located are from **secondary/tertiary sources** (Israeli news sites quoting the TIME interview). I did *not* find a publicly available full transcript of the TIME interview that *verifies the exact phrasing* (e.g., \u201close all of its support from the United States\u201d) in the screenshot.  \n- It\u2019s possible the media outlets slightly paraphrased or translated his remarks and added emphasis (\u201call of its support\u201d) that may not exactly match Trump\u2019s verbatim statement.  \n- Given Trump\u2019s long history of strong pro-Israel policies (in his first term and earlier statements), this sharp red-line position (threatening loss of US support) marks a *notable shift*, which raises the possibility of selective quotation or framing by intermediaries.  \n- One must also check what \u201csupport\u201d means in this context (military aid? diplomatic backing? recognition?) and whether the \u201cif that happened\u201d condition is absolute or conditional.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d The broader context  \n- The Israeli bill in question: The \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\", \"Knesset\", 0]\ue201 approved a preliminary reading of a proposal for the laws, judicial system, administration and sovereignty of Israel to apply to settlement areas in Judea and Samaria (West Bank) on 22 October 2025. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- Many Arab states (notably Saudi Arabia, UAE) have warned that formal annexation would jeopardise normalisation deals with Israel, and U.S. policy under Trump now appears to emphasise maintaining Arab-Israeli normalization and leverage of the U.S. role in the region. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- In that light, Trump\u2019s remarks can be seen as a diplomatic signal: **\u201cIf Israel moves with annexation now, it threatens the broader peace/normalisation agenda I am advancing with Arab states.\u201d**  \n- This is somewhat ironic given that in his first term, Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the \ue200entity\ue202[\"place\", \"Golan Heights\", 0]\ue201 and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 both moves widely seen as pro-Israel. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- So the shift likely reflects the changing regional environment (wartime in Gaza, strong Arab-state involvement, U.S. push for \u201cintegration\u201d rather than unilateral Israeli expansion) rather than a pure reversal of pro-Israel positioning.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e My judgement  \n- I **believe** Trump did make the core claim: that Israel moving ahead with sovereignty/annexation in Judea/Samaria would threaten U.S. support. The screenshot likely captures the gist of his remarks.  \n- But I **would not treat** the screenshot as *verbatim transcription* without reservation \u2014 some of the exact phrasing (\u201close all of its support\u201d, \u201cI gave my word to the Arab countries\u201d) may have been condensed or paraphrased by the news outlets quoting the interview.  \n- The context is that Trump is setting a red line for Israeli action in the West Bank, tying it to U.S. relations with Arab states and regional normalization.  \n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can attempt to locate the full transcript of the TIME interview (or original audio/video) to check the exact wording and provide a source-by-source comparison. Would you like me to do that?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"people\", \"Donald Trump\", 0]\ue201","start_idx":61,"end_idx":99,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Donald Trump","prompt_text":"Donald Trump","type":"alt_text"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\", \"TIME Magazine\", 0]\ue201","start_idx":486,"end_idx":531,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"TIME Magazine","prompt_text":"TIME Magazine","type":"alt_text"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"place\", \"Judea and Samaria\", 0]\ue201","start_idx":625,"end_idx":667,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Judea and Samaria","prompt_text":"Judea and Samaria","type":"alt_text"},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":738,"end_idx":796,"safe_urls":["https://matzav.com/trump-israel-would-lose-us-support-if-it-annexes-judea-and-samaria/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/10/23/trump-gaza-ceasefire-netanyahu-deal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.israelnationalnews.com/flashes/669064?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.israelnationalnews.com/flashes/669066?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Matzav](https://matzav.com/trump-israel-would-lose-us-support-if-it-annexes-judea-and-samaria/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Trump: 'Israel Would Lose US Support If It Annexes Judea ...","url":"https://matzav.com/trump-israel-would-lose-us-support-if-it-annexes-judea-and-samaria/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1761214555.0,"snippet":"1 hour ago \u2014 In a new interview with TIME Magazine, President Donald Trump made clear that Israel should not proceed with extending sovereignty over Judea ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Trump warns Israel annexation will end US support","url":"https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/10/23/trump-gaza-ceasefire-netanyahu-deal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"2 hours ago \u2014 Donald Trump threatened Benjamin Netanyahu with loss of all US support unless Israel's prime minister accepted a Gaza ceasefire agreement, ...","attribution":"www.israelhayom.com"},{"title":"Trump: 'Israel would lose all US support' if it applies ...","url":"https://www.israelnationalnews.com/flashes/669064?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1 minute ago \u2014 US President Donald Trump spoke to Time Magazine about Israel applying sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, and said, \"It won't happen.","attribution":"Israel National News"},{"title":"Trump: 'Israel would lose US support if it annexes Judea ...","url":"https://www.israelnationalnews.com/flashes/669066?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"2 hours ago \u2014 In an interview with TIME Magazine, President Trump said any Israeli move to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria would cost it US ...","attribution":"Israel National News"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Matzav"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":966,"end_idx":1011,"safe_urls":["https://maktoobmedia.com/gaza-genocide/trump-says-us-will-oppose-israeli-annexation-of-west-bank-amidst-global-outrage-over-knessets-vote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/10/23/trump-gaza-ceasefire-netanyahu-deal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-871299?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-871299?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"New bill on Israeli West Bank sovereignty passed by Knesset","url":"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-871299?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"22 hours ago \u2014 ...
