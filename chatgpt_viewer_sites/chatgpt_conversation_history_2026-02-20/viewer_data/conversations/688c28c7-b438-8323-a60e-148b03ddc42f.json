However, Germany and the UK remained non-committal, emphasizing Palestinian recognition must be part of a broader peace process that includes Israel's security.\n\nCeasefire talks between Hamas and Israel were expected to resume, amid Israel\u2019s claims of Hamas exploiting negotiations.

Legal and ethical debates are intensifying in the UK, where a judicial review has been sought over continued arms supplies to Israel amidst allegations of genocide. While Labour has partially suspended arms exports, recent data shows significant military equipment sales to Israel have continued.

The EU remains divided, and any recognition of Palestine or sanctioning of Israel requires consensus among all 27 member states\u2014something currently out of reach.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753967722.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.huffingtonpost.es","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.huffingtonpost.es/global/reconocimientos-cadena-palestina-que-espera-paso-mas-simbolico.html","title":"Reconocimientos en cadena del Estado de Palestina: qu\u00e9 se espera tras un paso mucho m\u00e1s que simb\u00f3lico","snippet":"En julio de 2025, Francia, Reino Unido y Canad\u00e1 anunciaron su intenci\u00f3n de reconocer al Estado de Palestina, lo que representa un cambio diplom\u00e1tico significativo en el contexto del conflicto palestino-israel\u00ed. Estas naciones del G7, influyentes y con peso internacional, justifican su decisi\u00f3n en la necesidad de revivir la soluci\u00f3n de dos Estados, fomentar la paz y presionar a Israel por su ofensiva en Gaza, que ha causado m\u00e1s de 60.000 muertos. Francia lider\u00f3 el movimiento, seguida por Reino Unido y Canad\u00e1, los cuales condicionaron su reconocimiento a acciones como reformas de la ANP, elecciones sin Ham\u00e1s y desmilitarizaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl reconocimiento se enmarca en un deterioro de las relaciones con Israel y crecientes tensiones humanitarias en Gaza, mientras aumenta la presi\u00f3n sobre gobiernos tradicionales aliados de Tel Aviv. La medida ha sido duramente criticada por Israel y EE.UU., que la consideran contraproducente y un premio a Ham\u00e1s. Aun as\u00ed, se espera un efecto domin\u00f3 en otros pa\u00edses occidentales.\n\nAunque no tiene efectos jur\u00eddicos inmediatos, el reconocimiento puede influir en procedimientos diplom\u00e1ticos y judiciales futuros. En paralelo, iniciativas ciudadanas y de di\u00e1logo como la Iniciativa de Di\u00e1logo Internacional siguen proponiendo soluciones viables para una paz duradera con dos estados.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753968217.0,"attribution":"www.huffingtonpost.es"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theonlinecitizen.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2025/07/30/singapore-is-prepared-in-principle-to-recognise-the-state-of-palestine/","title":"Singapore is prepared in principle to recognise the State of Palestine","snippet":"Singapore envoy Kevin Cheok delivered this position at a high-level United Nations conference in New York on 29 July 2025.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753843210.656545,"attribution":"www.theonlinecitizen.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.yenisafak.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.yenisafak.com/en/news/singapore-prepared-in-principle-to-recognize-palestine-3705693","title":"Singapore 'prepared in principle' to recognize Palestine - Yeni \u015eafak","snippet":"Singapore is \"prepared in principle\" to recognize a Palestinian state, and the key consideration is that such a move should help foster progress ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753936810.659198,"attribution":"www.yenisafak.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newsweek.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/us-sanctions-palestinian-leaders-peace-violations-visa-2106907","title":"US Blocks Visas for Palestinian Leaders - Newsweek","snippet":"As of mid-2025, 147 of the 193 United Nations member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, which holds non-member observer status ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753972810.680115,"attribution":"www.newsweek.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aa.com.tr","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/factbox-mapping-european-recognition-of-palestine/3642077","title":"FACTBOX - Mapping European recognition of Palestine","snippet":"As of now, 11 EU member states recognize State of Palestine, with France's upcoming recognition, that number is set to rise to 12 out of 27","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753411210.694318,"attribution":"www.aa.com.tr"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newarab.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newarab.com/news/which-countries-will-recognise-palestinian-state-2025","title":"Which countries will recognise a Palestinian state in 2025?","snippet":"These include: Cyprus, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Hungary.

France has recently announced its intention to recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing list of Western nations responding to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid Israel's conflict with Hamas. Britain and Canada have also indicated they may follow suit. Currently, 144 of the 193 UN member states recognize Palestine, including key global powers, though only a few EU members\u2014mainly former Communist countries, Sweden, and Cyprus\u2014have done so. The UN General Assembly granted Palestine non-member state status in 2012, marking a significant step toward wider international recognition.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Portugal to consult major parties about Palestine recognition, PM says","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/07/31/portugal-to-consult-major-parties-and-president-about-palestinian-state-recognition-pm-say?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753980010.697733,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Will Germany and Italy recognise Palestine as a state?","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/germany-palestine-state-friedrich-merz-063f7skhr?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753967722.0,"snippet":"As of July 2025, Germany and Italy are not planning to recognize Palestine as a state, reflecting broader divisions within the European Union on Middle East policy. Germany\u2019s Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni firmly oppose recognition, citing concerns that it would be premature and potentially counterproductive amid ongoing conflict. While Britain and France are moving toward support for Palestinian statehood, Germany insists such recognition should come only after a negotiated two-state solution begins. Italy echoes this stance, emphasizing that symbolic recognition won\u2019t solve the underlying issues.\n\nMeanwhile, some EU nations, including Sweden, the Netherlands, and Spain, are pressing for sanctions on Israel due to its actions in Gaza, especially regarding humanitarian access and military strikes. These countries propose freezing parts of the EU\u2019s trade and research agreements with Israel. Germany and Italy, historically strong allies of Israel due to their wartime pasts, are resistant to such measures, although pressure is mounting. The EU remains divided, and any recognition of Palestine or sanctioning of Israel requires consensus among all 27 member states\u2014something currently out of reach.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Further reading on European & global shifts\ue202turn0news36,turn0news35,turn0news54\ue201","start_idx":5624,"end_idx":5713,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/1f6874adbfe1d5be1fddce5a69c0f6ac?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://apnews.com/article/bb40a9ec020280a67c3427a17f95f0fb?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/122912146.cms?imgsize=18898&cfs=8JL5MBsDYFNo","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-will-recognise-palestine-state-macron-1st-in-g7-to-do-so/articleshow/122912142.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":54}],"alt":"- [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-will-recognise-palestine-state-macron-1st-in-g7-to-do-so/articleshow/122912142.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/bb40a9ec020280a67c3427a17f95f0fb?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/1f6874adbfe1d5be1fddce5a69c0f6ac?utm_source=chatgpt.com)","prompt_text":"\nnavlist containing the following URLs:\n- [France will recognise Palestine state: Macron;

In a letter addressed to Lord Hermer, the UK\u2019s attorney-general, the signatories argue that Palestine does not meet the four conditions for statehood as outlined in the Montevideo Convention of 1933: a permanent population, defined territory, functioning government, and capacity to enter diplomatic relations. They stress that such recognition would undermine the UK\u2019s stated commitment to international law and accuse Starmer of political expediency.\n\nThe pledge comes amid growing domestic and international tensions. Over 250 MPs have backed recognition, but critics, including Israeli officials, Jewish leaders, and families of hostages, warn it could embolden Hamas and derail peace efforts. Starmer maintains that the recognition is intended to support a two-state solution and spur peace negotiations, not act as a symbolic gesture. Meanwhile, Canada's commitment to recognizing Palestine triggered backlash from Israel and former U.S. President Donald Trump. The legal challenge coincides with Palestine Action gaining permission to contest its terrorist designation by the UK government, after a High Court ruled it potentially infringes on rights to protest and free speech.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753946100.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-plans-recognise-palestinian-state-september-unless-israel-takes-action-2025-07-29/","title":"UK plans to recognise Palestinian state in September unless Israel ...","snippet":"UK plans to recognise Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes action.

This declaration marks a significant shift in Canadian foreign policy and aligns it with recent similar moves by France and the UK. Trump criticized the decision on his Truth Social platform, linking it to stalled trade negotiations, which had a deadline of August 1. Talks have reportedly been disorganized, lacking progress toward an agreement to mitigate tariffs and avoid a trade war.\n\nCarney defended Canada's position, claiming it supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is based on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to reforms, electoral changes excluding Hamas, and state demilitarization. While Palestinian President Abbas welcomed the move, Israel condemned it, citing Hamas\u2019s 2023 violence and a lack of governance. Carney expressed urgency due to worsening conditions in Gaza and diminishing chances for peace, criticizing both Hamas and Israel\u2019s settlement expansions. He emphasized that recognition is intended to preserve peace and secure both Israel\u2019s and Palestine\u2019s futures.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753948800.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/germany-respond-any-unilateral-israeli-moves-palestinian-territories-minister-2025-07-31/","title":"Germany to respond to any unilateral Israeli moves on Palestinian ...","snippet":"Germany's foreign minister said on Thursday recognition of a Palestinian state should come at the end of talks on a two-state solution but ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753969504.937186,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/canada-plans-recognize-palestinian-state-raising-allies-pressure-israel-2025-07-31/","title":"Canada plans to recognize Palestinian state, raising allies' pressure on Israel","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753980304.836384,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.abc.net.au","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-25/palestinan-statehood-explainer-state-of-palestine-future/105572128","title":"Which countries recognise the state of Palestine.

The IMF notes that the U.S. is achieving a \"soft landing\" with inflation easing while job market damage remains minimal. Other emerging market economies, notably India and Brazil, also have positive growth projections, while China's growth forecast is dialed back due to weaknesses in the property sector and low consumer confidence. Despite overall global growth projections being tepid, at 3.2% for 2024 and slightly lower for 2025, the U.S. and some countries showcase economic resilience. Risks such as potential trade wars, inflation control policies, and geopolitical conflicts pose threats to this outlook.

However, this rebound masks underlying weaknesses, as the growth was mainly driven by a sharp decline in imports, which reduced the trade deficit and added significantly to GDP. Private domestic demand, a key measure of economic strength, grew at its slowest pace in 2.5 years. Consumer spending increased modestly by 1.4%, and business investment in equipment slowed after strong gains in Q1. Residential investment continued to contract, reflecting broader economic uncertainty influenced by ongoing trade policy instability and tariffs imposed under the Trump administration.\n\nDespite the positive headline figure, economists remain cautious, noting that the economy is not in recession but lacks the robustness needed for a confident outlook.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is under pressure due to the conflict between Germany\u2019s traditional support for Israel and increasing domestic demands to acknowledge Palestinian statehood in light of suffering civilians. Other G7 nations have taken varied stances: France plans to officially recognize Palestine in September, linking it to demilitarizing Hamas; Canada conditions recognition on excluding Hamas from future elections and implementing democratic reforms; the UK, under Sir Keir Starmer, has tied recognition to Israel\u2019s actions, including ending the humanitarian crisis and reviving peace talks. However, this position lacks clear criteria regarding Hamas's future role.\n\nThe push for recognition reflects broader disapproval of the Israeli far-right\u2019s aggressive policies on Gaza and the West Bank. Critics argue this recognition is premature and unclear in process. While 147 UN member states already recognize Palestine, a G7 move would mark a significant shift. The article emphasizes that genuine allies must urge Israel to prioritize humanitarian aid and a long-term peace solution, including cooperating with Arab nations and addressing Hamas\u2019s threat.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753996138.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/france-recognize-palestine-state-macron-800ed63143f0653a7f215ad96f7038d3","title":"Macron says France will recognize Palestine as a state | AP News","snippet":"French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will recognize Palestine as a state, amid snowballing global anger over people ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753325159.873083,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.economist.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/07/25/why-emmanuel-macron-has-decided-to-recognise-a-palestinian-state","title":"Why Emmanuel Macron has decided to recognise a Palestinian state","snippet":"France will become the first G7 country, and the most influential diplomatic voice, to make such recognition formal.

These moves bypass the long-stalled peace process that envisioned recognition following negotiations. With Israel continuing military operations in Gaza, proposing annexation of the West Bank, and consolidating control over East Jerusalem, observers question what entities remain to recognize as a Palestinian state.\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert views these recognitions as political rebukes to current Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has systematically opposed Palestinian statehood and expanded Israeli settlements. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's government, especially its far-right elements, rejects international recognition efforts and insists they reward Hamas, which reignited conflict with an attack in 2023.\n\nDespite symbolic rather than immediate territorial impact, recognition could uplift Palestinian morale, solidify diplomatic status, and bolster claims to self-determination. While over 147 countries already recognize Palestine, the support of major Western powers challenges long-standing U.S. and Israeli opposition. The U.S., frustrated, imposed sanctions on the PLO and promised to veto any upgrades in Palestine\u2019s UN status. However, a paradigmatic shift may be underway, leaving the U.S. increasingly diplomatically isolated on this issue.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753991546.163,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.state.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/united-states-rejects-a-two-state-solution-conference","title":"United States Rejects A Two-State Solution Conference","snippet":"President Macron's announcement about recognizing a Palestinian state was welcomed by Hamas.

The U.S. can override with financial and security guarantees.  \n* **Diplomatic signalling:** A G7 recogniser (France) plus possible UK recognition would shrink Western unanimity around the U.S. and highlight Washington\u2019s isolation\u2014raising reputational costs for Israel and complicating trans-Atlantic consensus building.\n\n### 3.3  Intra-Western dynamics  \n* **EU fragmentation:** Berlin and Rome act as \u201cbrakes,\u201d so recognition will not be an *EU* act for now. But qualified-majority voting on certain trade or association measures means the recognition caucus can still wield blocking power.  \n* **NATO cohesion:** The pro-recognition Europeans remain security-dependent on the U.S.; none threaten core NATO cooperation. Pressure therefore stays diplomatic-economic, not military.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Forward Outlook  \n\n* If France proceeds at UNGA 80 and the UK follows, the pro-recognition bloc will contain **two** UNSC vetoes and over **US $10 trn of GDP**\u2014enough to shift Western discourse but not to override U.S. veto power.  \n* A German policy pivot would be decisive: it alone would swing an additional **$4.5 trn** and a critical EU leadership voice, but Berlin shows no sign of imminent change.  \n* The net balance therefore remains **asymmetric**: Europe can *isolate* the U.S. politically and raise economic costs, yet Washington retains the *decisive institutional veto* and superior aggregate power, keeping recognition primarily a symbolic and diplomatic instrument rather than a coercive one.\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Key recent coverage\ue202turn9search6,turn0search0,turn1search0\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search12\ue201","start_idx":1331,"end_idx":1364,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-plans-recognise-palestinian-state-september-unless-israel-takes-action-2025-07-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/minister-dismisses-peers-claims-that-uk-recognition-of-palestine-may-break-international-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-plans-recognise-palestinian-state-september-unless-israel-takes-action-2025-07-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/minister-dismisses-peers-claims-that-uk-recognition-of-palestine-may-break-international-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"UK plans to recognise Palestinian state in September unless Israel ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-plans-recognise-palestinian-state-september-unless-israel-takes-action-2025-07-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753842982.681514,"snippet":"UK plans to recognise Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes action.

This declaration marks a significant shift in Canadian foreign policy and aligns it with recent similar moves by France and the UK. Trump criticized the decision on his Truth Social platform, linking it to stalled trade negotiations, which had a deadline of August 1. Talks have reportedly been disorganized, lacking progress toward an agreement to mitigate tariffs and avoid a trade war.\n\nCarney defended Canada's position, claiming it supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is based on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to reforms, electoral changes excluding Hamas, and state demilitarization. While Palestinian President Abbas welcomed the move, Israel condemned it, citing Hamas\u2019s 2023 violence and a lack of governance. Carney expressed urgency due to worsening conditions in Gaza and diminishing chances for peace, criticizing both Hamas and Israel\u2019s settlement expansions. He emphasized that recognition is intended to preserve peace and secure both Israel\u2019s and Palestine\u2019s futures.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The
