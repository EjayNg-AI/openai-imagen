However, these tools are highly specific to topology.\n\n#### 2. **Problem: Lack of General Framework**\nAs mathematicians began to study \"homotopy-like\" phenomena in other areas (e.g., chain complexes, simplicial sets, categories), they needed a framework that captures the essence of homotopy theory *abstractly*, **without relying on point-set topology**.\n\n#### 3. **Model Categories as an Abstraction**\nA **model category** is an *abstract category* (not necessarily topological) equipped with three classes of morphisms:\n  - **Weak equivalences** (generalizing homotopy equivalences)\n  - **Cofibrations** (generalizing subspace inclusions or injective maps)\n  - **Fibrations** (generalizing Serre fibrations, projections, etc.)\n\nThese axioms are designed so that one can develop a robust theory of *homotopy*\u2014such as the construction of homotopy categories, derived functors, and localization\u2014*in any setting where the model category axioms hold*.\n\n#### 4. **What Does This Generalize?**\n- **Homotopy theory of topological spaces**: The canonical example.\n- **Homological algebra**: Chain complexes of modules (with quasi-isomorphisms as weak equivalences).\n- **Simplicial sets**: With Kan fibrations, etc.\n- **Other contexts**: Categories of sheaves, diagrams, spectra, and more.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Classical Notion             | Model Category Abstraction   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Topological space            | Object of the category      |\n| Continuous map               | Morphism                    |\n| Homotopy equivalence         | Weak equivalence            |\n| Fibration                    | Fibration                   |\n| Cofibration                  | Cofibration                 |\n| Homotopy category            | Homotopy category           |\n\n### **Core Aim**\n> **Model categories provide a unifying language and set of axioms for doing homotopy theory *anywhere* the structure makes sense, not just in topology.**\n\n### **References**\n- Quillen, *Homotopical Algebra* (original source of model categories)\n- Dwyer & Spalinski, \"Homotopy Theories and Model Categories\" (*Handbook of Algebraic Topology*)\n\n---\n\n**If you want a more technical or historical angle (e.g., how this relates to Quillen\u2019s motivations, or how model categories relate to \u221e-categories), let me know.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"198900c3-6703-40a3-b1d9-2f159f890a73","request_id":"95ccd2bea89cfd9f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"198900c3-6703-40a3-b1d9-2f159f890a73","children":["facf66c3-2f6e-44a1-b037-f2e585169ec7"]},"facf66c3-2f6e-44a1-b037-f2e585169ec7":{"id":"facf66c3-2f6e-44a1-b037-f2e585169ec7","message":{"id":"facf66c3-2f6e-44a1-b037-f2e585169ec7","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752116594.327,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["is it confined only to algebraic topology and homological algebra>"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95ccd3aa9bf2fd9f-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"78fb21d1-6bae-49e3-a493-c9af98aad7c3","children":["bbcd7a92-d499-4eac-b535-6da4f035cb86"]},"bbcd7a92-d499-4eac-b535-6da4f035cb86":{"id":"bbcd7a92-d499-4eac-b535-6da4f035cb86","message":{"id":"bbcd7a92-d499-4eac-b535-6da4f035cb86","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752116594.784605,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**No, model categories are *not* confined only to algebraic topology and homological algebra.** Those were the original motivations and the earliest, most classical applications, but the concept is much broader and has been successfully exported to many other fields.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Original Contexts**\n- **Algebraic Topology:** Model categories were invented to generalize homotopy theory (spaces, spectra, simplicial sets, etc.).\n- **Homological Algebra:** Model structures on chain complexes, dg-modules, derived categories, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Broader Applications**\n\n### **A. Algebraic Geometry**\n- **Simplicial sheaves and derived algebraic geometry:** Model structures underpin the theory of derived stacks and derived schemes (see work by To\u00ebn, Vezzosi, Lurie, etc.).\n- **Motivic homotopy theory:** Model categories play a central role in Voevodsky's approach to motives.\n\n### **B. Category Theory**\n- **Diagram categories:** Model structures appear on categories of diagrams, diagrams of spaces, or more generally, diagrammatic homotopy theory.\n- **Higher category theory:** Model categories are used to present (\u221e,1)-categories and other higher categorical structures (see Joyal, Lurie).\n\n### **C. Mathematical Logic and Type Theory**\n- **Homotopy type theory:** Model categories (of simplicial sets, for instance) provide semantics for type theory and \"univalent foundations.\"\n\n### **D. Representation Theory**\n- **Stable module categories:** Certain model structures arise in modular representation theory, stable categories of modules, etc.\n\n### **E. Noncommutative Geometry**\n- Model categories have been explored in contexts of noncommutative spaces and their homotopical/derived enhancements.\n\n### **F. Mathematical Physics**\n- **Motivic, spectral, and higher-categorical approaches** in quantum field theory, string theory, and topological quantum field theory (TQFTs) sometimes make use of model category language.\n\n### **G. Computer Science**\n- Some branches of semantics and concurrency theory borrow homotopical ideas, sometimes invoking model categories (less common, but present).\n\n---\n\n## 3. **General Abstract Utility**\nWhenever you have a category with a class of \"weak equivalences\" (i.e., morphisms you want to formally invert), model category theory gives you a systematic way to *localize* and develop a calculus for manipulating \"up to homotopy\" objects. This is useful far beyond just topology and homological algebra.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Area                      | Example Use of Model Category                        |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Algebraic Topology        | Spaces, simplicial sets, spectra                     |\n| Homological Algebra       | Chain complexes, dg-categories                       |\n| Algebraic Geometry        | Simplicial sheaves, derived schemes                  |\n| Category Theory           | Diagrams, (\u221e,1)-categories, higher categories        |\n| Mathematical Logic/HoTT   | Semantics for type theory, univalent foundations     |\n| Representation Theory     | Stable module categories, triangulated categories    |\n| Mathematical Physics      | TQFTs, derived structures in QFT                    |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**Model categories are a general, flexible framework.

This is a much richer structure than the ordinary homotopy category of spaces.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Homotopy Category of a Model Category, Ho(C)**\n\nFor any model category \\( C \\), the **homotopy category** \\( Ho(C) \\) is constructed by formally inverting the weak equivalences.

However, there *is* a standard procedure to \"stabilize\" \\( C \\):\n\n### **Stabilization Procedure**\n- **Construct the category of spectra objects in C** (i.e., sequences \\( X_0 \\to \\Sigma X_1 \\to \\Sigma^2 X_2 \\to \\ldots \\) in \\( C \\)).\n- Give this category a model structure (under suitable conditions).\n- The homotopy category of this new model category is the **stable homotopy category** of \\( C \\).\n\nThis is analogous to going from spaces to spectra in classical topology.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Context            | Category                        | \"Stable\" Version Exists?     | Notes                                                      |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Topological Spaces | Ho(Top)                         | Yes, via spectra             | Ho(Spectra) is stable/trianagulated                       |\n| Chain Complexes    | Ho(Ch(Ab))                      | Already stable               | Ho(Ch(Ab)) is triangulated                                |\n| General Model Cat  | Ho(C)                           | Only if C is stable          | Else, need to \"stabilize\" (category of spectra in C)      |\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Conclusion**\n\n- There is **not always** a stable category of \\( Ho(C) \\) for an arbitrary model category \\( C \\).\n- **If \\( C \\) is stable, \\( Ho(C) \\) is already the stable homotopy category.**\n- **If \\( C \\) is not stable, you must stabilize it:**  \n  - **Construct a model category of spectra (or analogous objects) in \\( C \\);**\n  - The homotopy category of this stabilized model category is your \u201cstable category\u201d in analogy with algebraic topology.\n\n---\n\n### **References:**\n- Hovey, *Model Categories* (esp.

Certain extra structures are required.**  \nLet\u2019s clarify what\u2019s needed and why.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Minimum Requirements**\n\n### **A. Pointedness**\n- The model category \\( C \\) **must be pointed**:  \n  - It has a zero object (an object that is both initial and terminal).\n  - The suspension and loop functors are defined.\n\n### **B. Existence of Suspension**\n- There must be a *suspension functor* \\(\\Sigma: C \\to C\\) and a *loop functor* \\(\\Omega: C \\to C\\) (at least up to homotopy).\n\nIf \\( C \\) is not pointed, spectra in \\( C \\) don\u2019t make sense, since you can\u2019t define \u201csuspending\u201d or \u201clooping\u201d objects in a meaningful way.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Why These Are Needed**\n\n- **Spectra** are, by definition, sequences of objects equipped with structure maps involving the suspension functor.\n- If there\u2019s no suspension functor (or the category isn\u2019t pointed), you can\u2019t build spectra.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Technical Conditions for Good Behavior**\n\n### **A. Combinatorial or Cofibrantly Generated Model Category**\n- For the category of spectra in \\( C \\) to itself have a nice model structure, \\( C \\) should be **cofibrantly generated** (or more generally, *combinatorial*).\n- This ensures you can transfer a model structure to the spectra category using standard machinery.\n\n### **B. Simplicial, Topological, or Enriched Structure**\n- Sometimes it is helpful (not strictly required, but very useful) if \\( C \\) is **simplicial** or **topologically enriched**. This makes homotopy theory behave better.\n\n### **C. Properness and \u201cStability\u201d of Suspension**\n- For the stabilization to have all the desired properties (e.g., making the suspension functor an equivalence in the homotopy category), technical assumptions on the interaction between weak equivalences and (co)fibrations help.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Counterexamples / Failure Cases**\n\n- **Unpointed categories:** E.g., the category of all topological spaces (not pointed), or sets. These cannot be stabilized in the spectra sense.\n- **Exotic model categories:** Some model categories with \u201cbad\u201d behavior (e.g., without enough limits/colimits, or not cofibrantly generated) may not admit a good model structure on spectra.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Canonical Example:**\n\n- **Category of pointed simplicial sets:** Satisfies all requirements, stabilization yields symmetric spectra or S-modules.\n- **Category of chain complexes:** Already stable (suspension = shift), so \u201cstabilization\u201d is tautological.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Model Category \\(C\\)        | Pointed? | Suspension/Loop Defined? | Cofibrantly Generated? | Stabilization Possible? |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Topological Spaces          | \u2717        | \u2717 (no zero object)      | Yes                   | \u2717                      |\n| Pointed Topological Spaces  | \u2713        | \u2713                       | Yes                   | \u2713                      |\n| Simplicial Sets             | \u2717        | \u2717                       | Yes                   | \u2717                      |\n| Pointed Simplicial Sets     | \u2713        | \u2713                       | Yes                   | \u2713                      |\n| Chain Complexes             | \u2713        | \u2713 (shift functor)       | Yes                   | \u2713 (already stable)     |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **Stabilization** requires \\( C \\) to be at least **pointed** and to have a well-defined suspension functor (at least up to homotopy).\n- **Best behavior** is when \\( C \\) is also cofibrantly generated (or combinatorial) and, ideally, simplicially enriched.\n- **Not every model category can be stabilized** in this way\u2014categories lacking these properties cannot be \u201cstabilized\u201d in the spectra sense.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- Hovey, *Model Categories* (Ch. 8)\n- Schwede, *Symmetric Spectra*\n- Lurie, *Higher Algebra*, \u00a71.4.2\u20131.4.4\n\n---\n\nIf you want technical conditions spelled out (e.g., the precise transfer of model structure for spectra), or want to see what can go wrong, let me know."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"a160f433-6db1-4324-bc5c-e9d6490501fd","request_id":"95ccdaf41cb1600b-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a160f433-6db1-4324-bc5c-e9d6490501fd","children":["9963e37a-e089-4c1a-8256-22e6b41ed8a0"]},"9963e37a-e089-4c1a-8256-22e6b41ed8a0":{"id":"9963e37a-e089-4c1a-8256-22e6b41ed8a0","message":{"id":"9963e37a-e089-4c1a-8256-22e6b41ed8a0","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752116982.998,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["So if I have cofibrantly generated model category with suspension and loop functions, I can always construct the stable model category, and it is *guaranteed* to be triangulated?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95ccdd27eeb4600b-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6a175e29-9078-47f2-80e7-0192724bd421","children":["c95668a2-8857-4246-a91e-82dc24bb1391"]},"c95668a2-8857-4246-a91e-82dc24bb1391":{"id":"c95668a2-8857-4246-a91e-82dc24bb1391","message":{"id":"c95668a2-8857-4246-a91e-82dc24bb1391","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752116983.530195,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Summary Answer:**  \nIf you have a *pointed*, *cofibrantly generated* model category \\( C \\) with well-behaved suspension and loop functors, then **yes**: you can construct a stable model category (of spectra in \\( C \\)), and its homotopy category will be triangulated.

Monoidal Model Categories**\n- A **monoidal model category** is a model category \\( C \\) equipped with a closed symmetric monoidal structure (i.e., a tensor product \\( \\otimes \\) and internal Hom) that interacts well with the model structure.\n- The most famous examples: **chain complexes**, **symmetric spectra**, **simplicial sets** (with cartesian product), **topological spaces** (with product or smash product), etc.\n\n### **B. Compatibility Conditions**\n- The tensor product should satisfy the **pushout product axiom**:\n    - If \\( f: A \\to B \\) and \\( g: X \\to Y \\) are cofibrations, then the *pushout product*\n      \\[\n      f \\Box g: (A \\otimes Y) \\cup_{A \\otimes X} (B \\otimes X) \\to B \\otimes Y\n      \\]\n      is also a cofibration, and is acyclic if either \\( f \\) or \\( g \\) is.\n- This ensures that the tensor product is \"homotopically well-behaved\"\u2014it interacts correctly with cofibrations and weak equivalences.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Passing to Homotopy Category: Tensor Triangulated Categories**\n\n### **A. Stable Setting**\n- If the model category is **stable** (e.g., spectra, chain complexes), the homotopy category is triangulated.\n- If the tensor product is compatible with the model structure, it descends to the homotopy category, giving it a **tensor triangulated structure** (i.e., a triangulated category with a symmetric monoidal structure such that the monoidal product is exact in each variable).\n\n### **B.

Many \"familiar\" triangulated categories *are* algebraic:  \n- Derived categories of rings, schemes, sheaves  \n- Stable homotopy category of spectra  \n- Triangulated categories from representation theory (under some conditions)  \n\nBut not all triangulated categories are algebraic.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Obstructions: What Can Go Wrong?**\n\n### **A. Lack of Enhancement**\n- A **model category** gives a triangulated category **with extra structure** (a \"homotopy theory,\" not just a formal triangulated structure).\n- Some triangulated categories do not admit any **dg-category** or **stable \u221e-category** or **model category** enhancement.\n\n### **B. Exotic Triangulated Categories**\n- There exist **triangulated categories that are not algebraic**, often called \u201cexotic triangulated categories.\u201d\n- These can be constructed using *homological algebra with non-algebraic exact functors*, or via *localizations*, *quotients*, or *category theory* constructions that destroy possible enhancements.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Explicit Examples**\n\n### **A. The \u201cGlued\u201d or \u201cArtificial\u201d Triangulated Categories**\n- Verdier quotients of triangulated categories can result in new triangulated categories that do not come from any model category or dg-category.\n\n### **B. Examples in the Literature**\n- **Muro, Schwede, Strickland**: \"Triangulated categories without models\" ([reference, 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0783))\n    - They provide *explicit* examples of triangulated categories (even \u201csmall\u201d ones) which **cannot** be realized as the homotopy category of a stable model category.\n    - Example: Certain triangulated categories with \u201cexotic\u201d self-equivalences that cannot be realized by a dg-functor or model category.\n\n- **Bernhard Keller**: \u201cOn triangulated categories\u201d (Handbook of Algebra, 2003)  \n    - Gives survey of algebraic vs. non-algebraic triangulated categories, and obstructions.\n\n### **C. Brown Representability Fails**\n- Some triangulated categories lack sufficient representability or localization properties to be modeled by homotopy theory.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Technical Reason:**\n- Model categories, dg-categories, and stable \u221e-categories have \u201chigher structure\u201d (mapping spaces, higher homotopies) that not all triangulated categories encode.\n- Some triangulated categories are too \u201crigid\u201d or lack the ability to encode this homotopy theory.\n- The passage from homotopy theory to triangulated category **forgets** a lot of structure.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Philosophical Point**\n- This is why \u201cenhancements\u201d (dg-category, A\u221e-category, stable \u221e-category, or model category structure) are so central.  \n- *Triangulated categories alone are too weak to classify homotopy theories;* there are \u201cfake\u201d triangulated categories with no underlying homotopy theory.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Triangulated Category        | Model Category Origin?    | Reference/Notes                    |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| \\( D(R) \\), derived categories | **Yes**                  | Derived from abelian categories     |\n| Stable homotopy category     | **Yes**                  | Model of spectra                    |\n| \u201cGlued\u201d triangulated categories | **Not always**           | Muro, Schwede, Strickland (2011)    |\n| Some Verdier quotients       | **Not always**           | See Keller, Handbook of Algebra     |\n\n---\n\n## 7. **References and Further Reading**\n- Muro, F., Schwede, S., Strickland, N., *Triangulated categories without models*, Invent.

In many current research directions\u2014 derived algebraic geometry, motivic homotopy theory, and tensor-triangular geometry\u2014their role is arguably even more indispensable than in classical topology.\n\nBelow is a more nuanced picture: why the abstractions were imported, where they are used, and in what ways the geometric environment forces refinements beyond the topological prototypes.\n\n---\n\n## 1  | How the two worlds line up\n\n| Feature | Algebraic Topology | Algebraic Geometry |\n|---------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Underlying objects** | Spaces, spectra | Schemes, stacks, motives |\n| **Model-category presentation** | Quillen model on Top, Kan model on sSet, stable model on spectra, etc. | Jardine/Joyal-Jardine model on simplicial presheaves, Isaacson/Cisinski\u2013D\u00e9glise model on motivic spaces, projective/injective model structures on dg-modules or complexes of sheaves, etc. |\n| **Primary triangulated categories** | Stable homotopy category Ho(Sp) | Derived categories \\(D(\\mathcal{A})\\), \\(D^b\\!\\operatorname{Coh}(X)\\); Voevodsky\u2019s \\(DM^{\\mathrm{eff}}, SH(k)\\); Balmer\u2019s tensor-triangular categories |\n| **Tensor structure** | Smash product \\(X\\wedge Y\\) | Derived tensor \\(\\otimes^{\\mathbf L}\\); motive/spectrum smash; convolution tensor on \\(D(G)\\) |\n| **Geometric reconstruction** | Balmer spectrum of Ho(Sp\\(^\\omega\\)) gives chromatic strata of stable homotopy theory | Balmer spectrum of \\(D^b\\!\\operatorname{Coh}(X)\\) recovers the Zariski space of \\(X\\); tensor-triangular geometry views many derived categories as \u201cschemes\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 2  | Where model categories enter algebraic geometry\n\n### 2.1  Homotopical algebra for sheaves & stacks  \n* **Simplicial (pre)sheaves.**  The Jardine model structure on simplicial presheaves over a site \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) turns descent questions into homotopy-theoretic ones; fibrant objects are homotopy sheaves.  \n* **Derived schemes & stacks.**  In Lurie-To\u00ebn-Vezzosi \u201cDerived Algebraic Geometry\u201d one models a scheme by a functor on *simplicial commutative rings*; the simplicial\u2010ring category carries a cofibrantly generated model structure, and derived stacks are fibrant objects in the associated simplicial presheaf model category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n* **dg-enhancements.**  Complexes of \\( \\mathcal{O}_X\\)-modules with quasi-isomorphisms form a model category whose homotopy category is the usual derived category \\(D(\\mathcal{O}_X)\\).\n\n### 2.2  Motivic homotopy theory  \nVoevodsky-Morel define the *\\( \\mathbb{A}^1\\)-homotopy* model structure on presheaves of simplicial sets over smooth schemes; stabilizing with respect to \\(\\mathbb{P}^1\\) produces the **stable motivic homotopy category** \\(SH(k)\\).

For \\(D^b\\!\\operatorname{Coh}(X)\\) the Balmer spectrum is homeomorphic to \\(X\\) itself; for the stable homotopy category it recovers the chromatic filtration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n3. **Bridgeland stability, semi-orthogonal decompositions, motivic t-structures** are tools available only after one has a triangulated framework.\n\n---\n\n## 4  | Nuances: where algebraic geometry diverges from topology\n\n| Issue | Topology | Algebraic Geometry |\n|-------|----------|--------------------|\n| **Base change behavior** | Spaces have no arithmetic base field. | Derived categories of schemes must respect base change and flat descent; model structures often need Nisnevich or \u00e9tale localization. |\n| **Class of weak equivalences** | Classical weak homotopy equivalences. | Usually quasi-isomorphisms, \\( \\mathbb{A}^1\\)-equivalences, or local equivalences on a Grothendieck site; must mesh with algebraic subtleties (nilpotents, Tor-amplitude). |\n| **Tensor unit** | Sphere spectrum is universal. | Unit object depends on base scheme/field; dualizability and compactness vary dramatically with geometry. |\n| **Enhancements** | Stable homotopy category admits many model presentations. | Some geometric triangulated categories (e.g.\\ exotic semi-orthogonal factors) may lack *any* model or dg enhancement; this is where model-category methods reach their limit. |\n\n---\n\n## 5  | Bottom line\n\n*The language of model categories gives algebraic geometers a way to speak \u201chomotopy\u201d without leaving algebra; triangulated (and tensor-triangulated) categories package the resulting derived structures so they interact correctly with exact sequences, duality, and monoidal products.*  Consequently:\n\n* Derived intersection theory, deformation-quantization, and moduli of sheaves all rely on model\u2010categorical or \u221e-categorical foundations.  \n* Techniques first forged in topology\u2014spectra, localization, Brown representability, chromatic methods\u2014now permeate modern algebraic geometry.  \n* Conversely, algebraic geometry feeds back new examples and conjectures (e.g.\\ the Telescope Conjecture for \\(D(\\mathcal{O}_X)\\), or the interaction of tt-geometry with arithmetic).\n\nHence **the abstractions are not merely transferable; they have become a shared lingua franca connecting the two disciplines.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":1781,"end_idx":1813,"safe_urls":["https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/Pubfile/TTG.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/sosna/diplom-online.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([UCLA Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/Pubfile/TTG.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [math.uni-hamburg.de](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/sosna/diplom-online.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Tensor triangular geometry - UCLA Department of Mathematics","url":"https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/Pubfile/TTG.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1276056640.0,"snippet":"Tensor triangular geometry is the study of tensor triangulated categories by algebro- geometric methods.

I have organised it by theme, indicating why each avenue matters, typical entry-level projects, and pointers to recent literature or open-problem lists.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Foundational Problems in Model-Category Theory  \n### Why it matters  \nModel categories are the basic engines that present homotopy theories.  Several foundational questions remain open or only partially understood.\n\n| Topic | Typical questions & projects | References |\n|-------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| **Building new model structures** | \u2022 Construct symmetric-monoidal or abelian model structures on \u201cexotic\u201d settings such as ind\u2010sheaves, analytic or derived analytic objects, or categories of operators.<br>\u2022 Verify push-out\u2013product & monoid axioms in these contexts. | Hovey\u2019s 13-problem list includes \u201cwhenever someone says *homology*, there ought to be a model category\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 |\n| **Left/right properness & localisation** | \u2022 Classify when left Bousfield localisations preserve monoidal structure.<br>\u2022 Study existence of monoidal or monoid-compatible localisations. | Hovey problems 5 & 6 \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201 |\n| **Brown representability & combinatoriality** | \u2022 Does every combinatorial, stable, monoidal model category satisfy Brown representability?<br>\u2022 Interaction with presentability in the \u221e-categorical sense. | \u2014 |\n| **Quillen equivalence vs. \u221e-equivalence** | \u2022 Systematically compare Quillen and Lurie\u2019s presentable stable \u221e-categories; find invariants detecting when a Quillen equivalence lifts to an equivalence of stable \u221e-categories. | \u2014 |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Triangulated Categories *without* Models  \n### Core question  \nWhich triangulated categories *fail* to come from any stable model (or dg/\u221e) category?\n\n* **Exotic examples & classification.**  Muro\u2013Schwede\u2013Strickland produced the first such categories; open cases include producing p-local (p odd) or rational counter-examples and giving general criteria for (non-)modellability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n* **Enhancement-obstruction theory.**  Develop obstructions to the existence or uniqueness of dg/\u221e-enhancements and study triangulated categories with multiple, inequivalent enhancements.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tensor\u2013Triangular Geometry (TTG)  \nBalmer\u2019s program studies symmetric-monoidal, compactly generated triangulated categories via a \u201cspectrum\u201d of prime tensor ideals.  Several front-line problems are spelled out in Balmer\u2019s *Problems* list (ICM 2010). \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n| Theme | Sample open problems |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| **Compute spectra in new settings** | E.g. spectra of (i) genuine equivariant G-spectra for profinite G, (ii) n-excisive functors in Goodwillie calculus, or (iii) stable motivic categories over \u211a-schemes. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201 |\n| **Residue \u201ctt-fields\u201d and nilpotence** | Formalise tt-residue fields and understand nilpotent phenomena (Problems 4.3\u20134.4). |\n| **Picard groups & invertible objects** | Prove torsion or compute Pic(K) in geometric and representation-theoretic categories (Problem 4.5). |\n| **Descent & costratification** | Extend stratification/costratification results (support vs. cosupport) to non-Noetherian or non-rigid settings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Derived & Spectral Algebraic Geometry  \nModel-categorical techniques underlie \u221e-categorical derived AG.\n\n* **Spectral stacks & spectral Deligne\u2013Mumford stacks.**  Give Quillen model presentations and study their moduli.  \n* **Derived analytic geometry.**  Build workable model structures for Stein spaces, Berkovich spaces, or rigid analytic geometry in a derived setting.  \n* **Comparison theorems.**  Rigorously compare simplicial\u2010commutative, dg-commutative, and E\u221e-ring approaches. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Motivic & Equivariant Homotopy Theories  \nActive directions include:\n\n* **Slice filtration & motivic chromatic homotopy.**  Describe slice-spectral behaviour for new base schemes; compare to classical chromatic layers.  \n* **Balmer spectrum of motivic categories.**  Conjecturally relates to Milnor\u2013Witt correspondences; being tackled using costratification and descent. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n* **Global and profinite equivariant spectra.**  Classification of prime ideals and compact objects for G-spectra (finite, profinite, or Lie groups). \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Representation Theory  \nStable module categories and triangulated categories of representations feed rich tt-geometry.\n\n* **Support/stratification for finite group schemes & Lie super-algebras.**  Extend Quillen-type support geometry and classify localising subcategories. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n* **Endotrivial and invertible modules.**  Relate Picard groups to tt-Picard and compute for new classes of Hopf algebras.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Non-commutative & Higher-Categorical Extensions  \n\n| Area | Research avenues |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Non-commutative TTG** | Develop Balmer-type spectra for monoidal triangulated categories lacking commutativity; study \u201ctensor-triangular fields\u201d in this setting. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201 |\n| **Higher semi-additivity & Goodwillie calculus** | Explore n-excisive functors as monoidal stable \u221e-categories and compute their tt-spectra (Heard\u2013May, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Monoidal Localisation & Homotopical Algebra of Rings/Algebras  \n*When does Bousfield localisation preserve monoidal or algebra structures?*  \nProjects include: criteria for monoidal left localisations, interaction with topological Hochschild or cyclic homology, and homotopy coherent Morita theory.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Computational & Algorithmic Questions  \n* **Algorithms for Balmer spectra** (symbolic computation of prime ideals, support varieties).  \n* **Effective homotopical algebra**: computer verification of model-category axioms for concrete categories (e.g. in proof assistants).  \n* **Automated detection of Quillen equivalences** via categorical invariants.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Cross-disciplinary Applications  \n* **Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT).**  Stable monoidal model categories underpin extended TQFTs and the cobordism hypothesis.  \n* **Non-commutative geometry (C\\*-algebras).**  Use tt-geometry to study KK-theory and classification of C\\*-algebras (Dell\u2019Ambrogio et al.). \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### How to choose a project\n\n1. **Background first.**  Master one flagship example (e.g. stable module category, motivic spectra, or derived categories of coherent sheaves).  \n2. **Read problem lists.**  Start with Hovey\u2019s list for model categories and Balmer\u2019s *Problems* section for TTG. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n3. **Attend focused workshops.**  Recent Oberwolfach and MFO reports summarise the state-of-the-art and highlight fresh conjectures. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n4. **Look for \u201ccomputational gaps\u201d.**  Many areas (Picard groups, Balmer spectra, localisation) need explicit calculations in new examples; these make tractable PhD-level projects.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  The landscape of model-category and triangulated-category research is broad, spanning pure foundations to computational and applied work.  The themes above mark active frontiers where new results are being published, conjectures remain unsolved, and the methods of homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory intertwine."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":1002,"end_idx":1019,"safe_urls":["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424613/mark-hoveys-open-problems-in-the-theory-of-model-categories"],"refs":[],"alt":"([MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424613/mark-hoveys-open-problems-in-the-theory-of-model-categories))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Mark Hovey's open problems in the theory of model categories - MathOverflow","url":"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424613/mark-hoveys-open-problems-in-the-theory-of-model-categories","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"MathOverflow"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":1233,"end_idx":1250,"safe_urls":["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424613/mark-hoveys-open-problems-in-the-theory-of-model-categories"],"refs":[],"alt":"([MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424613/mark-hoveys-open-problems-in-the-theory-of-model-categories))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Mark Hovey's open problems in the theory of model categories - MathOverflow","url":"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424613/mark-hoveys-open-problems-in-the-theory-of-model-categories","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"MathOverflow"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":2088,"end_idx":2107,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1378?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1378?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Triangulated categories without models","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1378?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1176282483.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arXiv"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201","start_idx":2560,"end_idx":2577,"safe_urls":["https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/Pubfile/TTG.pdf"],"refs":[],"alt":"([math.ucla.edu](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/Pubfile/TTG.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"","url":"https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/Pubfile/TTG.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"math.ucla.edu"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201","start_idx":2852,"end_idx":2869,"safe_urls":["https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/47480"],"refs":[],"alt":"([EMS Press](https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/47480))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OWR-2023-40","url":"https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/47480","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"EMS Press"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201","start_idx":3292,"end_idx":3311,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13480?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13480?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[2303.13480] Cosupport in tensor triangular geometry - arXiv","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13480?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1679529600.0,"snippet":"We develop a theory of cosupport and costratification in tensor triangular geometry.

J. P. May shows the axiom follows from these basic constructions, no extra axiom needed \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201. |\n| **dg- or A\u221e-category** | *Functorial mapping cone* | Cones satisfy a universal property; composing two cone functors gives a comparison morphism whose cone is canonically \\(C(gf)\\). |\n| **Stable \u221e-category** | *Fiber/cofiber sequences* | Lurie proves that in any stable \u221e-category every composable pair of fibre sequences extends to an octahedron; passing to \\(\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathcal C)\\) gives TR4 automatically \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201. |\n\nSo the axiom is **not an extra law grafted onto homotopy theory**; it is a *shadow* of higher-dimensional coherence that is already present in the enhanced world and survives when we decategorise to an ordinary triangulated category.\n\n---\n\n### 3  A sketch of the construction in a stable model category  \n\n1.

Modern expositions (e.g. May, Neeman) show the axiom is *redundant* once you know your triangulated category comes from an enhancement; but when you axiomatise triangulated categories *on their own* you have to include TR4 by hand because that extra homotopy-coherence is no longer visible.\n\n---\n\n### 5  Take-away  \n*The octahedral axiom is the triangulated-category remnant of the fact that \u201ctaking two consecutive cones equals taking one cone of the composite, up to canonical homotopy.\u201d*  \nIn any context where cones are defined functorially\u2014dg-categories, stable model categories, stable \u221e-categories\u2014the axiom is **automatic**; you only notice its mystery when you forget the larger structure and work purely at the triangulated level."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":687,"end_idx":706,"safe_urls":["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1591734/why-the-octahedral-axiom?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1591734/why-the-octahedral-axiom?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Why the octahedral axiom? - Mathematics Stack Exchange","url":"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1591734/why-the-octahedral-axiom?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1451260800.0,"snippet":"This axiom wants to roughly generalise the \"double quotient\" situation in the category of abelian groups, ie if A\u2282B\u2282C are abelian groups then C/B\u2245(C/A)/(B/A).","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Mathematics Stack Exchange"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201","start_idx":1341,"end_idx":1360,"safe_urls":["https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/Triangulate.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/Triangulate.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] The axioms for triangulated categories - The University of Chicago","url":"https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/Triangulate.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1110939185.0,"snippet":"We define triangulated categories and discuss homotopy pushouts and pullbacks in such categories in \u00a71 and \u00a72.

Otherwise, they may stay in the larger category for flexibility or tradition.**\n\n---\n\n### 5\u202f\u00a0Take\u2011away for researchers\n\n* When doing algebraic topology, spectra, operads, or anything model\u2011categorical, start in **CGWH** (or simplicial sets) and you will match current practice.  \n* When working in fields concerned with fine point\u2011set properties, be prepared to handle spaces that are *not* compactly generated.  \n\nThat is why modern texts like May\u2019s *Concise Course* and Strickland\u2019s notes make CGWH explicit, while journals such as *Topology and its Applications* still publish results about general spaces: both conventions serve the needs of different sub\u2011communities."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":922,"end_idx":954,"safe_urls":["https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [NCAT Lab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology J.

answer \u2013** *Every smooth spacetime manifold used in general\u2011relativity (GR) *is* a compactly generated weak Hausdorff (CGWH) space, but the converse is false and the reasons topologists use CGWH have almost nothing to do with the extra smooth/Lorentzian structure that drives GR.*\n\n---\n\n## 1\u202f\u00a0What \u201cCGWH\u201d buys you in algebraic topology  \n\n| Feature | Why algebraic topologists demand it |\n|---------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Compactly generated** (`k`\u2011space) | Makes the functor \\(X\\mapsto C(A,X)\\) behave well: mapping\u2011spaces preserve colimits, smash products behave, and the category becomes **cartesian closed**. |\n| **Weak Hausdorff** | Ensures images of compact Hausdorff spaces are closed\u2014avoids basic pathologies in homotopy limits/colimits. |\n| **Complete, cocomplete, monoidal model** | Gives Serre/Str\u00f8m model structures, operads, spectra, etc.  |\n\nThese are *point\u2011set* conveniences so that homotopy theory can be done internally; no differentiable structure is assumed or needed.\n\n---\n\n## 2\u202f\u00a0Where smooth manifolds stand relative to CGWH  \n\nFinite\u2011dimensional \\(C^\\infty\\)\u2011manifolds (with their usual topologies) satisfy:\n\n* **Hausdorff**\u2003(by definition).  \n* **Second\u2011countable \u2192 compactly generated.**  \n  Any second\u2011countable locally compact Hausdorff space is CG.  \n* **Weak Hausdorff.**  Locally compact Hausdorff \u21d2 every map from a compact Hausdorff space is closed, so the space is weak Hausdorff.\n\nHence every smooth (or Lorentzian) manifold \\(M\\) of GR sits **fully inside** the CGWH universe:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Man}_{\\mathrm{sm}}\\;\\subset\\;\\mathbf{CGWH}\\;\\subset\\;\\mathbf{Top}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 3\u202f\u00a0Why CGWH is *not* the main tool for GR  \n\n| For homotopy theorists | For GR geometers |\n|------------------------|------------------|\n| Need good mapping\u2011object behavior, spectra, operad actions. | Need charts, atlases, differentiable structure, Lorentzian metric, curvature. |\n| Can ignore metrizability, paracompactness, second\u2011countability. | Usually insist on paracompact, second\u2011countable to secure partitions\u00a0of\u00a0unity, existence of global tensors, etc. |\n| Category is complete/cocomplete, cartesian closed. | Category of manifolds is **not** cartesian closed; products and function\u2011spaces leave smooth category; instead people use Fr\u00f6licher, diffeological, or Cahiers to make a \u201cconvenient\u201d smooth world. |\n\nThus CGWH solves **categorical** issues that plague raw\u202fTop; GR focuses on **analytic and geometric** issues (smooth structure, tensors, geodesics) that CGWH says nothing about.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u202f\u00a0Bridging viewpoints  \n\n*Because manifolds are CGWH, any large\u2011scale construction in algebraic topology\u2014spectra, generalized (co)homology, etc.\u2014can be applied to spacetime manifolds without extra work.*  Examples:\n\n* **Bordism invariants** (e.g. index theorems) take spacetime \\(M\\) as a CGWH object when forming Thom spectra.  \n* **Global analysis on loop spaces** often uses CGWH to give the correct \u201ck\u2011topology\u201d on \\(C(S^1,M)\\) before adding smooth loops.  \n* **Whitehead and Postnikov towers** for GR spacetimes rely on CGWH to ensure homotopy colimits behave.\n\nIf one needs a **cartesian\u2011closed smooth category** rather than just topological, geometers move to **diffeological spaces** or **convenient vector spaces** (Kriegl\u2013Michor), which extend CGWH by adding smooth plots\u2014again reflecting different priorities.\n\n---\n\n## 5\u202f\u00a0Take\u2011away  \n\n* All standard GR manifolds live safely inside the compactly generated weak Hausdorff world, so nothing is lost when algebraic topologists restrict to CGWH.  \n* The **motivation** behind CGWH (homotopy\u2011theoretic manageability) is orthogonal to the **motivation** behind smooth/Lorentzian manifolds (differential geometry and physics).  \n* When the two subjects interact\u2014e.g. topological invariants of spacetime, index theory, quantum\u2011field\u2011theoretic path integrals\u2014CGWH provides the right \u201cambient\u201d category on the topological side, while the smooth and metric data supply the geometric side."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

This tightens the bridge Lurie sketched and makes monoidal presentations a theorem of record, not folklore. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\n### 2) Making **Bousfield localizations** play well with algebra\nThere\u2019s active work on **when localization preserves monoidal/operadic structures**\u2014e.g., criteria ensuring the **monoid axiom** survives **enriched** left Bousfield localizations\u2014together with updated expositions on how localizations generate stable model structures of spectra inside a given base. This matters any time you want derived algebra structures after localization. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### 3) Recognition and **presentation theorems** for whole homotopy theories\nFresh \u201crecognition\u201d results characterize when a given (enriched) model category is **Quillen-equivalent to a presheaf category** with the projective model structure. Parallel tracks refine **models of (\u221e,1)-categories** (via Segal/double categories) with explicit model structures and Quillen equivalences between the competing presentations. These give new, checkable entry points to build models for homotopy theories of interest. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n### 4) **Equivariant / parametrized** homotopy via model categories\nOn the equivariant side, there\u2019s movement on structural tools (e.g., **norms** and recognition principles) and on how model structures support them; on the parametrized side, new frameworks for **parametrized \u221e-categories** clarify how classical parametrized model categories present higher-categorical structures. Expect continued tightening of Quillen-level foundations behind equivariant and parametrized phenomena. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n### 5) Model-categorical **foundations for derived analytic / condensed / bornological** geometry\nMultiple strands push derived methods beyond algebraic geometry: foundations for **derived analytic geometry** via simplicial objects in exact categories; representability theorems in analytic settings; and **bornological/condensed** flavors where one still wants localizing invariants and stacky moduli with homotopy-theoretic control. These works typically implement model or dg-presentations to access \u221e-categorical results. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n### 6) New **monoidal model structures** for algebraic and enriched contexts\nRecent constructions put **monoidal model structures** on categories that interact with dg- or internal algebra (e.g., curved coalgebras Quillen-equivalent to dg-cats, or module categories internal to a lextensive base), often with monoidal Quillen equivalences. This widens the catalogue of algebraic settings where homotopical algebra works \u201cout of the box.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n### 7) Ongoing **motivic** refinements (built on model presentations)\nMotivic homotopy continues to evolve: non-\\(\\mathbb A^1\\)-invariant motivic spectra and structural results for the motivic sphere; strengthened **norms/transfers** packages. While modern expositions use stable \u221e-categories, the standard motivic model structures remain the hands-on presentations many constructions pass through. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search10\ue201\n\n### 8) **Stabilization technology** and spectra models\nThere\u2019s sustained attention on how stabilization interacts with specific models (e.g., symmetric vs. sequential spectra and transferability of model structures), and on localization-based routes to stable structures for algebras/modules within a chosen ambient model category. This is practical know-how for building bespoke stable homotopy theories. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### 9) Fresh **model structures for algebraic gadgets**\nWork continues on explicit model structures in algebraic contexts (e.g., **simplicial algebras via Dold\u2013Kan**) that keep derived functors under tight, computable control\u2014a recurring need in applied and geometric homotopy theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue201\n\n### 10) Interfaces with **triangulated** representability\nAlthough more triangulated than model-centric, there\u2019s renewed activity on **Brown representability variants** under additional structure (graded actions, strong generation). These results often get *used* by passing to or from a model presentation of the same homotopy theory. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n#### Meta-trend (honest reading)\nMuch day-to-day homotopy theory is now phrased at the \u221e-categorical level, but **model categories remain the preferred *presentations*** whenever you need transferred structures, explicit cofibration/fibration factorizations, or monoidal control. The newest results either (i) **prove that desired \u221e-categorical gadgets admit clean model presentations** (notably in the monoidal case), or (ii) **sharpen the toolkit**\u2014localization, recognition, enrichment\u2014so those presentations can be built and used reliably. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this to your interests (e.g., motivic + tt-geometry, or operator-algebraic K-theory) and propose concrete, publication-sized projects with prerequisites and first computations."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":577,"end_idx":609,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://arxiv.org/html/2504.20606v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Monoidal Relative Categories Model Monoidal $\\infty","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by K Arakawa \u00b7 2025 \u2014 We show that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative categories is equivalent to that of monoidal \\infty-categories, as well as its symmetric monoidal version.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Monoidal Relative Categories Model ...","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2504.20606v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Apr 29, 2025 \u2014 We show that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative categories is equivalent to that of monoidal \u221e \\infty \u221e -categories, as well as its ...","attribution":"arXiv"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arXiv"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":1054,"end_idx":1086,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03764?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08926?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08926?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"arXiv:2311.08926v1 [math.CT] 15 Nov 2023","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08926?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1700101006.0,"snippet":"by P Bonart \u00b7 2023 \u2014 Introduction.
