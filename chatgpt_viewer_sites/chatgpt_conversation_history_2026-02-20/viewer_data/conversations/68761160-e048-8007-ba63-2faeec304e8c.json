Sadi Carnot's initial work on the efficiency of steam engines laid the foundation for classical thermodynamics, which describes the relationship between temperature, heat, work, and entropy. Thermodynamics' principles seemed subjective and depended on one's knowledge, as highlighted by Maxwell's demon paradox.\n\nRecent advancements in quantum information theory have revolutionized our understanding of thermodynamics by explaining the subjectivity of the laws through information manipulation at the quantum level. Researchers discovered that energy and other conserved quantities like angular momentum could be traded based on quantum information. This new perspective suggests that energy's dominance in thermodynamics may be circumstantial, necessitating a more comprehensive theory encompassing various conserved quantities. Quantum thermodynamics could also provide insights into black hole thermodynamics and applications in technology, such as more efficient quantum engines and fridges. Despite some skepticism, the field encourages a deeper understanding of the nexus between energy, information, and symmetries in nature.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1494068440.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6876118fec148007add9cc0e47591841","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"95f7e4c54e4eeba0-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"f9d5af2b-0a4a-4599-a22a-3aead48f7312","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f9d5af2b-0a4a-4599-a22a-3aead48f7312","children":["aabf2250-94ed-451d-b420-a365a6a6afcc"]},"aabf2250-94ed-451d-b420-a365a6a6afcc":{"id":"aabf2250-94ed-451d-b420-a365a6a6afcc","message":{"id":"aabf2250-94ed-451d-b420-a365a6a6afcc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752568225.490217,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring entropy across fields","content":"I\u2019m looking at two types of entropy: Shannon entropy (information loss) and thermodynamic entropy (missing microstate knowledge).

Unifying threads & forward questions  \n| Bridge principle | Status & open issues |\n|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Statistical \u2192 Quantum \u2192 Gravitational entropy** | All satisfy generalized second\u2010law\u2013type inequalities, but require a quantum\u2011gravitational derivation. |\n| **Information = Energy?** | Landauer gives a lower bound; does gravity set the upper bound (e.g., Bekenstein bound)? |\n| **Gravity from entanglement** | Jacobson\u2019s (1995) \u201cEinstein = thermodynamics\u201d derivation uses local Rindler entropy; modern work extends this with relative entropy. |\n| **Microscopic dof of spacetime** | String theory vs. loop\u2011gravity vs. tensor\u2011network / qubit models; all predict area\u2011law entropy but disagree on microstates\u2019 nature. |\n| **Quantum thermodynamics** | Can QFT\u2011in\u2011curved\u2011spacetime engines (Unruh heat) be built in analogue systems? |\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Take\u2011away hierarchy  \n1. **Information** is counted by **entropy**.  \n2. In **QM**, entropy tracks loss of coherence; in **QFT**, it diagnoses field correlations and RG flow; in **GR**, it measures horizon microstates.  \n3. All three frameworks increasingly look like different limits of a deeper, information\u2011theoretic theory\u2014possibly quantum gravity.  \n\nUnderstanding how *bits* stitch together *geometry* and vice\u2011versa is now a central research frontier."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":732,"end_idx":751,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Landauer's principle -

Strip the claim to its core\n\n> **Refined statement**  \n> *Given a macroscopic specification (energy, volume, constraints, etc.), the **Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy**  \n> \\(S=k_{\\mathrm B}\\ln\\Omega\\) measures the logarithm of the number of **distinguishable micro\u2011configurations** compatible with that specification.  If each micro\u2011configuration can be pinned down by \\(n\\) independent coordinates resolved to precision \\(\\delta\\), then, in the simplest case of no correlations, \\(\\Omega\\sim (\\Lambda/\\delta)^{n}\\) and  \n> \\(S\\propto n\\ln(\\Lambda/\\delta)\\). Thus entropy counts *effective* parameters, not bare ones.*\n\nThis wording highlights two crucial caveats that the original slogan hides:\n\n1. **Resolution matters.**  In the continuous limit entropy is ill\u2011defined unless you coarse\u2011grain or choose a measure.  \n2. **Independence matters.**  Correlations (classical or quantum) mean you can\u2019t assign one free parameter per degree of freedom.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  When the identification works exactly\n\n| Context | What is counted? | Why proportional to parameter count? |\n|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Discrete uniform codebook** (information theory) | \\(N\\) equally likely codewords | Shannon entropy \\(H=\\log_2N\\) equals number of binary *bits* \u2192 number of parameters if every symbol is a free bit. |\n| **Ideal gas in a cell** | Phase\u2011space cells of volume \\(h^{3N}\\) | With fixed \\(E,V\\) and molecular indistinguishability, \\(\\ln\\Omega\\) still scales \u221d \\(N\\) once Stirling\u2019s approximation and the Gibbs factor are included \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201. |\n| **Independent coin\u2013flip ensemble** | \\(N\\) bits | Von\u202fNeumann entropy of the maximally mixed state on \\(N\\) qubits is \\(N\\) (in bits). |\n\nIn each case the microvariables are (i) independent, (ii) equally probable after coarse\u2011graining, so entropy is nothing but \u201chow many knobs you must dial.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Where the na\u00efve parameter count **fails**\n\n| Failure mode | Illustration | Fix |\n|--------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Correlations / constraints** | Ising model below \\(T_c\\): magnetisation couples spins, lowering entropy per spin. | Use mutual\u2011information subtraction or *conditional* entropies. |\n| **Gauge redundancy** | Electromagnetic field: potentials \\(A_\\mu\\) over\u2011parameterise physical states. | Count *gauge\u2011invariant* degrees of freedom; entropy uses phase\u2011space volume modulo constraints. |\n| **Continuous variables** | Differential entropy depends on coordinate scaling (non\u2011invariant). | Work with *relative* entropy / KL divergence, or Jeffreys prior in information geometry. |\n| **Quantum entanglement** | Two qubits in Bell pair: global state pure (0\u202fbits), subsystems individually maximally mixed (1\u202fbit each). Parameter counting must respect tensor\u2011product structure. | Use von\u202fNeumann entropies \\(S(\\rho_A)\\) and mutual information. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Formal bridges between entropy and \u201cparameter number\u201d\n\n### 4.1  **Kolmogorov complexity & Minimum\u2011Description Length (MDL)**  \n*Average* Kolmogorov complexity per symbol converges to Shannon entropy for any computable source \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201.  MDL model selection rewrites \u201cbest model\u201d as *shortest two\u2011part code* = **encoded parameters + encoded residuals** \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201.\n\n### 4.2  **Information geometry**  \nThe Fisher\u2011information metric gives each statistical model a Riemannian volume element \\(\\sqrt{\\det I(\\theta)}\\,d\\theta\\).  Jeffreys\u2019 prior and the associated *thermodynamic length* tie entropy production to the \u201cvolume\u201d swept out in parameter space \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search14\ue201.\n\n### 4.3  **Bayesian \u201ceffective number of parameters\u201d**  \nWatanabe\u2013Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) and related measures define  \n\\(p_{\\text{eff}} = H_q - \\mathbb{E}[H_{\\text{post}}]\\), a difference of entropies that counts only those parameters not washed out by the posterior \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search10\ue201.\n\n### 4.4  **Landauer\u2019s principle**  \nTo erase one binary parameter you must dump \\(k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln2\\) of entropy into the environment; parameter count translates directly into thermodynamic cost \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Physical examples that nuance the slogan\n\n| System | Raw variables | Correlated / constrained? | Entropy scaling |\n|--------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Solar\u2011mass black hole** | \u223c\\(10^{77}\\) Planck\u2011area \u201cpixels\u201d on the horizon | Unknown microstates but area law fixes \\(S\\propto A\\), not volume; suggests huge degeneracy but *fewer independent parameters* than a volume law would imply. |\n| **Deep neural net (2025 sparsification studies)** | Millions of weights | Many get pruned by entropic regularisation; effective parameter count drops with negligible loss in accuracy \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201. |\n| **Renormalisation group flow** | Bare QFT Lagrangian has infinite couplings | Coarse\u2011graining integrates out high\u2011momentum modes; entropy of those modes becomes part of the *effective action*, leaving only a handful of relevant couplings. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  A sharper working guideline\n\n1. **Specify the ensemble** (probabilities or measure).  \n2. **Identify independent coordinates** *after* removing symmetries and constraints.  \n3. **Choose a resolution / prior measure**; for continuous variables adopt relative entropy to avoid Jacobian artefacts.  \n4. **Compute \\(S\\).**  If the distribution factorises and is uniform, \\(S\\propto\\) parameter count. If not, interpret \\(S\\) as *redundancy\u2011pruned* parameter count.  \n5. **Connect to thermodynamics or learning theory** through Landauer bounds, Fisher metric length, or MDL penalties.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Forward questions worth pursuing\n\n* **Quantum gravity:** Does the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking area law hint that spacetime\u2019s *true* micro\u2011parameter count is holographic rather than volumetric?  \n* **AI model compression:** Can entropic regularisers systematically predict the *minimal* parameter budget for a given task?  \n* **Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of information:** What is the tightest entropy\u2013parameter trade\u2011off for feedback\u2011controlled quantum systems?\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nEntropy is **not** a raw head\u2011count of knobs; it is a logarithmic measure of the *volume of distinguishable states* once you have fixed (i) a resolution, (ii) independence structure, and (iii) symmetries.  Under those conditions it **does** tell you how many truly *free* parameters remain\u2014and how much information (or heat) you must supply to specify them."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":1877,"end_idx":1896,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%27s_entropy_formula?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%27s_entropy_formula?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Boltzmann's entropy formula - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%27s_entropy_formula?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1170694028.0,"snippet":"The Boltzmann formula shows the relationship between entropy and the number of ways the atoms or molecules of a certain kind of thermodynamic system can be ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":3407,"end_idx":3439,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/13/3/595?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/13/3/595?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Kolmogorov complexity - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":998625602.0,"snippet":"It can be shown that for the output of Markov information sources, Kolmogorov complexity is related to the entropy of the information source.

The conceptual gap is not in the formula but in (i) what the probabilities mean, (ii) the units we attach to the quantity, and (iii) how we fix the coarse\u2011graining that turns the continuum of phase\u2011space points into a discrete probability distribution.*\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Why statistical mechanics falls straight out of Shannon\u2019s variational principle  \n\nE.\u202fT.\u202fJaynes (1957) asked: *What probability distribution maximises Shannon entropy subject to known constraints such as average energy?*  The answer, from the calculus of Lagrange multipliers, is the **canonical distribution**\n\n\\[\np_i = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_i}}{Z},\\qquad\n\\beta\\equiv \\frac{1}{k_B T},\\qquad\nZ=\\sum_j e^{-\\beta E_j}.\n\\]\n\nInsert this \\(p_i\\) back into \\(S_\\text{G}\\); one recovers all equilibrium thermodynamics because  \n\n\\[\nS_\\text{G} = k_B\\,\\bigl(\\ln Z + \\beta \\langle E\\rangle\\bigr),\\quad\nF \\equiv -k_B T \\ln Z = \\langle E\\rangle - T S_\\text{G},\n\\]\n\ni.e. the **free energy** is the Legendre transform of \\(S_\\text{G}\\).  The *structure* of classical thermodynamics is therefore nothing more than Shannon\u2019s **maximum\u2011entropy inference** carried out with the physically relevant constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Special cases that clarify the link\n\n1. **Equiprobable microstates** (Boltzmann\u2019s original \\(S=k_B\\ln\\Omega\\)):  \n   If each of \\(\\Omega\\) states has probability \\(1/\\Omega\\), then  \n   \\(S_\\text{G} = k_B \\ln \\Omega = k_B \\ln 2 \\,\\log_2 \\Omega = k_B H.\\)  \n   The entropy is literally \u201cthe number of bits needed to label the state\u201d.\n\n2. **Ideal gas in a box**:  \n   Discretise phase space into cells of volume \\(h^{3N}\\); indistinguishability of particles divides \\(\\Omega\\) by \\(N!\\).  The ensuing Sackur\u2013Tetrode formula is still \\(k_B\\) times the Shannon functional, but it reminds us that ***coarse\u2011graining and symmetry reduction matter***.\n\n3. **Landauer\u2019s principle**:  \n   Erasing one bit of information increases the environment\u2019s BG entropy by at least \\(k_B \\ln 2\\).

The fundamental relation: Landauer\u2019s principle  \n\nFor **any physical implementation of a binary memory**, erasing one bit (resetting it to a standard state, e.g. \u201c0\u201d) must dump at least  \n\n\\[\n\\Delta Q_{\\min}=k_{B}\\,T\\ln 2\n\\]\n\nof heat into the surroundings.  This is **independent of how much internal energy the bit held before erasure**; the only variable is the **environment temperature\u202f\\(T\\)** at which the erasure is carried out.  The formula has been verified down to mesoscopic and superconducting platforms, within a few\u202f% of the bound \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Subtleties and extensions  \n\n* **Non\u2010isothermal erasure** \u2013 If you can couple the bit to a *colder* bath during reset, the required work is smaller; you pay by running a refrigerator elsewhere.  \n* **Feedback\u2011assisted erasure / Maxwell\u2011demon schemes** \u2013 You can extract work \\(W\\le k_{B}T\\,I\\) if you first gain \\(I\\) bits of mutual information about the state, but erasing the demon\u2019s memory later restores the full Landauer balance.  \n* **Quantum proposals to \u201cbeat\u201d Landauer** \u2013 Recent theory and experiments show apparent violations in strong\u2011coupling or non\u2011Markovian regimes, but once all degrees of freedom (work reservoirs, correlations) are included, the total entropy cost still respects a generalized Landauer bound \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 5.
