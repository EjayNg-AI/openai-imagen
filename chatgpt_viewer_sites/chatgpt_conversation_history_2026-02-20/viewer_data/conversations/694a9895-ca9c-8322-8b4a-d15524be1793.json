Primarily used for individuals aged 40-75 without diabetes but with high LDL cholesterol, the test is particularly helpful when a person\u2019s heart disease risk is unclear and the need for statin therapy is uncertain. A score of zero generally indicates low heart disease risk, potentially negating the need for statins if there are no other major risk factors like smoking, diabetes, or family history. Higher scores (e.g., over 100) suggest greater benefit from medications and lifestyle changes. \n\nThe painless test takes about 15 minutes and uses relatively low radiation. However, it is not suitable for high-risk individuals already advised to take statins and may not be covered by insurance, typically costing $100-$400. While the test can motivate healthier lifestyle decisions, it has limitations\u2014such as lack of endorsement from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for asymptomatic individuals.

Priced at just \u20b9500, compared to much higher costs at private hospitals, the test identifies calcium deposits in heart vessels, helping assess the risk of coronary artery disease and heart attacks. A calcium score under 100 is normal, while scores between 100-400 indicate mild risk and above 400 signal severe disease, requiring further diagnostic tests like ECG, ECHO, or angiograms.\n\nAccording to Dr. J Chezhian, Head of Radiology, and Dr. Mary Majella, Head of Cardiology, the scan is especially useful for patients under 40 or those unable to take treadmill tests due to conditions such as hypertension or disability. The initiative follows a rise in heart disease cases post-COVID, especially among young adults. A hospital study from 2018-2023 revealed 10,842 serious coronary cases, including 2,457 among people aged 18-45. The number of young patients increased significantly after the pandemic.

The technology, known as HeartFlow Analysis, uses CT scans to create detailed 3D models of coronary arteries, helping to accurately diagnose coronary heart disease (CHD) in non-invasive ways. This innovation has reduced the need for invasive angiograms by a sixth and decreased the number of follow-up tests by 12% over two years.\n\nCurrently available in 56 hospitals across England, the scans have benefitted over 24,300 patients and saved the NHS approximately \u00a3390 per patient. With around 2.3 million people affected by CHD in England, the technology is seen as a major advancement in identifying and treating the disease efficiently. The tool also enables pre-planned, personalized treatment strategies, as seen in the case of Sarah Remnant from Portsmouth, who received a life-saving stent following her 3D scan. NHS leaders and researchers emphasize the role of AI in enhancing patient care and healthcare system efficiency, with equal benefits noted across various demographics.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1746486000.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694a98d796b0832abf0623240938d8ed","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching authoritative sources for coronary artery disease tests","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b1564300-322f-47e8-89d5-0e566e21a9d0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"8c09c562-06c3-4ce1-82ad-b69bd28da205","turn_exchange_id":"4b54a33c-9709-46d6-923a-be5bb7a211e3","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8c09c562-06c3-4ce1-82ad-b69bd28da205","children":["027d5c49-0ee0-4492-8dd8-71198c0473cd"]},"027d5c49-0ee0-4492-8dd8-71198c0473cd":{"id":"027d5c49-0ee0-4492-8dd8-71198c0473cd","message":{"id":"027d5c49-0ee0-4492-8dd8-71198c0473cd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766496493.297363,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting response with detailed risk factors and testing","content":"I\u2019ll explain the detection methods and risk factors clearly and precisely.

Detection and treatment depend a lot on **which artery bed** is involved and whether you have symptoms.\n\n## How arterial blockages are detected\n\n### 1) Risk assessment + basic evaluation (often the starting point)\n- **History & symptoms**: chest pressure with exertion, breathlessness, calf pain when walking (claudication), transient vision loss/weakness/speech trouble (mini-stroke/TIA), erectile dysfunction, etc.\n- **Physical exam**: blood pressure, pulses in feet, listening for a **carotid bruit** (a \u201cwhooshing\u201d sound\u2014useful clue but not very accurate on its own). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n- **Labs**: fasting lipids (LDL-C), HbA1c (long-term glucose), kidney function, etc.\n\n### 2) Tests for *coronary* artery disease (heart arteries)\nCommon non-invasive ways to look for plaque or narrowing:\n- **Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score** (CT scan): estimates plaque burden by measuring calcium in coronary arteries; higher score \u2192 more atherosclerosis. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n- **Coronary CT angiography (CCTA)**: CT with contrast to visualize narrowed coronary arteries; often used when symptoms suggest coronary disease or prior tests are inconclusive. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n- **Stress testing** (exercise treadmill \u00b1 imaging): looks for evidence that a narrowing is limiting blood flow during exertion (often used when symptoms suggest angina; exact choice depends on your baseline ECG and ability to exercise).\n\n### 3) Tests for *leg* artery disease (peripheral arterial disease, PAD)\n- **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**: compares ankle vs arm blood pressure; **ABI \u2264 0.9** is commonly used as diagnostic evidence of PAD. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n- Note: For **asymptomatic** people, the USPSTF says evidence is **insufficient** to recommend ABI screening across the board\u2014clinicians may still do it for higher-risk individuals or symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n### 4) Tests for *carotid* artery disease (neck arteries \u2192 stroke risk)\n- If there\u2019s concern (symptoms like TIA/stroke or certain exam findings), doctors typically use **carotid duplex ultrasound**, sometimes followed by **CT/MR angiography** depending on the situation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search14\ue201\n\n## Risk factors likely relevant to you (based on what you\u2019ve shared previously)\nFrom your earlier context: **hypertension** (on amlodipine) and **borderline elevated HbA1c / prediabetes risk** are both meaningful risk factors for atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is a major driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \nPrediabetes/metabolic risk tends to cluster with other risks (lipids, weight, inflammation) and raises long-term cardiovascular risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\nOther big risk factors to check (because they change what testing/treatment makes sense):\n- **LDL cholesterol / dyslipidemia**\n- **Smoking/vaping exposure**\n- **Family history of early heart disease**\n- **Overweight/central obesity, inactivity**\n- **Chronic kidney disease**\n- **Sleep apnea**\n- **Chronic inflammatory conditions**\n- **Age/sex and some ancestry patterns** (AHA lists South Asian ancestry as a higher-risk group). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search23\ue201\n\n## Treatment / \u201cremedy\u201d (what actually reduces risk and events)\n\n### A) Lifestyle (high leverage, works with meds rather than instead of them)\n- **Blood pressure control** (home BP monitoring, sodium reduction, weight management, consistent sleep).\n- **Exercise**: aerobic + resistance; for PAD, **structured walking programs** are especially effective.\n- **Diet**: Mediterranean/DASH patterns (fiber, legumes, fish, unsaturated fats; minimize refined carbs and trans fats).\n- **Stop smoking** (if applicable): it\u2019s one of the strongest reversible risks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search23\ue201\n\n### B) Medications (chosen based on your risk profile and whether disease is proven)\n- **Statins (LDL-lowering)** are first-line for reducing events when risk is elevated or disease is present; many guidelines set *lower LDL targets for higher-risk people*. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- **Antihypertensives**: you\u2019re already on a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). If BP isn\u2019t at goal, clinicians add/adjust meds (often ACE inhibitor/ARB, thiazide-type diuretic, etc.) depending on labs and side-effects.\n- **Glucose/metabolic management**: if you cross into diabetes or have very high cardiometabolic risk, certain diabetes meds have cardiovascular benefit in appropriate patients (your clinician decides based on your exact profile). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- **Antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin)**: generally **not** for \u201cjust in case\u201d primary prevention in many people; commonly used when you have established atherosclerotic disease or specific indications (your doctor weighs bleeding risk vs benefit).\n\n### C) Procedures (when blockage is significant or causing symptoms/events)\n- **Coronary**: stent (PCI) or bypass surgery (CABG) depending on anatomy and symptoms.\n- **Carotid**: endarterectomy or stenting in selected higher-risk stenosis cases.\n- **Leg arteries (PAD)**: angioplasty/stenting or bypass for severe lifestyle-limiting claudication or threatened limb.\n\n## A practical \u201cnext steps\u201d checklist to discuss with your doctor\n1) Confirm your **10-year cardiovascular risk** and review: BP logs, LDL-C, triglycerides, HbA1c, kidney function.  \n2) Decide if you\u2019re **symptomatic** (even subtly with exertion). Symptoms change the testing strategy.  \n3) If you\u2019re asymptomatic but intermediate risk, ask whether **CAC scoring** or **CCTA** would meaningfully change management (some Singapore-facing resources also discuss CT calcium scoring / CT coronary angiogram). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search17\ue201  \n4) If you have leg symptoms or high PAD risk, consider **ABI** testing. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n## When to seek urgent care\n- Chest pressure/pain (especially with sweating, nausea, breathlessness), fainting, sudden one-sided weakness/numbness, facial droop, speech difficulty, or sudden vision loss \u2192 **urgent emergency evaluation**.\n\nIf you tell me your age, sex, whether you smoke, your latest BP range, LDL/HDL/triglycerides, HbA1c, and whether you have symptoms with exertion, I can map this into a more tailored \u201cmost likely tests\u201d + \u201chighest-impact interventions\u201d plan."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search2\ue201","start_idx":757,"end_idx":790,"safe_urls":["https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.025702","https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.025702?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360527","https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360527?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360527?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Carotid artery disease - Diagnosis and treatment","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360527?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"24 Jul 2025 \u2014 The exam generally includes listening for a swooshing sound, known as bruit, over the carotid artery in the neck.

Dr. Ahmad Jayedi of Imperial College London emphasized that this level of activity is needed to reach the clinically important goal of losing 5% of body weight over three months. While the NHS already recommends this level of exercise for general health, the study confirms it's also key for weight reduction in those with a BMI over 25.\n\nJayedi acknowledged the challenge of lifestyle changes, particularly with sedentary habits and diets high in ultra-processed foods. However, he encouraged integrating exercise into daily routines. Additionally, studies show that even \u201cweekend warriors\u201d benefit similarly when condensing workouts into one or two days. Alongside exercise, doctors recommend a balanced diet rich in whole foods and low in processed items to support weight loss and reduce disease risk. A recent report highlights the financial and health consequences of poor diets in the UK, costing more than the NHS budget annually.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":59},"pub_date":1735228844.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/reversing-prediabetes-without-weight-loss-how-lifestyle-changes-fat-distribution-and-glucose-control-cut-diabetes-risk-by-70/articleshow/124549731.cms","title":"Reversing prediabetes without weight loss: How lifestyle changes, fat distribution, and glucose control cut diabetes risk by 70%","snippet":"A recent study highlighted in the Times of India reveals that reversing prediabetes is possible without weight loss, emphasizing the impact of lifestyle changes and fat distribution on glucose metabolism. Prediabetes affects over one-third of U.S. adults and, if unmanaged, could lead 70% of those affected to develop type 2 diabetes. Traditionally, weight loss has been promoted as a primary means of reducing diabetes risk. However, this new research underscores that improvements in fat distribution and blood sugar control can significantly reduce the risk\u2014by as much as 70%\u2014even without shedding pounds. Key lifestyle interventions include balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, and glucose monitoring, all of which can contribute to healthier fat distribution and improved insulin sensitivity. Early detection and consistent lifestyle management are critical in stopping or reversing the progression to type 2 diabetes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":68},"pub_date":1760436912.0,"attribution":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694aa1ec84a8832faed31aac8aa2f073","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for ADA Standards of Care and diabetes treatments","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6b485823-2ecb-4714-a538-e8b086e0a83a","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"8dd2588d-a3be-4388-ba85-fb3e8b2bb35d","turn_exchange_id":"b85f3df2-6417-4d07-a2aa-819b1200b4b8","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8dd2588d-a3be-4388-ba85-fb3e8b2bb35d","children":["f159df74-f867-481a-b8aa-955b5c21353b"]},"f159df74-f867-481a-b8aa-955b5c21353b":{"id":"f159df74-f867-481a-b8aa-955b5c21353b","message":{"id":"f159df74-f867-481a-b8aa-955b5c21353b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766498804.680864,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring ADA 2025 prevention and diabetes medications","content":"I need to gather details from the ADA 2025 prevention section and CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

The primary focus of treatment is lifestyle modification, which includes weight loss, healthy eating, and regular physical activity. Losing 5\u201310% of body weight can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, with a 54\u201385% decrease in risk observed in studies. Nutritional recommendations involve consuming more fiber, non-starchy vegetables, and whole grains while reducing added sugars. Regular physical exercise \u2014 at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly \u2014 increases insulin sensitivity and overall health.\n\nFor some individuals, especially those with obesity or a history of gestational diabetes, metformin may be prescribed off-label to help prevent progression to diabetes. Other drugs like semaglutide and liraglutide may also aid in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss.\n\nComplementary therapies, including dietary supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols, and zinc, may offer additional benefits, though their efficacy requires further research. Overall, the condition is reversible with sustained lifestyle changes, and early treatment is essential to avoid the serious complications associated with type 2 diabetes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1662549124.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2021/08/24/task-force-type-2-diabetes-screening-35","title":"U.S. task force lowers recommended age for type 2 diabetes screening to 35","snippet":"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has updated its guidelines to lower the recommended starting age for type 2 diabetes screening from 40 to 35 years old. This change targets overweight or obese adults aged 35 to 70 who are at risk for prediabetes. The revision emphasizes early detection due to the significant health risks associated with diabetes, including kidney failure, blindness, and cardiovascular disease. Statistics from the CDC reveal that 13% of U.S. adults have diabetes, while 35% are prediabetic, and a notable 21% of diabetes cases may go undiagnosed. The guidelines apply to asymptomatic adults with risk factors like age, obesity, or family history of diabetes. Additionally, a separate study noted an increase in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes cases among youth.

It mimics the incretin hormone to stimulate insulin release after eating, reduces glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar), and slows digestion, making patients feel fuller longer. The medication comes in a prefilled pen for subcutaneous injection and is administered once weekly. Although Ozempic is not FDA-approved for weight loss, it is often used off-label for this purpose due to its appetite-suppressing effects. A closely related drug, Wegovy, contains the same active ingredient and is approved for weight management.\n\nIn addition to managing high blood sugar, Ozempic also helps reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Common side effects include nausea and gastrointestinal discomfort, while severe risks include potential thyroid tumors\u2014a concern noted in animal studies but not confirmed in humans. It is not recommended for individuals with a history of pancreatitis, type 1 diabetes, or diabetic ketoacidosis. Before starting Ozempic, patients should inform their healthcare provider of all health conditions and medications to avoid interactions.

It is the first sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitor that targets glucose absorption in both the kidneys and the small intestine by combining the effects of SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition. Clinical trials involving nearly 12,000 patients demonstrated that Inpefa reduced cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations or urgent visits for heart failure by 33% and 26%, respectively. Traditional SGLT2 inhibitors only target glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, while Inpefa uniquely acts in both organs, enhancing its effectiveness. Despite initial rejections related to diabetic ketoacidosis risks and technical application issues, Inpefa\u2019s eventual approval in May 2023 underscores the rigor of the FDA\u2019s review process. Experts believe this dual-targeting approach offers a significant advancement in managing heart failure, with broad benefits expected for patients with multiple chronic conditions.

Originally designed for type 2 diabetes, these drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1 to regulate insulin and satiety responses, enabling significant and sustained weight loss. One patient, St\u00e9phane, lost 25 kg in eight months using Wegovy, illustrating its dramatic impact. Approved in the U.S. in 2021 and in Europe shortly after, Wegovy has been made accessible to high-BMI patients in France since 2022 under early access protocols.\n\nUnlike older weight-loss drugs linked to severe health risks, GLP-1 agonists such as semaglutide and liraglutide offer more promising, safer results. However, experts stress that these drugs must complement lifestyle changes and medical support. Ongoing research focuses on how they function\u2014slowing digestion, affecting hunger centers in the brain, and altering food preferences\u2014and aims to identify genetic markers predicting responsiveness.\n\nWhile hailed as a revolution and \"breakthrough of the year\" by Science magazine, challenges remain: long-term effects, affordability, misuse, and equitable access. Developers are now exploring dual and triple-receptor drugs (GLP-1, GIP, glucagon), showing even higher efficacy. With obesity affecting over a billion globally, the stakes are immense for both public health and healthcare systems.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1718994616.0,"attribution":"www.lemonde.fr"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.goodhousekeeping.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64945075/increase-glp1-naturally/","title":"Can You Really Boost Your GLP-1 Naturally? Here's What Experts Say","snippet":"GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone naturally produced in the small intestine that plays a key role in regulating blood sugar, digestion, and appetite. While medications like Ozempic mimic GLP-1 to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity, it's also possible to naturally boost GLP-1 through lifestyle choices. Experts note that certain dietary patterns can enhance natural GLP-1 production, especially diets rich in fiber, prebiotics, protein, and healthy fats. Foods such as legumes, asparagus, bananas, and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids (like fish and flaxseed oil) can contribute to increased GLP-1 levels by supporting gut health and promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids.\n\nMoreover, moderate to high-intensity exercise is associated with short-term increases in GLP-1 levels and improved sensitivity, aiding in better appetite and blood sugar control. Although research is still emerging, particularly in humans, plant-based diets like the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets support GLP-1 production and overall health. Ultimately, increasing GLP-1 naturally involves focusing on overall eating patterns rather than any single food, particularly emphasizing prebiotic fiber (10 grams daily), while staying hydrated and making gradual dietary changes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1752310920.0,"attribution":"www.goodhousekeeping.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694aa1ec84a8832faed31aac8aa2f073","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6b485823-2ecb-4714-a538-e8b086e0a83a","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"49ddfbc3-2995-4ce9-9a2d-b2b4086a6d64","turn_exchange_id":"b85f3df2-6417-4d07-a2aa-819b1200b4b8","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"49ddfbc3-2995-4ce9-9a2d-b2b4086a6d64","children":["a7052282-635f-45b5-97e9-48a17c26438c"]},"a7052282-635f-45b5-97e9-48a17c26438c":{"id":"a7052282-635f-45b5-97e9-48a17c26438c","message":{"id":"a7052282-635f-45b5-97e9-48a17c26438c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766498847.271146,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Finding prediabetes monitoring guidelines","content":"I have enough sources for the medication mechanisms, so now I need to focus on prediabetes management.

Prediabetes, a condition where blood sugar is elevated but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis, often shows no symptoms and affects around 88 million Americans\u2014most of whom are unaware they have it. The American Diabetes Association recommends routine diabetes screenings every three years after age 35, or earlier for individuals with risk factors such as obesity, a family history of diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nPrevention strategies focus on lifestyle changes including losing 5\u20137% of body weight, engaging in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week), and adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Diagnostic tools like the A1C test and fasting plasma glucose test help identify prediabetes.\n\nThe article highlights the CDC\u2019s National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP), which offers coaching and support to significantly reduce diabetes risk. Early action is essential to prevent serious complications. Individuals are encouraged to get tested and consult healthcare providers for personalized advice and support.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1598708066.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-happens-when-a1c-is-too-high-5118384","title":"What Happens When A1C Levels Are Too High?","snippet":"A high A1C level, which reflects the average blood sugar over the past 2\u20133 months, signals poor blood sugar control and can indicate prediabetes or diabetes. An A1C below 5.7% is considered normal; 5.7% to 6.4% suggests prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher on two separate tests confirms diabetes. Chronic high A1C significantly raises the risk of complications including heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy), vision loss (diabetic retinopathy), and gum disease.\n\nProper management of A1C includes lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise (150 minutes of moderate activity weekly), stress management, and at times, medication. Dieticians or diabetes educators can help tailor meal plans. Medication regimens vary between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with insulin being essential for type 1 diabetes. Regular blood sugar monitoring and consultations with healthcare providers are key to managing and lowering A1C.\n\nThe test is usually conducted via a blood sample and does not require fasting unless additional tests are involved. As A1C results can be influenced by factors like anemia or pregnancy, accurate medical history and context are important. Regular A1C testing is recommended, especially for those over 45 or with diabetes risk factors.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1620324501.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.eatingwell.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eatingwell.com/what-you-should-do-first-when-diagnosed-with-prediabetes-8737560","title":"You Just Found Out You Have Prediabetes-Here Are 5 Things a Doctor Recommends You Do First","snippet":"If you've been diagnosed with prediabetes, it's an opportunity to adopt healthier habits and prevent progression to type 2 diabetes. More than one in three U.S. adults have prediabetes, making this a common but manageable condition. Prediabetes means your blood sugar is elevated\u2014an A1C between 5.7% and 6.4% or fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL\u2014but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis.\n\nTo manage it effectively, doctors recommend five key lifestyle changes:\n\n1. **Eat High-Fiber Foods**: Aim for 25\u201330 grams of fiber daily, especially starting with breakfast, to stabilize blood sugar.\n2. **Get Active**: Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity. Short, frequent walks and strength training can significantly lower A1C levels.\n3. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Focus on improving body composition through resistance training and set process-oriented goals rather than fixating on weight loss alone.\n4. **Prioritize Sleep and Stress Management**: Poor sleep and chronic stress can spike blood sugar. Use consistent sleep routines and stress-reducing strategies like breathing exercises.\n5. **Monitor Your Blood Sugar**: Tracking levels, particularly after meals, helps identify how your body responds to food and activity.\n\nWith proactive steps and medical guidance, it's possible to reverse or control prediabetes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1730808288.0,"attribution":"www.eatingwell.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694aa1ec84a8832faed31aac8aa2f073","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Managing Prediabetes, Medications, and Diabetes Overview","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6b485823-2ecb-4714-a538-e8b086e0a83a","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"bb55ff3b-1fc8-4891-a1bb-95310429c132","turn_exchange_id":"b85f3df2-6417-4d07-a2aa-819b1200b4b8","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bb55ff3b-1fc8-4891-a1bb-95310429c132","children":["78713116-d6ec-4275-a7f2-dc442c77abbb"]},"78713116-d6ec-4275-a7f2-dc442c77abbb":{"id":"78713116-d6ec-4275-a7f2-dc442c77abbb","message":{"id":"78713116-d6ec-4275-a7f2-dc442c77abbb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766498890.72658,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Structuring the final response on prediabetes management","content":"For the final response, I\u2019ll organize it like this:\n\n1.
