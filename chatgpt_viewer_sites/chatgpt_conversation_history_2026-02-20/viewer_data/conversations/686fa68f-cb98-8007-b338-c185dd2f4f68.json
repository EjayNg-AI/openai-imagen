The book, authored by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, claims that Trump invited Obama to play golf, promoting his global golf courses during their conversation. Despite a lack of past cordiality\u2014highlighted by Trump\u2019s former endorsement of the disproven \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy against Obama\u2014the two were seen smiling and talking during the event. Trump later acknowledged the exchange appeared friendly and remarked they \"probably do like each other,\" despite their differing political philosophies. This unexpected moment stood out given their historically strained relationship, including harsh criticisms and personal attacks, particularly from Michelle Obama, who condemned Trump's false birther claims in her memoir, Becoming. The encounter adds a surprising twist to the narrative surrounding the political and personal dynamics between the former presidents.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752073451.0,"attribution":"people.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cartercenter.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2024/statement-on-president-jimmy-carter-122924.html","title":"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter Passes Away at 100","snippet":"Jimmy Carter, 39 th president of the United States and winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, died peacefully Sunday, Dec. 29, at his home in Plains, Georgia.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1735430400.0,"attribution":"www.cartercenter.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/index.html","title":"Guinea Worm Eradication Program - The Carter Center","snippet":"The Guinea worm eradication campaign has reduced the disease by more than 99.99% and averted more than 100 million cases of this devasting disease among the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.cartercenter.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/gw-in-the-news-listing-page.html","title":"2025 Guinea Worm Eradication Program Media Coverage","snippet":"We invite you to read 2025 media highlights for the Guinea Worm Eradication Program below.

He achieved a significant milestone by brokering a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, but his term was mostly marked by failures. Carter's policy decisions, such as advocating for human rights and social justice, led to unreliable foreign relations and an inability to address adversaries effectively. Key missteps included proposing the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and underestimating the Soviet Union, which culminated in the invasion of Afghanistan. Domestically, his administration struggled with inflation, unemployment, and high interest rates. Carter's term ended with the Iranian hostage crisis, showcasing his weakened international stance. Post-presidency, even Carter's well-intended humanitarian efforts were sometimes undermined by poor geopolitical judgment. Overall, Carter's good character is acknowledged, but his presidency is regarded as notably flawed in leadership and policy execution.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1735549680.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686fa69cc550800790f5872e1a657f37","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"a4df1de7-63ee-4058-994e-1c1ac495a031","request_id":"95cfc8a1ca89ce7a-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a4df1de7-63ee-4058-994e-1c1ac495a031","children":["2f33d8c9-a2ac-4cc2-bca9-f7b409a348b8"]},"2f33d8c9-a2ac-4cc2-bca9-f7b409a348b8":{"id":"2f33d8c9-a2ac-4cc2-bca9-f7b409a348b8","message":{"id":"2f33d8c9-a2ac-4cc2-bca9-f7b409a348b8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752147624.034811,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into Carter's personality","content":"I want to explore aspects of Jimmy Carter's personality, especially the criticism of his micromanagement style during his time in the White House.

Carter, a little-known former governor from Plains, Georgia, announced his candidacy in December 1974 and became the Democratic nominee by July 1976. Following Nixon\u2019s resignation and Ford's pardon of him, Carter's outsider status and principles resonated with voters. Fallows worked as Carter\u2019s chief speechwriter until 1978, with his biggest task being Carter\u2019s gracious and short inaugural address. Carter's presidency (1977-1981) saw significant events like the Egypt-Israel peace negotiations at Camp David, a testament to Carter's attention to detail. Fallows notes Carter\u2019s detailed and sometimes micromanagement approach and moral firmness, both strengths and weaknesses in governance.

He campaigned as an ethical outsider after Watergate, promising \u201ca government as good as its people.\u201d His single term unfolded amid oil shocks, stagflation, and geopolitical tumult, and his approval ratings collapsed. Yet on his passing at age 100\u2014marked by a National Day of Mourning on 9 Jan 2025\u2014historians and policymakers again debated the balance between his perceived managerial shortcomings and his moral vision. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 2  Political Vision & Governance  \n\n#### 2.1 Domestic Policy  \n\n**Economic management & deregulation.** Carter inherited simultaneous high inflation, high unemployment, and energy-driven recession (\u201cstagflation\u201d). His orthodox fiscal restraint and credit-tightening failed to tame prices quickly, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s late-term shock therapy occurred too late to help him politically. Nonetheless, Carter shepherded path-breaking sectoral deregulation\u2014airlines, trucking, rail, and natural gas\u2014liberalizing fares and routes and seeding today\u2019s low-cost-carrier market. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201 Critics on the left argue these moves opened the door to the broader neoliberal turn of the 1980s. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n**Energy & environment.** Convinced that the 1970s oil shocks foreshadowed a permanent energy transition, Carter created the Department of Energy, pushed fuel-efficiency standards, subsidized solar research, and warned in his famous \u201cCrisis of Confidence\u201d speech that conservation was the \u201cmoral equivalent of war.\u201d Some policies (price decontrols, renewables R&D) proved farsighted; others (synthetic-fuels subsidies) faltered. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n\n#### 2.2 Foreign Policy  \n\n**Human-rights doctrine.** Carter placed human rights at the center of diplomacy, conditioning aid and public rhetoric\u2014even toward authoritarian allies. The initiative institutionalized rights reporting inside the State Department and influenced later administrations, but critics argued it frayed relations with key anticommunist partners. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n\n**Major diplomatic achievements.**  \n* *Camp David Accords (1978)* yielded the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty, largely intact nearly half a century later. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n* *Torrijos-Carter Treaties (1977-78)* returned the Panama Canal by 1999, easing a chronic hemispheric grievance while surviving fierce domestic opposition. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201  \n* *SALT II* (1979) capped strategic arms, though the Senate never ratified it after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  \n\n**Crises & limitations.**  \n* *Iranian hostage crisis (1979-81).* The 444-day standoff dominated headlines and symbolized impotence, arguably costing Carter re-election. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201  \n* *Afghanistan & Soviet d\u00e9tente collapse.* The December 1979 invasion shattered d\u00e9tente; Carter\u2019s embargo and Olympic boycott were viewed as reactive rather than anticipatory.  \n* The administration also struggled to articulate a coherent grand strategy linking human-rights idealism with Cold-War power politics.  \n\n---\n\n### 3  Personality & Leadership Style  \n\nCarter\u2019s defining personal traits\u2014piety, probity, and intellectual rigor\u2014won trust abroad but often clashed with Washington\u2019s transactional culture. Observers recall his insistence on reading reams of departmental memos, approving White House tennis-court schedules, and initially operating without a chief of staff, hallmarks of his celebrated (and maligned) micromanagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2news9\ue201  \n\nHis outsider ethos bred mutual suspicion with congressional barons; legislative coalitions on health-care reform and labor law collapsed, not for want of ideas but for want of political brokerage. Carter\u2019s propensity for moral lecture over retail persuasion, and his difficulty delegating, undercut public communication during crises, compounding perceptions of drift. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### 4  Legacy  \n\n#### 4.1 Re-evaluation of the Presidency  \n\nRecent scholarship argues that many failures were structural\u2014oil shocks, post-Vietnam self-doubt, and systemic inflation\u2014while achievements in deregulation, environmental foresight, and Middle East diplomacy were undervalued for decades. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n#### 4.2 Humanitarian post-presidency  \n\nCarter transformed the ex-presidency, building the Carter Center into a global force for election monitoring, conflict mediation, and disease eradication. Guinea-worm cases plummeted from 3.5 million (1986) to only 15 worldwide in 2024\u2014an outcome arguably as consequential as any Oval Office decision. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201 His Habitat for Humanity builds, Nobel Peace Prize (2002), and relentless diplomacy redefined the role of \u201cformer president\u201d from elder statesman to active humanitarian. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news8\ue201  \n\n#### 4.3 Enduring influence  \n\n* **Energy/climate:** Today\u2019s bipartisan attention to efficiency and renewables echoes Carter\u2019s 1977 energy blueprint.  \n* **Human rights:** Annual State Department rights reports trace directly to his reforms, embedding liberal norms in U.S. statecraft.  \n* **Deregulation template:** Later Democratic administrations accepted competition policy frameworks Carter pioneered.  \n* **Model of integrity:** Amid rising cynicism, Carter\u2019s life is cited as evidence that personal decency and public service need not be mutually exclusive.  \n\n#### 4.4 Persistent critiques and lessons  \n\n* Moral clarity without political craft can immobilize an agenda.  \n* Micromanagement in a complex presidency stifles strategic focus.  \n* Economic credibility often overrides diplomatic triumphs in voters\u2019 minds.  \n\n---\n\n### 5  Conclusion  \n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s story resists simple binaries of \u201cgood man/bad president.\u201d He injected moral purpose into American power, scored durable diplomatic victories, and anticipated twenty-first-century energy and rights debates. Yet his managerial style, economic misfortunes, and crisis messaging left the impression of an administration adrift. The arc of his life\u2014culminating in four decades of transformative humanitarian work\u2014suggests a legacy that ultimately transcends the confines of a turbulent single term. For future leaders, Carter offers a dual lesson: ethical conviction is indispensable, but without political acumen and organizational discipline, conviction alone seldom sustains governing success."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":616,"end_idx":648,"safe_urls":["https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2024/statement-on-president-jimmy-carter-122924.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.obamalibrary.gov/news/national-archives-mark-day-mourning-former-president-jimmy-carter-january-9-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Carter Center](https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2024/statement-on-president-jimmy-carter-122924.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [obamalibrary.gov](https://www.obamalibrary.gov/news/national-archives-mark-day-mourning-former-president-jimmy-carter-january-9-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter Passes Away at 100","url":"https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2024/statement-on-president-jimmy-carter-122924.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1735430400.0,"snippet":"Jimmy Carter, 39 th president of the United States and winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, died peacefully Sunday, Dec. 29, at his home in Plains, Georgia.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Carter Center"},{"title":"National Archives to Mark Day of Mourning for Former President ...","url":"https://www.obamalibrary.gov/news/national-archives-mark-day-mourning-former-president-jimmy-carter-january-9-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1736380800.0,"snippet":"On January 9, 2025, the National Archives will mark the National Day of Mourning for the 39th President, Jimmy Carter, who died December 29, 2024.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"obamalibrary.gov"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201","start_idx":1235,"end_idx":1280,"safe_urls":["https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/airline-deregulation-when-everything-changed?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_Deregulation_Act?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/235277/jimmy-carter-retrospective.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Gallup.com](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/235277/jimmy-carter-retrospective.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [National Air and Space Museum](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/airline-deregulation-when-everything-changed?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_Deregulation_Act?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Jimmy Carter Retrospective -

Carter, a little-known former governor from Plains, Georgia, announced his candidacy in December 1974 and became the Democratic nominee by July 1976. Following Nixon\u2019s resignation and Ford's pardon of him, Carter's outsider status and principles resonated with voters. Fallows worked as Carter\u2019s chief speechwriter until 1978, with his biggest task being Carter\u2019s gracious and short inaugural address. Carter's presidency (1977-1981) saw significant events like the Egypt-Israel peace negotiations at Camp David, a testament to Carter's attention to detail. Fallows notes Carter\u2019s detailed and sometimes micromanagement approach and moral firmness, both strengths and weaknesses in governance. Economic challenges, the Iran hostage crisis, and high interest rates marred his presidency. Post-presidency, Carter continued his humanitarian work, upheld by strong religious faith and moral leadership, setting a high standard for former presidents.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Australian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue201","start_idx":4087,"end_idx":4106,"safe_urls":["https://icma.org/articles/article/leadership-lessons-jimmy-carter?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([icma.org](https://icma.org/articles/article/leadership-lessons-jimmy-carter?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Leadership Lessons from Jimmy Carter | icma.org","url":"https://icma.org/articles/article/leadership-lessons-jimmy-carter?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1489968000.0,"snippet":"Carter also refused to meet with congressional leaders on critically important issues; filled White House aide positions with predominately ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"icma.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":4414,"end_idx":4433,"safe_urls":["https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/30/jonathan-alter-jimmy-carter-presidency-reappraisal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/30/jonathan-alter-jimmy-carter-presidency-reappraisal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Jimmy Carter's presidency is ripe for a major reappraisal","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/30/jonathan-alter-jimmy-carter-presidency-reappraisal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1735516800.0,"snippet":"His time in office is remembered almost exclusively for events that were largely beyond his control.

Carter's post-presidential years distinguished him as a revered global figure. He founded the Carter Center, dedicated to promoting peace, democracy, human rights, and eradicating diseases, significantly contributing to the virtual elimination of guinea worms. Throughout his post-presidential life, he traveled widely, brokered international agreements, and engaged in humanitarian efforts, earning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
