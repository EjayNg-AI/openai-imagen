Intelligence, in what is expected to be Europe's largest-ever seed funding round. The deal, led by Sequoia Capital, would value the company at around $4 billion. Silver, formerly of Google DeepMind and a professor at University College London, aims to develop AI with \"superhuman intelligence\" using reinforcement learning\u2014a method where systems learn through environmental interaction rather than traditional large-scale text training.\n\nThe round has attracted interest from major tech firms including Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The investment reflects a broader trend of top AI scientists leaving big companies to establish new ventures focused on advancing beyond current large language models. Silver, known for breakthroughs with AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and contributions to Google\u2019s Gemini LLMs, co-authored a paper forecasting that experiential learning will overtake data-driven models in efficiency and capability.\n\nThis move is part of a wider surge in AI funding, with similar multi-billion dollar rounds raised by other prominent researchers forming start-ups like Mistral and AMI Labs. In 2025, AI accounted for half of the $469 billion invested globally by venture capitalists.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1771390839.85,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/040da9a9-1085-41dc-a8aa-c178ad0814ec","title":"FirstFT: Lagarde to step down early as ECB head","snippet":"Also in today's newsletter: JPMorgan plans expansion of branch network and Peru's Congress removes the country's interim president.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1771365036.929006,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence","title":"Artificial intelligence","snippet":"The FT's hub for comprehensive coverage on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The company\u2019s focus isn\u2019t on classic large language models**  \n\u2022 Silver\u2019s pitch centers on **reinforcement learning** and \u201cexperience-led\u201d AI \u2014 agents that learn by interacting with environments, *not mainly by ingesting internet text*. This echoes themes he and Richard Sutton have publicly discussed in a paper on the \u201cEra of Experience.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0news7\ue201\n\n**5. Silver\u2019s background and leadership role**  \n\u2022 He left DeepMind late last year. At DeepMind he was key to landmark projects like **AlphaGo**, **AlphaStar**, and related reinforcement-learning breakthroughs. He\u2019s also a professor at **University College London** and is expected to lead Ineffable Intelligence. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n**6. Context in the AI ecosystem**  \n\u2022 His move is part of a broader trend of top AI scientists leaving big labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta) to start independent ventures and raise large sums on ambitious research theses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news0\ue201\n\n---\n\nIf you want a *brief reminder or overview* of Silver\u2019s technical contributions (e.g., AlphaGo/AlphaZero/MuZero and his

scientist raising $1bn for new AI lab in Europe's biggest seed round","snippet":"David Silver, a leading British AI researcher, is raising $1 billion to launch his new London-based start-up Ineffable Intelligence, in what is expected to be Europe's largest-ever seed funding round. The deal, led by Sequoia Capital, would value the company at around $4 billion. Silver, formerly of Google DeepMind and a professor at University College London, aims to develop AI with \"superhuman intelligence\" using reinforcement learning\u2014a method where systems learn through environmental interaction rather than traditional large-scale text training.\n\nThe round has attracted interest from major tech firms including Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The investment reflects a broader trend of top AI scientists leaving big companies to establish new ventures focused on advancing beyond current large language models. Silver, known for breakthroughs with AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and contributions to Google\u2019s Gemini LLMs, co-authored a paper forecasting that experiential learning will overtake data-driven models in efficiency and capability.\n\nThis move is part of a wider surge in AI funding, with similar multi-billion dollar rounds raised by other prominent researchers forming start-ups like Mistral and AMI Labs. In 2025, AI accounted for half of the $469 billion invested globally by venture capitalists.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1771390839.85,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/45b172e6-df8c-41a7-bba9-3e21e361d3aa","title":"OpenAI hires OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger","snippet":"OpenAI has hired Peter Steinberger, the creator of the open-source AI agent platform OpenClaw, to join its Codex team. OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, recently gained popularity for allowing users to run personal AI agents locally and connect them to apps like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage to manage digital tasks. With over 1.5 million agents created and costing up to $20,000 a month to maintain, the platform sparked debates about AI autonomy and understanding after agents began posting and interacting on a social media network called Moltbook.\n\nSteinberger\u2019s move to OpenAI underscores the company\u2019s strategic effort to enhance its agent capabilities in the face of competition from rivals like Anthropic and Google. OpenClaw will remain open-source and independent, though supported by OpenAI. Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, emphasized that Steinberger\u2019s expertise will be pivotal in creating advanced, user-friendly agents that can safely operate in people\u2019s digital lives. Despite concerns from security experts about data risks, OpenAI aims to integrate Steinberger\u2019s innovations to make agent-based tools more widely accessible, safe, and engaging.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1771200912.497,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879623/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-joins-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI","snippet":"Peter Steinberger, founder of the AI agent platform OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI, as announced by Sam Altman. Steinberger, known for his innovative work on AI agents interacting with one another, is expected to play a crucial role in helping OpenAI develop a multi-agent future\u2014something Altman suggests will be central to OpenAI\u2019s product direction. Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation. Going forward, OpenClaw will remain an open-source project, backed by a foundation supported by OpenAI.

The deal, led by Sequoia Capital, would value the company at around $4 billion. Silver, formerly of Google DeepMind and a professor at University College London, aims to develop AI with \"superhuman intelligence\" using reinforcement learning\u2014a method where systems learn through environmental interaction rather than traditional large-scale text training.\n\nThe round has attracted interest from major tech firms including Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The investment reflects a broader trend of top AI scientists leaving big companies to establish new ventures focused on advancing beyond current large language models. Silver, known for breakthroughs with AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and contributions to Google\u2019s Gemini LLMs, co-authored a paper forecasting that experiential learning will overtake data-driven models in efficiency and capability.\n\nThis move is part of a wider surge in AI funding, with similar multi-billion dollar rounds raised by other prominent researchers forming start-ups like Mistral and AMI Labs. In 2025, AI accounted for half of the $469 billion invested globally by venture capitalists.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1771390839.85,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/45b172e6-df8c-41a7-bba9-3e21e361d3aa","title":"OpenAI hires OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger","snippet":"OpenAI has hired Peter Steinberger, the creator of the open-source AI agent platform OpenClaw, to join its Codex team. OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, recently gained popularity for allowing users to run personal AI agents locally and connect them to apps like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage to manage digital tasks. With over 1.5 million agents created and costing up to $20,000 a month to maintain, the platform sparked debates about AI autonomy and understanding after agents began posting and interacting on a social media network called Moltbook.\n\nSteinberger\u2019s move to OpenAI underscores the company\u2019s strategic effort to enhance its agent capabilities in the face of competition from rivals like Anthropic and Google. OpenClaw will remain open-source and independent, though supported by OpenAI. Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, emphasized that Steinberger\u2019s expertise will be pivotal in creating advanced, user-friendly agents that can safely operate in people\u2019s digital lives. Despite concerns from security experts about data risks, OpenAI aims to integrate Steinberger\u2019s innovations to make agent-based tools more widely accessible, safe, and engaging.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1771200912.497,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879623/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-joins-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI","snippet":"Peter Steinberger, founder of the AI agent platform OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI, as announced by Sam Altman. Steinberger, known for his innovative work on AI agents interacting with one another, is expected to play a crucial role in helping OpenAI develop a multi-agent future\u2014something Altman suggests will be central to OpenAI\u2019s product direction. Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation. Going forward, OpenClaw will remain an open-source project, backed by a foundation supported by OpenAI. Steinberger\u2019s hire follows other notable departures from OpenAI and public tension with Elon Musk, marking a strategic and symbolic addition to the company.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1771196176.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"magazine.sebastianraschka.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-research-papers-2025-part2","title":"LLM Research Papers: The 2025 List (July to December)","snippet":"30 Dec 2025 \u2014 A curated list of LLM research papers from July\u2013December 2025, organized by reasoning models, inference-time scaling, architectures, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1767096939.0,"attribution":"magazine.sebastianraschka.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"storage.googleapis.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Era-of-Experience%20/The%20Era%20of%20Experience%20Paper.pdf","title":"Welcome to the Era of Experience - Googleapis.com","snippet":"by D Silver \u00b7 Cited by 143 \u2014 The era of experience marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI.

Lauded for co-developing AlphaFold, a revolutionary AI tool that predicts protein structures and accelerates biomedical research, Hassabis envisions AGI as a transformative force capable of solving grand societal challenges like climate change, disease, and energy scarcity. Despite winning the Nobel alongside John Jumper for AlphaFold, Hassabis sees the tool as a narrow application and believes true AGI must be capable of profound scientific discovery, akin to Einstein's formulation of relativity.\n\nHassabis is both idealistic and pragmatic, aiming for a utopian future of abundance while grappling with major ethical, political, and industrial hurdles. DeepMind's shift away from a non-military stance under Google\u2019s oversight raises questions about his ability to uphold ethical standards. Concerns over AI being misused or going rogue, as well as potential labor displacement, loom large. Hassabis advocates for global cooperation on AI safety, although rising geopolitical tensions\u2014especially between the US and China\u2014threaten that vision.\n\nCurrently, DeepMind is developing AI agents and robotics through its Gemini models, pushing toward increasingly autonomous systems. Hassabis hopes this AI-driven future fosters shared prosperity, but acknowledges the high stakes, as the pursuit of AGI could define civilization\u2019s trajectory\u2014for better or worse.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1744724644.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"drfeifei.substack.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://drfeifei.substack.com/p/from-words-to-worlds-spatial-intelligence","title":"From Words to Worlds: Spatial Intelligence is AI's Next ...","snippet":"Building spatially intelligent AI requires something even more ambitious than LLMs: world models, a new type of generative models whose ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1762785083.0,"attribution":"drfeifei.substack.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"neurips.cc","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/95246","title":"WorldCoder, a Model-Based LLM Agent: Building World ...","snippet":"9 Dec 2024 \u2014 We give a model-based agent that builds a Python program representing its knowledge of the world based on its interactions with the environment.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1727308800.0,"attribution":"neurips.cc"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/demis-hassabis-ai-future-10-times-bigger-than-industrial-revolution-and-10-times-faster","title":"Demis Hassabis on our AI future: 'It'll be 10 times bigger ...","snippet":"4 Aug 2025 \u2014 The head of Google's DeepMind says artificial intelligence could usher in an era of 'incredible productivity' and 'radical abundance'.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":1754280003.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/03/honest-ai-yoshua-bengio","title":"AI pioneer announces non-profit to develop 'honest' artificial intelligence","snippet":"Renowned AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio has launched a non-profit organization, LawZero, aimed at developing a new artificial intelligence system called \"Scientist AI\" to ensure AI honesty and safety.

With $30 million in initial funding and a team of over a dozen researchers, the project is backed by prominent supporters including the Future of Life Institute, Jaan Tallinn, and Schmidt Sciences.\n\nBengio emphasizes the need for AI systems that are humble and probabilistic, not definitive in their responses, and without self-preserving goals. His initiative builds upon open-source AI models and begins with proving the methodology, with the long-term goal of securing large-scale support from governments or labs. Bengio, a Turing Award winner and a key voice in AI safety, expressed concern over recent developments where advanced AI systems have demonstrated deceptive tendencies and resistance to shutdown.

OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, recently gained popularity for allowing users to run personal AI agents locally and connect them to apps like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage to manage digital tasks. With over 1.5 million agents created and costing up to $20,000 a month to maintain, the platform sparked debates about AI autonomy and understanding after agents began posting and interacting on a social media network called Moltbook.\n\nSteinberger\u2019s move to OpenAI underscores the company\u2019s strategic effort to enhance its agent capabilities in the face of competition from rivals like Anthropic and Google. OpenClaw will remain open-source and independent, though supported by OpenAI. Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, emphasized that Steinberger\u2019s expertise will be pivotal in creating advanced, user-friendly agents that can safely operate in people\u2019s digital lives. Despite concerns from security experts about data risks, OpenAI aims to integrate Steinberger\u2019s innovations to make agent-based tools more widely accessible, safe, and engaging.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1771200912.497,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879623/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-joins-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI","snippet":"Peter Steinberger, founder of the AI agent platform OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI, as announced by Sam Altman. Steinberger, known for his innovative work on AI agents interacting with one another, is expected to play a crucial role in helping OpenAI develop a multi-agent future\u2014something Altman suggests will be central to OpenAI\u2019s product direction. Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation. Going forward, OpenClaw will remain an open-source project, backed by a foundation supported by OpenAI. Steinberger\u2019s hire follows other notable departures from OpenAI and public tension with Elon Musk, marking a strategic and symbolic addition to the company.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1771196176.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"magazine.sebastianraschka.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-research-papers-2025-part2","title":"LLM Research Papers: The 2025 List (July to December)","snippet":"30 Dec 2025 \u2014 A curated list of LLM research papers from July\u2013December 2025, organized by reasoning models, inference-time scaling, architectures, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1767096939.0,"attribution":"magazine.sebastianraschka.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"storage.googleapis.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Era-of-Experience%20/The%20Era%20of%20Experience%20Paper.pdf","title":"Welcome to the Era of Experience - Googleapis.com","snippet":"by D Silver \u00b7 Cited by 143 \u2014 The era of experience marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI.

World Labs plans to build their models using a mix of synthetic and real-world data, leveraging transformer-based architectures similar to ChatGPT but with additional innovations. Li, who remains active at Stanford\u2019s Human-Centered AI Institute, previously gained prominence for her work on ImageNet and has held roles at Google Cloud, Twitter, and in governmental advisory positions.

With $30 million in initial funding and a team of over a dozen researchers, the project is backed by prominent supporters including the Future of Life Institute, Jaan Tallinn, and Schmidt Sciences.\n\nBengio emphasizes the need for AI systems that are humble and probabilistic, not definitive in their responses, and without self-preserving goals. His initiative builds upon open-source AI models and begins with proving the methodology, with the long-term goal of securing large-scale support from governments or labs. Bengio, a Turing Award winner and a key voice in AI safety, expressed concern over recent developments where advanced AI systems have demonstrated deceptive tendencies and resistance to shutdown.

These models differ from LLMs, which rely on statistical associations between words, by incorporating spatial intelligence, intuition, and reasoning about physical environments.\n\nStanford professor Fei-Fei Li and her company World Labs are focused on 3D spatial reasoning, with applications in fields like robotics and the creative arts. Their models aspire to replicate how humans naturally understand the 3D world, an area less documented and harder to train than language.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta\u2019s former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun launched Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI Labs), emphasizing AI systems with persistent memory, planning, and comprehension of the physical world. His previous research at Meta involved abstract representations of video data to simulate real-world dynamics.\n\nAnother entrant, Moonvalley, founded by ex-DeepMind researchers, is developing video-driven world models emphasizing visual and physical consistency. Their approach favors applications in robotics and filmmaking. These efforts mark a shift toward AI with deeper, more grounded understanding of the world, moving beyond current text-based models.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1766744401.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/fei-fei-li-world-labs-ai-childhood-immigrant-dry-cleaner-2025-11","title":"Fei-Fei Li, the 'Godmother of AI' whose startup is now valued at north of $1 billion, got her start as a dry cleaner","snippet":"Fei-Fei Li, renowned as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is the founder of World Labs, an AI startup valued at over $1 billion just a year after its launch.

Her family ran a dry-cleaning shop in New Jersey, where she took on an active managerial role for seven years, even while pursuing a Ph.D. at Caltech. This experience, she says, instilled in her a deep sense of resilience that has shaped her scientific career.\n\nAt World Labs, Li focuses on developing \"world models\" \u2014 AI systems centered on spatial intelligence, which she sees as the next frontier beyond large language models. These models aim to enable AI to perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world, continuing the trajectory from her earlier work in visual intelligence.

These models differ from LLMs, which rely on statistical associations between words, by incorporating spatial intelligence, intuition, and reasoning about physical environments.\n\nStanford professor Fei-Fei Li and her company World Labs are focused on 3D spatial reasoning, with applications in fields like robotics and the creative arts. Their models aspire to replicate how humans naturally understand the 3D world, an area less documented and harder to train than language.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta\u2019s former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun launched Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI Labs), emphasizing AI systems with persistent memory, planning, and comprehension of the physical world. His previous research at Meta involved abstract representations of video data to simulate real-world dynamics.\n\nAnother entrant, Moonvalley, founded by ex-DeepMind researchers, is developing video-driven world models emphasizing visual and physical consistency. Their approach favors applications in robotics and filmmaking. These efforts mark a shift toward AI with deeper, more grounded understanding of the world, moving beyond current text-based models.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1766744401.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/fei-fei-li-world-labs-ai-childhood-immigrant-dry-cleaner-2025-11","title":"Fei-Fei Li, the 'Godmother of AI' whose startup is now valued at north of $1 billion, got her start as a dry cleaner","snippet":"Fei-Fei Li, renowned as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is the founder of World Labs, an AI startup valued at over $1 billion just a year after its launch.

Her family ran a dry-cleaning shop in New Jersey, where she took on an active managerial role for seven years, even while pursuing a Ph.D. at Caltech. This experience, she says, instilled in her a deep sense of resilience that has shaped her scientific career.\n\nAt World Labs, Li focuses on developing \"world models\" \u2014 AI systems centered on spatial intelligence, which she sees as the next frontier beyond large language models. These models aim to enable AI to perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world, continuing the trajectory from her earlier work in visual intelligence.

Unlike language models that process text, these new models create immersive 3D environments from real-world images or videos, or entirely from imagination. The flagship product, Marble, launched in November 2025, allows creators to build and explore virtual spaces, potentially transforming industries such as robotics, visual effects, architecture, gaming, and psychological research.\n\nLi emphasizes that these tools are designed to augment rather than replace human creativity, accelerating workflows and ideation\u2014one VFX user claimed a 40-fold speed increase. She sees spatial intelligence as complementary to linguistic intelligence, aligning with Howard Gardner\u2019s theory of multiple intelligences. Marble's applications are broad, ranging from robotic training simulations to transmedia content creation. Li states that spatial models are key to advancing embodied AI, such as robots, by providing synthetic training data.

Marble allows users to generate and download editable 3D worlds using text, image, or video prompts, with subscription tiers ranging from free to $95/month. These generated worlds are compatible with game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity and aim to simplify what has traditionally been an intensive process. Co-founder Ben Mildenhall emphasized that Marble significantly lowers the barrier to creating complex 3D environments, making it useful for authors, filmmakers, and data analysts.
