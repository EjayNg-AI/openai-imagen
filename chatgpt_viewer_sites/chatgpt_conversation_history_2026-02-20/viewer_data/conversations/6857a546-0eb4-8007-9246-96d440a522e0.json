It has been just over a year since you assumed office as the Prime Minister of Singapore and nearly a month since your cabinet was sworn in. So how has this transition into the role been for you and the responsibilities that come with leading a nation?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** It's a big job with significant responsibilities. There's nothing that really prepares you for this, and even for someone like me, I've been in government for a long time. I've been in the civil service for nearly 15 years and in politics for about 14 years, so nearly 30 years of experience. Still, coming into a job like this, there is still a lot to learn and adapt and adjust to. But fortunately, I have a strong team of ministers and Members of Parliament supporting me, and so it has been a smooth transition, both in the government and in the leadership of the People's Action Party. I led the party into our general elections, and I am very grateful that Singaporeans gave me a clear mandate to lead for another term.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Visit to China and Bilateral Relations\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Prime Minister Wong, you've been to China many times before, but you are going to embark on your very first official trip to China as the Prime Minister of Singapore next week. So what different expectations do you have for this trip, and what will be the key priorities guiding your agenda?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** Well, I made it a point to visit China almost every year since entering politics because it's useful to visit regularly to interact, exchange notes with my counterparts, and to get a sense of how China is moving and transforming. I've always had good visits; I've always had good exchanges and meetings with my counterparts. As you say, this time will be a different occasion. It's more special this time because it's my first visit in my capacity as Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nI would look forward to achieving several objectives: first, to just establish closer ties with Chinese leaders, especially with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang. Second, to reaffirm our shared commitment to enhancing our bilateral cooperation, especially as we mark the 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year. And then, of course, thirdly, to discuss the wider regional and global developments that we are all confronting during this challenging period and to see how we can continue working together to strengthen multilateralism and the rules-based global order.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** You met with Chinese President Xi Jinping last November on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. What's your impression and also some of the major takeaways from your meeting with President Xi? And as you just mentioned, you will be scheduled to meet President Xi again. What are some of the major topics that you hope to touch upon during this meeting?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** We had a short but productive meeting at the sidelines of APEC last year, my first time in fact as Prime Minister at that time. We discussed our bilateral cooperation, we discussed cooperation in regional platforms like APEC and how we can take this forward. And I said to the President at that time that I would be visiting China next year\u2014that was in 2024, I said next year in 2025\u2014when we mark the 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties. So I'm doing so right after the elections, at the soonest possible opportunity to visit China now, and I hope to be able to meet him again.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** And just now you mentioned that your visit this time coincides with the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations. So how do you interpret this partnership, which was upgraded in 2023, now termed as an \"all-round, high-quality, future-oriented partnership,\" and what is your vision towards the future trajectory of it?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** China and Singapore have a very close and steadfast partnership. It's a partnership that's built on mutual trust, respect, and understanding. It started with our founding Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, and Mr. Deng Xiaoping, and successive Prime Ministers of Singapore since then have built on that strong foundation to establish close rapport and trust with their Chinese counterparts. So I hope to do the same in my visit with Chinese leaders, especially with President Xi and Premier Li. And I think the close ties at the leadership level set the tone for the overall relationship.\r\n\r\nWe have an apex body called the JCBC, the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, that oversees the many multifaceted and comprehensive projects we have with one another. I used to be the Singapore co-chair of the JCBC. In fact, the JCBC meets every year. Each time they meet, the agenda keeps growing because there are so many things to discuss. But it's not just the number of projects, because in the spirit of our partnership, we are pursuing projects that are all-round or comprehensive, that are high in quality, and are also future-oriented. And so these are the guideposts that will shape our cooperation in the future. And with the close partnership we have, I am optimistic that the future of our cooperation is bright and there are many more things we can do together.\r\n\r\n### Reflections on China's Development\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** As you just raised, you've been to China many times, to cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, etc. So what are some of the major changes and transformations you have witnessed through all those years in terms of China's development and modernization that you think are inspirational to you in governing a nation?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** The transformation and success of China, I feel, is nothing short of an economic miracle. Because in the last 20 or so years when I've been visiting China regularly, even as a civil servant and then later as a politician, across so many different Chinese cities\u2014not just your Beijing and Shanghai, but even in a city like Chengdu and other cities\u2014you can see transformation happening. You can see the determination and the drive of the Chinese people to move forward, and you can see lives getting better and improving. So it's a remarkable change, and I continue to wish China every success in its ongoing transformation and modernization efforts.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** And you recently made the remark that \"never bet on the decline of China.\" So what are the key factors that underpin your confidence? And has China's recent economic performance, especially amidst the global headwinds, reinforced your belief in its long-term resilience and also potential?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** Well, first of all, is what I've just described: it's the track record of success, remarkable success. Of course, you can say past performance does not predict future performance, but still, it's a very impressive track record which gives one confidence. But a second factor is that I've interacted so many times with Chinese leaders at all levels\u2014the mayors, the party secretaries, the governors, and of course the leaders at the center in Beijing\u2014and I've always been impressed by the high level of competence, by their deep mastery of issues. They understand the challenges, they are focused on resolving the challenges and problems that China faces.\r\n\r\nBut it's more than just competence and mastery; it's also a willingness to listen and to be open-minded about finding better solutions. Because governments never get everything right; it's impossible. Governments will make mistakes from time to time. What distinguishes a high-quality system is the ability to reflect, learn, and keep on improving and doing better. And I see that in the Chinese system. But the biggest reason, the most important reason why I have confidence in China, is because of the people of China. It's because of their tremendous ingenuity and resourcefulness, the deep drive to succeed, to strive and work hard. And that gives me confidence that China will continue to have a good future ahead.\r\n\r\n### Global Challenges and Multilateralism\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** You'll be attending the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, which will take place in Tianjin this year, also known as Summer Davos. So what will be the key messages that you hope to deliver there, especially with this global context, with the world now going through choppy waters filled with so many different challenges?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** We are in the midst of a profound global change. So my message at Tianjin will be the importance of upholding a rules-based multilateral order. Because without rules, without long-standing norms of cooperation, countries everywhere will be worse off. Small countries like Singapore, of course, are very concerned because we have limited bargaining power and we risk being sidelined and squeezed by the bigger powers. But I think big countries will be impacted too, because if we end up in a world that's more fragmented, where there's deep suspicion and mistrust of one another, this will be a world with great uncertainty and volatility. And you will have slower growth and higher inflation in the global economy, which means all countries will suffer, and our people at the end of the day will be the ones facing the impact. So we have to do something about this. Of course, multilateralism today is not perfect. There are things that can be improved, but our response should not be to abandon the multilateral system. Our response should be to reform, change, improve, and make the system work better for the benefit of all countries.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Given the challenges you just touched upon\u2014the tensions in trade, the anti-globalization trend, various geopolitical risks, and so many different pressing issues faced by the world\u2014what is your top concern for Singapore from your perspective?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** Well, we know that from Singapore's perspective, we are small, we are an open economy, we rely heavily on trade. So this new external environment will make it less hospitable for us to continue flourishing. So we have to find ways to navigate the external environment carefully. But I think despite the changes that we see around us, trade will still continue. Countries do want to be more self-sufficient in this new environment, but it's not possible for any single country to do everything themselves.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** But talking about trade, you've recently described the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration as a \"seismic change in the global order,\" suggesting the era of free trade is over. Given what you have just mentioned, Singapore's heavy reliance on global trade, what are the specific plans or the priorities for your government to navigate through the shifts and also the pressure in the global trading system?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** As I mentioned just now, the era of free trade or the era that we are familiar with may be over, but trade will still continue. Different configurations, different supply chains. We will try to be competitive, we will try to stay relevant, but at the same time, we will work with like-minded countries to uphold free trade and to uphold a rules-based trading system. And we are doing this with our neighbors in ASEAN. So within ASEAN, we are accelerating our integration, bringing down trade and non-trade barriers so that we can make ASEAN a more integrated community, more competitive, more attractive for investors. We are doing this with partners in Asia like China, India, Japan, South Korea, for example, working closely with all the key players in Asia. But we are also pursuing this with countries outside of Asia, like the EU, Latin America, Africa, for example. And some of these are countries we are not so familiar with, but we think we should now make an extra effort to establish closer links with them. We are also strengthening our cooperation in regional platforms like RCEP and CPTPP, and we are finding ways to establish new linkages across different platforms, for example, between ASEAN and other groupings. So these are all different areas we are exploring. I believe in every crisis, there will always be opportunities, and so we are finding ways to seize new opportunities for ourselves and for other countries.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Just like the Chinese phrase \"w\u0113ij\u012b.\"\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** So opportunities always come with... we may speak English, but we are very Asian in our thinking.\r\n\r\n### Deepening China-Singapore Cooperation\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Speaking of regional and global cooperation, China and ASEAN about a month ago have announced the conclusion of negotiations on Version 3.0 of the FTA, with the aim to be signed by year-end. So how do you interpret the significance of this upgraded protocol, especially in this global context of rising protectionism and uncertainties?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** It's a very important upgrade, and Singapore fully supports it. It's in line with the spirit of what I said just now, that amidst the pressures of protectionism and trade barriers, Singapore will want to work closely with ASEAN and other like-minded countries to continue to uphold free trade and a rules-based trading system. So in that spirit, we fully support the upgrade to the China-ASEAN FTA. We hope this can be signed at the coming ASEAN-China Summit in October and that the new upgrade will come into force soon after that.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Over the years, China and Singapore have established three major government-to-government projects in Suzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing, and also state-level bilateral cooperation projects such as the Guangzhou Knowledge City. Mr. Prime Minister, do you envision, for instance, introducing a new project during your term, or what are some of the new areas of cooperation do you expect apart from these existing initiatives?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** I would first clarify that these existing initiatives are not simply projects that are completed and then we've turned the page and we move on to something else. They are developing and growing; they are work in progress. In fact, they are platforms. The G2G, the government-to-government initiatives that we have, are platforms for wider cooperation.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, the Suzhou Industrial Park, which was our first government-to-government cooperation, was very successful, and now we recently marked the 30th anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park. And now we're looking at a new frontier for cooperation, where the cooperation may be wider, not just between the government entities but with a wider ecosystem of players. Or take another example of Tianjin Eco-City. Yes, it started as a barren wasteland, and the vision was to transform this place into a place for eco-living, green living. We've achieved that vision, and recently we marked the 15th anniversary of the Tianjin Eco-City. And now we are saying, let's look ahead, have a new chapter, and think about how the Tianjin project can be a model for high-quality green development and sustainable growth for China.\r\n\r\nSo in each of these projects, we are constantly finding new ways to cooperate. At the same time, beyond these existing platforms, we are always open to new ideas, and we are continuing to discuss new possibilities for cooperation, including in areas like low-carbon green energy, digital economy, and biomedical sciences. So the point is, the cooperation between our two countries, because of the close partnership, is never static. It never stands still. We are always upgrading, improving, trying to find new opportunities to cooperate and to be responsive to the needs of our times. That's the spirit of our cooperation. That's why I'm so confident that we can continue to do more together.\r\n\r\n### The Geopolitical Landscape\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** The world is now going through so many major challenges, the challenges unseen in a century. So what is your reading, your evaluation of the current global scene in terms of the geopolitical risks, those uncertainties that we're faced with?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** We are in the midst of a very messy and unpredictable transition. We are in a state of flux, and it will take time before we find a new equilibrium. I think the new order will be shaped eventually by not just a single superpower but by all countries, large and small, by the actions and choices of all countries, big and small. And this will take time. In the meantime, we are in this period of transition, very unpredictable, very chaotic, and potentially very dangerous as well. Because during this period, without clear global leadership and coordination, there are many things that can go wrong in this world. So I think what's important for all of us, countries everywhere, is to recognize the dangers that we are in, for all of us to do our part to manage geopolitical tensions and rivalry carefully in order to minimize the risk of conflict and war, for us to find ways to get countries to still work together and find win-win cooperation, especially in areas of shared interest. And then step by step, we can all work together to lay the groundwork for a new and more stable global order that may emerge in the years ahead. It will take time, but we should all do our part to shape this new global order.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** But in this time of transition, imposing heavy tariffs on so many different countries around the world might not be the proper solution, right?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** We don't believe it is. The administration reflects a growing sentiment amongst the American people that they are paying too high a price to be the world's policeman, to underwrite the global system, and they have not benefited. In fact, we believe America has benefited. It has benefited if America were to take an enlightened self-interest, not just a very narrow perspective of its interest, but a wider view of its interest. This system has benefited America too.\r\n\r\n### 4G Leadership and Personal Reflections\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Back here in Singapore, you are referred to as the leader of 4G, the fourth generation of political leadership. So what core values do you believe define the governing style of 4G leaders?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** The leadership we have now will continue to uphold the core values of the People's Action Party. These values will never change: the values of incorruptibility, meritocracy, multi-racialism\u2014because we are a diverse society\u2014and self-reliance. So these core values will continue to be values that my team and I will uphold in governing Singapore. But at the same time, our leadership approach will be different. Every leader has to be himself; you cannot pretend to be someone else. My approach is to be open, to listen to different views and suggestions, even if they are views which are different from mine. I would like to listen to them. I would like to engage widely and involve as many people as possible. But at the end of the day, the government must decide, must come to a decision.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** What kind of narrative do 4G leaders aspire to create, especially in light of the remark you made that \"the best chapters of Singapore's story are yet to be written\"?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** We hope we can continue to keep Singapore special, exceptional, a shining red dot. A shining little red dot that will continue to add value to the world and ensure that everyone in Singapore can continue to achieve better lives.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** What do you mean by a \"shining red dot\"? It is small but is very evident and it's shining, or what?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** It's a little red dot because that's the, I suppose, slogan that we have for ourselves. Yes, because we are a small country. But shining... history has never been kind to small countries. You look at the long arc of history, small countries find it very hard to survive. Singapore has defied the odds for 60 years. This is 60 years of independence this year. We will try to continue defying the odds of history and keep Singapore special.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** A very unique experience in your career is serving as the Principal Private Secretary to the then Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong from 2005 to 2008. So what are some of the major lessons or the biggest source of inspiration that you gained from working very closely with Senior Minister Lee?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** I was always struck by how devoted he was to Singapore, to the country, and how obsessed he was every single day, thinking about how to keep Singapore going. Because as I said just now, we feel the vulnerabilities more as a small country. Big countries, you may feel, you know, there are resources, you've got wealth, you've got many things you can rely on. But as a small country, we always feel we are vulnerable. We take nothing for granted. And I was always struck by how obsessed he was. So now that the leadership baton has been passed to me, this has become my obsession. And I'll do everything in my power, together with my teammates, to keep Singapore moving forward.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Mr. Prime Minister, when you first emerged as the new leader of the nation, I don't know whether you have noticed that if you take a closer look at the headlines at that time about media coverage of you, there is sometimes a phrase that is frequently used. Do you know what it is?\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** I have no idea. There are many phrases.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Sometimes it's \"guitar-playing prime minister\" or \"guitar-wielding prime minister.\" We heard it's actually a guitar from your father, a gift when you were a child, that sparked your passion for music and playing guitar.\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** Well, I started playing at a very young age, maybe eight years old or something like that. But I never had formal lessons; I was self-taught.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Yes. So I don't claim to play very well at all.\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** That's very modest because we saw some of the videos.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** I enjoy doing it. I find that music helps to break barriers, it helps to bring people together, and so I enjoy doing it. But for me personally, I just find it's a good way to unwind, to de-stress. Especially doing a job like this, you do need outlets to relax from time to time.\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** Is there a go-to Chinese song that you really enjoyed playing with your guitar? We're just wondering.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** I have played a number of Chinese songs. For example, \"\u6708\u4eae\u4ee3\u8868\u6211\u7684\u5fc3\" (The Moon Represents My Heart) is one song that I would play in my constituency.\r\n\r\n**Prime Minister Lawrence Wong:** Mr. Prime Minister, thank you so much for sharing with us your time and also your insightful views. It's greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Zou Yun:** Thank you very much."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9539c0937ac0f890-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d6116aab-400e-4288-a37c-d3323afae00b","children":["efdd874b-e267-4dea-9692-c95aca354f5d"]},"efdd874b-e267-4dea-9692-c95aca354f5d":{"id":"efdd874b-e267-4dea-9692-c95aca354f5d","message":{"id":"efdd874b-e267-4dea-9692-c95aca354f5d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750574418.124867,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"22395b2a-2d15-4324-94c2-6fca8efba598","request_id":"9539c0937ac0f890-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"22395b2a-2d15-4324-94c2-6fca8efba598","children":["9c55cd72-f3c6-4776-b67d-7a91c2f3f3c4"]},"9c55cd72-f3c6-4776-b67d-7a91c2f3f3c4":{"id":"9c55cd72-f3c6-4776-b67d-7a91c2f3f3c4","message":{"id":"9c55cd72-f3c6-4776-b67d-7a91c2f3f3c4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750574418.124985,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing bilateral ties","content":"I understand that the user wants a structured analysis based on the interview with Singapore's PM about enhancing ties with China.

Announced by China's commerce ministry on Wednesday, the agreement also seeks to enhance supply chain connectivity and deepen integration of production and supply chains. ASEAN, composed of 10 Southeast Asian nations, is currently China's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling $234 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Negotiations began in November 2022, and the upgraded deal intends to boost regional and global trade stability, fostering openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit. This initiative comes as China increases ties with ASEAN amidst ongoing global trade tensions following U.S. tariffs imposed under the Trump administration. President Xi Jinping recently toured Southeast Asia, urging regional unity against protectionism and unilateral policies. The new agreement is expected to be formally signed before the end of 2025; the original ASEAN-China Free Trade Area was established in 2002 and enacted in 2010.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747811723.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.pmo.gov.sg","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Wong-to-Visit-the-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Jun-2025","title":"PM Wong to Visit the People's Republic of China (Jun 2025)","snippet":"Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong will make an official visit to China (Beijing and Tianjin) from 22 to 26 June 2025, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750567148.86774,"attribution":"www.pmo.gov.sg"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/20th-Joint-Council-for-Bilateral-Cooperation-in-Singapore","title":"20th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation and Related Joint ... - PMO","snippet":"Singapore and China will continue to leverage on the Demonstration Zone to jointly unlock new growth opportunities in a green economy. 8th CCI ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1731283200.0,"attribution":"www.pmo.gov.sg"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.channelnewsasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-china-relations-lawrence-wong-visit-li-qiang-xi-jinping-zhao-leji-5195996","title":"Lawrence Wong to make first visit to China as prime minister, meet with Li Qiang and Xi Jinping in Beijing","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750563549.046565,"attribution":"www.channelnewsasia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"fta.mofcom.gov.cn","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://fta.mofcom.gov.cn/topic/china_asean_upgrade.shtml","title":"China-ASEAN FTA (including upgrade)","snippet":"2024/02/01The fifth round of negotiations on version 3.0 of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area has launched; 2023/06/26China International Trade Representative ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"fta.mofcom.gov.cn"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.straitstimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-heads-to-china-for-first-official-visit-as-pm","title":"Lawrence Wong heads to China for first official visit as PM","snippet":"The visit comes as Singapore and China mark the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

Anchoring deals in ASEAN frameworks (e.g., CAFTA 3.0) gives Singapore political cover and a bigger market to offer China. |\n| **Acknowledgement that the \u201cfree-trade era\u201d is over** | Expect Singapore to hedge by embedding China links inside many overlapping trade, digital-trade and sustainability agreements\u2014so if one corridor closes, others remain open. |\n\n### 2  Likely Avenues for Deepening Ties  \n\n| Avenue | Concrete Mechanisms Already Visible | Near-Term (-2027) Next Steps |\n|---|---|---|\n| **1.

Supply-chain connectivity** | Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (rail-sea) has shortened Chengdu\u2013Singapore freight to <10 days. | Add electronic certificate-of-origin and smart-container tracking; integrate with CAFTA 3.0 supply-chain chapter. |\n| **5.

Even a modest elasticity (0.4) on the current S$170 bn merchandise base implies **S$10-15 bn extra annual trade** for Singapore by 2030. Track: CAFTA utilisation rates; Tuas port TEUs bound for China. |\n| **H2 \u2013 Surge in Chinese capital routed via Singapore** | Upgraded CSFTA grants easier market access for Singaporean financial products; Singapore\u2019s rule-of-law brand provides a regulatory \u201cmiddle ground\u201d for Chinese firms raising USD or RMB outside the mainland. Expect **double-digit growth in RMB settlements and green-bond listings on SGX**. Track: MAS RMB clearing volume, SGX bond issuance data. |\n| **H3 \u2013 Green-tech & digital-services clusters add 20 000\u201330 000 skilled jobs** | Joint projects (Eco-City 2.0, hydrogen pilots, med-tech parks) require engineers, data scientists and compliance specialists. Monitor: EDB investments in cleantech, digital-trade start-up employment. |\n| **H4 \u2013 Greater concentration risk to China economic cycle** | If China\u2019s structural slowdown persists (<4 % GDP growth), sectors tightly coupled to Chinese demand (petrochemicals, tourism retail) face earnings volatility. Singapore\u2019s diversification into EU/India may blunt but not remove this exposure. Watch: share of China in non-oil domestic exports (NODX). |\n| **H5 \u2013 Geopolitical balancing costs rise** | Deep entanglement increases the probability of US export-control or secondary-sanction pressure on firms operating in dual-use tech (AI chips, quantum). Compliance overheads and the need for \u201ctwo-track\u201d supply chains could erode some efficiency gains. Indicators: number of Singapore companies seeking US export-licence waivers; MAS guidance on sanctions. |\n| **H6 \u2013 Domestic social pressures from talent inflows** | More Chinese professionals may tighten housing and schooling bottlenecks, reigniting public concern over immigration. The government\u2019s tighter Employment Pass framework (COMPASS) will be a critical valve. Track: EP approvals by nationality; private-home rental index. |\n\n### 4  Risk-Adjusted Outlook & Mitigation  \n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy Already Signalled |\n|---|---|---|\n| US-China tariff/technology escalations spill over (e.g., ICT blacklist) | **Medium\u2013high** | Singapore embeds China deals in multilateral or ASEAN settings, giving them political legitimacy; promotes digital-standards interoperability to avoid tech bifurcation. |\n| China growth undershoots >2 ppt for several years | **Medium** | Expand ties with India, GCC and Africa concurrently; accelerate services exports (finance, logistics, education) less dependent on China\u2019s domestic demand. |\n| Domestic backlash to rapid foreign-talent inflow | **Medium** | PM Wong\u2019s \u201clistening leadership\u201d + progressive wage moves; COMPASS and tighter S-Pass quotas to pace inflows. |\n| Green-tech hype fails to commercialise | **Low\u2013medium** | Pilot projects are structured as modular \u201csandbox\u201d trials (Eco-City upgrades, hydrogen bunkering) to cap sunk costs if technologies stall. |\n\n### 5  Strategic Take-aways  \n\n1. **Incremental but relentless** \u2013 Singapore\u2019s model is evolutionary: take an existing platform, upgrade, replicate. Expect *many* small, high-quality announcements rather than one flagship megaproject.  \n2. **Hub-and-spoke resilience** \u2013 By embedding Chinese links inside broader ASEAN, RCEP and digital frameworks, Singapore keeps optionality if great-power rivalry worsens.  \n3. **Shift from goods to intangibles** \u2013 The next growth engine is data, algorithms, and green intellectual property, not container-ship tonnage. Singapore\u2019s comparative advantage is in *rules, trust and finance* rather than scale.  \n4. **Domestic governance matters** \u2013 Success hinges on managing social sentiment and maintaining a neutral foreign-policy brand. Without this, economic gains could erode political capital.  \n\n**Bottom line:**  If present trends continue, deeper Sino-Singapore economic integration will likely lift trade and green-digital investment, cement Singapore\u2019s status as *ASEAN\u2019s node for China\u2019s outward strategy*, and create high-skill jobs.  The main strategic challenge will be balancing this growth against geopolitical volatility and domestic capacity constraints\u2014an equation that PM Wong\u2019s administration appears keenly aware of and already engineering safeguards for."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":1520,"end_idx":1552,"safe_urls":["https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2024/11/Singapore-and-China-are-committed-to-ensuring-that-the-China-Singapore-Free-Trade-Agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/china-asean-complete-negotiations-free-trade-area-30-2025-05-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([mti.gov.sg](https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2024/11/Singapore-and-China-are-committed-to-ensuring-that-the-China-Singapore-Free-Trade-Agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/china-asean-complete-negotiations-free-trade-area-30-2025-05-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Singapore and China are committed to ensuring that the China ... - MTI","url":"https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2024/11/Singapore-and-China-are-committed-to-ensuring-that-the-China-Singapore-Free-Trade-Agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1731283200.0,"snippet":"Singapore and China are committed to ensuring that the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) Further Upgrade Protocol would enter into force on 31 ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"mti.gov.sg"},{"title":"China, ASEAN complete negotiations on upgraded free trade deal","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/china-asean-complete-negotiations-free-trade-area-30-2025-05-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1747811723.0,"snippet":"China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have concluded negotiations on the upgraded 3.0 version of their Free Trade Area, aiming to include new sectors such as the digital and green economies.

Negotiations began in November 2022, and the upgraded deal intends to boost regional and global trade stability, fostering openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit.

President Xi Jinping recently toured Southeast Asia, urging regional unity against protectionism and unilateral policies.

The trip is calibrated to:\n\n* **Lock-in technical architecture** (green-finance, data, shipping corridors) that converts the upgraded partnership rhetoric into usable rules and platforms;  \n* **Showcase Singapore\u2019s convening power** at Summer Davos as a voice for middle powers defending open trade;  \n* **Send markets a confidence signal on China\u2019s economic trajectory** while giving Singaporean corporates preferential on-ramps into China\u2019s green and digital sectors.\n\nIf even half the anticipated MOUs reach implementation stage, Singapore secures new growth engines in finance, logistics and digital services\u2014at the cost of deeper sensitivity to U.S.\u2013China rivalry and the need for deft domestic management of talent inflows and strategic neutrality."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn20view0\ue201","start_idx":1039,"end_idx":1068,"safe_urls":["https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202506/t20250620_11654061.html","https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Wong-to-Visit-the-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Jun-2025"],"refs":[],"alt":"([pmo.gov.sg](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Wong-to-Visit-the-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Jun-2025),
