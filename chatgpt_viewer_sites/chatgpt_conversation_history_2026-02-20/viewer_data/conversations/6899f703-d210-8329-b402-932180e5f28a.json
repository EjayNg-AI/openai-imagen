Here\u2019s a focused shortlist with distinguishing \u201cmemory triggers,\u201d roughly in the order I\u2019d bet on.\n\n**1) James & Liebeck, _Representations and Characters of Groups_ (CUP, 1993; 2nd ed. 2001).**  \nVery likely. It\u2019s deliberately undergraduate-friendly and finite-group centric. Chapters are short, self-contained, and commonly taught one per week. It builds character tables for \\(S_3,S_4,A_4,A_5\\), dihedral groups, etc., and culminates in applications like Burnside\u2019s \\(p^aq^b\\) theorem. Exercises are present but not overwhelming. If your copy was a Cambridge blue paperback and you recall lots of worked symmetric-group examples, this is probably it.\n\n**2) Alperin & Bell, _Groups and Representations_ (Springer GTM 162, 1995).**  \nAlso a strong candidate. Springer \u201cyellow\u201d cover. Compact chapters mixing basic group theory with representations, Maschke\u2013Schur\u2013Frobenius in a clean arc, then characters; many concise exercises. If you remember a brisk, theorem-lemma-corollary pace with GTM typography and short end-of-chapter problem sets, this could be the one.\n\n**3) Serre, _Linear Representations of Finite Groups_ (Springer GTM 42, 1977).**  \nBeloved, elegant, and short. It\u2019s denser than (1) and (2) but still very readable. Exercises are selective. Chapters are indeed week-sized, but the style is a bit more \u201cgraduate-leaning.\u201d If you remember algebraic-number-theory tinges (e.g., cyclotomic integers creeping in) and a very succinct presentation, consider Serre.\n\n**4) Isaacs, _Character Theory of Finite Groups_ (Academic Press 1976; later AMS reprint).**  \nA classic that focuses squarely on ordinary characters. Substantive but not sprawling; lots of clean exercises. More theorem-driven than (1), and (for many undergrads) a half-step more demanding. If you recall the notation \\(\\mathrm{Irr}(G)\\) featured heavily and a systematic, character-table-first approach, Isaacs is plausible.\n\n**5) Ledermann, _Introduction to Group Characters_ (2nd ed., 1987).**  \nFriendly prose, compact chapters, and an \u201colder-school\u201d British style. Many UK/Commonwealth courses used it pre-2000s. If you remember warm exposition, many short proofs, and a slim paperback feel, this could fit.\n\n**6) Burrow, _Representation Theory of Finite Groups_ (Dover reprint of 1965 text).**  \nShort, economical, and quite readable, with restrained exercises. Often used for a first pass. If your copy was a very inexpensive Dover paperback and the treatment felt classical, keep this on the list.\n\nA few popular but less likely options given your \u201cfinite-group focus\u201d remark:\n\n- **Fulton & Harris, _Representation Theory: A First Course_ (Springer GTM 129, 1991):** superb but leans to Lie groups/algebras and geometry; not primarily finite-group/character-theory.  \n- **Curtis & Reiner, _Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Associative Algebras_ (1962):** wonderful but too advanced/encyclopedic for a modular one-chapter-per-week undergrad course.\n\nIf you want to pin it down quickly, two discriminators usually work:\n\n1) **Cover memory:** Cambridge blue (James\u2013Liebeck) vs. Springer yellow (Alperin\u2013Bell or Serre).  \n2) **Endgame topics:** Did the course/book **prove Burnside\u2019s \\(p^aq^b\\) theorem** and compute character tables of \\(A_5\\) with explicit class fusions (James\u2013Liebeck is textbook here), or did it feel more general/abstract with number-theoretic flavors (Serre), or more theorem-catalogue with \\(\\mathrm{Irr}(G)\\) notation front and center (Isaacs)?\n\nIf any of these jogs a detail\u2014cover color, a memorable end-of-chapter exercise (e.g., building the \\(D_{2n}\\) table), or a specific \u201ccapstone\u201d theorem\u2014I can narrow to one or two with high confidence."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"96d842905e31c51a-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"03e8d633-fac0-45c4-a813-15a37fc40f3b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"03e8d633-fac0-45c4-a813-15a37fc40f3b","children":[]}}}
