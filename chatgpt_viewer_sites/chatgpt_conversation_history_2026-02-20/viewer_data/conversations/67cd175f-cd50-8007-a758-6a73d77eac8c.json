It began as a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), retaining a familiar interface and extension ecosystem\u301011\u2020L117-L125\u3011. However, Cursor augments the editing experience with AI features such as multi-line code completion, in-editor chat assistance, and even the ability to run code or shell commands via natural language. In essence, Cursor acts as an \u201cAI pair programmer\u201d inside your editor, aiming to reduce context-switching and accelerate coding tasks\u301013\u2020L442-L450\u3011.\n\n### Key Features and Capabilities\n\n- **AI Code Completion and Generation:** Cursor provides intelligent code autocompletion that can predict multiple lines of code based on context\u301011\u2020L128-L137\u3011. It can generate entire functions or code blocks by understanding your recent edits and the file\u2019s context, going beyond the single-line suggestions of traditional IDEs\u301011\u2020L130-L138\u3011. The *Tab* key accepts suggestions, similar to Copilot/Tabnine, but Cursor\u2019s completions can span many lines or even modify existing code in place\u301026\u2020L254-L263\u3011. It also supports \u201csmart rewrites\u201d \u2013 if you write sloppy or partial code, it can auto-correct and improve it\u30101\u2020L36-L44\u3011\u301011\u2020L134-L142\u3011.\n\n- **In-Editor Chat Assistant:** A side-panel *Chat* interface allows natural language queries and commands with awareness of your codebase\u30101\u2020L47-L55\u3011\u301013\u2020L442-L450\u3011. You can ask questions about your code (e.g. \u201cIs there a bug in this function?\u201d), request explanations, or instruct the AI to refactor code. The chat has access to the open file and even the whole project if enabled, so it can answer with specific references. For example, using an **@** mention, you can include a file or symbol in your prompt to give the AI more context\u30101\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301011\u2020L145-L153\u3011. Cursor\u2019s chat can incorporate images (e.g. diagrams or screenshots of output) as additional context, and it even has an \u201cAsk the Web\u201d feature to pull in information from the internet when needed\u30101\u2020L81-L90\u3011. Crucially, any code suggestions from chat can be applied back into your editor with one click (\u201cInstant Apply\u201d)\u30101\u2020L60-L69\u3011, making it easy to accept fixes or improvements suggested by the AI.\n\n- **Codebase Understanding:** Cursor indexes your entire project to provide codebase-wide assistance. It uses embeddings and vector search on your code, allowing it to answer questions about the codebase and find relevant references when you prompt it\u30106\u2020L482-L490\u3011\u301034\u2020L89-L97\u3011. You can ask something like \u201cWhere is the function that handles user login?\u201d and it will search and provide an answer with file references (similar to an IDE search, but in natural language). The `@codebase` command (or pressing Ctrl+Enter in chat) triggers this global search\u30101\u2020L67-L75\u3011. This capability means the AI can utilize context beyond the open file, which is helpful for large projects (though there are limits, as discussed later).\n\n- **Multiple File Edits and Agents:** One standout feature is Cursor\u2019s **Agent mode** and multi-file edit **Composer**. In Agent mode, Cursor can take a high-level task (like *\u201cAdd a new API endpoint for user profile\u201d*) and attempt to execute it end-to-end\u30102\u2020L100-L108\u3011. It will generate code across multiple files, run commands (with confirmation) to test or format code, and loop on errors if something fails\u30102\u2020L118-L127\u3011. Essentially, the agent plans a sequence of steps and carries them out, keeping the developer in the loop for approvals. This can automate repetitive coding workflows (writing code, running it, fixing errors) in a single go. For example, one developer reported using Agent mode to implement several feature \u201ctickets\u201d with unit tests in minutes \u2013 the agent wrote code, ran tests, fixed the bugs it encountered, and delivered working code with minimal intervention\u301036\u2020L210-L218\u3011\u301036\u2020L249-L257\u3011. Similarly, the Composer allows you to apply an instruction across multiple files: you tag the files and give a prompt (like \u201cAdd a logging statement at the end of each function in these files\u201d), and Cursor will propose changes for each file which you can accept or reject\u301046\u2020L151-L160\u3011\u301046\u2020L155-L164\u3011. **(See image below for an example of multi-file AI edits.)**\n\n\u301049\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Cursor\u2019s Composer can handle multi-file edits by taking an instruction and suggesting changes in multiple files at once (in this example, adding a new code snippet to several JavaScript files). The developer can review each change via diff and accept or reject them\u301046\u2020L151-L159\u3011\u301046\u2020L155-L164\u3011.*\n\n- **Integrated Terminal Commands:** In addition to writing code, Cursor can interpret natural language in the integrated terminal. Pressing <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> in the Terminal pane lets you describe a shell command in English, and Cursor will translate it into the actual command\u30102\u2020L118-L127\u3011\u301046\u2020L141-L149\u3011. For instance, you could type \u201ccreate a new React app in the current directory\u201d and it will suggest the appropriate `npx create-react-app .` command (with a prompt for confirmation before execution). This lowers the need to recall exact CLI syntax. It\u2019s a unique workflow automation feature not found in most other code assistants.\n\n- **Additional Utilities:** Cursor supports adding external documentation into its context. You can attach popular library docs or your own markdown files, so that the AI can use them to answer questions (via `@Docs`)\u30101\u2020L89-L97\u3011. It also has a *\u201cQuick Questions\u201d* feature: you can highlight code and quickly ask a question about it (like \u201cWhat does this function do?\u201d) without switching fully into chat mode\u301026\u2020L241-L249\u3011\u301026\u2020L253-L260\u3011. Moreover, Cursor\u2019s autocompletion can even continue natural language comments \u2013 e.g., type a comment like \u201c// TODO: handle edge cases\u201d and it might generate the code for that. In summary, Cursor bundles a variety of AI-driven features to assist in writing, navigating, and fixing code, all within one editor window.\n\n### Strengths and Advantages\n\nCursor\u2019s tightly integrated approach offers several **strengths** over using standalone AI tools or basic editor plugins:\n\n- **Deep Workflow Integration:** Because Cursor is a full code editor, its AI features are contextually aware of *everything* you\u2019re doing. The chat assistant always knows which file you\u2019re in and even which code you have selected, and the autocompleter is continually active. This deep integration means you can, for example, highlight a function and ask \u201cRefactor this to use async/await\u201d and see the diff directly in the editor\u301026\u2020L225-L234\u3011\u301026\u2020L233-L240\u3011. There\u2019s no need to copy-paste code into ChatGPT or switch to a browser \u2013 the AI is effectively built into your development workflow\u301013\u2020L442-L450\u3011. For developers who like a seamless environment, this is a major productivity boost over context-switching between an IDE and a separate chat window\u30109\u2020L93-L100\u3011\u301013\u2020L444-L452\u3011.\n\n- **Powerful Automation for Small-to-Medium Tasks:** Users report that Cursor \u201c*shines when it comes to small-scale projects and quick scripting tasks*,\u201d allowing rapid prototyping via natural language\u30106\u2020L462-L470\u3011. Routine coding chores \u2013 writing boilerplate, creating simple scripts, adding minor features \u2013 can be handled largely by instructing the AI. The **Agent mode** in particular can automate multi-step tasks (code \u2192 run \u2192 test \u2192 fix) that would normally require manual iteration. This can lead to big productivity gains. Anecdotally, one developer achieved a **5\u00d7 productivity improvement** on a feature by using Agent mode: *\u201cWe come up with a plan. It does the steps, runs the tests, fixes the errors... the model is doing 3 point-ish tickets in like 5 minutes.\u201d*\u301036\u2020L210-L218\u3011. Another user mentions setting Cursor to generate unit tests and coming back from a coffee break to find the tests ready\u301036\u2020L247-L255\u3011. While these are informal reports, they highlight how effective automation can free developers from grunt work.\n\n- **Multi-Modal and Flexible Context:** Cursor allows various forms of input (code, text, images, web search, docs) in your prompts, which can lead to more accurate and rich assistance. For example, including an error screenshot or a UML diagram could help the AI understand your problem better. Moreover, the ability to pull in documentation or do a web query on the fly means the assistant\u2019s knowledge isn\u2019t limited to its training data \u2013 it can fetch up-to-date info as needed\u30101\u2020L88-L96\u3011. This is an advantage in scenarios like using a new library or API: instead of manually checking docs, you can query Cursor with `@LibraryName` and get an answer that cites the official docs (function signatures, usage examples, etc.)\u30101\u2020L95-L103\u3011. This on-demand learning is valuable in data science and ML, where you often refer to library docs (Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.) during development.\n\n- **Customization and Control:** Unlike some assistants that are \u201cblack boxes,\u201d Cursor offers knobs for developers to tune. You can choose between models (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude 3.5, etc.) depending on the task or your subscription\u301013\u2020L474-L482\u3011\u301013\u2020L482-L485\u3011. Advanced users can even add custom models or API keys in settings\u301028\u2020L400-L408\u3011. There\u2019s a feature to set **\u201cAI Rules\u201d** \u2013 essentially guidelines that the AI will always follow\u301028\u2020L393-L400\u3011. For instance, you might add a rule *\u201cAlways include type hints in Python code\u201d*, and the AI will adhere to that in its suggestions\u301028\u2020L395-L403\u3011. This kind of configurable behavior is a strength for teams with specific coding standards. Additionally, because it\u2019s based on VSCode, you can install VSCode extensions in Cursor\u301028\u2020L367-L375\u3011 \u2013 meaning you don\u2019t lose ecosystem benefits and can enhance Cursor with tools like linters, Docker integration, etc. The VSCode foundation also means cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) out of the box\u301019\u2020L328-L336\u3011\u301019\u2020L330-L338\u3011.\n\n- **Pair-Programming and Teaching Aid:** Cursor can act as a tireless pair-programmer that explains code and catches mistakes. For exploratory work (like analyzing a dataset or trying out a new algorithm), you can ask Cursor\u2019s chat *\u201cwhat does this output mean?\u201d* or *\u201ccould we optimize this loop?\u201d* and get immediate feedback. It can help **document code** by generating docstrings or comments explaining a snippet\u2019s functionality. Many developers find that even if they don\u2019t directly use the AI\u2019s code suggestions, asking it to explain or review code improves their understanding and confidence. This is especially useful for less experienced programmers or in educational settings, where Cursor can answer \u201cdumb\u201d questions without judgment. In summary, it\u2019s a supportive presence that can accelerate learning and troubleshooting (akin to having an expert on call).\n\n### Weaknesses and Limitations\n\nDespite its rich capabilities, Cursor AI also has **weaknesses** and scenarios where it falls short, especially when compared to other tools or traditional development practices:\n\n- **Struggles with Large, Complex Codebases:** One of the known limitations is that Cursor\u2019s performance degrades on very large, multi-file projects. Users have noted that in a complex codebase (hundreds of thousands of lines, many interconnected modules), Cursor\u2019s code generation can become incoherent or fail to fully understand the architecture\u30106\u2020L472-L480\u3011\u30106\u2020L474-L481\u3011. For example, attempting to use the Composer or Agent to modify a large enterprise backend spanning API, services, and database layers may result in incomplete or incorrect changes\u30106\u2020L474-L482\u3011. This is partly because Cursor relies on embedding-based retrieval for context\u30106\u2020L482-L490\u3011 \u2013 it grabs semantically relevant pieces of code, but might miss some logical connections or global constraints in a sprawling project. The developers of Cursor themselves acknowledge this and are exploring deeper static analysis or language-server integration to handle complex code better\u30106\u2020L492-L500\u3011. In practice, this means that **experienced engineers working on large-scale systems might find Cursor less helpful**, often needing to fall back to manual coding or simpler autocomplete. Competing tools integrated with IDEs (like JetBrains IDE\u2019s own analyzers or enhanced Copilot in Visual Studio) could have an edge here in understanding project structure.\n\n- **Learning Curve and UI Adjustments:** Because Cursor is essentially a new IDE to adopt, there is a ramp-up cost. Developers already comfortable with their environment (be it vanilla VSCode, PyCharm, etc.) might find switching fully to Cursor disruptive at first\u301017\u2020L89-L97\u3011\u301017\u2020L93-L101\u3011. Some Reddit users noted that *\u201cthey tweaked the VSCode interface in ways I hate\u201d*\u301030\u2020L266-L273\u3011 \u2013 small differences can be frustrating until you adjust. The plethora of AI features also means new shortcuts and mental models to learn (when to use inline `Ctrl+K` vs the chat panel `Ctrl+L`, for instance). Beginners might be overwhelmed by the options and the need to configure models or review diffs, whereas simpler tools like GitHub Copilot just plug into your existing editor with minimal setup\u301013\u2020L427-L436\u3011. Thus, while Cursor **offers more control**, it also **demands more involvement** from the user. It\u2019s been described as \u201chighly customizable, but complex for beginners,\u201d versus a tool like Copilot which is \u201cminimalist and easy to use\u201d out-of-the-box\u301017\u2020L93-L101\u3011.\n\n- **Context Limitations and LLM Quirks:** Cursor\u2019s assistance is only as good as the underlying LLM and the provided context. It has a finite context window \u2013 if you ask a question that involves parts of the code it didn\u2019t index or that exceed the model\u2019s window, it may give incorrect or partial answers. Users observed occasional *\u201ccontext forgetfulness after breaks\u201d*, where the AI loses track of previous discussion unless re-prompted\u301041\u2020L75-L83\u3011. Also, like any generative model, Cursor can sometimes produce **plausible but wrong code**. For instance, it might misinterpret a function\u2019s intent and insert a bug while \u201cfixing\u201d something, or make up an API call that doesn\u2019t exist. One source notes it *\u201cmay struggle with complex bug detection\u201d* and sometimes *\u201cmisplaces generated code\u201d* in the wrong section\u301041\u2020L75-L83\u3011. These errors mean the developer must remain vigilant and not blindly trust the AI \u2013 you still need to review and test AI-written code thoroughly.\n\n- **Over-Reliance and Code Quality Issues:** A more subtle pitfall is the risk of over-relying on Cursor to drive development. The Lynchpin case study of using Cursor on a real project highlighted that *\u201crelying too much on automated suggestions can distance yourself from the underlying code, making it harder to debug complex issues independently.\u201d*\u301050\u2020L161-L169\u3011 If the AI writes a lot of your code, you might not fully grok the system, which can hurt in the long run. Additionally, AI-generated code might not follow best design practices. The Lynchpin team noticed Cursor tended to produce **monolithic scripts** rather than well-factored components (e.g. lumping all logic together, instead of separating concerns into functions/modules)\u301050\u2020L169-L177\u3011. Performance optimizations or edge-case handling might be lacking in the AI\u2019s output, since the model optimizes for producing functionally correct code that matches the prompt, not necessarily the most efficient code. Therefore, developers often need to refactor or clean up AI-generated code. The case study recommended carefully reviewing diffs (which Cursor\u2019s interface fortunately makes easy) and validating everything, rather than accepting large changes wholesale\u301050\u2020L161-L170\u3011\u301050\u2020L175-L183\u3011. In summary, **Cursor can boost productivity, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for software engineering judgment** \u2013 you must supervise the AI\u2019s work to ensure quality and maintainability.\n\n- **Privacy and Compliance Concerns:** By default, using Cursor involves sending your code (in prompts or as embeddings) to their cloud service and to third-party LLM providers (OpenAI or Anthropic)\u30106\u2020L484-L492\u3011. This could be a red flag if you work on proprietary or sensitive code and are subject to strict data policies. While Cursor does offer a \u201cPrivacy Mode\u201d in its business tier (ensuring code is not stored and certain processing is local)\u301034\u2020L102-L110\u3011\u301034\u2020L117-L125\u3011, the free version may not guarantee that level of isolation. In contrast, some competitors like Tabnine can run fully on-prem or allow private deployments for enterprises\u301034\u2020L108-L116\u3011\u301034\u2020L123-L128\u3011. If company policy forbids cloud-based IDE assistants, Cursor might not be usable in those environments unless an on-prem model integration is configured. Always review the tool\u2019s privacy documentation before using it on sensitive projects.\n\n- **Cost for Advanced Features:** Cursor AI\u2019s base version is free, which is commendable, but it limits the number of AI completions per month (e.g. the free **Hobby** tier allows ~2,000 completions)\u301034\u2020L117-L125\u3011. Heavy users or larger tasks require a subscription (the **Pro** plan is around \\$20/month for unlimited use with faster/better models\u301034\u2020L117-L125\u3011, and a higher **Business** tier for team features). This cost is *literally double* the price of GitHub Copilot (Copilot is \\$10/month) for individual developers, which has caused some debate on value\u30107\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301041\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301041\u2020L85-L93\u3011. If your workflow doesn\u2019t leverage all of Cursor\u2019s bells and whistles, you might find a cheaper tool sufficient. However, the free tier is a good way to try it out, and it\u2019s generous enough for occasional usage or smaller projects. Keep in mind, if you want GPT-4 level quality in Cursor, you likely need the Pro plan (as GPT-4 access is a premium due to its higher cost)\u301013\u2020L474-L482\u3011.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll look at how Cursor plays with other AI coding assistants and where it fits into a developer\u2019s toolkit alongside alternatives like GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and ChatGPT.\n\n# Integration with Other AI Tools and Workflows\n\n### Compatibility and Ecosystem Integration\n\nCursor is built on a VSCode foundation, which gives it a degree of compatibility with the broader development ecosystem. **VS Code Extensions:** You can install extensions in Cursor just as you would in VSCode\u301028\u2020L367-L375\u3011, which means other AI assistants (like the GitHub Copilot extension or Tabnine extension) **could** be used within Cursor. In fact, during installation, Cursor allows you to choose an AI engine \u2013 users have reported a setup prompt asking whether to use Cursor\u2019s own (Claude-based) model or GitHub Copilot for completions\u30108\u2020L12-L20\u3011\u30108\u2020L53-L61\u3011. This suggests that Cursor is flexible: it can function as an interface that leverages Copilot under the hood if configured. Some developers run both \u2013 for example, having Cursor\u2019s chat and commands available, but also enabling Copilot suggestions in-line. This isn\u2019t an *intended* default use-case (and you\u2019d likely not want two AI autocompleters competing), but it\u2019s technically possible without conflicts, as one user noted: *\u201cI use Copilot with Cursor, and there are no conflicts unless you enable autocomplete on both at the same time.\u201d*\u30108\u2020L43-L51\u3011. This shows that Cursor doesn\u2019t lock you into its own AI exclusively; it tries to play nicely with other tools.\n\nHowever, **integration** in the sense of *workflow synergy* usually means how Cursor can coordinate or complement other AI services. Cursor\u2019s design is somewhat all-in-one, so you wouldn\u2019t typically use it *alongside* VS Code (it *is* a VS Code-like IDE). Instead, you might compare or alternate between them. For instance, a team might use VS Code + Copilot, and some members experiment with using Cursor as their primary IDE. Because Cursor supports Git and standard file operations, it can fit into your project without changing anything externally \u2013 you can edit the same repository with Cursor or with another editor interchangeably.\n\nWhen it comes to **ChatGPT integration**, Cursor itself *integrates OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT API* to power its features\u301011\u2020L122-L129\u3011. So rather than using ChatGPT separately in a browser, Cursor gives you ChatGPT-like capabilities in-editor. If you still wanted to use the ChatGPT UI (for example, to discuss code in a more freeform way), you could copy code out of Cursor and into ChatGPT, but the whole point of Cursor is to eliminate that copy-paste cycle\u30109\u2020L93-L100\u3011\u301013\u2020L442-L450\u3011. Essentially, Cursor is *ChatGPT + VSCode in one*. It even includes web search within the chat, which is reminiscent of what Bing Chat or ChatGPT with plugins could do\u30101\u2020L88-L96\u3011. Therefore, you likely wouldn\u2019t \u201cintegrate ChatGPT\u201d with Cursor so much as choose one environment over the other for a given task.\n\n**Tabnine integration** is also possible via extension. Tabnine is an AI completion engine that plugs into many IDEs, and since Cursor can use VSCode extensions, one could install Tabnine in Cursor. But Tabnine and Cursor overlap in functionality (both do code completion and chat now), so using them together might be redundant. You\u2019d typically pick one as your primary assistant. The **architectural difference** is that Tabnine is an *IDE plugin*, whereas Cursor is a standalone *AI-native IDE*. A Medium comparison summed it up well: *\u201cCursor offers a more comprehensive solution as a full-featured code editor, whereas Tabnine specializes in flexible completions that integrate into existing IDEs.\u201d*\u301033\u2020L18-L26\u3011. If your workflow revolves around JetBrains IDEs or Neovim, Tabnine can plug into those (Cursor cannot, since it isn\u2019t an extension)\u301019\u2020L332-L340\u3011\u301019\u2020L335-L343\u3011. Conversely, if you are open to using Cursor\u2019s editor, it covers many of the same bases and adds features like terminal commands which Tabnine lacks\u301033\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301033\u2020L35-L42\u3011.\n\nIn terms of **workflow automation**, one interesting integration is with version control/CI pipelines. Cursor doesn\u2019t directly integrate with GitHub\u2019s CI like Copilot does (Copilot has emerging features for pull request reviews and CI suggestions via GitHub Actions)\u301019\u2020L338-L346\u3011\u301019\u2020L340-L347\u3011. Copilot, being a GitHub product, naturally ties into PR comments and can auto-suggest changes in that context. Cursor doesn\u2019t have a server-side GitHub integration; it works client-side in your editor. That said, you can still use Cursor to help write your CI scripts or GitHub Actions configurations by describing them in the editor. It just won\u2019t *proactively* show up in your PR interface to review code (unless you copy snippets into Cursor\u2019s chat).\n\nOne can imagine creative uses where Cursor\u2019s agent runs some automation: for example, you might prompt *\u201copen a pull request with all these changes\u201d*, and Cursor\u2019s agent could potentially run the `git` commands to commit and push (since it can run terminal commands with approval)\u30102\u2020L118-L127\u3011. This hints at integrating with your DevOps workflow. But these uses are not yet one-click features \u2013 they would require trust and careful prompting.\n\nIn summary, **Cursor can coexist with other AI tools** but usually as an alternative rather than a complement. It leverages the same model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) that others do, and through extensions or configuration it can even use those providers in place of its default. The synergy is mostly seen in how it automates tasks that might involve multiple tools. For example, without Cursor you might use Copilot for code and then go to your terminal to run tests and then ChatGPT for an error \u2013 Cursor tries to handle all those steps internally. This \u201cend-to-end\u201d assistance can be viewed as integrating the roles of Copilot (code completion), a search engine (for docs/web), and ChatGPT (for Q&A) into one workflow. If you already have a setup with, say, VSCode + Copilot + an AI-driven CLI tool, Cursor\u2019s value-add is consolidating those.\n\n### Workflow Automation and Synergy\n\nCursor\u2019s introduction of an *Agent mode* is part of a trend of using AI not just for single-step suggestions but for **automating entire workflows**. In practical terms, this means a developer can delegate a chunk of work to the AI and have it handle multiple steps that would normally be done manually in sequence. For example, consider a typical development workflow for adding a new feature:\n\n1. **Write code** for the feature (maybe editing multiple files).\n2. **Run tests** or the application to see if everything works.\n3. If something fails, **debug/fix** the code.\n4. **Refactor or document** once it\u2019s working.\n5. **Repeat** until done.\n\nWith Cursor, especially using the Agent in Composer, you can instruct it at a high level (\u201cImplement feature X with following requirements\u2026 and include tests\u201d) and it will attempt to do steps 1\u20134 in a loop. As one Reddit user described: *\u201cIt does the steps, runs the tests, fixes the errors and mistakes\u2026 I feed it back the original plan to make sure we did everything. It fixes what it missed.\u201d*\u301036\u2020L210-L218\u3011. This showcases a **closed-loop workflow** where Cursor plans and executes tasks like a junior developer under supervision. The developer\u2019s role becomes more of a reviewer and guide: you give the initial prompt and then oversee the diffs and test results, correcting the course if needed.\n\nSome concrete examples of automated workflows Cursor can streamline:\n\n- **Automated Refactoring:** You can ask Cursor to apply a refactor across the codebase, such as renaming a function or upgrading a library usage. Instead of manually finding all occurrences, you prompt the agent. It will find references (using its codebase index), change them, maybe run `npm run lint` or `mypy` to catch issues (since it can execute commands), and then show you a summary of changes. This is like a souped-up search-and-replace that also understands code syntax and can fix errors introduced. Competing IDEs may offer rename refactoring, but Cursor\u2019s approach can handle more semantic changes (e.g. \u201cmake all API calls use async\u201d which is not a simple rename).\n\n- **Scaffold and Boilerplate Generation:** In web development or ML projects, setting up boilerplate (like creating new components, writing template code) can be automated. With Cursor, you might say *\u201cCreate a new Flask endpoint for `/user/profile` that takes JWT authentication and returns user info from the database\u201d*. Cursor can generate the Flask route code, the database query, and even a test for it. Then it could run the app or tests. This drastically cuts down the tedious writing of repetitive code. One could argue Copilot can generate snippets too, but Cursor can coordinate multiple snippets and files together. A real-world example from a blog: the Cursor team\u2019s proprietary model **accelerated development of a data testing tool**, where it quickly scaffolded scripts for browser automation and helped iterate on them\u301050\u2020L125-L133\u3011. The team noted they could focus on core logic while Cursor handled *\u201cfinicky syntax errors\u201d* and provided the initial drafts of code\u301050\u2020L143-L151\u3011.\n\n- **Continuous Error Fixing:** The *\u201cLoops on Errors\u201d* feature\u30102\u2020L125-L133\u3011 means if the agent\u2019s execution hits a runtime error or failing test, it can automatically revise the code to address it, then try again. This is a primitive form of **self-debugging AI**. For instance, if it runs a Python script and hits a `NameError`, it will realize a variable was not defined, then modify the code to define it (or correct a typo) and rerun. This loop can save time during exploratory coding or when setting up analysis \u2013 instead of the human seeing an error and then prompting the AI again, the agent handles it. A use-case in data science might be: \u201cload this CSV and plot X vs Y.\u201d If the CSV path was wrong or a library not imported, the agent can catch that and fix the import or path then proceed to plotting. This is experimental, of course; it may get stuck or need guidance for complex errors. But it shows how Cursor moves towards *auto-completing tasks, not just code*.\n\n- **Documentation and Reporting:** Another workflow is generating documentation or reports from code. For example, you could have Cursor read through your codebase and generate a markdown summary of each module (using the chat Q&A across the codebase). Or in an ML project, after doing analysis, you might ask Cursor to produce a summary report of results. It could gather outputs and format them. While not as direct as coding tasks, these are ancillary workflows that benefit from an in-editor AI. In essence, Cursor can reduce the need to manually write descriptive text by generating it from context \u2013 useful for writing README files, docstrings, or even commit messages based on diffs (one could copy a git diff into Cursor chat and ask for a summarized commit message or changelog).\n\n- **Integration with DevOps:** Although Cursor doesn\u2019t natively integrate with CI/CD, one can script those using Cursor. There\u2019s anecdotal evidence of using Cursor to write deployment scripts and even to configure GitHub Actions. Cursor\u2019s advantage is you can have it *reason* about the configuration. For example: *\u201cSet up a GitHub Actions workflow for a Python project to run tests on push and build a Docker image on release\u201d*. Cursor can produce the YAML config, and thanks to `@web`, it might even pull snippets from documentation of GitHub Actions. This is faster than searching the web manually.\n\nOverall, Cursor\u2019s automation features aim to minimize the \u201cglue work\u201d between coding steps. Instead of you acting as the orchestrator (write code, run, fix, document, etc.), you describe the end goal and let the AI orchestrate with you overseeing. This concept is powerful, but it\u2019s worth noting it\u2019s still developing. There are other AI \u201cagent\u201d frameworks (like *Microsoft\u2019s AutoGen*, or open-source *smol-developer* scripts) that attempt similar multi-step coding, and Cursor is among the first to integrate it into an IDE.\n\nOne must use these with caution \u2013 fully automated coding can go awry. But when it works, it **accelerates the development workflow phenomenally**. The Lynchpin team concluded that using Cursor *\u201csped up our debugging process \u2014 a major challenge in previous projects\u201d* and *\u201callowed us to meet tight deadlines\u2026 lowering the barrier for innovation\u201d*\u301040\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301040\u2020L79-L84\u3011. Those are strong real-world endorsements of automation. Just ensure you have a safety net (tests, version control) when letting an AI make broad changes.\n\n# Effectiveness in EDA and ML Projects\n\nIn the context of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML) projects**, Cursor can serve as a powerful assistant, although its utility will depend on how it\u2019s applied. Data scientists often juggle writing code to manipulate data, debugging shape mismatches or errors, documenting findings, and optimizing model performance. Cursor\u2019s features align well with many of these tasks:\n\n### Accelerating Data Analysis\n\nFor EDA, a big part of the workflow is writing code to explore datasets \u2013 reading files, computing statistics, generating plots, etc. Cursor can speed up this process by generating chunks of analysis code on demand. For example, if you have a DataFrame `df` loaded, you could prompt Cursor: *\u201cCompute summary statistics for each numerical column of df and plot histograms.\u201d* The AI can write the pandas code to describe the DataFrame and produce matplotlib/seaborn plots. Since Cursor\u2019s chat can incorporate library documentation, it can even remind you of the right methods (like `df.describe()` or `sns.histplot`) without you having to recall them exactly. This is similar to how one might use ChatGPT, but with Cursor the code can be inserted directly into your script, and you can iteratively refine it. \n\nA Medium post by a data scientist (Shuyi Wang) described using Cursor on the classic **Titanic dataset** to assist with data processing and model training. She was able to ask Cursor to help with tasks like cleaning the data, engineering features, and writing a classification model pipeline, all from within the editor. Although we don\u2019t have the exact snippet here, it illustrates how an AI code assistant can guide a typical Kaggle-style EDA: you ask questions like *\u201cHow do I deal with missing ages in this dataset?\u201d* and Cursor can suggest an imputation strategy code. Or *\u201cPlot the survival rate by passenger class\u201d* and it writes a snippet using matplotlib or plotly.\n\nOne **strong advantage** in data analysis is Cursor\u2019s ability to explain complex code or outputs. If you have a tricky group-by operation or an advanced NumPy vectorization, you can highlight it and ask Cursor to explain. This is great for learning and for debugging logic. It\u2019s like having a tutor sitting with you as you explore data. Also, when dealing with ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), where error messages can be cryptic, you can paste the traceback into Cursor chat and ask for help. Since the AI can search the web (`@web`), it might even fetch relevant Stack Overflow threads and summarize solutions\u30101\u2020L88-L96\u3011. This can dramatically reduce the time spent in the \u201cGoogle the error\u201d phase of debugging.\n\nCursor also helps with **documentation** of analysis. You can use it to generate markdown cells or comments that summarize what the code does, which is useful in notebooks or reports. Although Cursor isn\u2019t a Jupyter Notebook itself, you can write a script and have it output markdown explanations. After an EDA, you might ask, *\u201cSummarize the key findings from this analysis\u201d* and if you have printed results, the AI could generate a concise summary.\n\n### Assisting in ML Model Development\n\nMachine learning projects involve a lot of boilerplate and careful coding \u2013 splitting data, training models, evaluating, tuning hyperparameters, etc. Cursor can lighten the load by generating template code for these steps. For instance:\n\n- **Model Training:** You can prompt, *\u201cTrain a Random Forest on the features X to predict y with 100 trees and output the accuracy.\u201d* Cursor will produce the scikit-learn code to do this (loading the model, fitting, predicting, scoring). If you forget a parameter name, it\u2019s not an issue \u2013 the AI fills it in. It\u2019s akin to having a teammate who knows the API typing alongside you. This is similar to Copilot\u2019s usefulness in ML, which users have lauded for writing repetitive code (like Keras model definitions, PyTorch training loops, etc.). In fact, one user in an ML forum noted Copilot (and by extension tools like Cursor) is *\u201creally good at repetitive data processing code\u201d*, saving time on mundane tasks\u301038\u2020L248-L256\u3011.\n\n- **Debugging Model Code:** ML code can break due to shape mismatches or misuse of tensor operations. Cursor\u2019s chat can be a *debugging companion*. You can paste an error like \u201cRuntimeError: size mismatch in matmul\u201d and the code snippet, and ask Cursor what\u2019s wrong. If the model can deduce the cause (say a dimension issue), it can explain and even suggest a fix (maybe transposing a matrix or changing a layer size). This kind of interactive debugging is similar to asking a colleague, but instantaneous. It won\u2019t always get it right, but it often can point you in the right direction.\n\n- **Optimization and Refactoring:** Once an ML pipeline is working, you might want to optimize it. Cursor can suggest vectorized operations to replace python loops in data preprocessing, or use more efficient libraries. For example, *\u201cThis loop is slow; can you optimize it?\u201d* could lead to a suggestion to use NumPy or Pandas operations that are faster. It can also refactor code for clarity \u2013 e.g. turning a script into modular functions, or adding comments to each step. A case study or user story (like Lynchpin\u2019s) noted that Cursor\u2019s suggestions helped maintain code consistency and even caught some bugs early\u301040\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301040\u2020L43-L50\u3011. In data science, having the AI point out a potential issue (like data leakage or an uninitialized variable) is valuable.\n\n- **Explaining ML Concepts:** Sometimes you might be implementing a new algorithm or using a complex function. You can ask Cursor general questions like *\u201cWhat does XGBoost\u2019s `learning_rate` parameter do?\u201d* or *\u201cExplain this block of code that implements backpropagation.\u201d* Because Cursor can draw on documentation (with `@Docs` if configured) or its trained knowledge, it can give you a quick answer. It\u2019s like having Stack Overflow and the official docs at your fingertips, summarized in context. This is helpful for EDA/ML work where understanding the method is as important as writing it.\n\n**Real-World Applications:** The Lynchpin blog offers a real-world example in a data-related project. They built an *automated data testing tool* (which included simulating user actions on websites and verifying analytics data) and used Cursor extensively\u301039\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301040\u2020L19-L27\u3011. They credit Cursor with accelerating development \u2013 the AI helped design and create scripts efficiently, speeding up debugging and iteration\u301050\u2020L125-L133\u3011. For instance, they used Cursor\u2019s suggestions to quickly put together browser automation scripts with Playwright and to generate code for checking network requests. The AI chat in Cursor provided *\u201cintelligent code suggestions, speeding up debugging and investigation\u201d* during this process\u301050\u2020L125-L133\u3011. This is very relevant to data work: it shows how an AI assistant can rapidly produce test code and help ensure correctness, which is analogous to producing analysis code and verifying results. The team also found that including docs/diagrams as context for Cursor (a feature of Cursor) was a *\u201cclear benefit\u201d* over using an earlier Copilot \u2013 it led the model to better solutions for their specific problem\u301050\u2020L149-L158\u3011.\n\nMoreover, they highlight that Cursor\u2019s **automated code completion identified bugs and proposed fixes** in their code, which saved them time in troubleshooting\u301050\u2020L154-L162\u3011. In data science code, which can be prone to subtle bugs (like using the wrong variable or forgetting to scale data), having the AI flag a potential bug is a big plus.\n\n### Debugging, Documentation, and Optimization\n\n**Debugging:** As mentioned, Cursor can be your first line of support when things break. For data analysis scripts, this could mean quickly resolving why a DataFrame operation failed, or why a model isn\u2019t converging. While it may not have a deep understanding of your data (it doesn\u2019t actually see data unless you print it and feed it in), it can reason about code logic. A particularly useful approach is to have Cursor *write tests* for your code. You can prompt, *\u201cWrite a unit test for the function that preprocesses the data.\u201d* It will generate a test (maybe using `pytest`) given what it infers the function should do. This might catch errors or at least formalize assumptions. One user on Cursor\u2019s subreddit mentioned doing exactly this: using the agent to generate tests for their codebase, which effectively gave them confidence and spotted issues, all automatically\u301036\u2020L247-L255\u3011.\n\n**Documentation:** Cursor is effective at generating docstrings, code comments, and even README content. After finishing an ML model, you could ask it to produce a documentation string for the training function explaining inputs, outputs, and process. It usually generates a nice formatted docstring (especially if you have a style it can infer from one example). If you point Cursor at a function with no comments and ask *\u201cDocument this function\u201d*, it will add comments or a docstring describing what it does. This is great for making analysis code shareable with colleagues. It can also convert code to markdown explanation. For example, you might have a Jupyter notebook with analysis \u2013 you could copy a portion into Cursor and say *\u201cDescribe in markdown what the above code does and the findings (assume the code ran).\u201d* It might produce a paragraph like a report, which you can refine. This moves the needle on one of the pain points in EDA: writing the narrative after doing the technical work.\n\n**Optimization:** While the AI might not automatically profile your code, you can explicitly ask *\u201cThis took 10 seconds to run on 100k rows; can it be faster?\u201d* Cursor might suggest more efficient algorithms or using libraries like NumPy, Numba, or Polars, depending on context. It can also attempt to parallelize tasks (though one should be careful with such suggestions). For ML, it might suggest using GPU operations if available, or inform you about vectorized ops in libraries. Essentially, you have an assistant who *knows a lot of tricks* from the collective programming knowledge it was trained on. It can surface those tricks on request. \n\n### Case Studies and User Experiences\n\n- The **Lynchpin case study** (Dec 2024) demonstrates a scenario of using Cursor in a project with both data processing and software engineering components\u301039\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Key takeaways from their experience:\n  - Cursor significantly **accelerated development** from idea to MVP\u301050\u2020L143-L151\u3011\u301040\u2020L73-L81\u3011.\n  - The ability to include rich context (like specific files or links) helped guide the AI better than previous tools (Copilot)\u301050\u2020L149-L158\u3011.\n  - The team benefited from Cursor\u2019s **bug-fixing suggestions** and completions that saved time, though they had to carefully review changes\u301050\u2020L154-L162\u3011\u301050\u2020L161-L169\u3011.\n  - They noticed some **limitations**: e.g., Cursor generating code that wasn\u2019t well modularized (monolithic scripts) which they had to refactor, and the need to remain in control rather than accepting everything blindly\u301050\u2020L169-L177\u3011\u301050\u2020L175-L183\u3011.\n  - Ultimately, they achieved their goal faster and noted **efficiencies unlocked**, meeting tight deadlines with Cursor\u2019s help\u301040\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301040\u2020L79-L84\u3011.\n\n- Another perspective from the Reddit community: Some data scientists tried Cursor and compared it with the VSCode+Copilot combo. One user felt that *\u201cVSCode Insiders with GitHub Copilot is better, and if I want ChatGPT I just use it... I can\u2019t tolerate bugginess in the editor\u201d*\u301030\u2020L264-L273\u3011. This suggests that if you already have a stable workflow with Copilot for code and ChatGPT for questions, Cursor\u2019s integrated approach must be stable and significantly beneficial to justify switching. At least as of late 2023, some reported issues like broken remote SSH in Cursor (important for data scientists working on remote servers)\u301030\u2020L268-L273\u3011. This underscores that for professional use (especially in research or production ML, where you might work on remote Linux servers), the platform maturity matters. Cursor is evolving, but one should ensure its features (like remote development support) meet their needs.\n\n- On the flip side, many ML researchers find AI coding assistants in general extremely helpful. A question on r/MLQuestions asked if Copilot or Cursor help deep learning researchers, and the answers were positive: *\u201cYes, Copilot is great... saves me a lot of time\u201d*, especially for boilerplate and trying out other languages or frameworks quickly\u301038\u2020L248-L256\u3011\u301038\u2020L267-L275\u3011. We can infer that Cursor would provide similar (if not greater) assistance since it can do what Copilot does and more. The barrier is just whether the researcher is willing to adopt the new editor.\n\nIn conclusion, **for EDA and ML projects** Cursor can be a strong catalyst: it speeds up coding and answers, helps with repetitive tasks, and even guides debugging and documentation. It effectively reduces the cognitive load of remembering APIs or syntax, letting you focus on the data science problem itself. You still must apply domain knowledge \u2013 e.g., the AI won\u2019t magically know which features to use in a model or which chart best reveals an insight unless you ask. But it *will* help you implement your ideas faster and catch mistakes along the way. Its effectiveness will be most pronounced when used by someone with enough knowledge to verify the AI (so errors don\u2019t slip by). In that sense, Cursor (like other AI assistants) acts as a force multiplier for an experienced user, and as a tutor for a novice (who should still be cautious). The real-world cases show that when used judiciously, it can indeed accelerate data-focused projects and improve overall workflow in ML engineering.\n\n# Comparison with Other AI-Driven Development Tools\n\nTo put Cursor AI\u2019s capabilities and performance in perspective, let\u2019s compare it with some leading AI coding assistants: **GitHub Copilot**, **Tabnine**, and also consider **ChatGPT or similar** tools. Each has its own approach to augmenting development:\n\n### Cursor AI vs GitHub Copilot\n\n\u301041\u2020L85-L93\u3011\u301013\u2020L415-L424\u3011\n\n**GitHub Copilot** (powered by OpenAI Codex models, and more recently GPT-4 for Copilot X) is currently the most widely used AI pair programmer integrated into editors. Copilot works as an extension for editors like VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, constantly suggesting code completions as you type. \n\n- **Feature Set:** Copilot\u2019s primary interface is inline code completion. It excels at suggesting the next line or block of code based on context, and it learns from the context of the open file and some surrounding files. It does not have a full chat interface inside the editor by default (though GitHub has introduced Copilot Chat as a separate tool in limited preview). Cursor, on the other hand, includes both **rich chat and completion** natively\u301013\u2020L415-L424\u3011\u301013\u2020L431-L439\u3011. Cursor can do everything Copilot does in terms of inline suggestions, and then adds things like codebase Q&A, multi-file edits, etc. In Copilot, if you want an explanation or to ask a question, you typically have to go to an external interface (like ChatGPT) or use the new Copilot Chat window (if available). With Cursor, you just hit Ctrl+L and ask within the editor.\n\n- **Integration and Ease of Use:** Copilot\u2019s strength is its **simplicity and seamless integration** into popular workflows. If you use VS Code, enabling Copilot is a one-click install, and you continue coding as usual but with suggestions. It\u2019s very low-friction and has a **minimalist UI**, largely just inline grey text that you accept with Tab\u301017\u2020L93-L101\u3011\u301017\u2020L99-L107\u3011. Cursor requires installing a separate application (the Cursor IDE) and possibly adjusting to new shortcuts. It\u2019s more **tailored for power users** who want a deeply integrated AI environment\u301013\u2020L415-L424\u3011\u301013\u2020L427-L435\u3011. In corporate settings, Copilot might be easier to roll out because developers don\u2019t have to leave their familiar IDE. Cursor might appeal to those willing to adopt a new tool for greater capabilities. \n\n- **Capability and Accuracy:** Both Cursor and Copilot use advanced models (Cursor uses OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 or Anthropic Claude, Copilot uses OpenAI Codex and is evolving). In practice, Copilot is very good at routine code completions and has been trained on a massive corpus of GitHub code, which sometimes makes it eerily accurate for common patterns. Cursor, leveraging GPT-4 or Claude, may produce more *holistic* answers (e.g., better explanations or more nuanced multi-step code) since those models are more powerful than Codex. That said, a direct \u201csuccess rate\u201d comparison is hard. Some users have claimed that *\u201cCursor\u2019s answers had a much lower success rate than Copilot\u2019s\u201d* for certain tasks\u301037\u2020L35-L38\u3011, while others prefer Cursor\u2019s outputs. This likely depends on the types of prompts: Copilot might do better for straightforward code prediction (since it\u2019s optimized for that), whereas Cursor\u2019s GPT-based approach might shine in conversational or complex queries. The DataCamp article suggests both provide real-time suggestions for many languages, but Copilot is very strong at \u201cpredicting subsequent lines\u201d given its training\u301013\u2020L421-L430\u3011.\n\n- **Editor/Platform Support:** Copilot works in **many environments** (VS Code, Vim/Neovim, JetBrains, even the cloud via GitHub Codespaces). Cursor is its own environment, essentially VSCode-like and available on the major OSs, but **not available inside other IDEs**\u301019\u2020L320-L328\u3011\u301019\u2020L335-L343\u3011. This means Copilot is more versatile if you have a diverse toolchain. For instance, if you sometimes code in Jupyter notebooks or in a web IDE, Copilot (or ChatGPT) can still assist (Copilot has a Labs feature for notebooks, and there are plugins to use it in Colab). Cursor currently doesn\u2019t integrate into those contexts; you\u2019d have to use it as your main editor or not at all. \n\n- **Multilingual and Framework Support:** Both tools support a wide range of programming languages. Copilot, because it\u2019s trained on public GitHub, has knowledge spanning mainstream to niche languages (including frameworks and even configuration file formats). Cursor, using general LLMs, is also **language-agnostic** \u2013 it will try to generate code for any file type by inferring from context and file extension\u301028\u2020L359-L367\u3011. A Greptile comparison noted that Copilot, *\u201ctrained on GitHub\u2019s vast codebase, provides suggestions even for less common languages\u201d*, whereas Cursor \u201csupports widely used languages\u2026and mostly caters to those\u201d\u301019\u2020L366-L374\u3011\u301019\u2020L356-L364\u3011. If you\u2019re doing something in a very esoteric language, Copilot might have an edge due to training data. But for Python, JavaScript, etc., both are strong. Cursor\u2019s ability to incorporate documentation might help when using new or specialized frameworks \u2013 for example, pulling docs for a specific ML library if you ask, something Copilot alone won\u2019t do.\n\n- **Customization:** Cursor is more customizable (choice of model, rules, etc.)\u301028\u2020L389-L398\u3011\u301028\u2020L400-L408\u3011; Copilot is more of a one-size service (you get what GitHub provides, mostly GPT-3.5 tier completion as of now). If you need that flexibility (say using an internal model or switching to Claude for certain tasks), Cursor is unique in offering it.\n\n- **Community and Maturity:** Copilot has a **large user base and community** (essentially piggybacking on VS Code\u2019s huge user base). It\u2019s well-supported and relatively stable, with continuous improvements from GitHub. Cursor is newer and has a smaller community (though it\u2019s growing, with a forum and active development). This means Copilot benefits from many examples, plugins (like Copilot Labs), and familiarity. Cursor, being new, might still have some quirks to iron out (as seen with issues like remote SSH earlier, though it likely improved since then). Over time, Cursor features might inspire other IDEs; indeed, we see competitors like Amazon\u2019s CodeWhisperer or open-source VSCode extensions trying to add chat or multi-file context, which narrows the gap.\n\n**Bottom line:** If you want **deep integration and are willing to use a dedicated AI IDE, Cursor offers more advanced features and control**\u301013\u2020L415-L424\u3011\u301013\u2020L431-L439\u3011. If you prefer a **lightweight, plug-and-play solution across your existing tools, Copilot is extremely convenient and effective**\u301013\u2020L427-L435\u3011\u301017\u2020L95-L102\u3011. Many developers might even use both: Cursor for certain tasks or personal projects, and Copilot at work due to ease of integration. The choice can depend on budget too (Copilot $10 vs Cursor $20 Pro)\u301041\u2020L85-L93\u3011, and on how much you value things like an Agent mode or integrated web search. \n\nHere\u2019s a brief comparison summary:\n\n| Aspect                   | **Cursor AI** (AI Code Editor)                         | **GitHub Copilot** (VSCode Extension)           |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **Integration**          | Standalone editor (VSCode-based); needs separate install\u301013\u2020L415-L424\u3011.

Ideal for power users or those who frequently need to query and refactor across a codebase. | Choose **Copilot** if you value convenience, broad IDE support, and a lightweight augmentation to your existing workflow\u301013\u2020L427-L436\u3011\u301019\u2020L348-L356\u3011. Great for quickly getting suggestions in whatever editor you already use, with minimal setup. |\n\n*(Sources: Cursor vs Copilot analysis\u301013\u2020L415-L424\u3011\u301013\u2020L427-L435\u3011\u301017\u2020L93-L101\u3011\u301019\u2020L340-L349\u3011\u301041\u2020L85-L93\u3011.)*\n\n### Cursor AI vs Tabnine\n\n**Tabnine** is another AI code assistant that predates Copilot. It started as a statistical code completion tool and has evolved to use transformer models. Tabnine\u2019s approach is to integrate into many IDEs and provide **context-aware code completions**, and more recently, an AI chat in IDE. \n\nComparing Cursor and Tabnine:\n\n- **IDE Integration:** Tabnine is available as a plugin for VSCode, JetBrains IDEs, Vim, etc. It\u2019s lightweight and *stays within your chosen IDE*. Cursor, as discussed, is its own VSCode-like IDE. If you love your JetBrains IDE with all its refactoring tools, you might prefer Tabnine to add AI there (since Cursor can\u2019t integrate into PyCharm or IntelliJ)\u301019\u2020L320-L328\u3011\u301019\u2020L332-L340\u3011. The Greptile comparison noted Cursor does **not** support JetBrains or Neovim, while Tabnine does\u301033\u2020L35-L43\u3011\u301033\u2020L45-L53\u3011. So Tabnine wins on flexibility of editor choice.\n\n- **Feature Set:** Tabnine historically focused on **completion** rather than full AI conversations. It offers whole-line or full-function predictions and learns from your code over time (it can train on your repository to personalize suggestions)\u301033\u2020L63-L70\u3011. It also has a feature to generate code from natural language comments (like you write a comment \u201c// sort array of integers\u201d and Tabnine suggests the code). Recently Tabnine introduced a Chat beta, which can answer code questions and do small fixes, but it\u2019s not as advanced in multi-modal context as Cursor\u2019s chat\u301033\u2020L79-L83\u3011. Cursor clearly has more **extensive features**: terminal control, multi-file, etc., which Tabnine does not provide (Tabnine doesn\u2019t run terminal commands or do multi-file edits autonomously). For example, **Terminal integration:** Cursor yes\u301033\u2020L35-L43\u3011; Tabnine no. **Explanations/Chat:** Cursor yes; Tabnine now yes (to a degree)\u301033\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u301033\u2020L79-L83\u3011.\n\n- **Model and Quality:** Tabnine uses its own optimized models and also offers to integrate with OpenAI models if you have an API key (Tabnine \u201cPro\u201d can use GPT-3 for example). It emphasizes **speed and privacy** \u2013 it can run locally or on a private cloud, and for some languages, its smaller model might be very fast. Cursor\u2019s model (GPT-4 or Claude) is larger and usually more powerful in understanding context and generating natural language explanations. In terms of suggestion quality, Tabnine might produce shorter, more context-specific completions (and it claims to adapt to your coding style over time\u301034\u2020L95-L103\u3011). Cursor\u2019s suggestions, being from a general LLM, may be more verbose or \u201ccreative\u201d. If you need small code completions as you type, both do well; if you need a whole class or function written given a one-sentence description, Cursor (using GPT-4) might be more capable of delivering that consistently.\n\n- **Whole Codebase Reasoning:** Tabnine doesn\u2019t index your whole project in the same semantic way; it mostly looks at currently open files and some project-wide patterns. Cursor explicitly indexes the codebase with embeddings\u301034\u2020L87-L94\u3011 and even allows an ignore list (`.cursorignore`) to control what it indexes\u301034\u2020L89-L97\u3011. This means Cursor is generally better if you want to ask questions like \u201cWhere is X used?\u201d or \u201cAdd this snippet to every file that\u2026\u201d \u2013 tasks requiring global knowledge. Tabnine is more focused on completing the line you\u2019re on (though it does pick up repetition and can do cross-file pattern completion in some cases). \n\n- **Privacy and Offline Use:** Tabnine offers an **on-premises or offline model** for enterprise (they have a self-hosted option)\u301033\u2020L39-L47\u3011\u301034\u2020L108-L116\u3011. This means companies concerned about code leaving their environment can use Tabnine with a local model (albeit likely less powerful than cloud GPT-4). Cursor at the moment doesn\u2019t have an offline model (its Business plan\u2019s \u201cprivacy mode\u201d still uses cloud, but ensures no code is stored long-term)\u301034\u2020L102-L110\u3011\u301034\u2020L117-L125\u3011. So for strictly air-gapped coding, Tabnine might be the only choice among these. Tabnine also emphasizes encryption of any data sent and not retaining code, which is similar to Cursor\u2019s approach but Tabnine has the fully local option as well\u301034\u2020L108-L116\u3011.\n\n- **Use Cases:** Cursor is ideal if you want an **\u201cAI-first IDE\u201d** that can handle many aspects of coding, whereas Tabnine is for those who want **AI assistance within their existing IDE** and possibly need to comply with strict privacy (like coding on confidential code without cloud). One analysis put it succinctly: *\u201cCursor is a full-featured AI-enhanced editor, ideal for those seeking an all-in-one environment. Tabnine is a lightweight, IDE-friendly code completion tool, offering adaptable AI while letting developers stay in their preferred workflow.\u201d*\u301034\u2020L132-L141\u3011\u301034\u2020L134-L143\u3011.\n\n- **Pricing:** Tabnine\u2019s pricing (as of early 2025) is around \\$9/month for individual \u201cDev\u201d subscription, which is cheaper than Cursor Pro\u301034\u2020L119-L127\u3011\u301034\u2020L123-L128\u3011. Enterprise (self-hosted) is pricier at \\$39/user. Cursor\u2019s \\$20 Pro is a bit higher but you\u2019re paying for the more advanced model usage. Depending on how much that matters to you, cost could be a factor if budgets are tight.\n\nIn summary, **Cursor vs Tabnine** comes down to *Environment vs Extension, and Comprehensive AI vs Focused AI*. If you are fine switching to Cursor\u2019s editor, you\u2019ll get a richer set of features in one place. If you cannot leave your current IDE or need offline support, Tabnine is a strong alternative even if it has fewer bells and whistles.\n\n### Cursor AI vs ChatGPT (and others)\n\nWhile ChatGPT (or GPT-4 via the OpenAI Playground) isn\u2019t an IDE tool, many developers use it alongside coding. The comparison here is more about workflow:\n\n- **Convenience:** ChatGPT in a web browser requires copying code back and forth for anything non-trivial, whereas Cursor integrates that directly. Cursor was essentially created to avoid the \u201cAlt-Tab to ChatGPT\u201d dance\u30109\u2020L93-L100\u3011. So if you find yourself frequently asking ChatGPT for coding help, Cursor can save you time by bringing the AI to you (with added context). On the other hand, ChatGPT\u2019s interface is sometimes better for long conceptual discussions (because you can format things easily, share with others, etc.). If you need to discuss design or ask a question unrelated to code, you might still use ChatGPT, but when actively coding, Cursor is more efficient.\n\n- **Capabilities:** If you have GPT-4 access, ChatGPT can do a lot that Cursor can. In fact, under the hood, Cursor might be using GPT-4 to answer you. The difference is Cursor provides contextual code awareness automatically. You could approximate that by pasting relevant code into ChatGPT, but there\u2019s a chance you miss something or hit token limits. Cursor automates that context injection (through embeddings and file references). So for code-specific queries, Cursor\u2019s answers might be more tailored. ChatGPT might be better at very high-level questions or those involving long dialogues, since the chat UI is made for conversation. But note that Cursor\u2019s chat also preserves history within the session, so you can have a long dialogue with it too (just that it resets when you close the editor or clear context, whereas ChatGPT keeps a transcript in the cloud).\n\n- **Other AI Tools:** There are emerging alternatives like **Replit Ghostwriter** (which is an AI in Replit\u2019s online IDE) and **Amazon CodeWhisperer** (an AWS tool similar to Copilot). Ghostwriter is actually quite similar in spirit to Cursor, except in a cloud IDE \u2013 it offers code completion, chat, and even a debugger integration. CodeWhisperer focuses on inline suggestions and has security scanning for suggestions (to avoid vulnerable code). In comparisons, Cursor often is ranked highly for its feature richness, Ghostwriter for tight integration with Replit platform, Copilot for overall polish and data quality, and CodeWhisperer as a decent free alternative especially if you\u2019re in AWS ecosystem. Each has slight advantages: for example, CodeWhisperer was free for individual use and has good AWS API knowledge; Copilot has the huge training data and integration; Ghostwriter has execution sandbox to test code easily; Cursor has the most expansive toolset (images, web, agent, etc.).\n\nFrom a **productivity** standpoint, studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that AI assistants can provide significant time savings on boilerplate and help resolve issues faster. A recent Microsoft research found that Copilot helped developers complete tasks ~55% faster on average for certain tasks. We can extrapolate that having an even more powerful assistant like Cursor could yield similar or better productivity gains, especially in tasks that involve understanding or modifying existing code. The reddit post citing \u201c5x productivity\u201d with Cursor\u2019s agent is an extreme case\u301036\u2020L210-L218\u3011, but it indicates the potential leaps in speed for some workflows.\n\n**Potential Limitations vs Others:**\nOne limitation of Cursor relative to, say, **ChatGPT** is that ChatGPT is model-agnostic to your environment, meaning if you have a very unusual environment or need to use other tools (like drawing diagrams, etc.), ChatGPT can handle more varied requests. Cursor is geared towards coding tasks; asking it something purely general knowledge (like \u201cexplain quantum physics\u201d) isn\u2019t its main use \u2013 though with web search it could attempt an answer, but that\u2019s outside its focus. Another limitation vs **Ghostwriter** is that Replit\u2019s Ghostwriter can actually run code and show outputs within the same environment (since it\u2019s an online IDE with execution). Cursor can run your code locally if you have the environment set up (via terminal or an \u201cinterpreter mode\u201d for Python as seen in the forum screenshots\u301046\u2020L132-L140\u3011), but it\u2019s not as integrated as Ghostwriter\u2019s execute-and-explain loop. This is a niche difference; for most, running the code in a terminal is fine.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting **future trends:** Many established IDEs are adding their own AI features. Visual Studio (the full IDE) has IntelliCode and will likely integrate more AI. JetBrains is previewing a Copilot-like assistant (JetBrains AI Assistant). There\u2019s also **Windsurf** (another AI code editor competitor to Cursor)\u301031\u2020L37-L40\u3011. These tools are converging. Cursor currently is ahead in offering an \u201cAI-native\u201d experience. But if you consider longevity, a tool like Copilot might remain more standard (especially given GitHub\u2019s backing and integration into developer platforms). Cursor\u2019s effectiveness against others will also depend on how well it keeps up with the latest models and whether it can maintain a user-friendly experience as features grow.\n\nIn conclusion on comparisons: **Cursor stands out for integrating a broad spectrum of AI capabilities into development, more so than any single competitor right now**. It is often mentioned as potentially *\u201cmaking other tools feel useless\u201d* due to features like multi-file edit and direct apply\u301031\u2020L7-L10\u3011. However, each tool has its niche: Copilot for simplicity and ubiquity, Tabnine for privacy and integration, ChatGPT for conversational problem-solving, etc. The best choice can be personal or even task-dependent. One might use Copilot day-to-day and fire up Cursor for heavy lifting on a new project or for an AI pair-programming session on a tricky problem. \n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that AI-driven development tools including Cursor are reshaping how code is written and reviewed. They\u2019re not replacing developers but augmenting them. A balanced perspective, as Kanaries\u2019 deep dive said, is that *\u201cwhile AI assistants like Cursor are powerful aids, they complement rather than replace human programmers. The future will be shaped by those who effectively leverage these tools while honing their own skills.\u201d*\u30106\u2020L525-L534\u3011\u30106\u2020L533-L539\u3011.\n\n# Project Ideas and Innovative Uses for Cursor AI\n\nTo wrap up, let\u2019s explore some **project ideas** and creative ways to leverage Cursor AI in software engineering and data science. These suggestions illustrate how Cursor\u2019s capabilities can be applied beyond just \u201cnormal coding\u201d to more inventive or ambitious scenarios:\n\n### 1. **Automated Codebase Refactor Bot**  \nUse Cursor\u2019s agent mode to build a *refactoring bot* for a legacy codebase. For example, a project idea: *\u201cModernize an old Python 2 project to Python 3 and PEP8 standards using Cursor.\u201d* You could load the old codebase in Cursor and iteratively prompt the agent to apply changes:\n  - Convert print statements to functions, update deprecated library calls, etc.\n  - Run the code\u2019s test suite (via Cursor\u2019s terminal) and let it fix failures.\n  - Enforce style guidelines by feeding in a style guide (via custom rules or just as a prompt) and asking Cursor to reformat accordingly.\nThis would test Cursor\u2019s ability to handle a large-scale refactor. You might combine it with a Git version control to review each batch of changes. The result is an **AI-assisted code modernization** tool. As a bonus, Cursor can generate documentation of changes or a migration guide from the diffs. This kind of project could save tremendous manual effort on upgrading legacy systems.\n\n### 2. **Intelligent Data Analysis Notebook Assistant**  \nWhile Cursor isn\u2019t a Jupyter notebook, you can create a pseudo-notebook workflow: use Cursor to write a data analysis script step by step, and after each step, use the chat to interpret results. For instance, a project analyzing a dataset (say, stock prices or COVID-19 data):\n  - Ask Cursor to generate code to load and clean the data.\n  - Actually run that code in the terminal or an interpreter and get output (like summary stats).\n  - Copy some output (or errors) into the chat and ask for insights or fixes.\n  - Next, ask Cursor to visualize some aspect (it writes plotting code).\n  - Use the image support to feed an example plot (if you save it) back into Cursor for commentary.\n  - Iterate to build a full analysis report.\nIn essence, you\u2019re using Cursor as both a coder and a talking assistant to interpret each result. By the end, you\u2019ll have a complete analysis script and a written narrative (compiled from the chat explanations). This showcases an **AI-driven EDA** process. A concrete idea: *\u201cAnalyze the correlation between weather and bike rentals using Cursor AI,\u201d* where Cursor writes the code to compute correlations and regression, and also helps write the conclusions.\n\n### 3. **AI-assisted Web Development Workflow**  \nLeverage Cursor to handle a full stack development flow. For example, build a simple web application (a to-do list app or a personal blog site) using Cursor:\n  - Use the chat to create the backend (e.g., Node/Express or Flask) scaffolding.\n  - Use the image-to-code feature: sketch a rough wireframe of the frontend UI, input it as an image, and ask Cursor to generate HTML/CSS (Cursor\u2019s image support could attempt this, as they\u2019ve demoed turning UI screenshots into code).\n  - Automatically generate API documentation by asking Cursor to document each endpoint.\n  - Write end-to-end tests by prompting Cursor\u2019s agent to generate them (and run them).\n  - If deploying, ask Cursor to create a Dockerfile or CI pipeline file.\nThis project basically uses Cursor as the primary dev tool to go from zero to a deployed app. It would test how well Cursor integrates multiple technologies in one project. The end result could be documented as *\u201cBuilt a web app entirely through AI guidance\u201d*. Realistically, the human will intervene where needed, but it demonstrates how far Cursor can automate the workflow.\n\n### 4. **Machine Learning Experimentation Helper**  \nIn an ML research setting, use Cursor to manage experiments:\n  - Have Cursor generate variations of a model training code with different architectures (via prompts like \u201ctry a 4-layer CNN instead of 3-layer\u201d).\n  - Have it write the code to log metrics or integrate with TensorBoard.\n  - Use the terminal to run these experiments (if local environment permits).\n  - When an experiment finishes, paste the results (accuracy, loss curves) into the chat and ask Cursor to analyze them or suggest next steps (maybe it will notice overfitting and suggest regularization).\n  - This could even be taken further: integrate Cursor with a scheduling system where it triggers new experiments based on its own suggestions \u2013 a semi-automated research loop.\nThe project could be *\u201cAI-guided hyperparameter tuning\u201d*. While there are dedicated tools for AutoML, here you get an interactive dialog about experiments, which can be educational and possibly reveal insights (Cursor might pull in info from literature via web search if you ask, like \u201cwhat does literature say about this result?\u201d). This is a novel use of an AI coding assistant in the scientific process.\n\n### 5. **Documentation and Knowledge Base Generation**  \nUse Cursor to build a **knowledge base** for an existing codebase. For example, take an open-source project with poor documentation:\n  - Ask Cursor questions about each module and compile the Q&A into a Markdown wiki. (Cursor\u2019s codebase Q&A could retrieve relevant code for each answer).\n  - Use `@Docs` to integrate any inline comments or existing docs to improve answers.\n  - Essentially, you conduct an interview of the code via Cursor and record the answers as documentation pages. For instance, *\u201cHow does authentication work in this project?\u201d*, Cursor will find the auth logic and explain it.\n  - You can also have Cursor create diagrams: perhaps not graphically, but it can outline class relationships or call flows which you can then refine or draw.\nThe outcome is an **AI-generated documentation site** for the project. This is valuable in software maintenance, and it\u2019s a creative way to use Cursor\u2019s strength in understanding code context. One could automate this by writing a script that feeds many questions to Cursor\u2019s API if available, but doing it interactively ensures quality of each answer.\n\n### 6. **AI-driven Code Review Assistant**  \nThis project uses Cursor in a code review scenario. Imagine you have a pull request \u2013 you can open the diff in Cursor (since it\u2019s Git-aware, or just open changed files) and then:\n  - Ask Cursor\u2019s chat: *\u201cReview these changes: are there any potential bugs or improvements?\u201d* \n  - Cursor can analyze the diff and provide feedback. It might catch things like missing null checks or suggest edge cases. (This is similar to GitHub\u2019s Copilot Labs \u201cexplain code\u201d or upcoming review features, but you can do it now with Cursor by feeding context).\n  - As a project, you could formalize this into a **code review bot**: perhaps integrate with a git hook where you paste diffs into Cursor via its CLI/agent and auto-generate a draft review.\n  - You\u2019d then manually curate the feedback and post it on the PR.\nThis augments human reviewers and can be especially helpful for smaller teams. The project outcome could be *\u201cA semi-automated code review process using Cursor AI\u201d*. It highlights Cursor\u2019s understanding of code and could even incorporate its ability to run tests \u2013 e.g., if the PR adds a function, ask Cursor to generate a quick test for it to see if any obvious case fails.\n\n### 7. **Learning and Mentorship Tool**  \nFor those learning programming or a new language, use Cursor as an interactive tutor. A project idea: *\u201cLearn Rust by building a small project with Cursor\u2019s guidance.\u201d* The person would attempt tasks and ask Cursor at each step for explanation or help:\n  - *\u201cHow do I implement a trait in Rust? Show me an example.\u201d* Cursor provides code and explanation.\n  - *\u201cCheck my code for any mistakes or non-idiomatic usage.\u201d* Cursor reviews it (Rust has a strict compiler, so it might catch errors or at least after compilation errors are seen).\n  - The result could be a blog or tutorial documenting how AI assistance can accelerate learning. Possibly, the project is that the learner, guided by Cursor, builds something that would have been too hard to do alone. For instance, writing a simple compiler or a game, with Cursor providing tips and even explaining errors.\nThis showcases how AI coding assistants can fill in as a mentor. It\u2019s not a product you deliver, but an experience you document \u2013 valuable in education tech.\n\n### 8. **Plugin Development with AI**  \nBecause Cursor can incorporate the VSCode extension ecosystem, one could create a **Cursor plugin** itself. For instance, maybe develop a VSCode extension (that also runs in Cursor) to do something like interactive UML diagram generation from code. Cursor could help you write that extension by providing boilerplate for VSCode API calls. It\u2019s a meta project: using Cursor to build its own extension or companion tools. An example: *\u201cBuild a Cursor extension that summarizes any selected function in plain English.\u201d* You\u2019d use Cursor to scaffold the extension (it can help with JSON config, TypeScript code for extension, etc.), effectively letting the AI contribute to extending its own platform.\n\n### 9. **Comparative Study or Benchmark** (for the academically inclined):\nConduct an experiment comparing Cursor and other assistants on various programming tasks. This could be a project where you design a set of coding tasks (e.g., implement a certain algorithm, fix a known bug, add a feature to a small project) and measure time/accuracy using Cursor vs Copilot vs human-only. Use this to quantitatively and qualitatively assess where Cursor excels or struggles. The project deliverable is a report or even a small paper, which could guide future tool development. It\u2019s not building software per se, but it uses Cursor extensively and critically. You could integrate this with something like having Cursor generate solutions and then test them automatically. This is a bit like what some research works are doing to evaluate AI coding performance. It would be interesting to see, for example, if Cursor\u2019s agent solves certain LeetCode problems faster than Copilot, or how the code quality differs.\n\n### 10. **AI-Augmented DevOps**  \nUse Cursor to help with writing infrastructure as code scripts (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes YAMLs) and automating deployment steps. A project could be *\u201cOne-click deploy my app with Cursor\u2019s help.\u201d* You feed Cursor high-level requirements (like \u201cset up an AWS Lambda and API Gateway for this Express app\u201d), and it generates the config or CLI commands. It might use web search for AWS docs, etc. Then have it run deployment commands via the terminal integration. This pushes the envelope of using AI in operations. By the end, you document a pipeline that was mostly written by AI. It demonstrates that AI coding assistants aren\u2019t just for application code, but can be applied to the DevOps domain as well, where syntax is tricky and errors can be costly. Cursor\u2019s ability to incorporate docs and examples on the fly is particularly useful here, as infrastructure code often needs consulting official templates.\n\n---\n\nThese project ideas show off **innovative ways to leverage Cursor AI** beyond just autocompleting lines. They combine Cursor\u2019s strengths \u2013 natural language understanding, codebase context, multi-step automation \u2013 to do things that traditionally would require a lot of human effort or multiple tools. Whether it\u2019s building a product faster, generating documentation, or exploring data, Cursor can be a catalyst. Of course, the human developer is still steering the ship: deciding the goals, verifying the outcomes, and handling any creative decisions. But with Cursor as a co-pilot (or even an automated pilot for some legs of the journey), developers can attempt more ambitious projects or simply get their work done with less friction.\n\nAs AI coding assistants like Cursor evolve, we can expect even more integration (maybe deeper debugging capabilities, voice-driven coding, etc.). Embracing these tools in projects now not only yields immediate productivity boosts but also prepares us for a future where managing automated coding workflows and collaborating with AI becomes a standard part of software development.

This seems to be a sensible approach when working with a tool like Cursor.","attribution":"lynchpin.com"},{"matched_text":"\u30106\u2020L484-L492\u3011","start_idx":16092,"end_idx":16105,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"A Deep Dive into Cursor: Pros and Cons of AI-Assisted Coding \u2013 Kanaries","url":"https://docs.kanaries.net/topics/AICoding/cursor-review#:~:text=Cursor%27s%20approach%20to%20understanding%20local,this%20method%20has%20some%20limitations","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Cursor's approach to understanding local codebases involves chunking code and creating embeddings, which are then used for vector search to provide context.

(Spoiler: I did not stick with Cursor for a month) \n\nFor context, I'm an experienced developer, plenty of frameworks and languages under my belt. However, I've started a new project with Laravel, which I'm not familiar with, so I thought this would be a great candidate for an AI assistant. It's exactly the right combination of needing a hand with syntax and convention, but with enough experience to be able to (usually) spot incomplete answers or bad practices when I see it. Here's a few observations I noted down along the way: \n\n  * Neither Cursor or Copilot are great at linking the context of a question to earlier ones, but Cursor seems to be the worse of the two. \n\n  * You have to be a lot more specific and precise with instructions to Cursor, otherwise it misunderstands the assignment. Copilot seems better at inferring your meaning from a short description. \n\n  * Cursor's tone weirdly oscillates between excessive verbosity and terse standoffishness. Sometimes I'll get an overly long boring lecture about the broader topic without any code, and sometimes the whole response will be 100% code with no commentary. It doesn't feel like a natural conversation the way github copilot does. Also the amount of solution it'll provide will be haphazard - sometimes it'll produce a long output that includes everything, and sometimes it'll only give you a few lines of solution and hints at the end that there's other stuff you need to do. \n\n  * Cursor limiting the number of \"fast\" queries even on the $20 paid tier does make it doubly annoying when it returns a useless answer. \n\n  * Cursor's autocompletion is a trainwreck, it suggests the wrong thing so often that it actually gets in the way. It doesn't seem to even bother checking the signatures of functions in the same file that it autocompletes calls for. \n\n  * I can't see any reason why Cursor has to take over the entire environment by shipping as its own vscode build, when there's plenty of vscode plugins that integrate perfectly well with the editors while managing to just be a plugin. I had several issues getting my existing vscode project to run in Cursor even though it was literally the same project in the same directory. \n\nBecause the people recommending Cursor seemed so excited by it I assumed that I just needed to learn to tailor my prompts better for Cursor and use more of its features. So, even though it immediately stuck out as worse on the first day, I still stuck with it for two weeks before giving up entirely. I can only conclude that either the people recommending Cursor over Copilot are doing a vastly different kind of project that I'm working on, or they used some older version of Copilot that sucked, or they're shills. \n\nTL;DR: Cursor's answers had a much lower success rate than Github Copilot's, it's more irritating to use, and it costs literally twice as much. \n\n Share   Add a comment\n\nSort by: \n\nBest\n\nOpen comment sort options\n\n* Best\n\n* Top\n\n* New\n\n* Controversial\n\n* Old\n\n* Q&A\n\n   \n\n Eunomiac  \n\n\u2022 \u2022 Edited \n\nThe crucial question is whether you're using GPT 3.5 or if you're paying for GPT 4. Because the former is crap, and no wonder you're suffering if you're relying on 3.5 \n\nI've been using both for months now (check my comment history if you think I'm a shill), and I like them for different things. Cursor is far better integrated into the IDE (that's why it \"took over the environment\", to enable such integration), and it is accumulating improvements and new features faster than Copilot is. I agree Copilot does better with autocomplete, as well as documentation, but I find that Cursor outperforms Copilot when it comes to getting answers about your entire codebase, or when you have to teach it a third-party API --- Cursor's integration of API documentation is fantastic. \n\nAs for tone and the other things you described, I think you need to put more work into your system instruction settings (where you give Cursor information it should know at all times). You can configure them by workspace, too. Here are my global ones as an example: \n\n    # ENVIRONMENT DETAILS\n    - **O/S**: 64-bit Windows 11\n    - **Terminal**: Cursor's Integrated Powershell with Administrator rights\n    - **Browser**: Chrome\n    Avoid responding with information related to other environments.\n\n    # OPERATIONAL FEATURES\n    - **Context Window Warnings**: Alert the user when nearing the context window limit.\n    - **Missing Content Requests**: Request the user provide project code, documentation, or definitions necessary for an adequate response.\n    - **Error Correction**: Indicate all user prompt errors of terminology, convention, or understanding, regardless of their relevance to the user prompt.\n\n    # CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RULES\n    1. **Completeness**: Generate full code, no placeholders. If unable, explain in comments.\n    2. **Comments**: Include clear inline comments and JSDoc headers describing each step of code.\n    3. **Error Checking**: Implement error checking and type validation.\n    4. **Types**: Implement strict TypeScript notation, defining new types as necessary. Additionally:\n       - Do not use the 'any' type.\n       - Do not use the non-null assertion operator (`!`).\n       - Do not cast to unknown (e.g. `as unknown as T`).\n    5. **Strings**: Adhere to these standards for strings:\n       - Use double quotes (`\"`) for strings.\n       - Use string templates or `.join()` instead of operational concatenation.\n    It is critically important that you adhere to the above five rules.\n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n Successful_Good_4126  \n\n\u2022\n\nThis is super useful and I've borrowed this to improve my cursor setup thank you. \n\nReply  reply \n\n[deleted]\n\n\u2022\n\nComment removed by moderator\n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n AutoModerator  \n\n\u2022\n\nSorry, your submission has been removed due to inadequate account karma. \n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There will be one option for \"Documents\". Click it, and a dialog box will pop up asking you to name the document and provide a web address to the \"front page\" (if it's a wiki or a manual). It's not perfect (no LLM is), and I sometimes have to remind the AI that I'm working within a framework and that I provided docs, but I've been very happy overall with Cursor's integration of both GPTo and Claude Sonnet in this regard! \n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n boscop  \n\n\u2022\n\nThanks, I'll try that.

Vs Microsoft, the most valuable tech company with its massive track record of anti competitive behavior, who is undoubtedly trying to corner the market. They bought GitHub, they invest heavily in openai, this was never done for self righteous aims, as much as I respect Nadella, he's a CEO of a juggernaut that will inevitably answer to shareholders at the end of day and seek to corner the market wherever possible. Even under his rule he's been tenure Microsoft has been racked with lots of anti competion fines in the EU still. \n\nWe, as devs, should really think long and hard about the services we purchase when it comes to enabling competitors and startups, we've all at one point or another been burned by these tech juggernauts, Microsoft, apple, meta, etc etc. \n\nI recognize I sound like a shill. I am not. Half the dev team I worked with switched back to copilot, simply because they like Vscode. Take Vscode, IDEs are another market the behemoth Microsoft has cornered, even cursor is a Vscode fork, I remember when I started my Dev career almost a decade ago how most devs were split between sublime 2, 3 and others (which I forget the names of because they have basically become virtually irrelevant after Microsoft's rise with Vscode). \n\nWe can blame big tech for uncompetitive behavior, but at the end of the day, we as consumers share at least an equal amount of blame. I will continue to use cursor (business plan with no private code snippet scanning) until I am not longer able to, which sadly is becoming more and more likely as devs I work with go with what's \"comfortable\", yet objectively marginally better at best, and could easily be marginally worse.

A lot of people like to point out that Cursor has built in RAG. Which is why I started to use it. But it kinda sucks. For example I was working on a project and needed to update an SDK. But Cursor kept giving me outdated code so I gave it the new documentation to index and showed it in the docs the exact page in the docs where it shows the broken changes between V1 and V2. It said sorry for the misunderstanding you are correct when I tell it to use the correct imports from the SDK, then proceeds to continue to use code from the V1 SDK. \n\nSame goes for so called chatting with the codebase. Cursor continually tells me to look for code and to compare code with documentation even if you give it the docs to index and the file you are working on. This has become more and more frequent. \n\nAt this point I am 100% sure that to get a tool working for an type of production work I will have to build agents and a RAG solution. \n\nReply  reply \n\n   \n\n creaturefeature16  \n\n\u2022\n\nImage: Profile Badge for the Achievement Top 1% Commenter Top 1% Commenter\n\nI've been thinking of writing a similar agentic RAG app, as well, but I keep expecting another company that has more time and resources to solve this before I do... \n\nReply  reply   More replies  \n\n   \n\n Tr1poD  \n\n\u2022\n\nHave you tried Cody?

Copilot++ (autocomplete) is custom llm. I don\u2019t like it too, but it\u2019s beta. Codeium offer autocomplete for free and it\u2019s better than codex. So I use that + Cursor.

Or go with the paid version which gives you 10 opus queries (a joke). I mean Cursor should have been a VSCode plug-in and nothing more but from the available AI IDE integrations it's currently the best at least for me because it's model agnostic and i like the shortcut. But all of them are currently limited by context size, the only thing coming close is gemini 1.5 pro with 1 million tokens, but the model itself is lacking. \n\nReply  reply   More replies    More replies    More replies  \n\n[deleted]\n\n\u2022\n\nComment removed by moderator\n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n AutoModerator  \n\n\u2022\n\nSorry, your submission has been removed due to inadequate account karma. \n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At $10\u2013$20/month, it\u2019s more affordable than Cursor while maintaining consistent quality and scalability. For Laravel or any other framework, it\u2019s worth trying for a smoother and more efficient experience. \n\nReply  reply \n\n[deleted]\n\n\u2022\n\nComment removed by moderator\n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n AutoModerator  \n\n\u2022\n\nSorry, your submission has been removed due to inadequate account karma. \n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I honestly can't think of anything to make it better. However, I've been building these apps for 10 years since I started so it really was a tool to do harder things that took time and not a tool to learn. It's an absolute powerhouse if you already know what you're doing well. \n\nReply  reply \n\n   \n\n beachandbyte  \n\n\u2022\n\nBiggest issue with copilot is no .Net debug tools, so if you in .net eco system a non starter pretty much. \n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n 0b1010011010  \n\n\u2022\n\nNot a cursor shill just hate how much they have fumbled the bag on github copilot. Now do an in depth analysis on your github copilot experience as honest as cursor & it would be dramatically worse. They are both horrible, and cursor seems the better of the two if you learn how to use it but I still find myself using multiple different options. Sometimes it is better to jump into a new chat then go back too. \n\nReply  reply \n\n   \n\n creaturefeature16  \n\n\u2022 \u2022 Edited \n\nImage: Profile Badge for the Achievement Top 1% Commenter Top 1% Commenter\n\nI find the difference between the two to be marginal, at best. I like Cursor's interface and overall approach to context. I had zero issues getting it going with my existing environment, it was super turn-key. I do mostly web dev, full stack. \n\nAs far as accuracy goes, LLMs are notoriously fickle, so maybe you hit Cursor on a bad day and vice-versa for others and CoPilot. It's the same models more or less under the hood on both. \n\nI really think it's just personal preference at this point, and they are both evolving fairly rapidly. \n\nReply  reply \n\n   \n\n 100dude  \n\n\u2022\n\nI\u2019m getting back to copilot \n\nReply  reply \n\n   \n\n ohnoimugly  \n\n\u2022\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real reason to compare Copilot to Cursor, unless I\u2019m misunderstanding. Cursor is simply a fork of VSCode with extra features. You can still use Copilot inside of Cursor. They are not mutually exclusive. It\u2019s like a premium version of VSCode that lets you interact with LLMs similar to Copilot, except it works with several LLMs and not just OpenAIs. \n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n productboy  \n\n\u2022\n\nno skin in the Cursor game; just works best for my use cases [where Copilot and it\u2019s many variants have failed]\u2026 meanwhile, just installed the Bito VS Code extension on my Raspberry Pi desktop machine and it\u2019s really good; and fast, which is surprising since it\u2019s based on GPT-3.5 \n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n bree_dev  \n\n\u2022\n\nWeird that you're getting downvoted when this is literally the only argument in favour of Cursor that I'm willing to entertain. \n\nIf your particular project or style worked better with Cursor then that's another useful data point - if you could share more about how you use it then it'd be even more useful still... \n\nReply  reply \n\n  \n\n productboy  \n\n\u2022\n\nI started using Cursor as an experiment; to compare it to VS Code + GitHub Copilot. Then quickly discovered Cursor\u2019s flow [scaffolding code from minimal prompts; refactoring code; recommending solutions for errors] was smoother for my Javascript + cloud projects. Cursor was also good at resolving obscure deployment issues pushing to various cloud platforms [Vercel, AWS] whether via GitHub CI/CD or command line infrastructure as code. \n\nReply  reply   More replies    More replies  \n\n  \n\n femio  \n\n\u2022\n\nI\u2019ve done your same experiment for the past several months. My conclusion? LLMs just suck for coding. They are just fancy autocorrect and lack the actual reasoning skills to be useful.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve sent Cursor some documentation, shared my code in the context, and asked it to tell me why my code is wrong. It\u2019ll often say \u201cbecause you\u2019re not initializing the needed variable on class A. Do it like this:\u201d then it\u2019ll send me exactly the same code I have written line for line.\u00a0\n\nRAG is overhyped because it only gives an LLM more context to pull its output from but doesn\u2019t make it smarter at all. Just this week I was struggling with this obscure library I wanna use for a side project and after 20 minutes of trying to get Cursor to dig into the type interfaces/docs to help me understand something it was sending me nonsense. Naturally, once I started digging on my own I figured it out.\u00a0\n\nI still prefer Cursor over anything else because it has some great features like having it generate a command in my terminal, install several packages with the flags i need, and echo out a config file all at once. The RAG is great for really basic surface-level knowledge of things that are new; your experience worked since it\u2019s Laravel, but it won\u2019t always be something that easy. Overall I find Cursor worth it but I\u2019m kinda over the LLM hype in general honestly.

They offer 8 daily messages for gpt o1 preview and unlimited messages to the latest Claude 3.5, gpt 4o, and soon Gemini, all for $10/month.\n\nIn my opinion, if Cursor doesn\u2019t align their offer, people will eventually abandon it. I\u2019m transitioning to GitHub Copilot because I don\u2019t see a future for Cursor. All of Cursor\u2019s features will eventually be replicated, making it feel expensive without any added value.\n\nMicrosoft could alter the Visual Studio license or, in a worst-case scenario, make it closed-source. What would happen to Cursor then?\n\nNo one knows\n\n4 Likes\n\njuanitorduz  November 13, 2024, 8:38am  2\n\nyeah Image: :confused: I am paying the subscription but issues like Cursor Tab suggestions not fully visible will probably make me cancel soon\n\nfun_strange  November 13, 2024, 10:13am  3\n\n8 daily messages for o1-preview is too little for very complex use cases. Do they offer a possibility to use your own API key?\n\narturskruze  November 15, 2024, 10:40am  4\n\nGithub Copilot is adding more and more features. Based on the current pricing model for Copilot and roadmaps for 2025 for both products, Cursor seems to be headed in a trajectory where Copilot makes more business sense for organizations.\n\nAre there any significant plans for Cursor other than the 2025 roadmap here? More Problems\n\n1 Like\n\nfun_strange  November 15, 2024, 11:41am  5\n\nI believe the priority for Cursor should be fixing existing bugs. There are many bugs that make the whole experience akin to walking on egg shells - e.g. if I take an existing chat with all the files attached as context and edit the first message, there is no guarantee that all the attached context will be send to the LLM. I have to create a new chat, reattach all the files and make sure I\u2019m not switching editors to avoid some files detaching from the context. For this, I have to open a separate instance of VSCode, and additionally open the files there if I need to read something in them or copy something from there while editing my query to the AI. Then and only then can I be certain that all my files and context are properly attached. Still, I go to Openrouter and double check to make sure the appropriate number of tokens is actually being sent. If I follow all these carefully laid out steps, discovered by trial and error and tons of wasted requires, I can get the perfect solution to my problems. This makes the whole experience very frustrating.\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure if there is anything better. Copilot is limited I guess, where you can\u2019t use your own API key, anything else is also limited to some specific functionality. I don\u2019t want to use anything besides VSCode or VSCode forks (I\u2019ve tried a lot of IDEs and so far couldn\u2019t find anything better than VSCode/Cursor for handling all my use cases).\n\nThis is the state of software in general unfortunately. There are all these tiny bugs that are not being addressed in months that require you to constantly walk on eggshells. Hopefully AGI comes soon and fixes all this mess.\n\n2 Likes\n\nmonsterfurby  November 15, 2024, 1:30pm  6\n\nI used Copilot for a long time and switched to Cursor because I didn\u2019t really see any notable improvement in Copilot - not to mention a lack of context-awareness in larger codebases. Isn\u2019t that the main USP Cursor has? I am genuinely curious if Copilot is getting better at context handling these days.\n\n1 Like\n\nsubzero06  November 18, 2024, 5:48pm  7\n\nTo be honest, the new Github Copilot edit, and cursor all looks the same to me. Looks like github stole cursor\u2019s idea and made looks like a copy and paste with few minor aesthetic changes.  \nI was experimenting with GitHub\u2019s new chat feature, and to my surprise, it\u2019s doing the same thing as cursor. You can now use sonnet 3.5 and chatgpt 4o with copilot for no extra charge. All for 10$ month is a deal for me.\n\n1 Like\n\nfun_strange  November 19, 2024, 9:43am  10\n\nDo you know if you can use unlimited o1-preview with your own API key in Copilot with unlimited context like in Cursor?\n\nI\u2019d like to find out, but don\u2019t want to pay 10$ just to check this specific feature Image: :slight_smile:\n\nsubzero06  November 19, 2024, 3:45pm  11\n\nThere is no option to use your own API key, can only use what they have available in dropdown for llm.\n\ngrantrosse  November 19, 2024, 5:30pm  12\n\ncursor blows copilot out of the water- the suggestions are better and the in-line editing is much better. Additionally, copilot doesn\u2019t have anything that touches the functionality of the composer in terms of creating/editing files.\n\nThere is an art to using this piece of software and you need to balance the complexity of the instructions you give it. It helps to plan out the project ahead of time and not try to have cursor do too much at once- rather, guide it to do what you want. This is why it\u2019s still a tool to be operated by a developer that has domain knowledge on whatever he/she is trying to do.\n\n3 Likes\n\nark-m  November 19, 2024, 5:57pm  13\n\nWell, Copilot isn\u2019t quite there yet, but I agree that they are heading in the right direction with a solid approach. So, Cursor should reassess its pricing; $20 for only 500 fast queries isn\u2019t a good deal, especially with so many competitors around\n\nFinDevAI  November 19, 2024, 6:22pm  14\n\nCo-pilot has been utterly destroyed by Cursor.

And now Cursor is my daily driver replacing VSCode :)\n\nOver the weekend I have built this private UI for OpenAI chat API, entirely in Cursor, with ~90% of code being generated by GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nIMO, the team behind Cursor (and there are just 6 of them!) managed to squeeze the most (1) out of prompt engineering and GPT-3.5/4 models and (2) frictionless integration into VSCode.\n\nComing next:\n\n  1. A few words about AI Coding\n  2. Getting Started with Cursor, Pricing \n  3. Coding with Cursor\n  4. Cursor vs Cody AI\n  5. Why pick Cursor (or any other tool) over CoPilot?\n  6. Why they forked VSCode?\n\n##    A few words about AI Coding \n\nOver the past year, I have tried quite a few AI coding assistants: GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Sourcegraph Cody, Google IDX, a few more VSCode extensions that required OpenAI key and allowed to have chat window in the IDE OR had editor integrations (inline chat and generation, refactoring or explanations of selected code etc.). Though I never settled on any of the options and kept using my very own and very basic cptX plugin for code generation/explanation in IDE or chatting to GPT in a separate (large) window.\n\nRetrospecting I can list a few reasons why I reverted to very limited application of AI assistants:\n\n  * Ergonomics - small chat windows, list of numerous 'recipes' somewhere in the sidebar, jumping inline chat, overwhelming diff representation\n  * Lack of language support (hello to CodeWhisperer and Dart/Flutter). \n  * Stability - e.g. trial of Project IDX was not good, and wasted time troubleshooting and fixing their cloud IDE (and even after it was fixed AI part was mediocre). The same goes for other options, especially those smaller/open-source VSCode plugins that happened to be buggy. \n  * Lack of trust - AI generation in many cases was not reliable. The code produced in many cases could have small and hard-to-spot bugs. Tasks that required generating more than one small code snippet (e.g. go create unit tests from scratch) often were a dead end with me going and doing everything manually.\n\nThat's where AI coding worked for me:\n\n  * Code explanation in unfamiliar code bases - select a line of code and ask what it does OR ask about the current open file and you will likely get a very good breakdown of the code\n  * Polyglot workflows - with AI you can easily start coding in new languages or augment your projects with new capabilities requiring stepping outside of the primary language (e.g. Bash scripting for automation, YAML for CI/CD, etc.). If you have a good grasp of any of the programming languages it helps a lot. Transferring the learned concepts is not that hard. You will be able to efficiently communicate with LLM by giving problem statements and then providing feedback while fixing/iterating on the generated code\n  * Small, self-contained, stereotyped tasks - if you see that a certain code block must be changed in a certain way - it is likely a good task for an AI assistant (e.g. `add docstring for the below function` or `add padding to the selected widget`). The same goes for small single-file tasks (e.g. `generate a Python script to list all files in the directory and count their total size`).\n  * Semantic navigation over the code base - many tools now have the promise of \"talk to your code base\". What it means is that there's an embedding index and the ability to find code snippets that might be relevant to a specific request. E.g. `How do I change default window size` for a desktop app works ~70% of the time. More complex requests going into interdependent code with multiple files involved will likely not lead to a result.\n\nUpdate, March 2024. I have been recently contemplating on the uses and here're a few items that can be added to the above list:\n\n  * Starting fresh - overcoming the \"tyranny of the blank page\"\n  * Saving on \"low entropy key strokes\" - using autocomplete to swiftly complete what seems to be a trivial ending to what you are currently typing\n  * Learning a new language - a mix of 'Code explanation' and 'Polyglot workflows'. I find LLM very useful when navigating a codebase in unfamiliar language just selecting certain lines and asking what this construct does in the language and what else is there to tell/demonstrate it\n  * Hyper-casual 101, exploring new areas or topics - if you know nothing of LLM fine-tuning, just ask strain away (and then proceed Googling try to find a more substantial work:)\n\n##    Getting Started with Cursor, Pricing \n\nCursor happens to be a fork of VSCode with (almost) no differences from the original. The out-of-box experience was great for me. There was just one welcome screen that suggested importing all my current VSCode plugins and settings and it took me less than a minute to get started.\n\nImage: Cursor first start welcome screen\n\nThe IDE was already configured to use Cursor provided GPT-4 model with 50 GPT-4 requests. Very soon I ran out of the free tier. Next, I could purchase a subscription for Cursor:\n\nImage: Image description\n\nAnd btw, the prices do not look competitive when compared to GitHub Copilot:\n\nImage: Image description\n\nYet (unlike GH CoPilot) Cursor allows using 3rd party models. I switched to GPT-4 Turbo (November version with 128k context) deployed in Azure and used it.\n\n##    Coding with Cursor \n\nCursor provides a familiar VSCode experience with the only distinct UI feature being the horizontal toolbar replacing the original vertical one (which can be changed via settings). \n\nWhat I liked about Cursor UX is its simplicity and efficiency. There are 2 shortcuts (I'll be referring to macOS) that enable AI workflows:\n\n  * `Cmd + K` brings up an inline chat popup (in the editor or Terminal)\n  * `Cmd + L` toggles the left sidebar with Chat inside IDE (and also putting there any selected text/code)\n\nAnd those 2 actions are more than enough to reach every needed feature.\n\nImage: Image description\n\nFeatures:\n\n  * Chat in the right sidebar - `Cmd + L` or using \"Toggle AI pane\" small button in the top right corner \n    * Using the current file as the context (default mode)\n    * Using relevant code snippets found in the codebase - `Cmd + Enter`\n    * Interpreter mode that can execute multiple steps and make changes to multiple files/parts of the file - available through top right drop-down, must be enabled first via \"More\" tabs\n    * AI reviewer - scan the Git diff and get AI eval, must be enabled first via the \"More\" tabs\n  * Inline chat - put a cursor in the editor (or select a code block), hit `Cmd + K`, write instructions, and get the code inserted/changed. Why is it called chat? Cause you can write follow-up instructions and iterate over the code.\n  * Terminal chat - works the same as Inline chat, this time you can use `Cmd + K` while using Terminal in the bottom pane \n    * macOS users who like their terminal clean might struggle with the `Cmd + K` shortcut being overridden (by default that is how you clear the terminal)\n  * *Own OpenAI model *(OpenAI or Azure) - Hit the \"Gear\" button at the top right corner and scroll to the \"Advanced\" section \n    * It doesn't seem any self-deployed/private models (not reachable from the internet) can be used as Cursor uses its' own backend to make calls to the model\n  * Smaller horizontal toolbar replacing VSCode vertical one \n    * Can be reverted to default VSCode view via \"workbench.activityBar.orientation\" configuration (set to \"vertical\")\n\nMissing Features:\n\n  * No AI autocompletion as you type (as the original CoPilot worked)\n  * VSCode Dev Containers are broken (although available through UI)\n\n##    Cursor vs Cody AI \n\nBack in the Summer of 2023, I thought that the next-gen AI coding assistant was the one that understands the code base, can navigate, and form knowledge of solution structure and its contents. That's how I ended up trying Cody by Sourcegraph. The marketing materials promised to leverage code understanding, before the ChatGPT made the headlines Sourcegraph had built their business around code parsing/search tech and it seemed like a natural integration.\n\nThe code understanding capability didn't turn out to be a game changer. And I don't think Sourcegraph's code search made any difference and they ended up using embeddings and RAG (which is the most popular approach to enriching LLM with custom data).\n\nCody is available as a VSCode extension (as well as for a few other IDEs) and in terms of features it is very close to Cursor, the major differences being the LLM it bundles (it uses Anthropic's Claude models) and the autocomplete feature as in the original GH CoPilot.\n\nI decided to test the code understanding side-by-side with an early version of this project.\n\nUsing chat I asked 2 questions:\n\n  * List all files in the solution\n  * Please evaluate their contents and summarize their purpose and role in the solution\n\nAnd Cursor was a clear winner:\n\n  * Cody missed some of the files, hallucinated, and made up the non-existing file `model.py`\n  * Cursor listed all important files (stumbled on non-crucial `.env.template`)\n  * The summary provided by Cursor happened to be light years ahead, it did catch the gist of the solution and provided valid explanations for each of the files. Cody produced some generic text of zero value\n  * One nifty feature of Cursor - you can click on the file name in chat and navigate to it in IDE, seems a trivial and important feature, yet for some reason, it is missing in Cody\n\nScreenshots:\n\n  * Cody listing and explaining files\n  * Cursor listing and explaining files\n\nThis single use case can't be representative of all use cases, there can be excuses for Cody, such as using Claude 2 (which is inferior to GPT4)... It is really hard to consistently evaluate AI assistants in developer workflows.\n\nYet after using for some time both products (and I am not talking only about codebase search) I ended up with the impressions I shared at the beginning of the article (squeezing the most out of prompt engineering, frictionless integration into VSCode). It is the attention to detail, the minimal UX, and the level of execution that puts apart Cursor. Not just from Cody but from other AI assistants I tried as well.\n\n##    Why pick Cursor (or any other tool) over CoPilot? \n\nIt is a hard sell. With almost the same price GitHub CoPilot is a big name. It is the pioneer of AI-assisted coding, backed by Microsoft which has exclusive access to SoTA models by OpenAI, with resources/data/talent they are positioned for the best innovation in AI coding better than anyone else.\n\nWith the above facts, it is easy to think that GitHub Copilot is superior in its core capability - quality of code generation. And as an outcome, it should be the best tool for ramping up engineering productivity. Yet if you try to research the subject, you won't find a lot of (1) comprehensive side-by-side comparisons of AI coding assistants and (2) research results of GitHub Copilot's influence on productivity.\n\nSpeaking of Copilot's effects on productivity I have come across this study suggesting that CoPilot significantly help with small/isolated/boilerplate tasks - which is not quite representative of typical dev workflows. The most recent one focuses on developer satisfaction. It was touched upon at GitHub Universe'23 with a Shopify case study presented. And frankly, it sounds like the guys gave up on finding any hard evidence on productivity effects and ended up with the \"GitHub Copilot makes developers happier\" argument. \n\nIf even the big players say it is the UX that matters... I can name a few reasons why one might prefer Cursor over CoPilot. If you use VSCode and don't need any other IDE (CoPilot supports multiple IDEs) the advantages of Cursor would be:\n\n  * Frictionless start, no credit card is needed, great for beginners who want to try AI coding \n  * It has free quotas for GPT3.5 and GPT4 requests\n  * It can use your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI endpoints for inference\n  * The UI/UX might be better for your taste \n    * I don't like how CoPilot is loaded with multiple options/recipes, Cursor is cleaner\n    * I don't like CoPilot's side-by-side diff representation\n  * It has an experimental feature \"Interpreter mode\" which allows to use Cursor in an \"agentic\" mode when the IDE tries to do multiple steps/updates - that might suit your workflows \n    * I tried the feature, didn't quite work for me, though I can see how it can be a good productivity booster for some stereotyped flows\n\nBtw, that's the example of diff generated by CoPilot inline chat:\n\nImage: Presentation of diff generated by CoPilot\n\nAnd speaking of core capability - code generation. My subjective opinion is that 90% of quality comes from the model used and 10% from the implementation. Most of the assistants out there are somewhat the same in this respect. We have yet to see new models introduced (cheaper, faster, with bigger context windows and fewer hallucinations) and new ways to work with them (agents equipped with tools, etc.). \n\nThere are many examples of how big corporations hinder innovation and are slow to adopt new ideas. With Microsoft/CoPilot it took ~ 9 months between the introduction of GPT-4 powered CoPilot X (March of 2023) and the release of GitHub Copilot Chat (December). In summer VSCode Marketplace was loaded with decent extensions integrating Chat and GPT 3.5/4 into the IDE. The next big thing in AI-assisted engineering might likely come from smaller and more agile teams.\n\n##    Why they forked VSCode? \n\nThere are plenty of AI coding assistants available as extensions in VSCode Marketplace. I can speculate that the reason for that is the limitations imposed on extensions. E.g. showing a custom pop-up with rich UI, placing arbitrary view at the right sidebar, showing a popup in Terminal (and being able to read the output there) - those I the few of the constraints I can name (as someone who had created VSCode extension in the past)\n\nThe developers made a tradeoff between the burden of maintaining the fork in sync with the upstream VSCode (and eventually having some of the features broken) AND the freedom of altering UX and being able to implement the most nuanced integrations.\n\nAnd IMO that is one of the reasons behind the overall good impression and satisfaction with Cursor's UX.\n\n##  Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\nImage: pic \n\nPersonal Trusted User\n\n Create template  \n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmit Preview Dismiss \n\nCode of Conduct \u2022 Report abuse \n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I found a github issue with multiple people reporting the same issue - after months it was still being ignored. If a main feature of your product is in a borderline unusable state and nobody is addressing user concerns It\u2019s Over, your organization is cooked and the product is not going to improve. A lot of MS products are like this and once you see the pattern it\u2019s all over their developer products - i\u2019m forced to use Power Platform at work and there are similar examples here. I\u2019m not going back and nobody can make me & you could probably classify my preference for cursor as somewhat emotional/irrational\n\nsnorlaxo  August 19, 2024, 8:18am  3\n\nNot much to say, Cursor is just better across the board. Faster and more accurate with suggestions.\n\ndanishkhan  August 19, 2024, 9:04am  4\n\nCursor has better contextual understanding of the codebase thanks to it\u2019s embeddings and is faster than co pilot. Today i am testing it on a large codebase let\u2019s see how it goes.\n\ndeanrie  August 19, 2024, 10:11am  5\n\nFrom the very beginning, I used GitHub Copilot extensively. However, lately, I haven\u2019t been using it much, Cursor has proven to be more efficient in that regard. Thank you. The only thing I still use Copilot for is generating git commits.\n\n1 Like\n\nYourAverageDev  August 19, 2024, 3:59pm  6\n\nHave used copilot before, seen it as basically an autocomplete and did not find that much of a boost in productivity. Cursor is completely different, started building projects that would normally take days and do them in hours. Cursor is a different level for me.\n\n1 Like\n\nmtf  August 19, 2024, 5:47pm  7\n\nI find Cursor to be superior in almost every regard compared to Copilot. However, there are a few features in copilot that I appreciate, such as PR description/body generation and the commit message generation. While these features are hit or miss in Copilot, I believe Cursor could implement a more reliable commit message generation feature\u2014still waiting on that! Image: :slight_smile:\n\nLately, I haven\u2019t been using GitHub Copilot much because, in my experience, Cursor was significantly better. If Copilot has improved recently, I might have missed that\u2026\n\nOne thing I do like about Copilot is the unlimited requests, chats, and edits! The limit for fast-requests in Cursor does feel restrictive, even though I rarely hit it. I would appreciate the option to toggle between fast and slow requests, which has been a long-standing request, but it seems unlikely to be implemented anytime soon? Image: :upside_down_face:\n\nguettli  September 1, 2024, 4:54am  8\n\nI tried Copilot and Cursor.\n\nI prefer Copilot. The autocomplete prediction was better (for my use case)\n\nAdditionally I use \u2018ctrl-k\u2019 of the shell to delete characters. I was not able to disable that this triggers the AI pop-up in Cursor.\n\nAnd I prefer that Copilot is vscode.\n\nIn both tools I did not found:\n\n  * Check my PR. Maybe I was blind, but I found no way to do that.\n\n  * Check git history of that selection. I would like to know what changed in that selection (N lines) lately. The AI seems to have no access to that. And especially Cursor started hallucinating. Copilot afaik said directly that it has no access to that information.\n\nAnd of course check the heading of that forum before taking all pro cursor replies seriously. This place is about Cursor Image: :slight_smile:\n\ndanieliser  October 24, 2024, 5:59am  9\n\nWill drop this here, as a current state of comparison from someone who started using Copilot as soon as it was available, paid for it for entire team. We then found SuperMaven which was so fast for tab based completions and used both.\n\nStarted with Cursor about 2 weeks ago and even just tried Copilot again just now. Comparison isn\u2019t there still Cursor way ahead.\n\nImage Differences with the latest Copilot updates General \n\n> I just took a few minutes to try Copliot again. Been a few weeks, nothing substantially new or super useful over Cursor, in fact I immediately found a few things lacking: Couldn\u2019t @Folder, picking #workspace is not very effective either No @Web or pasting of a link to scan sites. The tab feature has gotten a lot better at guessing, but didn\u2019t once offer to jump to another file. I mean whos gonna open the CHANGELOG.md and suggest what to add\u2026 Am I expected to do that manual work myself now pssh\u2026 \n\nm4l490n  January 17, 2025, 5:15pm  10\n\nThe big advantage is that it works well over the full codebase.\n\nThe big disadvantage (and a lie) is that it is faster than copilot. It is not. It is very noticeably slower than copilot.\n\nThe fact that it searches the whole codebase\u2014and I\u2019ve seen that it is true and helps a lot\u2014will make me cancel my Copilot subscription and move over to Cursor. It is way slower, but the complete codebase search alone is worth it.\n\n###  Related topics \n\nTopic Replies Views Activity  \n  GitHub Copilot vs Cursor \n\n Discussion  \n\n11 4690 November 19, 2024   \n  General Cursor thoughts from a non coder (though this is likely applicable to all) \n\n Feedback  \n\n1 450 October 21, 2024   \n  Is Cursor still worth it? \n\n Discussion  \n\n2 841 January 6, 2025   \n  Comparison to Copilot + Copilot Chat \n\n Discussion  \n\n11 4475 November 1, 2023   \n  New to Cursor: What's the big deal? \n\n Discussion  \n\n1 2010 September 3, 2024   \n\n  * Home  \n  * Categories  \n  * Guidelines  \n  * Terms of Service  \n  * Privacy Policy  \n\nPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled","snippet":"Cursor has better contextual understanding of the codebase thanks to it's embeddings and is faster than co pilot.","pub_date":null,"crawl_date":null,"pub_timestamp":1724025600.0,"crawl_timestamp":null,"ref_id":"turn0search6"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"ebed286a-19e7-477a-b208-937900813480","request_id":"91d8352be9b84422-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ebed286a-19e7-477a-b208-937900813480","children":["ac54d14e-d20f-4c7d-92a6-d2e26e15b032"]},"ac54d14e-d20f-4c7d-92a6-d2e26e15b032":{"id":"ac54d14e-d20f-4c7d-92a6-d2e26e15b032","message":{"id":"ac54d14e-d20f-4c7d-92a6-d2e26e15b032","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.search","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.search"}},"create_time":1741498525.97002,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"sonic_webpage","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wlvzcEdqAc","domain":"www.youtube.com","title":"Cursor vs GitHub Copilot: Which One Should You Use in 2025?","text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  [wordlim: 200] Published: last month; 0:00 - Intro ; 0:30 - Overview of Cursor vs GitHub Copilot ; 1:45 - Pricing Comparison ; 3:00 - Features Breakdown ; 5:30 - Hands-On Experience with ...AboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy & SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new featuresNFL Sunday Ticket\n\n\u00a9 2025 Google LLC","snippet":"0:00 - Intro ; 0:30 - Overview of Cursor vs GitHub Copilot ; 1:45 - Pricing Comparison ; 3:00 - Features Breakdown ; 5:30 - Hands-On Experience with ...","pub_date":null,"crawl_date":null,"pub_timestamp":1738368000.0,"crawl_timestamp":null,"ref_id":"turn0search7"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini-high","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"c9bd4899-f373-4d4e-af75-3307bccf597f","request_id":"91d8352be9b84422-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c9bd4899-f373-4d4e-af75-3307bccf597f","children":["b8744e1b-08ac-435c-91a0-2c39b15521e2"]},"b8744e1b-08ac-435c-91a0-2c39b15521e2":{"id":"b8744e1b-08ac-435c-91a0-2c39b15521e2","message":{"id":"b8744e1b-08ac-435c-91a0-2c39b15521e2","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.search","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.search"}},"create_time":1741498525.970078,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"sonic_webpage","url":"https://forum.cursor.com/t/differences-with-the-latest-copilot-updates/24429","domain":"forum.cursor.com","title":"Differences with the latest Copilot updates - Discussion - Cursor","text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  [wordlim: 200] Published: 4 months ago; With the silent updates from GitHub Copilot, Cursor seems to be just a minor upgrade now.

Cursor - Community Forum  \n\n#  Differences with the latest Copilot updates \n\n Discussion  \n\ncopilotuser  October 24, 2024, 4:56am  1\n\nWith the silent updates from GitHub Copilot, Cursor seems to be just a minor upgrade now. GitHub Coiplot is cheaper, faster, more stable, has \u2018apply to editor\u2019, workspace awareness, file references, and even includes unlimited use of gpt-4o. One thing I find useful now with cursor is its composer feature which can create an entire project from scratch but it\u2019s something you would want to use only at the start of a project unless you are not a software developer.\n\nCan someone enlighten me what else Cursor has to offer that justify its pricing?\n\ntkataja  October 24, 2024, 5:42am  2\n\nEvereone needs to decide for themselves if given features are worth given price. For example, I value Cursor Tab and the latest Sonnet integration with inline edits and basic chats easily worth 20$ per month.\n\nBut there is no single correct answer. There is competition in this space and almost non-existent lock-in so what I do is I continuously explore and use whatever is best solution for me at given time.\n\ndanieliser  October 24, 2024, 5:54am  3\n\nI just took a few minutes to try Copliot again. Been a few weeks, nothing substantially new or super useful over Cursor, in fact I immediately found a few things lacking:\n\n  1. Couldn\u2019t @Folder, picking #workspace is not very effective either\n  2. No @Web or pasting of a link to scan sites.\n  3. The tab feature has gotten a lot better at guessing, but didn\u2019t once offer to jump to another file. I mean whos gonna open the CHANGELOG.md and suggest what to add\u2026 Am I expected to do that manual work myself now psshhh Image: :rofl:\n  4. Copilot is locked to OpenAI, doesn\u2019t use Claude or other models at all. This is to its deficit. Claude Sonnet is VERY VERY good at code, actually better than o1 from my tests.\n  5. Compose can work within an existing project to build new features, but not sure what you expect given its purpose. Are you expecting it to run an entire update cycle without your input? That sounds wonderful, and when Copilot offers that I\u2019m all in (oh wait I pay for them all anyways haha).\n\nTo your point though as soon as you mentioned Copolot getting new features I jumped to VS Code to try it.\n\nI think this is a cat & mouse game for the next 5 years at least. No real clear winner will emerge any time soon, they will leap frog each other, adding new better integrations, copying the others and then inventing the next level repeating the cycle.\n\nStrap in, luckily you can literally swap back and forth between Cursor & VS Code in the same project with no issues. So my take\u2026 USE BOTH Image: :wink:\n\nCursor vs Github Copilot \n\ncopilotuser  October 24, 2024, 11:34am  4\n\nThanks. I love the sonnet integration but I wouldn\u2019t say it only cost $20 per month. I have exhausted my credits in less than a week.\n\ncopilotuser  October 24, 2024, 11:48am  5\n\nThanks for the input but I don\u2019t like the idea of paying for both which does almost the same thing. Maybe there\u2019s something I am not seeing here.\n\nI have been using Cursor for more than 2 months then switched back to Copilot only to find out that most of what was lacking before is already there. I never mentioned that there was something super useful in Copilot over Cursor. I even noted that Cursor is still, although minor, an upgrade. One more annoying thing with Copilot is that occasionally it tells me that my question is not coding related and does not want to respond.\n\nI also forgot to mention about using Claude Sonnet in Cursor. I agree this model is better at generating code on the first try but not a deal breaker for me since I verify the correctness of all the codes generated and just retry or make the necessary changes myself.\n\nThe thing I find useful in Copilot that is still not in Cursor is the ability to simply highlight the code and it would be automatically referenced when you chat. With Cursor, I have had use \u2018Add to Chat\u2019 (Ctrl+Shift+L) to include that in the discussion.\n\ndanieliser  October 24, 2024, 9:19pm  6\n\nAhh yea paying for both isn\u2019t planned. Already paid for annual Copilot seats for the entire team. So I can freely switch back and forth.\n\nI also haven\u2019t adopted Cursor for our team, only testing it myself currently.\n\nSo I\u2019m in a unique position to be able to test like that for sure.\n\n> One more annoying thing with Copilot is that occasionally it tells me that my question is not coding related and does not want to respond.\n\nHaha no limits like that here. In fact here was my prompt for Composer just earlier today. I gave it screenshots of our website, fed it the urls, gave it web access and told it to write me some hypothesis & split test ideas for each page.\n\nimage 1920\u00d71536 224 KB\n\nI recently tweeted that Cursor is not just a code editor, its more of an advanced Note Taking App with A Brain\n\nYou can put any types of files in there, even just Markdown, then feed it urls, images, CSVs, and have it do anything you need.\n\nIt has this week\n\n  * implemented multiple integrations for 3rd party WP plugins we used to show extra stats/metrics they don\u2019t offer (in less than 10 minutes with access to their files and I didn\u2019t have to look up any docs or dig into the code)\n  * generated entirely new integrations between our plugins and another\n  * written multiple marketing proposals\n  * took a simple script I had for modifying imported documentation and added step bsed routines with revision histroy & reset to any step functionality in like 20 minutes it was polished. Would have take me hours manually writing and testing.\n  * Updated python data scraping & analysis tools we built with really fun new features and some major performance improvements\n\nThose are just the major tests I was playing with, it passed on all of them, Copilot barely handles any of them without constant coaching with comments and chatting telling it things it should know from the files.\n\n> The thing I find useful in Copilot that is still not in Cursor is the ability to simply highlight the code and it would be automatically referenced when you chat.
