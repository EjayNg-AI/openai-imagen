Points that need tightening  \n\n| Issue | Why it matters | Fix |\n|-------|----------------|-----|\n| **Definition of a radical extension** | Requiring each \\(F_i\\) to be the *splitting field* of \\(x^{n_i}-A_i\\) is far stronger than necessary. One usually just adjoins a single root:  \\[F_i=F_{i-1}(u_i),\\qquad u_i^{n_i}\\in F_{i-1}.\\]  Making every step into a full splitting field forces unnecessary Galoisness and rules out some perfectly legitimate radical towers (although it does not break the final theorem). | Replace \u201csplitting field of\u201d by \u201cobtained by adjoining a root of\u201d. <br>Optionally note that one may also adjoin the corresponding primitive \\(n_i\\)-th root of unity so that each step is Galois, but this is an *extra* assumption, not part of the basic definition. |\n| **Characteristic and separability** | If \\(\\operatorname{char}F\\mid n_i\\) then \\(x^{n_i}-A_i\\) is inseparable and the usual correspondence with solvable groups breaks down. | State \u201cAssume \\(\\operatorname{char}F=0\\) (or at least does not divide any \\(n_i\\)).\u201d  Since the base field is \\(\\mathbb Q(\\ldots)\\) this is automatic, but it is good practice to say so. |\n| **Ordering and leading coefficient of the generic polynomial** | Standard references use the *monic* form  \\(x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots +a_0\\).  Allowing an arbitrary leading coefficient \\(a_n\\) is harmless\u2014one can divide by \\(a_n\\)\u2014but then \\(g\\) is no longer \u201cgeneric up to scaling\u201d. | Either (i) fix the polynomial to be monic, or (ii) say explicitly that after dividing by \\(a_n\\) one obtains the usual monic generic polynomial. |\n| **Quantifier on \\(n\\)** | Your \u201cSuppose that \\(n\\ge5\\) and \\(g(x)=\\dots\\)\u201d should stress that the irreducible *generic* polynomial of degree \\(n\\) has Galois group \\(S_n\\).  That fact is the engine driving the insolvability result. | Insert a sentence: \u201cThe splitting field of the generic degree\u2011\\(n\\) polynomial over \\(\\mathbb Q(a_0,\\dots ,a_{n-1})\\) has Galois group \\(S_n\\), which is not solvable for \\(n\\ge5\\).\u201d |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Suggested clean statement  \n\n> **Theorem (Abel\u2013Ruffini, modern formulation).**  \n> Let \\(n\\ge5\\).  Let \\(a_1,\\dots ,a_n\\) be algebraically independent over \\(\\mathbb Q\\) and set  \n> \\[\n> f_n(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots +a_0\\in \\mathbb Q(a_0,\\dots ,a_{n-1})[x].\n> \\]\n> There is **no** tower of fields  \n> \\[\n> \\mathbb Q(a_0,\\dots ,a_{n-1})=F_0\\subset F_1\\subset\\cdots\\subset F_r\n> \\]\n> with \\(F_{i}=F_{i-1}(u_i)\\) and \\(u_i^{m_i}\\in F_{i-1}\\) (and, if desired, adjoining primitive \\(m_i\\)-th roots of unity at each stage) such that \\(f_n(x)\\) splits over \\(F_r\\).  Equivalently, the general degree\u2011\\(n\\) equation is not solvable by radicals.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Why the theorem holds (sketch)  \n\n1. **Generic Galois group.**  For \\(n\\ge5\\) the Galois group of the splitting field of \\(f_n\\) over \\(\\mathbb Q(a_0,\\dots ,a_{n-1})\\) is the full symmetric group \\(S_n\\).  \n2. **Radical towers \u21d2 solvable Galois group.**  Any finite radical extension in characteristic \\(0\\) has a solvable Galois group (because each step has cyclic Galois group after adjoining roots of unity, and solvable groups are closed under extensions).  \n3. **Contradiction for \\(n\\ge5\\).**  The group \\(S_n\\) is not solvable when \\(n\\ge5\\).  Hence the splitting field of \\(f_n\\) cannot lie inside any radical extension of the base field.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Forward\u2011looking remarks  \n\n* If you plan to treat *all* solvable\u2011by\u2011radicals equations (not merely those with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb Q\\)) you should phrase the theorem over *any* field of characteristic \\(0\\) containing the required independent variables.  \n* Modern expositions often separate \u201cradical extension\u201d (may be non\u2011Galois) from \u201csolvable extension\u201d (the Galois closure is radical).  Deciding which notion you want up front helps avoid hidden hypotheses later.  \n* For applications (e.g.\\ Bring\u2013Jerrard normal forms, resolvent degree) one sometimes extends the base field by adjoining certain discriminant square roots before asking about solvability.  Clarifying that point early prevents confusion about whether one is working with \\(S_n\\) or \\(A_n\\).\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Bottom line  \n\nYour formulation captures the heart of Abel\u2013Ruffini, but it bundles in a stronger\u2011than\u2011necessary definition of \u201cradical extension\u201d and omits a couple of standard technical hypotheses.  Tweaking those items\u2014as outlined above\u2014will align your statement precisely with the version used in contemporary Galois\u2011theoretic literature."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9653af21eb546020-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"104a4854-bdf7-4c49-ac67-e5273a80dc73","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"104a4854-bdf7-4c49-ac67-e5273a80dc73","children":[]}}}
