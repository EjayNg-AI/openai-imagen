If not, calibrate toward EdTech entrepreneurship. |\n\n---\n\n### Handling Your Stated Concerns  \n\n* **Age 47** \u2013 In Singapore\u2019s tech ecosystem, programmes such as CCP and TeSA explicitly *favour* applicants \u2265\u202f40 with enhanced subsidies, making you cheaper to hire and lowering employer risk.  Emphasise maturity, pedagogy and stakeholder skills.  \n* **No formal coding credentials** \u2013 Complete at least one *recognised* bootcamp or AIAP; that label shortcuts HR filters.  \n* **Lack of non\u2011teaching breadth** \u2013 Pick portfolio problems outside education (finance, logistics) to show versatility.  \n* **Satisfaction uncertainty** \u2013 Treat Phase\u202f0\u20131 as low\u2011stakes experiments.  Track *flow\u2011state hours* each week; if coding consistently rates lower than teaching, EdTech product or analytics roles may suit better.  \n\n---\n\n### Immediate Next Steps (Next 4\u202fWeeks)\n\n1. **Register** on AI Singapore portal for AIAP Batch\u202f21 notification list (takes 5\u202fmin).  \n2. **Book** a TeSA\u2011approved one\u2011day \u201cIntro to Data Science\u201d course using your SkillsFuture credit to test waters cheaply.  \n3. **Select** a publicly available JC\u2011math dataset (e.g., A\u2011level past\u2011year question texts) and draft a *GitHub README* for an ML clustering demo.  \n4. **Join** the DataScienceSG Telegram / Slack and introduce yourself; ask for feedback on your first repo.  \n5. **Block** one weekday morning and one weekend evening for coding practice; protect these time slots like tuition classes.\n\nBy following the phased plan you keep financial safety from tutoring while systematically validating\u2014and, if promising, executing\u2014your pivot into applied AI or adjacent analytical roles.  You will also accumulate tangible artefacts (code, talks, references) that counterbalance the \u201conly\u2011ever\u2011tutor\u201d CV narrative and make age an asset rather than a liability.  Good luck, and feel free to iterate on any part of this roadmap as real\u2011world feedback comes in."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":785,"end_idx":802,"safe_urls":["https://aiap.sg/apprenticeship/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([aiap.sg](https://aiap.sg/apprenticeship/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI Apprenticeship Programme\u00ae - AIAP","url":"https://aiap.sg/apprenticeship/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"aiap.sg"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201","start_idx":929,"end_idx":946,"safe_urls":["https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/techskills-accelerator-tesa/tech-immersion-and-placement-programme-tipp"],"refs":[],"alt":"([imda.gov.sg](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/techskills-accelerator-tesa/tech-immersion-and-placement-programme-tipp))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP) | IMDA","url":"https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/techskills-accelerator-tesa/tech-immersion-and-placement-programme-tipp","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"imda.gov.sg"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":1071,"end_idx":1088,"safe_urls":["https://conversion.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/portal/ProgramDetails.aspx?ProgID=P00001802"],"refs":[],"alt":"([conversion.mycareersfuture.gov.sg](https://conversion.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/portal/ProgramDetails.aspx?ProgID=P00001802))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"\n\tCareer Conversion Programmes (CCP) Details\n","url":"https://conversion.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/portal/ProgramDetails.aspx?ProgID=P00001802","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"conversion.mycareersfuture.gov.sg"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201","start_idx":1641,"end_idx":1660,"safe_urls":["https://sg.indeed.com/q-mathematics-curriculum-jobs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([sg.indeed.com](https://sg.indeed.com/q-mathematics-curriculum-jobs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"75+ Mathematics Curriculum Jobs, Employment June 14, 2025","url":"https://sg.indeed.com/q-mathematics-curriculum-jobs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Mathematics Teacher (Singapore).

Reset & Recharge  (Month 0-2)\n\n| Element | Target | Practical tips |\n|---------|--------|----------------|\n| **Workload** | Cut tutoring hours to **\u2248 60 %** of current load (\u2248 15 contact hrs / wk). | Re-segment classes into slightly larger groups, or pause the lowest-yield students for one term. |\n| **Daily rhythm** | AM = *mind-body priming* (exercise, quiet reading); early PM = deep learning block; late PM = tutoring. | Physical change-of-scene matters: run/jog at Bishan Park, then study at NLB\u2019s Central Public Library reading pods. |\n| **Restorative habits** | - 30 min mindfulness audio (e.g., Wysa) after lunch <br>- 1 screen-free evening per week. | Burnout research shows a 1-day digital mini-fast measurably lowers stress hormones. |\n| **Micro-learning** | Enrol in one **free, truly self-paced MOOC** just to rekindle curiosity; no deliverables. | IBM Data Science Professional Cert on Coursera is 100 % asynchronous and SkillsFuture-claimable. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 |\n\n> **Checkpoint @ Week 6:** Are fatigue levels down?  If not, cut another 5 hrs of tutoring before adding study load.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structured Self-Study \u201cSprint Cycles\u201d  (Month 2-6)\n\n### 2.1 Curriculum skeleton (rolling 6-week cycles)\n\n| Week | Focus | Outcomes |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| 1-2 | **Python Production Stack** (poetry, pytest, GitHub Actions) | Build & publish a repo that auto-tests simple math-quiz functions. |\n| 3-4 | **Data Wrangling & Viz** (pandas, Altair) | Replicate a basic tuition-centre KPI dashboard. |\n| 5-6 | **ML Fundamentals** (scikit-learn, cross-validation, metrics) | Kaggle \u201cTitanic\u201d or \u201cTabular Playground\u201d submission (\u2265 top-25 %). |\n\nRepeat cycles with progressively harder content (e.g., cloud deployment, basic deep-learning) until Month 6.\n\n### 2.2 Learning resources (100 % self-paced)\n\n| Resource | Funding route | Why it fits |\n|----------|---------------|-------------|\n| Coursera subscription (NUS-curated bundle) | Pay with SkillsFuture Credit under *\u201conline subscriptions\u201d* scheme. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | Pause any month; binge-watch during lighter tutoring weeks. |\n| Free \u201cGreatLearning\u201d bite-size modules | Free, certificate on completion. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 | 2-hour concepts to fill small mental gaps. |\n| Recorded talks from DataScienceSG Meetup (YouTube) | Free | Local case studies keep content S\u2019pore-relevant. |\n\n### 2.3 Routine to avoid new burnout\n\n```\nMon / Wed / Fri  \n08:00\u201309:00  Exercise & podcast  \n09:30\u201312:00  Study block (noise-cancelled headphones)  \n12:00\u201314:00  Lunch + nap / mindfulness  \n14:00\u201318:30  Tutoring sessions  \n20:30\u201321:30  Light reading / code-review\n\nTue / Thu  \nAM same as above  \n14:00\u201317:30  Capstone project rehearsal  \n18:30\u201322:00  Tutoring or completely OFF (alternate weeks)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Exploratory Capstone + Networking  (Month 6-9)\n\n| Strand | Description | Why now |\n|--------|-------------|---------|\n| **Capstone \u201cmath-meets-ML\u201d project** | Build a *category-theoretic graph library* that explains Linear Algebra for JC students via visual proofs; demo a Streamlit app. | Translates your Ph.D. strength into a marketable demo while still aligned with teaching. |\n| **CCP / AIAP scouting** | Spend 1 hour weekly browsing Workforce Singapore\u2019s CCP listings and registering interest. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201 | By Month 9 you\u2019ll know which employers use the 90 % salary-support scheme, and can time your exit. |\n| **Public presentation** | Pitch the capstone at a DataScienceSG lightning-talk (7 min). | Validates self-study depth; forces project polish. |\n| **Mentor circle** | Reach out to two past clients now in tech for monthly coffee chats. | Creates warm references for eventual formal job switch. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Financial & Mental-health Safeguards (continuous)\n\n* **Emergency runway:** keep at least **6 months of living costs** liquid; if tutoring revenue dips, pause paid courses first.  \n* **Accountability buddy:** weekly 15-min call with a peer (can be ex-student) just to report what you coded or read.  \n* **Quarterly reflection:** journal on three axes \u2013 energy, mastery, market traction \u2013 and recalibrate study/work ratio.\n\n---\n\n### Big-Picture Timeline\n\n```mermaid\ngantt\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM\n    section Recharge\n    Lighten tutoring        :a1, 2025-06,2m\n    Mind-body routines      :a2, 2025-06,2m\n    section Self-Study Cycles\n    Python & Git            :b1, 2025-08,0.5m\n    Data wrangling & Viz    :b2, 2025-08.5,0.5m\n    ML Basics + Kaggle      :b3, 2025-09,1m\n    Repeat harder cycles    :b4, 2025-10,1m\n    section Capstone & Network\n    Build demo app          :c1, 2025-10,2m\n    Meetup talk             :c2, after c1, 0.1m\n    CCP / AIAP applications :c3, 2025-09,3m\n```\n\n*After Month 9* you decide: (i) join AIAP/CCP full-time, (ii) accept a junior DS role, or (iii) blend tutoring and a niche EdTech product if you find coding joy but prefer autonomy.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Plan Works for Burnout\n\n* Alternating **focus / rest days** mimics evidence-based \u201cultradian\u201d cycles (90-120 min deep work \u2192 recovery).  \n* No external deadlines until you feel ready \u2013 MOOCs are all asynchronous; capstone schedule is self-imposed.  \n* Keeps **social identity** intact (you still teach), avoiding the isolation many mid-career switchers report.  \n* Step-wise escalation ensures every new commitment is reversible within one cycle.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Actions (This Week)\n\n1. **Block** two mornings in your calendar as \u201cnon-negotiable learning\u201d and inform current students early.  \n2. **Log in** to SkillsFuture portal and pay for a one-month Coursera subscription with credits (cost: S$0 cash).  \n3. **Choose** one free mini-project (e.g., automate quiz-grading emails) and ship a GitHub repo in seven days \u2013 momentum matters more than scope.  \n4. **Schedule** a library morning next week \u2013 environment switch is the fastest burnout relief trick.\n\nGive yourself permission to treat the next two months as a *deliberate recovery sprint*; the structured cycles that follow will only work if your energy stores refill first. Ping me whenever you need to tweak the cadence or vet learning resources \u2013 we\u2019ll iterate together."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":1175,"end_idx":1194,"safe_urls":["https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Coursera","url":"https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"You'll learn in-demand skills used by professional data scientists including databases, data visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"coursera.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201","start_idx":2229,"end_idx":2248,"safe_urls":["https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/career-resources/career-resources/education-career-personal-development/use_SFC_for_online_subscriptions_and_courses.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([myskillsfuture.gov.sg](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/career-resources/career-resources/education-career-personal-development/use_SFC_for_online_subscriptions_and_courses.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Use Your SkillsFuture Credit for Online Subscriptions and Courses","url":"https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/career-resources/career-resources/education-career-personal-development/use_SFC_for_online_subscriptions_and_courses.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\u279c Data Analytics & Data Science. \u279c IT & Digital Transformation ...
