While ketamine is FDA-approved as an anesthetic, its hallucinogenic effects have led to off-label use by some psychiatrists. Compounded versions of ketamine, altered from their FDA-approved state, present significant risks due to lack of FDA regulation, making them potentially dangerous. There are existing risks such as increased blood pressure, urinary tract infections, and risk of abuse. While off-label use is not illegal, it is not covered by insurance and lacks sufficient clinical trials to confirm safety and effectiveness. Spravato (esketamine), an FDA-approved nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression, offers a regulated alternative but is costly and limited to certain healthcare providers. Despite ongoing research showing potential benefits of ketamine in treating depression, more evidence is needed to support its use in other psychiatric conditions. The FDA emphasizes careful administration by medical professionals for safety.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1697827496.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.verywellhealth.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/fda-expands-approval-for-spravato-nasal-spray-8781088","title":"Spravato Nasal Spray Can Now Be Used Alone for Treatment-Resistant Depression","snippet":"The FDA has extended approval of Spravato (esketamine), a nasal spray, to be used alone for adults with treatment-resistant depression. Initially approved in 2019, Spravato was previously required to be prescribed alongside an oral antidepressant. This change increases the accessibility of the treatment, particularly for patients who are adversely affected by or nonresponsive to oral antidepressants. Esketamine, derived from ketamine, is administered under healthcare supervision. Clinical trials showed significant improvement in patients' depressive symptoms, achieving remission in 22.5% of cases after four weeks compared to 7.6% with a placebo. The new approval of Spravato follows thorough safety evaluations, indicating minimal side effects. Continuous mental health support is encouraged during treatment. Spravato is the only ketamine-derived drug approved by the FDA for psychiatric conditions, with promising results in alleviating depression, PTSD, and anxiety. The field is witnessing potential advancements in antidepressant medications that target similar pathways, highlighting an evolving landscape in mental health treatment.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1738092508.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thesun.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/34878330/ketamine-addiction-peeing-every-minute-passing-clots-bladder-damage/","title":"My \u00a3300k ketamine use left me completely psychotic, seeing dead people and passing blood clots - I may never pee again","snippet":"Oliver Westall, 24, from Neath, Wales, developed a severe ketamine addiction beginning at age 15, spending over \u00a3300,000 on the drug. Initially using it to combat anxiety, his consumption escalated to 21 grams daily. This led to \"ketamine bladder syndrome,\" a condition where the bladder shrinks and deteriorates, causing intense pain, bleeding, and incontinence. By age 20, Oliver was using 10 incontinence pads daily and experienced such severe damage that his bladder now holds only 10ml. Doctors have deemed his condition irreversible, requiring bladder removal and a permanent urostomy bag.\n\nDespite multiple hospital visits, effective treatment was delayed, leading to severe physical and mental deterioration. Oliver's turning point came through Christian rehab at The Carpenter\u2019s Arms and spiritual guidance, achieving sobriety on June 17, 2024. He now advocates against ketamine abuse, shares his recovery journey on social media, and plans to start a charitable organization. Experts warn ketamine's damaging effects are often hidden, with many suffering silently. Oliver hopes his story raises awareness and encourages others to seek help before irreversible damage occurs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":55},"pub_date":1747048091.0,"attribution":"www.thesun.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fb93c5a99c8322a387e90336eb3127","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing legal status, medical uses, and safety of ketamine","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"a2686c0d-3de4-4010-a1ee-6b5bf6df3ca4","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"fa30cee1-a9ee-4903-886f-8b0f3a8ed6ec","turn_exchange_id":"c681035e-4b6c-409e-870a-e7d18a9b8c9a","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fa30cee1-a9ee-4903-886f-8b0f3a8ed6ec","children":["efe78199-2d7d-4fd2-9dc6-8057cb07d32b"]},"efe78199-2d7d-4fd2-9dc6-8057cb07d32b":{"id":"efe78199-2d7d-4fd2-9dc6-8057cb07d32b","message":{"id":"efe78199-2d7d-4fd2-9dc6-8057cb07d32b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761317835.740647,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Ensuring reliable sources","content":"I need to be cautious about using low-authority sources like Verywellhealth or The Sun\u2014they\u2019re not the most trustworthy, especially for legal details.

Presently, ketamine is a class B substance, but increased abuse, often found in synthetic drugs like \"pink cocaine,\" has prompted ministers to seek guidance from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). Ketamine, used legally as an anaesthetic and in some cases for depression, has seen misuse surge in both the UK and the US. A report by a coroner, following a ketamine-related death, urged reclassification to correct the misconception of its safety. High-profile cases, including Elon Musk's controlled use for depression and the overdose death of actor Matthew Perry, have highlighted concerns. The Home Office emphasizes responding to current evidence to ensure public safety. A change in classification could increase penalties: possession may lead to seven years in prison, with life sentences for supply and production.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1736264091.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/15b43441670757b0c2bfa36731e47d07","title":"Justice Department formally moves to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug in historic shift","snippet":"The U.S. Justice Department has proposed reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, recognizing its medical uses and lower abuse potential compared to drugs such as heroin and LSD. The proposal, approved by Attorney General Merrick Garland, follows a suggestion from the Health and Human Services Department, prompted by President Joe Biden. While this change does not legalize recreational marijuana use, it signifies a major shift in U.S. drug policy. The proposed rule will undergo a public comment period and potentially lengthy review process. This move, supported by some lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and industry groups like the U.S. Cannabis Council, could also boost President Biden's support, particularly among younger voters. However, some critics argue that rescheduling is driven by politics rather than science. The immediate impact on the criminal justice system may be minimal, though federal regulation changes might lighten the tax burden on marijuana businesses and facilitate research. Currently, 38 states have legalized medical marijuana, and 24 have legalized its recreational use.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1715878843.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/c00db5dabbeb9efd94cf17baff241e85","title":"Marijuana recommendation by US health agency hailed as first step to easing weed restrictions","snippet":"O Departamento de Sa\u00fade e Servi\u00e7os Humanos dos EUA enviou uma recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Administra\u00e7\u00e3o para Controle de Drogas (DEA) sobre a pol\u00edtica de marijuana, considerada um primeiro passo para aliviar as restri\u00e7\u00f5es federais \u00e0 droga.

In 2023, 299,000 people aged 16-59 reported using ketamine in England and Wales, and its usage has shifted from parties to home environments, increasing the risk of dependency. Experts highlight the need for mental health services to address underlying issues driving this trend. Despite the potential reclassification, past upgrades of ketamine's legal status did not curb its use. The rise in treatment admissions for ketamine problems and growing concerns over long-term health issues, such as bladder and kidney damage, emphasize the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to tackling ketamine addiction.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1736760739.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.verywellhealth.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/fda-expands-approval-for-spravato-nasal-spray-8781088","title":"Spravato Nasal Spray Can Now Be Used Alone for Treatment-Resistant Depression","snippet":"The FDA has extended approval of Spravato (esketamine), a nasal spray, to be used alone for adults with treatment-resistant depression. Initially approved in 2019, Spravato was previously required to be prescribed alongside an oral antidepressant. This change increases the accessibility of the treatment, particularly for patients who are adversely affected by or nonresponsive to oral antidepressants. Esketamine, derived from ketamine, is administered under healthcare supervision. Clinical trials showed significant improvement in patients' depressive symptoms, achieving remission in 22.5% of cases after four weeks compared to 7.6% with a placebo. The new approval of Spravato follows thorough safety evaluations, indicating minimal side effects. Continuous mental health support is encouraged during treatment. Spravato is the only ketamine-derived drug approved by the FDA for psychiatric conditions, with promising results in alleviating depression, PTSD, and anxiety. The field is witnessing potential advancements in antidepressant medications that target similar pathways, highlighting an evolving landscape in mental health treatment.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1738092508.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.health.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.health.com/ketamine-not-fda-approved-psychiatric-disorders-8363091","title":"FDA Alert: Ketamine Is Not Approved For the Treatment of Any Psychiatric Disorder","snippet":"The FDA issued a recent alert clarifying that ketamine is not approved for the treatment of any psychiatric disorders, including depression. While ketamine is FDA-approved as an anesthetic, its hallucinogenic effects have led to off-label use by some psychiatrists. Compounded versions of ketamine, altered from their FDA-approved state, present significant risks due to lack of FDA regulation, making them potentially dangerous. There are existing risks such as increased blood pressure, urinary tract infections, and risk of abuse. While off-label use is not illegal, it is not covered by insurance and lacks sufficient clinical trials to confirm safety and effectiveness. Spravato (esketamine), an FDA-approved nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression, offers a regulated alternative but is costly and limited to certain healthcare providers. Despite ongoing research showing potential benefits of ketamine in treating depression, more evidence is needed to support its use in other psychiatric conditions. The FDA emphasizes careful administration by medical professionals for safety.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1697827496.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fb93c5a99c8322a387e90336eb3127","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for ketamine depression reviews and safety data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"a2686c0d-3de4-4010-a1ee-6b5bf6df3ca4","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"60dca507-2ccc-4e89-b6b7-f89bba3903f2","turn_exchange_id":"c681035e-4b6c-409e-870a-e7d18a9b8c9a","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"60dca507-2ccc-4e89-b6b7-f89bba3903f2","children":["4e652db1-64b8-43c2-b55a-5453a7abd049"]},"4e652db1-64b8-43c2-b55a-5453a7abd049":{"id":"4e652db1-64b8-43c2-b55a-5453a7abd049","message":{"id":"4e652db1-64b8-43c2-b55a-5453a7abd049","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761317852.065625,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying clinical uses and FDA approval","content":"I don't need to worry about news widgets; I should focus on concise sections covering legality, clinical uses, evidence, risks, and a bottom-line summary.

a clear, no-nonsense pass on ketamine\u2014what it is, where it\u2019s legal, what it does to the body, and which benefits actually have evidence behind them.\n\n# What it is (pharmacology, in one line)\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic that blocks NMDA receptors; at sub-anesthetic doses it produces rapid (hours\u2013days) psychoactive effects including dissociation and short-lived antidepressant effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n# Legality & regulation (selected jurisdictions; not exhaustive)\n\n- **United States.** Ketamine is a **Schedule III** controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (non-narcotic, medical use allowed; misuse penalized). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue201  \n  The only FDA-approved psychiatric product is **esketamine** nasal spray (brand: *SPRAVATO*), subject to a REMS program with mandatory in-clinic administration and \u22652-hour observation. As of **January 2025**, esketamine is approved for **treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as monotherapy or with an oral antidepressant**, and for **depressive symptoms with acute suicidal ideation/behavior (with an oral antidepressant)**\u2014with an explicit label note that prevention of suicide or reduction of suicidal behavior is **not demonstrated**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue201\n\n- **United Kingdom.** Ketamine is controlled as a **Class B** drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act; supply/production can carry up to 14 years in prison. The Home Office asked the ACMD in **Jan 2025** to review possible **reclassification to Class A** in response to rising misuse (proposal under consideration). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n- **Australia.** Scheduled as a **Schedule 8 (S8) controlled drug** nationwide (state implementation varies); NSW lists ketamine explicitly in the S8 table. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201\n\n- **Canada.** Controlled under **Schedule I** of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; possession/sale/production are illegal without authorization for medical/scientific use. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\n- **Singapore (your jurisdiction).** **Illegal to possess, consume, traffic, import or export without authorization.** Penalties are severe: possession can carry up to **10 years\u2019 imprisonment or S$20,000 fine (or both)**; consumption carries mandatory imprisonment; trafficking penalties escalate with quantity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n- **International treaties.** Ketamine is **not scheduled under the UN drug control conventions**; WHO\u2019s Expert Committee (2016) recommended **not** placing it under international control to preserve access to anesthesia, though many countries regulate it nationally. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search10\ue202turn6search6\ue201\n\n# What\u2019s actually approved/standard in medicine\n\n- **Anesthesia & procedural sedation.** Longstanding human/veterinary anesthetic use. Cardiovascularly stimulating; preserves airway reflexes better than many agents, but still requires full peri-procedural monitoring. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue201\n\n- **Depression.**\n  - **Esketamine (FDA).** As above: TRD (now including **monotherapy**) and **depressive symptoms with acute suicidal ideation/behavior** (with an oral antidepressant), **administered under REMS with 2-hour monitoring** for blood-pressure spikes, sedation, dissociation, and respiratory depression. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue201\n  - **IV racemic ketamine** for depression is **off-label** in the U.S.; clinics exist, but quality varies. The **FDA has warned (2022, 2023)** about **compounded** ketamine products (e.g., troches/lozenges/nasal sprays prepared by compounding pharmacies) for psychiatric use because they are **not FDA-approved**, have **uncertain potency/quality**, and pose risks of **abuse, hypertension, and serious adverse events**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n- **Pain.**\n  - **Acute pain (ED/trauma).** Sub-dissociative IV ketamine (\u22480.1\u20130.3 mg/kg) can provide **short-term analgesia** comparable to opioids, with more psychoperceptual side-effects; benefits beyond 24\u201348h are limited. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search5\ue202turn7search1\ue201\n  - **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).** IV infusion protocols can reduce pain for weeks in some patients, but the overall evidence quality is **low\u2013moderate** and responses are variable; protocols require specialist monitoring. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search12\ue201\n\n# What the evidence says (psychiatry)\n\n- **Antidepressant effect (acute).** Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show **rapid reductions** in depressive symptom scores within **hours to a few days** after ketamine/esketamine; effects tend to **wane over 1\u20132 weeks** without maintenance. Some analyses find **numerically larger** effects for racemic ketamine vs esketamine, but head-to-head evidence is limited. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201\n\n- **Maintenance & durability.** Real-world and RCT extension data suggest many responders **require ongoing dosing** (weekly to every 2\u20134 weeks) to maintain benefit; evidence is growing but heterogeneous. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search8\ue201\n\n- **Suicide-related outcomes.** Labels and reviews emphasize that **reduced ideation** does **not** equal proven reduction in **suicide attempts or deaths**; the **esketamine** label explicitly says **effectiveness in preventing suicide has not been demonstrated**. Recent commentary in *AJP* reaches the same conclusion. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n- **Other indications (PTSD, anxiety, substance disorders, dementia-related agitation, bipolar depression).** Early signals exist, but **evidence remains limited or mixed**; these uses should be regarded as **experimental**. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search11\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\n# Risks & adverse effects (what the body sees)\n\n- **Acute (dose-related, usually transient):**\n  - **Dissociation, perceptual disturbance, sedation**; **impaired driving/judgment** after dosing (hence clinic monitoring). **Respiratory depression** is uncommon at sub-anesthetic doses but has occurred post-marketing. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n  - **Cardiovascular stimulation:** **BP and HR increase**; rare severe events reported, esp. in patients with cardiac disease or on stimulants/MAOIs\u2014labels require **BP checks ~40 min post-dose and \u22652 h observation**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n  - **Nausea/vomiting, dizziness, anxiety or agitation.** \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n- **Urological toxicity (with repeated/chronic exposure):** **Ketamine cystitis/uro-pathy**\u2014frequency/urgency, severe pain, hematuria, **contracted bladder**, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis; **can be irreversible** if use continues. Cases are common in heavy recreational use and have been reported with therapeutic exposure; symptoms generally improve after cessation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn3search18\ue201\n\n- **Hepatic injury:** **Drug-induced liver injury and sclerosing cholangitis** have been reported with prolonged or repeated infusions; emerging 2024\u20132025 case series highlight the risk and the need to monitor LFTs during courses. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search10\ue202turn5search8\ue202turn5search16\ue201\n\n- **Neurocognitive effects:** Short-term cognitive slowing around the dosing window is expected; long-term cognitive/memory impairment is **reported** with repeated ketamine exposure (label warning), though some depression cohorts report **improved cognitive measures** paralleling mood improvements\u2014i.e., signal is mixed and likely dose/exposure-dependent. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn3search19\ue201\n\n- **Abuse, misuse, dependence:** The **FDA boxed warning** and DEA materials flag **abuse/misuse potential**; tolerance and psychological dependence can develop. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn1search12\ue201\n\n- **Drug interactions (practical):** Additive **sedation** with CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol); **BP spikes** with **stimulants** or **MAOIs**\u2014hence the label\u2019s specific cautions. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n# Bottom line (evidence-weighted)\n\n- **Scientifically grounded benefits:**  \n  - **Yes** for **rapid antidepressant effect** in TRD, now with a regulated, on-label **esketamine** option (**monotherapy allowed per 2025 label**) under strict monitoring. Expect **hours\u2013days onset**, **weeks-scale durability**, and likely **maintenance dosing** if continued benefit is needed. **Not proven** to reduce suicide attempts/deaths. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \n  - **Short-term analgesia** in acute settings is supported; **CRPS** evidence is promising for some but overall **low\u2013moderate quality** and specialist-dependent. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search5\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n- **Risks you shouldn\u2019t hand-wave:** **Hypertension/tachycardia during dosing**, **dissociation/sedation**, **urotoxicity** (with repeated/chronic use), **possible hepatotoxicity** with prolonged or repeated courses, and **misuse potential**. These are the main reasons for **REMS** supervision where approved. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn3search18\ue202turn5search8\ue201\n\n- **Legality caveat for Singapore:** Non-medical possession/consumption/trafficking is **a serious criminal offense** with **mandatory or long custodial penalties**. If you\u2019re in Singapore, **do not** handle or use ketamine outside tightly controlled medical care. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can contrast **IV racemic ketamine** vs **esketamine** (practicalities, dose, kinetics, cost, and clinic protocols), or outline a **risk-mitigation checklist** clinicians actually use (screening, BP thresholds, urology/liver monitoring, consent language)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201","start_idx":403,"end_idx":420,"safe_urls":["https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/211243s016lbl.pdf"],"refs":[],"alt":"([FDA Access Data](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/211243s016lbl.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"SPRAVATO","url":"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/211243s016lbl.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"FDA Access Data"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue201","start_idx":652,"end_idx":672,"safe_urls":["https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/ketamine.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([deadiversion.usdoj.gov](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/ketamine.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"KETAMINE (Trade Names: Ketalar, Ketaset, Ketajet, ...","url":"https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/ketamine.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1742824360.0,"snippet":"Control Status: Ketamine is controlled in schedule III of the Controlled.
