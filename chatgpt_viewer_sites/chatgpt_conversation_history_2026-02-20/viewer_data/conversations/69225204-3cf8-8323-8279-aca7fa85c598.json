Everyone has their **own** OpenAI API account, _or_  \n  2. You create an **API organization + project** and invite them as members, so their keys bill to you.\n\nI\u2019ll lay out the options and what\u2019s actually \u201ceasiest\u201d in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What you should *not* do\n\nTwo things are explicitly disallowed:\n\n1. **Sharing your API key**  \n   OpenAI\u2019s security docs say your API key is intended only for you, and that sharing keys is against the Terms of Use.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n   They repeat elsewhere that users are not permitted to share their API keys with others, including via \u201cbring your own key\u201d schemes.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\n2. **Sharing your OpenAI account**  \n   Their account sharing policy says your account is meant only for you; if someone else needs access, they should sign up for their own account.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \n\nSo: no giving them your key, no letting them log in as you, even if they\u2019re trusted friends.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Easiest if you don\u2019t care who pays: **everyone gets their own API account**\n\n**What it looks like**\n\n- Each friend:\n  - Creates their own account at platform.openai.com.\n  - Adds their own billing method and sets their own usage limits.\n  - Creates an API key under their own account.\n\nThis is simplest technically and legally: OpenAI\u2019s systems are built around one person \u2194 one account \u2194 one key, and the docs assume this.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n\n**Pros**\n\n- Zero operational work for you.\n- Cleanest alignment with Terms of Service (ToS = Terms of Service).\n- Everyone controls their own costs and keys.\n\n**Cons**\n\n- You cannot \u201csponsor\u201d usage unless you do something like reimburse them manually.\n- Harder to centralise cost control or usage monitoring.\n\nIf your main goal is just to let friends play with the Application Programming Interface (API) and they\u2019re okay attaching a card, this is the lowest-friction, lowest-risk approach.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Easiest if **you** want to pay: API **organization + project + members**\n\nIf you want your card to be charged while friends get their own keys, use OpenAI\u2019s organization and project system. This is exactly what it\u2019s designed for.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\n### High-level idea\n\n- You are the **organization owner** on the API platform.\n- You create a **project** (for example \u201cFriends Sandbox\u201d).\n- You invite friends as **members** of your organization and add them to that project.\n- Each friend generates **their own project-scoped key**, but all usage bills back to your org.\n\n### Step-by-step\n\n1. **Ensure you\u2019re on the API platform, not just ChatGPT**\n   - Go to the API dashboard (platform.openai.com), log in.\n   - You\u2019ll see org / project controls there.\n\n2. **Create or confirm your organization**\n   - In the sidebar under **Settings \u2192 Members** you\u2019ll see your API organization. From there you can invite people.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n\n3. **Create a dedicated project**\n   - Go to **Projects** in the API dashboard and create a new project, e.g. `friends-sandbox`.  \n   - As org owner, you\u2019re automatically an owner of that project.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\n4. **Invite your friends as org members**\n   - Under **Settings \u2192 Members**, invite each friend by email as a **Reader** (they can use the API but not touch billing or rate limits).\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n\n5. **Add them to the project**\n   - Open **Settings \u2192 [your project] \u2192 Members**.\n   - Add your friends as **Members** on that project. Project members can make API calls and create keys for that project.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\n6. **They generate their own keys**\n   - Each friend logs into their own OpenAI account.\n   - Selects your organization and that specific project.\n   - Goes to **API Keys** for that project and creates a key. This key is _scoped_ to the project, not to your entire org.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\n7. **You control budget and model access**\n   - In **Settings \u2192 [project] \u2192 Limits**, you can:\n     - Set a monthly budget for the project.\n     - Configure which models are allowed.\n   - In **Usage**, you can see how much they\u2019re consuming.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\n**Why this is \u201ceasiest\u201d if you\u2019re footing the bill**\n\n- No Terms-of-Service violations: they never see your key; they just have their own project keys under your org.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- Fine-grained control: per-project budgets / rate limits, and you can revoke a member or key any time.\n- Everyone can just use the normal OpenAI SDKs and environment variable pattern (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) with their project key.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Alternative: build a tiny **proxy API** for your friends\n\nThis is more work, but sometimes nicer if:\n\n- You want a **single, opinionated interface** (e.g. only a `/chat` endpoint with limited options).\n- You want to **enforce your own quotas**, logging, or guardrails on their traffic.\n- You want them to use the system without learning the OpenAI API directly.\n\n**What it is**\n\n- You run a small backend service (say a Python FastAPI or Flask app).\n- That backend has **your** API key stored securely as an environment variable or service-account key for a project.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n- Your friends call your backend, not OpenAI directly.\n- Your backend forwards their request to OpenAI\u2019s API and returns the result.\n\nThis is essentially how any Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product built on the API works. The crucial part is that your key never leaves the server.\n\n**Pros**\n\n- Maximum control: you can throttle, log, filter prompts, enforce model choices, etc.\n- Friends don\u2019t need their own OpenAI accounts at all.\n- You can hide complexity (e.g. always call `gpt-4.1` with some system prompt, etc.).\n\n**Cons**\n\n- You now own uptime, security, and abuse-prevention.\n- It is strictly more work than just using org members and project keys.\n- You must make sure your friends\u2019 usage still complies with OpenAI\u2019s usage policies, because you\u2019re the customer of record.\n\nGiven your background, setting up a minimal proxy is not hard, but it\u2019s overkill if the goal is just \u201clet them hack around with the raw API\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Which path would I pick?\n\nFor a **small, trusted, technical group**:\n\n- If you **do not care about paying for them individually**:  \n  \u2192 **Organization + project + members** is the sweet spot. It\u2019s as close to \u201cshared API access\u201d as OpenAI formally supports, with very little friction once it\u2019s set up.\n\n- If you want **zero admin work** and everyone is happy to self-fund:  \n  \u2192 Just have them create their **own API accounts** and keys.\n\n- If you eventually want a **custom playground or shared app**:  \n  \u2192 Start with **organization + project** anyway, and later hang a small proxy or web app off a project service-account key.\n\nIf you tell me roughly what your friends are trying to do (pure experimentation vs. building small apps vs. heavier use), I can sketch a concrete setup (including sample Python code) that keeps you inside OpenAI\u2019s rules while staying as low-effort as possible."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201","start_idx":600,"end_idx":619,"safe_urls":["https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety","https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Best Practices for API Key Safety","url":"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1.

Big-picture architecture\n\nThink of this as a tiny, single-purpose \u201cmodel gateway\u201d:\n\n**Clients (friends, browser, scripts) \u2192 Your Infographic API \u2192 Model providers**\n\n- **Front-end / clients**\n  - Could be:\n    - A small web app (teachers click \u201cGenerate infographic on Cauchy\u2013Schwarz\u201d).\n    - Or their own scripts hitting your HTTP endpoint.\n- **Your backend service** (FastAPI / Flask / Express / whatever):\n  - Exposes a **single high-level endpoint**, e.g. `POST /infographics`.\n  - Authenticates the caller with a **friend key** you generate.\n  - Calls:\n    - OpenAI\u2019s Large Language Model (LLM) via the Responses API to produce a **structured infographic spec** (JSON).\ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n    - One of several **image providers** (OpenAI, Stability, etc.) behind a simple adapter interface.\n  - Returns **JSON describing the whole infographic**, plus image URLs / base64.\n- **Model providers**\n  - OpenAI for text (and optionally for images, via the Responses API\u2019s image tools).\ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n  - Optional: Stability, DALL\u00b7E via another provider, local SD, etc., each wrapped in a small adapter.\n\nYour friends never see any provider keys; they only see *your* friend token for your app.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Define the infographic as a structured object\n\nFirst, make the LLM produce a **schema**, not free-form prose.\n\nExample **infographic spec** (simplified):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Cauchy\u2013Schwarz Inequality\",\n  \"level\": \"JC2\",\n  \"learning_objectives\": [\n    \"State the inequality in R^n\",\n    \"Apply it to bound dot products\",\n    \"Interpret it geometrically via angles\"\n  ],\n  \"sections\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"statement\",\n      \"heading\": \"The Inequality\",\n      \"body\": \"For vectors u, v in R^n, we have ...\",\n      \"visual\": {\n        \"type\": \"formula-highlight\",\n        \"latex\": \"\\\\lvert\\\\langle u,v\\\\rangle\\\\rvert \\\\leq \\\\|u\\\\|\\\\,\\\\|v\\\\|\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"geometry\",\n      \"heading\": \"Geometric Picture\",\n      \"body\": \"Think of the angle between vectors u and v...\",\n      \"visual\": {\n        \"type\": \"diagram\",\n        \"prompt\": \"Two arrows in the plane from a common origin forming an angle \u03b8, annotated with cos\u03b8 and lengths ||u|| and ||v||\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can enforce this shape using OpenAI\u2019s **Structured Outputs** (JSON Schema) so the model *must* return valid JSON matching your spec.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\nThat gives you a clean contract:\n\n- Text model: \u201cGiven (topic, level, objectives), output `InfographicSpec` JSON\u201d.\n- Image layer: \u201cFor each `visual` with a `prompt`, generate an image and attach URL/base64\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Minimal backend design (FastAPI + OpenAI)\n\nAssume:\n\n- You use Python + FastAPI.\n- You use the official OpenAI Python client and the Responses API.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n### 3.1. Core idea\n\n- Environment variables hold **provider secrets**:\n  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n  - `STABILITY_API_KEY` (if you use them), etc.\n- A small in-memory or SQLite table maps **friend keys \u2192 user names / quotas**.\n- Endpoint `POST /infographics`:\n  1. Checks `X-Friend-Key`.\n  2. Calls OpenAI Responses API to generate `InfographicSpec` as JSON.\n  3. If `generate_images=true`, calls selected image provider adapter.\n  4. Returns JSON spec (now with `image_url` fields).\n\n### 3.2.

Plug-in image providers (any vendor)\n\nMake the image piece an **adapter interface**. For example:\n\n```python\nasync def attach_images(spec: dict, provider: str) -> dict:\n    for section in spec.get(\"sections\", []):\n        visual = section.get(\"visual\")\n        if not visual or \"prompt\" not in visual:\n            continue\n\n        prompt = visual[\"prompt\"]\n\n        if provider == \"openai\":\n            url = await generate_image_openai(prompt)\n        elif provider == \"stability\":\n            url = await generate_image_stability(prompt)\n        else:\n            url = None\n\n        if url:\n            visual[\"image_url\"] = url\n\n    return spec\n```\n\nEach `generate_image_*` function wraps the vendor-specific call and returns either a URL (if you upload to object storage) or a data URL / base64.\n\n- **OpenAI option**  \n  OpenAI now supports images via the Responses API: you send a text request plus an image tool invocation and get back image bytes or base64.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n  You can then:\n  - Write the bytes to S3 / Cloudflare R2 / etc.\n  - Return the resulting URL in `image_url`.\n\n- **Other providers**  \n  Stability, etc., all have plain HTTP JSON or REST interfaces; your adapter just needs to:\n  - Take `(prompt, style, size)` as inputs.\n  - Return a URL or base64 string as output.\n  - Hide all of the provider-specific authentication/parameters from your callers.\n\nYour **front-end** (or your friends\u2019 scripts) just sees a nice neutral shape:\n\n```json\n\"visual\": {\n  \"type\": \"diagram\",\n  \"prompt\": \"...\",\n  \"image_url\": \"https://your-cdn/abc123.png\"\n}\n```\n\nSo you can swap providers without anyone upstream caring.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Light-weight auth + usage for your friends\n\nYou don\u2019t need OAuth if this is a small trusted group.\n\n### Friend authentication\n\n- Generate one random **friend key** per person, e.g. `friend_alice_123`.\n- Store hashed versions in a small database table with:\n  - `friend_id`\n  - `hashed_key`\n  - `daily_quota_tokens` or `daily_quota_cost`\n  - `used_today`\n- Require `X-Friend-Key` (or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`) on every request.\n- If the hash doesn\u2019t match, return HTTP 401.\n\nOpenAI has docs about **API key safety and production best practices** that you can mirror for your own friend keys (rotation, scoping, monitoring).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n\n### Minimal quota\n\nFor a small group, a crude but effective approach:\n\n- Every time you call OpenAI, read `response.usage` to get token counts (or use your own estimator).\n- Track approximate cost per friend per day.\n- Reject further requests if above some threshold; return a friendly error.\n\nYou can refine this later; for trusted friends, a simple \u201cplease don\u2019t hammer it\u201d plus soft quota is usually enough.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Front-end options\n\nYou have two main modes:\n\n1. **Web-only app for teachers**\n   - Build a small front-end (React / Next.js / Svelte) that:\n     - Lets a teacher pick module + level.\n     - Calls `POST /infographics` with their friend key stored in `localStorage`.\n     - Renders the infographic: headings, text blocks, images, export to PDF/SVG.\n   - Your friends never see any API at all; they just see a GUI.\n\n2. **API for hacker friends**\n   - Give them the endpoint and a friend key:\n     - `POST https://yourapp.xyz/infographics`\n     - Header: `X-Friend-Key: friend_alice_123`\n   - They can script around it in Python / JS or build their own front-ends.\n\nYou can support both from the same backend.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Why this fits your \u201cproxy\u201d goal cleanly\n\n- **Your keys stay on the server** (environment variables / secrets store only).\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- Friends get a *controlled* \u201cApplication Programming Interface (API)\u201d that encodes an educational abstraction (\u201ccreate infographic on X for level Y\u201d), not raw model access.\n- You can:\n  - Swap models (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` \u2192 `gpt-5.1`) with no client changes.\ue200cite\ue202turn2search9\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n  - Swap image providers without client changes.\n  - Enforce safety / content rules centrally.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, next step I can:\n\n- Flesh out the **JSON Schema** for `InfographicSpec` to handle things like multiple panels, colour palettes, and export hints.\n- Or give you a **full FastAPI app** (including requirements, basic logging, and a toy in-memory quota tracker) that you can drop onto something like Fly.io / Render and start sharing with your friends."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search5\ue201","start_idx":1120,"end_idx":1152,"safe_urls":["https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/examples","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/examples?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text","https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Text generation - OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Models can generate almost any kind of text response\u2014like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Decide what you actually need\n\nYour use-case:\n\n- Small group of known users (friends/teachers).\n- You control the backend and want to protect:\n  - The web UI, and\n  - The backend endpoints that call OpenAI / image providers.\n\nYou **don\u2019t** need:\n\n- Social login, complicated OAuth flows, or multi-tenant complexity (yet).\n\nSo the sweet spot is:\n\n- **Cookie-based session auth** for the website.\n- Optional **personal access tokens** for people who want to script against your API.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Super-simple option (good for early prototyping)\n\nIf you just want to gate the entire site for a handful of people, and robustness > UX:\n\n1. Put the whole app behind a reverse proxy that does **access control**:\n   - Example: Cloudflare Access, Tailscale Funnel, or even plain HTTP basic auth via Nginx / Caddy.\n2. Configure it so only people with your chosen identity (e.g. specific Google accounts) can reach the site.\n\nPros:\n\n- You write **zero** auth code.\n- Very robust and battle-tested.\n- Works great for a small internal tool.\n\nCons:\n\n- Harder to have per-user quotas, roles, or in-app settings later.\n- Less fine-grained integration with your app logic.\n\nIf you see this as something that might grow into a \u201creal\u201d app, I\u2019d use this only as a phase-0.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Recommended: simple email+password with session cookies\n\n### 3.1. Data model\n\nCreate a `users` table:\n\n- `id` (integer / UUID)\n- `email` (unique)\n- `password_hash` (string, Argon2 or bcrypt hash)\n- `role` (e.g. `\"admin\"`, `\"teacher\"`, `\"friend\"`)\n- `created_at`\n- `last_login_at`\n\nOptionally:\n\n- `is_active` boolean (you can disable an account later).\n- `api_token_hash` (if you want one personal token per user).\n\nYou **never** store plaintext passwords or plaintext tokens.\n\n### 3.2. Password hashing\n\nUse a real password hashing algorithm, not SHA-256:\n\n- **Argon2** (memory-hard, modern choice) or\n- **bcrypt** (widely deployed, acceptable).\n\nLibraries:\n\n- Python: `argon2-cffi` or `passlib[bcrypt]`.\n- Node: `argon2` or `bcrypt`.\n\nPattern:\n\n```python\nfrom argon2 import PasswordHasher\n\nph = PasswordHasher()\n\ndef hash_password(plain: str) -> str:\n    return ph.hash(plain)\n\ndef verify_password(plain: str, hashed: str) -> bool:\n    try:\n        ph.verify(hashed, plain)\n        return True\n    except Exception:\n        return False\n```\n\n### 3.3. Session design\n\nUse **server-side sessions** with an opaque ID, not home-rolled crypto.\n\n- When user logs in successfully:\n  - Generate a random `session_id` (e.g. 32 bytes of cryptographically secure randomness, hex-encoded).\n  - Store it in a `sessions` table:\n\n    - `session_id`\n    - `user_id`\n    - `expires_at`\n    - `created_at`\n    - `last_seen_at`\n    - maybe `ip` and `user_agent` for debugging.\n\n  - Set a cookie:\n\n    ```http\n    Set-Cookie: sid=<session_id>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/; Max-Age=604800\n    ```\n\n    where:\n    - `HttpOnly` stops JavaScript from reading it (mitigates XSS damage).\n    - `Secure` ensures it only goes over HTTPS.\n    - `SameSite=Lax` reduces Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) risk.\n    - `Max-Age` = 1 week (for example).\n\n- On each request:\n  - Read `sid` cookie.\n  - Look up `session_id` in DB.\n  - If found, non-expired, and user is active \u2192 attach `current_user` to the request context.\n  - Else \u2192 treat as unauthenticated (HTTP 401) and redirect to login page for browser requests.\n\nThe website then simply checks \u201cis `current_user` present?\u201d for pages / endpoints.\n\nThis is simple, robust, and doesn\u2019t require understanding JSON Web Tokens yet.\n\n> JSON Web Token (JWT) is a signed JSON object used as a bearer token to represent identity/claims. You *can* use JWTs instead of server-side sessions, but for your scale, server sessions are simpler and easier to rotate/revoke centrally.\n\n### 3.4. Login flow (FastAPI-ish sketch)\n\nAssume you have a `/login` HTML page that POSTs `email` and `password` to `/api/login`.\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Response\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nimport secrets, datetime as dt\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\nclass LoginForm(BaseModel):\n    email: str\n    password: str\n\nSESSION_LIFETIME = dt.timedelta(days=7)\n\ndef create_session(user_id: int) -> str:\n    sid = secrets.token_hex(32)\n    expires_at = dt.datetime.utcnow() + SESSION_LIFETIME\n    # insert into sessions table\n    # sessions.insert({\"session_id\": sid, \"user_id\": user_id, \"expires_at\": expires_at, ...})\n    return sid\n\n@app.post(\"/api/login\")\nasync def login(form: LoginForm, response: Response):\n    # 1. Look up user\n    user = get_user_by_email(form.email)  # your DB call\n    if not user or not verify_password(form.password, user.password_hash):\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid credentials\")\n\n    if not user.is_active:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=\"Account disabled\")\n\n    # 2. Create session\n    sid = create_session(user.id)\n\n    # 3. Set cookie\n    response.set_cookie(\n        key=\"sid\",\n        value=sid,\n        httponly=True,\n        secure=True,\n        samesite=\"lax\",\n        max_age=int(SESSION_LIFETIME.total_seconds()),\n        path=\"/\",\n    )\n\n    return {\"ok\": True}\n```\n\nThen for protected routes, you define a dependency:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import Request\n\nasync def get_current_user(request: Request):\n    sid = request.cookies.get(\"sid\")\n    if not sid:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Not logged in\")\n\n    session = get_session(sid)  # DB lookup\n    if not session or session.expires_at < dt.datetime.utcnow():\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Session expired\")\n\n    user = get_user(session.user_id)\n    if not user or not user.is_active:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid session owner\")\n\n    # Optionally update last_seen_at here\n    return user\n\n@app.get(\"/api/me\")\nasync def me(current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):\n    return {\"id\": current_user.id, \"email\": current_user.email}\n```\n\nThis same `get_current_user` is then used on `/api/infographics` so only logged-in users can generate infographics.\n\n### 3.5. CSRF protection\n\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where another site tricks the browser into sending authenticated requests to your site.\n\nIf:\n\n- You use `SameSite=Lax` cookies.\n- Your API only accepts JSON `POST` requests from your own front-end, and\n- You don\u2019t allow form posts without CSRF tokens.\n\n\u2026then you\u2019re already in decent shape.\n\nMore robust pattern (if you want):\n\n- On login, send back a random CSRF token (e.g. in JSON or as a non-`HttpOnly` cookie).\n- The front-end includes that token in a custom header, e.g. `X-CSRF-Token`, on each state-changing request.\n- Backend checks \u201csession + CSRF token\u201d pair.\n\nFor a small trusted user base and a single front-end origin, I\u2019d start with:\n\n- `SameSite=Lax`.\n- No cookie usage from other domains.\n\nAnd only add CSRF tokens when you expose more complex forms.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Add \u201cfriend keys\u201d as personal access tokens (optional but nice)\n\nFor your earlier proxy design, it\u2019s useful to issue **personal access tokens** so your friends can call the API from Python notebooks / scripts.\n\nDesign:\n\n- Add table `api_tokens`:\n\n  - `id`\n  - `user_id`\n  - `token_hash` (hash of the actual token string)\n  - `label` (e.g. \u201chome laptop\u201d)\n  - `created_at`\n  - `last_used_at`\n  - `revoked` boolean\n  - `expires_at` (optional)\n\n- In UI, under \u201cSettings \u2192 API Access\u201d:\n  - User clicks \u201cCreate new token\u201d.\n  - Backend generates a random string, e.g. `tok_` + `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`.\n  - Store **only a hash** of it in DB (same principle as passwords).\n  - Show the token **once** to the user; tell them to copy it.\n\n- For API calls from scripts:\n  - Users pass `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-Friend-Key: <token>`.\n  - Backend hashes the presented token, looks it up in `api_tokens`, and maps to a user.\n\nThen your `get_current_user` becomes:\n\n- If there\u2019s a session cookie, use it.\n- Else if there is an `Authorization` header with a valid token, treat that as authenticated.\n- Else 401.\n\nThis splits:\n\n- **Website UX** \u2192 cookie sessions.\n- **Programmatic access** \u2192 bearer tokens.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Where this leaves you\n\nWith this setup you get:\n\n- **Simple conceptual model**:\n  - Email+password login \u2192 session cookie \u2192 website access.\n  - Optional personal token \u2192 API access from scripts.\n- **Robustness**:\n  - Strong password hashing (Argon2/bcrypt).\n  - No secrets in localStorage or JS.\n  - All trust anchored on server-side session and token tables.\n- **Extensibility**:\n  - Easy to add roles (`role=\"teacher\"` vs `role=\"student\"`).\n  - Easy to enforce quotas per user.\n  - Easy to plug into your existing \u201cinfographic proxy\u201d endpoints.\n\nIf you tell me your tech stack for the front-end (Next.js, plain React, HTMX, etc.), I can sketch the exact login + \u201ccall /infographics with cookie\u201d code path so you can wire the auth into the infographic generator with minimal friction."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":9340,"end_idx":9340,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"f30f37f4-7f29-46a4-a620-b8a6347e2458","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"5656dd51-39f5-4bb4-8527-eb245989bd14","turn_exchange_id":"700c6ea0-50b6-4dc2-8e5e-e7bddef7d360","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"5656dd51-39f5-4bb4-8527-eb245989bd14","children":[]}}}
