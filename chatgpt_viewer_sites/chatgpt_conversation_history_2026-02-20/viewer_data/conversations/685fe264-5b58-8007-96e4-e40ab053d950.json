Managed virtual desktops (Amazon WorkSpaces)\n\n| What it is | A fully-managed Windows 11/10 or Amazon Linux desktop that AWS streams to you over WSP (WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol). |\n|---|---|\n| Best for | Office work, web browsing, YouTube/Netflix in 1080 p or even 4 K, light development. |\n| How it works | You pick a \u201cbundle\u201d (vCPU/RAM/GPU/SSD) and AWS provisions, patches, and maintains the OS.  You connect with the WorkSpaces client or just a browser.  Recent WSP upgrades added adaptive H.264/AV1 encoding, higher frame-rate video, and lower-latency audio redirection, so HD video playback is smooth on a 25--50 ms link. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 |\n| Video fidelity | Cameras/microphones up to 1080 p are supported; AppStream can go to 4 K (see below). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search6\ue201 |\n| Ongoing care | Keep the client up-to-date \u2014 older versions reach end-of-life on **31 Mar 2025**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Managed application streaming (Amazon AppStream 2.0)\n\nIf you only need one or two heavy apps (e.g., a browser, CAD tool, or media player) rather than an entire desktop, AppStream streams individual applications inside a browser tab.  It sits on top of the same NICE DCV protocol as WorkSpaces and inherits its AV improvements; bandwidth guidance is 2\u20134 Mb/s for office work and 8\u201315 Mb/s for HD graphics workloads at \u2264 100 ms RTT. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3.  \u201cRoll-your-own PC\u201d on Amazon EC2\n\n| Step | Notes |\n|---|---|\n| Pick an AMI | Windows Server 2022 or Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 work well. |\n| Choose instance type | For fluid 60 fps video use a GPU instance such as **g5.xlarge** (1 \u00d7 A10G GPU, 4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM).

Low FPS complaints are usually due to small instances without a GPU. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 |\n| Open ports securely | Restrict 3389 /TCP (RDP) or 8443 /TCP (DCV) to your IP; place the instance in a private subnet and use AWS Client VPN or S2S VPN for extra safety. |\n| Enable audio | In Windows Server, add the \u201cDesktop Experience\u201d feature or install the DCV audio driver. |\n\n---\n\n## Costs and hidden gotchas\n\n| Category | What to watch | Typical 2025 pricing* |\n|---|---|---|\n| Instance runtime | Pay per second.

From Singapore to ap-southeast-1 you\u2019ll see ~20\u201325 ms RTT, absolutely fine for office work and video, but high-tempo gaming still feels laggy.\n* **Video smoothness**: With a GPU instance (or WorkSpaces Graphics bundle) 1080 p@60 fps YouTube playback is flawless; without GPU the CPU must decode/encode every frame, which caps fluidity at ~15\u201330 fps.\n* **Audio sync**: WSP and DCV keep AV streams within \u00b150 ms, so lips stay in sync unless the network jitters badly.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-start recipes\n\n### A. Fastest path (managed)\n\n1. Open the **WorkSpaces** console \u2192 \u201cLaunch WorkSpaces\u201d.  \n2. Choose the **Standard with Graphics.g4dn** bundle.  \n3. Pick the nearest region (ap-southeast-1 for Singapore).  \n4. Invite yourself (and whomever) as a user; AWS emails client download links.  \n5. Log in \u2192 install Chrome or Firefox \u2192 enjoy YouTube/VLC/Office.\n\n### B. DIY EC2\n\n```text\naws ec2 run-instances \\\n  --image-id ami-<Windows_Server_2022_or_Ubuntu> \\\n  --instance-type g5.xlarge \\\n  --key-name my-kp \\\n  --security-group-ids sg-remote \\\n  --subnet-id subnet-private\n```\n\n* After boot:  \n  * (Windows) Enable RDP, install NVIDIA A10G driver, DCV server, and Chrome.  \n  * (Linux) `sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop dcv-server chromium-browser`.  \n  * Add an Elastic IP if you need a stable address.\n\n---\n\n## Beyond AWS\n\n* **Azure Virtual Desktop / Windows 365** \u2013 similar managed service, integrates with Microsoft 365.\n* **Google Cloud Workstations or GPU VM + Chrome RDP** \u2013 competitive GPU pricing in some regions.\n* **Third-party services** like Paperspace, Shadow.tech, or Shells offer turnkey cloud PCs with simpler pricing if you\u2019re mostly interested in media consumption.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\nRunning an AWS-hosted \u201ccloud PC\u201d is entirely feasible and gives you elastic horsepower, but mind the **two cost drivers** that surprise newcomers: GPU instance runtime and outbound bandwidth while streaming video.  For a light personal desktop that\u2019s on only a few hours a day, WorkSpaces AutoStop or a Spot GPU EC2 instance often lands around **US $40\u201360 per month**; 24\u00d77 heavy usage can easily cross **US $150\u2013250**.  With those caveats, the experience is mature and, on a good connection, indistinguishable from a local machine."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201","start_idx":827,"end_idx":846,"safe_urls":["https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/performance-enhancements-to-amazon-workspaces-streaming-protocol-wsp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/performance-enhancements-to-amazon-workspaces-streaming-protocol-wsp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Performance enhancements to Amazon WorkSpaces Streaming ...","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/performance-enhancements-to-amazon-workspaces-streaming-protocol-wsp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1668729600.0,"snippet":"I'm excited to announce significant enhancements to WSP for Amazon WorkSpaces that maximize audio/video (AV) performance and enable a consistent and responsive ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"aws.amazon.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search6\ue201","start_idx":953,"end_idx":985,"safe_urls":["https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/faqs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://dev.to/chathra222/elevating-visuals-4k-resolution-in-amazon-appstream-20-3b1?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/faqs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [dev.to](https://dev.to/chathra222/elevating-visuals-4k-resolution-in-amazon-appstream-20-3b1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Amazon AppStream 2.0 FAQs | Non-Persistent Virtualization","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/faqs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"For streaming sessions, AppStream 2.0 supports a maximum webcam video resolution of 1080p, which measures 1920x1080 pixels.

If copyrighted material transits your box, hosts will forward takedowns and (after a few) may suspend you. If that is a concern, pick a jurisdiction outside the DMCA regime. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 |\n\n**Bottom line** \u2013 If your goal is to watch US-only streaming services, evade hotel/airport Wi-Fi snooping, SSH into client machines behind NAT, or get a fixed US IPv4 that only you control, a dedicated box is ideal.  If you need snappier latency for gaming, place the server on the US West Coast (or even in Japan) or build a second hop in Guam/Honolulu.\n\n---\n\n## 2 \u2502 Choosing hardware\n\n| Typical spec | Who offers it (US) | Ballpark price |\n|--------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| 1 \u00d7 Ryzen 5 / 32 GB RAM / NVMe / 250 Mbps unmetered | OVHcloud, Hetzner Ashburn, ReliableSite | US $60\u201390 / mo |\n| 1 \u00d7 E-2278G / 64 GB / 1 Gbps unmetered | OVHcloud \u201cScale\u201d or Leaseweb | US $110\u2013150 / mo |\n| VPS 4 vCPU / 8 GB / 4 TB transfer | DigitalOcean Premium Droplet | US $48 / mo + $0.01/GB extra |\n\nIf you want GPU acceleration (e.g., transcoding Plex traffic through the tunnel), look at OVHcloud\u2019s \u201cGame\u201d range or an AWS g5.xlarge and run Spot instances when idle.\n\n---\n\n## 3 \u2502 Hardening checklist (10 min)\n\n1. **Install OS** \u2013 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or Rocky Linux 9.  \n2. `ssh-ed25519` keys only; disable root-password logins.  \n3. `ufw allow 22/tcp`, `ufw allow 51820/udp`, then `ufw enable`.  \n4.

At $0.01 / GB overage that is $0.12 each on a VPS; unmetered dedicated saves money if you binge-watch a lot.  \n* **IPv6** \u2013 Enable it; many US ISPs give native IPv6 only to residential customers, so your /64 from the server is handy.  \n* **DNS leaks** \u2013 Use a local recursive resolver (Unbound) or something like AdGuard Home on the server; push it via the `DNS =` line in client configs.  \n* **Logs & privacy** \u2013 Even \u201cno-log\u201d providers log NetFlow at the network edge.  With your own box you control software logs, but the datacenter operator can still see TCP metadata. For high-risk use cases put the server in Iceland, Finland, or Malaysia rather than the US.  \n* **Abuse complaints** \u2013 Respond within the host\u2019s SLA window (usually 48 h).
