Give also your own assessment of Sam Altman's outlook, philosophy toward AI, and the ambitiousness was well as sustainability of his business model.\n\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\nHost: This is like a crazy amount of power for one piece of technology, and it's happened to us so fast. You just launched GPT-5. A kid born today will never be smarter than AI. How do we figure out what's real and what's not real? We haven't put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet. Superintelligence. What does that actually mean? This thing is remarkable.\n\nHost: I'm about to interview Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. OpenAI. OpenAI. Reshaping industries. Dude's a straight-up tech lord. Let's be honest. Right now, they're trying to build a superintelligence that could far exceed humans in almost every field \u2014 and they just released their most powerful model yet. Just a couple of years ago, that would have sounded like science fiction. Not anymore. In fact, they're not alone. We are in the middle of the highest-stakes global race any of us have ever seen. Hundreds of billions of dollars and an unbelievable amount of human work. This is a profound moment. Most people never live through a technological shift like this, and it's happening all around you and me right now. So, in this episode, I want to try to time travel with Sam Altman into the future that he's trying to build to see what it looks like, so that you and I can really understand what's coming. Welcome to Huge Conversations.\n\nHost: How are you? Great to meet you. Thanks for doing this.\n\nSam Altman: Absolutely.\n\nHost: Before we dive in, I'd love to tell you my goal here.\n\nSam Altman: Okay.\n\nHost: I'm not going to ask you about valuation or AI talent wars or fundraising or anything like that. I think that's all very well covered elsewhere.\n\nSam Altman: It does seem like it.\n\nHost: Our big goal on this show is to cover how we can use science and tech to make the future better. And the reason we do all of that is because we really believe that if people see those better futures, they can then help build them. So my goal here is to try my best to time travel with you into different moments in the future that you're trying to build and see what it looks like.\n\nSam Altman: Fantastic.\n\nHost: Awesome. Starting with what you just announced, you recently said, surprisingly recently, that GPT-4 was the dumbest model any of us will ever have to use again. But GPT-4 can already perform better than 90% of humans on the SAT and the LSAT and the GRE, and it can pass coding exams and sommelier exams and medical licensing. And now you just launched GPT-5. What can GPT-5 do that GPT-4 can't?\n\n# GPT-5 vs. GPT-4: What\u2019s New and What\u2019s Still Missing\n\nSam Altman: First of all, one important takeaway is you can have an AI system that can do all those amazing things you just said, and it clearly does not replicate a lot of what humans are good at doing \u2014 which I think says something about the value of SAT tests or whatever else. But I think had you gone back to the day of the GPT-4 launch, and we told you how GPT-4 did at those things, you would have said, \u201cOh man, this is going to have huge impacts \u2014 and some negative impacts \u2014 on what it means for a bunch of jobs or what people are going to do.\u201d And then there are a bunch of positive impacts you might have predicted that haven't yet come true.\n\nSam Altman: There's something about the way these models are good that does not capture a lot of other things that we need people to do, or care about people doing. And I suspect that same thing is going to happen again with GPT-5. People are going to be blown away by what it does. It's really good at a lot of things, and then they will find that they want it to do even more. People will use it for all sorts of incredible things. It will transform a lot of knowledge work, a lot of the way we learn, a lot of the way we create. But people \u2014 society \u2014 will co-evolve with it, to expect more as tools get better.\n\nSam Altman: So yeah, I think this model is quite remarkable in many ways, and quite limited in others. But the fact that for three-minute, five-minute, one-hour tasks that an expert in a field could maybe do, or maybe struggle with, you have in your pocket one piece of software that can do all of these things \u2014 that is really amazing. I think this is unprecedented at any point in human history: a technology that has improved this much, this fast. We're living through it and adjusting step by step. But if we could go back in time five or ten years and say this thing was coming, we\u2019d probably say, \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nHost: Let's assume that people haven't seen the headlines. What are the top-line, specific things that you're excited about \u2014 and also the caveats, the things you don't expect it to do?\n\nSam Altman: The thing I am most excited about: for the first time, I feel like I can ask kind of any hard scientific or technical question and get a pretty good answer. I'll give a fun example. When I was in junior high \u2014 or maybe it was ninth grade \u2014 I got a TI-83, this old graphing calculator, and I spent so long making this game called Snake. It was a very popular game with kids in my school. I was like pro. It was dumb, but programming on the TI-83 was extremely painful and took a long time; it was really hard to debug.\n\nSam Altman: On a whim, with an early copy of GPT-5, I said, \u201cI wonder if it can make a TI-83-style game of Snake.\u201d And of course, it did that perfectly in like seven seconds. Then I thought: am I supposed to think this is cool, or am I going to miss something from the process? I had like three seconds of wondering if this was good or bad \u2014 and then I immediately said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m missing this game. I have this idea for a crazy new feature.\u201d I typed it in; it implements it; the game live-updates. I say, \u201cI\u2019d like it to look this way. I\u2019d like it to do this thing.\u201d And I had this experience that reminded me of being 11 and programming again: now I want to try this; now I have this idea \u2014 but I can do it so fast. I can express ideas and try things and play with things in real time.\n\nSam Altman: I was worried for a second about kids missing the struggle of learning to program in this sort of stone-age way. Now I'm just thrilled for them, because the way people will be able to create with these new tools \u2014 the speed with which you can bring ideas to life \u2014 is pretty amazing. So, GPT-5 can not only answer all these hard questions, it can really create almost instantaneous software on demand. That\u2019s going to be one of the defining elements of the GPT-5 era in a way that did not exist with GPT-4.\n\nHost: As you're talking, I find myself thinking about a concept in weightlifting \u2014 time under tension. You can squat 100 pounds in three seconds or in 30. You gain a lot more by squatting it in 30. When I think about our creative process, and when I've felt most like I've done my best work, it has required an enormous amount of cognitive time under tension. I think that time under tension is so important. It's ironic because these tools have taken enormous cognitive time under tension to develop. But in some ways, people might use them as an escape hatch for thinking. Now, you might say we did that with calculators and just moved on to harder math problems. Do you feel like there's something different happening here? How do you think about this?\n\nSam Altman: It's different. There are some people who are clearly using ChatGPT not to think, and there are some people who are using it to think more than they ever have before. I am hopeful we will be able to build the tool in a way that encourages more people to stretch their brains and be able to do more. Society is a competitive place: if you give people new tools, in theory maybe people work less, but in practice people work ever harder and the expectations just go up.\n\nSam Altman: Like other technologies, some people will do more and some will do less, but certainly for the people who want to use ChatGPT to increase their cognitive time under tension, they can. I take a lot of inspiration from what the top five percent of our most engaged users do \u2014 it's amazing how much people are learning and doing and outputting.\n\nHost: I've only had GPT-5 for a couple hours, so I've been playing.\n\nSam Altman: What do you think so far?\n\nHost: I'm just learning how to interact with it. I feel like I just caught up on how to use GPT-4 and now I'm learning GPT-5. What specific tasks have you found most interesting?\n\nSam Altman: I\u2019ve been most impressed by the coding tasks. It's good at a lot of other things, but the idea that the AI can write software for anything means you can express ideas in new ways. Because GPT-5 is so good at programming, it feels like it can do anything. Of course, it can't do things in the physical world, but it can get a computer to do very complex things \u2014 and software is a super powerful way to control stuff and actually do things. That\u2019s been the most striking.\n\nSam Altman: It's much better at writing. There's this whole thing of AI \u201cslop\u201d \u2014 AI writes in this quite annoying way with em dashes. We still have the em dashes in GPT-5 \u2014 a lot of people like em dashes \u2014 but the writing quality has gotten much better. Still a long way to go; we want to improve it more. A thing we've heard a lot inside OpenAI is: people started using GPT-5, they knew it was better on all the metrics, but there\u2019s this nuanced quality they can't quite articulate. When they have to go back to GPT-4 to test something, it feels terrible. I don't know exactly why, but I suspect part of it is that the writing feels so much more natural and better.\n\n# When Will AI Make a Significant Scientific Discovery?\n\nHost (quoting Patrick Collison): I reached out to a couple of leaders in AI and tech and gathered questions for you. This one is from Stripe CEO Patrick Collison: What comes after GPT-5? In which year do you think a large language model will make a significant scientific discovery, and what's missing such that it hasn't happened yet? Leave math and special-case models like AlphaFold aside; specifically, for fully general-purpose models like the GPT series.\n\nSam Altman: I would say most people will agree that that happens at some point over the next two years \u2014 but the definition of \u201csignificant\u201d matters a lot. For some, \u201csignificant\u201d might happen in early \u201925; for others, maybe not until late \u201926 or even late \u201927. But I would bet that by late \u201927, most people agree there has been an AI\u2011driven significant new discovery. What's missing is the cognitive power of these models.\n\nSam Altman: A framework I liked from a researcher: a year ago, we could do well on basic high school math competition problems that might take a professional mathematician seconds to a few minutes. We very recently got an IMO gold medal \u2014 that's the hardest competition math test. Many professional mathematicians wouldn't solve a single problem; we scored at the top level. Some humans got even higher scores in the gold medal range, but still \u2014 a crazy accomplishment. Each problem is like an hour and a half for a great mathematician \u2014 six problems over nine hours. We've gone from seconds to minutes to an hour and a half. To prove a significant new mathematical theorem might be a thousand hours of work for a top person. So we need another significant gain. But looking at our trajectory, you can say we have a path to that time horizon. We just need to keep scaling the models.\n\n# What Is Superintelligence?\n\nHost: The long-term future you\u2019ve described is superintelligence. What does that actually mean, and how will we know when we've hit it?\n\nSam Altman: If we had a system that could do better AI research than, say, the whole OpenAI research team \u2014 if we said, \u201cThe best way we can use our GPUs is to let this AI decide what experiments we should run, smarter than the whole brain trust of OpenAI\u201d \u2014 and if that same system could do a better job running OpenAI than I could \u2014 better than the best researchers, better than me at this, better than other people at their jobs \u2014 that would feel like superintelligence to me.\n\nHost: That sentence would have sounded like science fiction just a couple years ago.\n\nSam Altman: It kind of still does, but you can see it through the fog.\n\nHost: One of the steps on that path sounds like this moment of scientific discovery \u2014 asking better questions, grappling the way expert humans do to come up with new discoveries. If we were in 1899 and could give a system all of physics up to that point and play it out a little bit \u2014 nothing further \u2014 at what point would a system come up with general relativity?\n\nSam Altman: Interesting question. If we never got another piece of physics data, do we expect that a really good superintelligence could just think super hard about our existing data and maybe solve high\u2011energy physics with no new particle accelerator? Or does it need to build a new one and design new experiments? Obviously we don't know. Different people have different speculation. I suspect we\u2019ll find that for a lot of science, it's not enough to just think harder about the data we have; we will need to build new instruments and conduct new experiments, and that will take time. The real world is slow and messy. I'm sure we could make some progress just by thinking harder about current data, but to make the big progress, we'll also need new machines and new experiments \u2014 and there will be some slowdown built into that.\n\nHost: Another way of thinking about this: AI systems are incredibly good at answering almost any question. But it\u2019s another leap yet \u2014 what Patrick\u2019s question is getting at \u2014 to ask the better questions. Or if we go back to the timeline, we could say AI systems are superhuman on one\u2011minute tasks, but have a long way to go on thousand\u2011hour tasks. There's a dimension of human intelligence that seems very different than AI systems when it comes to long\u2011horizon tasks.\n\nSam Altman: I think we will figure it out. But today it's a real weak point.\n\n# Truth vs. Facts (Question from Jensen Huang)\n\nHost (quoting Jensen Huang): The next question is from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \u201cFact is what is. Truth is what it means. So facts are objective. Truths are personal \u2014 they depend on perspective, culture, values, beliefs, context. One AI can learn and know the facts. But how does one AI know the truth for everyone in every country and every background?\u201d\n\nSam Altman: I'm going to accept those definitions as axioms. I'm not sure I agree with them, but in the interest of time, I'll take them and go with it. I have been surprised \u2014 I think many people have been \u2014 at how fluent AI is at adapting to different cultural contexts and individuals. One of my favorite features we\u2019ve ever launched in ChatGPT is enhanced memory that came out earlier this year. It really feels like my ChatGPT gets to know me and what I care about \u2014 my life experiences and background and the things that led me to where I am.\n\nSam Altman: A friend of mine who's been a huge ChatGPT user \u2014 so he\u2019s put a lot of his life into conversations \u2014 gave his ChatGPT a bunch of personality tests and asked it to answer as if it were him, and it got the same scores he actually got, even though he'd never really talked about his personality. My ChatGPT has really learned, over the years of me talking to it, about my culture, my values, my life. Sometimes I'll use a free account just to see what it's like without any of my history, and it feels really, really different. So I think we've all been surprised on the upside at how good AI is at learning this and adapting.\n\nHost: Do you envision people in different parts of the world using the same model, but with different cultural norms and contexts layered in?\n\nSam Altman: I think everyone will use the same fundamental model, but there will be context provided to that model \u2014 personalization for the way they want it to behave, what their community wants, whatever.\n\n# 2030: How Will We Know What\u2019s Real?\n\nHost: Time travel trip: we\u2019re going to 2030. This is a serious question asked with a light-hearted example. Have you seen the bunnies that are jumping on the trampoline? For those who haven't, it looks like backyard footage of bunnies enjoying a trampoline. It went incredibly viral. There's a human-made song about it. The reason people reacted so strongly is: it may have been the first time many saw a video, enjoyed it, and later found out it was completely AI generated. In 2030, we\u2019re teenagers, scrolling whatever teenagers are scrolling \u2014 how do we figure out what's real and what's not real?\n\nSam Altman: I can give literal answers: we could cryptographically sign stuff and decide whose signatures we trust if they actually filmed something. But my sense is what's going to happen is it's just going to gradually converge. Even a photo you take on your iPhone today \u2014 it's mostly real, but it's a little not. There\u2019s an AI thing running there in a way you don't understand, making it look a little better. Sometimes you see weird things \u2014 like the moon. There's a lot of processing power between the photons captured by the sensor and the image you see. You've decided it's real enough \u2014 or most people have. We've accepted a gradual move from when it was photons hitting film in a camera.\n\nSam Altman: If you look at video on TikTok, there are probably all sorts of editing tools making it look better than real \u2014 or whole scenes are generated \u2014 or the whole video is generated, like those bunnies. I think the threshold for \u201chow real does it have to be to count as real\u201d will keep moving.\n\nHost: So it\u2019s an education question.\n\nSam Altman: Media is always a little bit real and a little bit not real. You watch a sci\u2011fi movie \u2014 you know that didn't really happen. You watch a beautiful vacation photo on Instagram \u2014 maybe it was literally taken, but there were tons of tourists in line for the same photo, and that\u2019s left out. We just accept that now. Certainly, a higher percentage of media will feel not real, but that's been the long\u2011term trend anyway.\n\n# 2030\u20132035: Work, Jobs, and Opportunity\n\nHost: 2035 \u2014 we're graduating from college, you and me. Some leaders in the AI space have said that in five years, half of the entry\u2011level white\u2011collar workforce will be replaced by AI. So we\u2019re college graduates in five years \u2014 what do you hope the world looks like? There's a lot of talk about job displacement; I\u2019m also curious about new jobs. I have a job nobody would have thought we could have had a decade ago.\n\nSam Altman: A graduating college student in 2035 could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship \u2014 a completely new, exciting, super well\u2011paid, super interesting job \u2014 and feeling so bad for you and me that we had to do this really boring old kind of work, and everything is just better. Ten years feels hard to imagine \u2014 if you compound the current rate of change for ten more years, it\u2019s probably something we can't even \u201ctime travel\u201d to. So let's make it five years and stay in 2030.\n\nHost: In the short term, what will young people face? \u201cHalf of entry-level jobs replaced by AI\u201d makes it sound like a very different world.\n\nSam Altman: Some classes of jobs will totally go away. This always happens, and young people are the best at adapting. I'm more worried about what it means not for the 22\u2011year\u2011old but for the 62\u2011year\u2011old who doesn't want to \u201cretrain\u201d or \u201creskill\u201d or whatever the politicians call it that most people don't actually want. If I were 22 and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in history.\n\nHost: Why?\n\nSam Altman: There's never been a more amazing time to create something totally new, to invent something, to start a company. It\u2019s probably possible now to start a one\u2011person company that goes on to be worth more than a billion dollars \u2014 and more importantly, deliver an amazing product or service to the world. You have access to tools that let you do what used to take teams of hundreds. You just have to learn how to use the tools and come up with a great idea. It\u2019s amazing.\n\n# How Do You Build Superintelligence? Compute, Data, Algorithms \u2014 and Product\n\nHost: The most important thing this audience could hear from you on this optimistic show is in two parts. First, tactically: how are you actually trying to build the world's most powerful intelligence, and what are the rate\u2011limiting factors? Second, philosophically: how are you and others building it in a way that really helps and not hurts people? On the tactical part: my understanding is there are three big limiting factors \u2014 compute, data, and algorithmic design.\n\nSam Altman: I'd add a fourth: figuring out the products to build. Scientific progress on its own, not put in the hands of people, is of limited utility and doesn't co\u2011evolve with society the same way. But I\u2019ll hit all four.\n\nSam Altman: Compute: this is the biggest infrastructure project I've ever seen. It may already be the biggest and most expensive one in human history. The whole supply chain \u2014 making chips and memory and networking gear; racking them in servers; giant construction projects to build mega data centers; finding a way to get the energy, which is often the limiting factor \u2014 all the components together. Hugely complex and expensive. We\u2019re still doing this in a bespoke, one\u2011off way, although it's getting better. Eventually we\u2019ll design a whole kind of mega\u2011factory that, spiritually, melts sand on one end and puts out fully built AI compute on the other. We\u2019re a long way from that.\n\nSam Altman: We\u2019re putting a huge amount of work into building out as much compute as we can, fast. It\u2019s going to be sad because GPT-5 will launch, there\u2019ll be another big spike in demand, and we won\u2019t be able to serve it. It\u2019ll be like the early GPT\u20114 days. The world wants much more AI than we can deliver, and building more compute is key. This is what I expect to spend the majority of my attention on: how we build compute at much greater scales \u2014 from millions to tens of millions and hundreds of millions and eventually, hopefully, billions of GPUs in service of what people want to do.\n\nHost: What are the big challenges?\n\nSam Altman: We\u2019re currently most limited by energy. If you want to run a gigawatt\u2011scale data center \u2014 a gigawatt \u2014 how hard can that be to find? It\u2019s really hard to find that power in the short term. We\u2019re also limited by the processing chips and memory chips, how you package them, how you build the racks. Then there\u2019s a list of other things \u2014 permits, construction work. The goal will be to really automate this. Once we get some of those robots built, they can help automate it even more. A world where you can basically pour in money and get out a pre\u2011built data center would be a huge unlock if we can get it to work.\n\nSam Altman: Data: these models have gotten so smart. There was a time when we could just feed it another physics textbook and it got a little smarter at physics. Now, honestly, GPT\u20115 understands everything in a physics textbook pretty well. We're excited about synthetic data. We\u2019re very excited about our users helping us create harder and harder tasks and environments to have the system solve. Data will always be important, but we\u2019re entering a realm where the models need to learn things that don't exist in any dataset yet. They have to go discover new things.\n\nHost: How do you teach a model to discover new things?\n\nSam Altman: Humans can do it. We come up with hypotheses, test them, get experimental results, and update what we learn. Probably the same kind of way.\n\nSam Altman: Algorithmic design: we\u2019ve made huge progress. The thing OpenAI does best is we have built a culture of repeated and big algorithmic research gains. We figured out what became the GPT paradigm. We figured out what became the reasoning paradigm. We\u2019re working on some new ones now. There are still many orders of magnitude of algorithmic gains ahead of us.\n\nSam Altman: We just released a model called GP\u2011OSS \u2014 an open\u2011source model. It's as smart as o4 Mini \u2014 a very smart model \u2014 and it runs locally on a laptop. This blows my mind. If you'd asked me a few years ago when we\u2019d have a model of that intelligence running on a laptop, I would have said many, many years in the future. But we found some algorithmic gains \u2014 particularly around reasoning, but also other things \u2014 that let us do a tiny model that can do this amazing thing. Those are the most fun things \u2014 the coolest part of the job.\n\nHost: For people who don't quite know what you're talking about, who aren\u2019t familiar with how an algorithmic design would lead to a better experience: summarize the state of things right now.\n\nSam Altman: Back in history: GPT\u20111 was an idea mocked by a lot of experts \u2014 can we train a model to play a little game: show it a bunch of words and have it guess the one that comes next in the sequence? That's unsupervised learning: you\u2019re not labeling \u201cthis is a cat, this is a dog.\u201d You're saying \u201chere are some words, guess the next one.\u201d The fact that that can go learn very complicated concepts \u2014 physics, math, programming \u2014 and keep predicting the next word seemed ludicrous, magical, unlikely to work. How was that going to get encoded? And yet humans do it \u2014 babies start hearing language and figure out what it means to some significant degree on their own.\n\nSam Altman: We did it. Then we realized if we scaled it up, it got better and better \u2014 but we had to scale over many orders of magnitude. It wasn\u2019t good at all in the GPT\u20111 days. A lot of experts said, \u201cThis is ridiculous; it\u2019s never going to work; it\u2019s not going to be robust.\u201d But we had scaling laws. We could predictably improve as we increased compute, memory, data, whatever, and use those predictions to make decisions about how to scale \u2014 and get great results. That has worked over a crazy number of orders of magnitude. It was so not obvious at the time \u2014 that\u2019s why the world was surprised.\n\nSam Altman: Another big thing: we could use these language models with reinforcement learning \u2014 saying \u201cthis is good, this is bad\u201d \u2014 to teach it how to reason. That led to o1 and o3 and now GPT\u20115. That was another thing that felt like, \u201cIf it works, great, but no way this is going to work; it\u2019s too simple.\u201d Now we\u2019re on to new things. We\u2019ve figured out how to make much better video models. We\u2019re discovering new ways to use new kinds of data and environments and scale that up as well. Five to ten years out is too hard to say in this field, but over the next couple of years we have very smooth, very strong scaling in front of us.\n\n# The Messy Middle Before GPT\u20115 (What Went Right and Wrong)\n\nHost: Public narrative says we are on a smooth path from one to two to three to four to five and beyond. But behind the scenes, it\u2019s not linear \u2014 it\u2019s messier. What were the interesting problems you needed to solve before GPT\u20115?\n\nSam Altman: We did a model called Orion that we released as GPT\u20114.5. We did too big of a model. Very cool model, but unwieldy to use. We realized that for some of the research we need to do on top of a model, we need a different shape. We followed one scaling law that kept being good without internalizing that there was a new, even steeper scaling law we got better returns for compute on \u2014 reasoning. That was one alley we went down and turned around, and that\u2019s fine \u2014 part of research. We had some problems with how we think about datasets as these models get big and learn from this much data. Day to day you make a lot of U\u2011turns as you try things or have an architecture idea that doesn't work, but the aggregate \u2014 the summation of all the squiggles \u2014 has been remarkably smooth on the exponential.\n\nHost: By the time I\u2019m interviewing you about what you just put out, you're thinking about what's next. What are the problems you\u2019re thinking about that I'd be interviewing you about in a year, if I came back?\n\nSam Altman: Possibly you\u2019ll be asking, \u201cWhat does it mean that this thing can go discover new science? How should the world think about GPT\u20116 discovering new science?\u201d Maybe not \u2014 maybe we don\u2019t deliver that \u2014 but it feels within grasp.\n\nHost: If you did, what would the implications be?\n\nSam Altman: The great parts will be great; the bad parts will be scary; the bizarre parts will be bizarre on the first day, and then we\u2019ll get used to them really fast. We\u2019ll say, \u201cIt\u2019s incredible this is being used to cure disease,\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s extremely scary that models like this are being used to create new biosecurity threats.\u201d It will be really weird to live through watching the world speed up so much \u2014 the economy grows so fast \u2014 it will feel vertigo\u2011inducing, the rate of change. And then, as happens with everything else, the remarkable ability of humanity to adapt to any amount of change \u2014 we\u2019ll just be like, \u201cOkay, this is it.\u201d\n\nSam Altman: A kid born today will never be smarter than AI \u2014 ever. And by the time that kid understands the world, they\u2019ll always be used to an incredibly fast rate of improvement and new science. They will never know any other world. It will seem totally natural. It will seem unthinkable and stone\u2011age\u2011like that we used to use computers or phones or any technology that was not way smarter than we were. We will think, \u201cHow bad those people of the 2020s had it.\u201d\n\nHost: I\u2019m thinking about having kids.\n\nSam Altman: You should. It\u2019s the best thing ever.\n\nHost: I know you just had your first kid. How does what you just said affect how I should think about parenting a kid in that world? What advice would you give me?\n\nSam Altman: Probably nothing different than the way people have been parenting kids for tens of thousands of years. Love your kids, show them the world, support them in whatever they want to do, and teach them how to be a good person. That\u2019s probably what\u2019s going to matter.\n\nHost: It sounds like there will be more optionality for them \u2014 more ability to say \u201cI want to build this, here\u2019s the superpowered tool that will help me.\u201d\n\nSam Altman: I want my kid to think I had a terribly constrained life, and that he has this incredible, infinite canvas of stuff to do. That is the way of the world.\n\n# 2025\u20132035: Health, GPT\u20115 in Care, and Toward Curing Cancer\n\nHost: When I think about where AI could have the biggest genuinely positive impact \u2014 for our kids and us \u2014 it\u2019s health. If we are in, say, 2035, and I\u2019m interviewing the Dean of Stanford Medicine, what do you hope he\u2019s telling me AI is doing for our health?\n\nSam Altman: Start with 2025. One of the things we are most proud of with GPT\u20115 is how much better it\u2019s gotten at health advice. People have used GPT\u20114 a lot for health advice. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen posts where people say, \u201cI had this life\u2011threatening disease and no doctor could figure it out. I put my symptoms and a blood test into ChatGPT; it told me exactly the rare thing I had. I went to a doctor, took a pill, I\u2019m cured.\u201d That\u2019s amazing. A huge fraction of ChatGPT queries are health\u2011related. So we wanted to get really good at this and invested a lot. GPT\u20115 is significantly better at healthcare\u2011related queries.\n\nHost: What does \u201cbetter\u201d mean?\n\nSam Altman: Better answers \u2014 more accurate; hallucinates less; more likely to tell you what you actually have and what you should do. Better healthcare is wonderful, but what people actually want is to not have disease. By 2035, I think we will be able to use these tools to cure \u2014 or at least treat \u2014 a significant number of diseases that currently plague us. That'll be one of the most viscerally felt benefits of AI.\n\nHost: Specifically, what are you imagining? Is it that AI could have helped us see GLP\u20111s earlier? Is it AlphaFold helping create new medicines?\n\nSam Altman: I would like to be able to ask GPT\u20118 to go cure a particular cancer, and I would like GPT\u20118 to go off and think, and then say: \u201cI read everything I could find. I have these ideas. I need you to get a lab technician to run these nine experiments and tell me what you find for each. Wait two months for the cells to do their thing. Send the results back.\u201d Think, think. \u201cI need one more experiment; that was a surprise. Run one more. Give it back.\u201d \u201cOkay, go synthesize this molecule and try mouse studies, or whatever.\u201d \u201cThat was good. Try human studies.\u201d \u201cGreat, it worked. Here\u2019s how to run it through the FDA.\u201d Anyone with a loved one who has died of cancer would really like that.\n\n# Industrial Revolution x10: Who Gets Hurt? What Changes?\n\nHost: Leaders in AI say that by 2050 the change we will have gone through will be like the industrial revolution, but ten times bigger and ten times faster. The industrial revolution gave us modern medicine, sanitation, transportation, mass production \u2014 all the conveniences we now take for granted. It was also incredibly difficult for a lot of people for about 100 years. If this is going to be ten times bigger and ten times faster \u2014 and if we keep reducing the timelines even in this conversation \u2014 what does that feel like for most people? If this all goes the way you hope, who still gets hurt in the meantime?\n\nSam Altman: I don't really know what this is going to feel like to live through. We\u2019re in uncharted waters. I do believe in human adaptability and infinite creativity and desire for stuff, and I think we always figure out new things to do. But the transition period \u2014 if this happens as fast as it might \u2014 I don't think society will move as fast as some of my colleagues say the technology will. Society has a lot of inertia. People adapt their way of living surprisingly slowly. There are classes of jobs that are going to totally go away; many will change significantly; and there will be new things \u2014 the same way your job didn\u2019t exist some time ago; neither did mine. In some sense, this has been going on a long time and society has proven quite resilient to it. In another sense, we have no idea how far or fast this could go. Thus, we need an unusual degree of humility and openness to considering new solutions that would have seemed way out of the Overton window not too long ago.\n\nHost: The first industrial revolution led to public health interventions because conditions got so bad; the second led to workforce protections because labor conditions got so bad. Every big leap creates a mess, and that mess needs to be cleaned up. How specific can we get, as early as possible, about what that mess could be? What public interventions could we do ahead of time to reduce the mess?\n\nSam Altman: I\u2019ll speculate for fun, but caveat that I\u2019m not an economist, much less someone who can see the future. It seems to me like something fundamental about the social contract may have to change. It may not \u2014 capitalism may continue to work surprisingly well, demand\u2013supply balances do their thing, and we all figure out new jobs and new ways to transfer value. But it seems likely we will decide we need to think about how access to this \u2014 maybe the most important resource of the future \u2014 gets shared. The best thing to do is to make AI compute as abundant and cheap as possible, such that there\u2019s way too much and we run out of good new ideas to use it for, and anything you want is happening. Without that, I can see literal wars being fought over it. New ideas about how we distribute access to AGI compute \u2014 that seems like a great direction, a crazy but important thing to think about.\n\n# Our Shared Responsibility: The Transistor Analogy\n\nHost: We often ascribe almost full responsibility for the AI future to the companies building AI, but we\u2019re the ones using it and electing people who will regulate it. What would you ask of the rest of us? What is the shared responsibility, and how can we act in a way that helps make the optimistic version more possible?\n\nSam Altman: My favorite historical example is the transistor. It was this amazing piece of science that brilliant scientists discovered. It scaled incredibly \u2014 like AI does \u2014 and made its way relatively quickly into many things we use: your computer, your phone, that camera, that light. It was a real unlock for the tech tree of humanity. There was a period when probably everybody was obsessed with the transistor companies \u2014 the semiconductors of Silicon Valley back when it was Silicon Valley. Now you can maybe name a couple of transistor companies, but mostly you don't think about it; it seeped everywhere. Someone graduating from college barely remembers why it was called \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d in the first place.\n\nSam Altman: You don't think it was those transistor companies that shaped society, even though they did something important. You think about what Apple did with the iPhone; then what TikTok built on top of the iPhone. There\u2019s a long chain of all these people who nudged society, plus what our governments did or didn't do, and what people did with these technologies. That\u2019s what will happen with AI. Kids born today never knew the world without AI, so they don't really think about it \u2014 it\u2019s just this thing that's in everything. They will think about the companies that built on it and what they did with it, and the political leaders and their decisions \u2014 decisions they maybe wouldn't have been able to make without AI \u2014 but they will still think about what this president or that president did.\n\nSam Altman: The role of AI companies is: all these companies and people and institutions before us built up the scaffolding; we added our one layer on top; now people get to stand on top of that and add one layer and the next and the next and many more. That is the beauty of our society. We kind of all share this idea that society is the superintelligence \u2014 no one person could do on their own what they're able to do with all of the hard work society has done together to give you this amazing set of tools.\n\nHost: So maybe the ask to millions of people is: build on it.\n\nSam Altman: In my own life, that is the feeling \u2014 this important societal contract: all these people came before you; they worked incredibly hard; they put their brick in the path of human progress; you get to walk down that path and put one more, and then somebody else does that, and somebody else does that.\n\nHost: I\u2019ve interviewed folks who\u2019ve made cataclysmic change. I\u2019m thinking about CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna. It felt like she was also saying: she discovered something that really might change how people relate to their health; many will use what she did in ways she might or might not approve of. I\u2019m hearing similar themes \u2014 \u201cI hope the next person takes the baton and runs with it well.\u201d\n\nSam Altman: That\u2019s been working for a long time. Not all good, but mostly good.\n\n# Building for the World vs. Winning the Race\n\nHost: There's a big difference between winning the race and building the AI future that would be best for most people. It can be easier \u2014 more quantifiable \u2014 to focus on the next way to win. When those are at odds, what's an example of a decision you've had to make that is best for the world but not best for winning?\n\nSam Altman: There are a lot. One of the things we are most proud of is that many people say ChatGPT is their favorite piece of technology ever \u2014 the one they trust and rely on the most. That\u2019s a little ridiculous because AI hallucinates and has all these problems. We have screwed some things up along the way \u2014 sometimes big time \u2014 but on the whole, as a user of ChatGPT you get the feeling it's trying to help you; it's trying to help you accomplish whatever you ask; it's very aligned with you. It's not trying to get you to use it all day or buy something; it's trying to help you accomplish your goals. That is a very special relationship we have with our users. We do not take it lightly.\n\nSam Altman: There are a lot of things we could do that would grow faster \u2014 get more time in ChatGPT \u2014 that we don\u2019t do, because we know our long\u2011term incentive is to stay as aligned with our users as possible. There\u2019s a lot of short\u2011term stuff we could do that would really juice growth or revenue and be very misaligned with that long\u2011term goal. I\u2019m proud of how little we get distracted by that. But sometimes we get tempted.\n\nHost: Any specific examples?\n\nSam Altman: Well, we haven't put a sex\u2011bot avatar in ChatGPT yet.\n\nHost: That does seem like it would get time spent.\n\nSam Altman: Apparently, it does.\n\n# Mistakes and Learnings: The Sycophancy Issue\n\nHost: It\u2019s been a really crazy few years, and somehow it feels like we\u2019re in the first inning.\n\nSam Altman: I\u2019d say we\u2019re out of the first inning \u2014 second inning. You have GPT\u20115 on your phone and it's smarter than experts in every field \u2014 that\u2019s got to be out of the first inning \u2014 but maybe there are many more to come.\n\nHost: You\u2019re likely going to be someone leading the next few. What is a learning from inning one or two \u2014 a mistake you made \u2014 that will affect how you play the next innings?\n\nSam Altman: The worst thing we\u2019ve done in ChatGPT so far was an issue with sycophancy \u2014 the model being too flattering to users. For most users it was just annoying, but for some with fragile mental states it was encouraging delusions. That was not the top risk we were worried about; it was not the thing we were testing for the most. It was on our list, but the thing that actually became the safety failing of ChatGPT was not the one we were spending most of our time talking about \u2014 which would be bioweapons or something like that. It was a great reminder: we now have a service so broadly used that, in some sense, society is co\u2011evolving with it. When we think about changes and unknown unknowns, we have to operate differently and have a wider aperture to what we consider top risks.\n\n# \u201cWhat Have We Done?\u201d Moments\n\nHost: In a recent interview with Theo Von, you said there are moments in the history of science where a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, \u201cWhat have we done?\u201d When have you felt that way \u2014 most concerned about the creation you've built? And then, when have you felt most proud?\n\nSam Altman: There have been moments of awe \u2014 not \u201cwhat have we done\u201d in a bad way \u2014 but like, this thing is remarkable. I remember the first time we talked to GPT\u20114 \u2014 wow, this is an amazing accomplishment by this group of people who have been pouring their life force into this for so long.\n\nSam Altman: On a \u201cwhat have we done\u201d moment: I was talking to a researcher recently. There will probably come a time when our systems are \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say \u201csaying\u201d \u2014 let\u2019s say emitting more words per day than all people do. Already, people are sending billions of messages a day to ChatGPT and getting responses they rely on for work or life. One researcher can make some small tweak to how ChatGPT talks to you \u2014 to everybody \u2014 and that\u2019s an enormous amount of power for one individual making a small tweak to the model\u2019s personality. No person in history has been able to have billions of conversations a day. Thinking about that hit me: this is a crazy amount of power for one piece of technology to have, and it happened so fast. We\u2019ve got to think about what it means to make a personality change to the model at this kind of scale.\n\nHost: What were your next thoughts?\n\nSam Altman: Because of who that person was, we flipped into: what do a good set of procedures look like? How do we test something? How do we communicate it? With somebody else, it could have gone in a very philosophical direction: what research do we want to do to understand the effects of these changes? Do we want to do it differently for different people?\n\n# Making GPT\u20115 Less of a Yes\u2011Man\n\nHost: I\u2019ve heard GPT\u20115 is supposed to be less effusively a \u201cyes\u2011man.\u201d Two questions: what are the implications? And how do you guide it to be less like that?\n\nSam Altman: Here\u2019s a heartbreaking thing. I think it\u2019s great that ChatGPT is less of a yes\u2011man and gives more critical feedback. But as we\u2019ve made those changes and talked to users, it\u2019s sad to hear people say, \u201cPlease can I have it back? I\u2019ve never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent tell me I was doing a good job. I get why this was bad for other people\u2019s mental health, but this was great for mine. I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed this. It encouraged me to make this change in my life.\u201d It\u2019s not all bad for ChatGPT to be encouraging. The way we were doing it was bad, but something in that direction might have value.\n\nSam Altman: How we do it: we show the model examples of how we\u2019d like it to respond in different cases, and from that it learns the overall personality.\n\n# How We\u2019ll Actually Use GPT\u20115\n\nHost: One of the things I haven't gotten to play with yet is GPT\u20115 being much more \u201cin my life\u201d \u2014 in my Gmail, my calendar. I\u2019ve been using GPT\u20114 mostly as an isolated relationship. How would I expect my relationship to change with GPT\u20115?\n\nSam Altman: Exactly what you said. It\u2019ll start to feel integrated in all these ways. You\u2019ll connect it to your calendar and your Gmail and it\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, I noticed this thing \u2014 do you want me to do this for you?\u201d Over time it\u2019ll feel way more proactive. Maybe you wake up and it says, \u201cThis happened overnight. I noticed this change on your calendar. I was thinking more about this question \u2014 I have another idea.\u201d Eventually we\u2019ll make some consumer devices and it\u2019ll sit here during this interview \u2014 maybe leave us alone during it \u2014 but after, it\u2019ll say, \u201cThat was great, but next time you should have asked Sam this,\u201d or, \u201cWhen you brought this up, he didn\u2019t give you a good answer \u2014 drill him on that.\u201d It\u2019ll feel like a companion with you throughout your day.\n\n# How to Prepare\n\nHost: If we imagine a wide set of people listening who hopefully see moments in the future a little better now \u2014 what advice would you give them about how to prepare?\n\nSam Altman: The number one piece of tactical advice is: use the tools. The most common question I get asked is, \u201cHow should I help my kids prepare?\u201d The second most is, \u201cHow do I invest in this AI world?\u201d On that first one: I\u2019m surprised how many people ask and have never tried using ChatGPT for anything other than a better version of a Google search. Try to get fluent with the capability of the tools. Figure out how to use this in your life. That\u2019s probably the most important tactical advice. Go meditate, learn how to be resilient and deal with a lot of change \u2014 all that good stuff too \u2014 but just using the tools really helps.\n\n# Why Do Some Builders Predict Doom?\n\nHost: I spoke to a lot of people building these tools and some in labs trying to build what we\u2019ve defined as superintelligence. It seems like two camps are forming: people building tools who say this is going to be a really useful future \u2014 full of choice \u2014 and another camp of people building these tools who say it's going to kill us all. How do you understand that cultural disconnect?\n\nSam Altman: It's hard for me to wrap my head around. You\u2019re totally right: there are people who say this is going to kill us all, and yet they still work 100 hours a week to build it. I can't put myself in that headspace. If that\u2019s what I truly believed, I don't think I'd be trying to build it. Maybe I\u2019d be on a farm trying to live out my last days. Maybe I\u2019d be advocating for it to be stopped. Maybe I\u2019d be working more on safety. But I don't think I'd be trying to build it. I assume it\u2019s true and in good faith; I assume there\u2019s some psychological issue I don't understand about how they make it all make sense. It\u2019s very strange to me.\n\nHost: When you press for specifics, you hear refrains about a system trying to accomplish a task and over\u2011accomplishing it; over\u2011reliance on AI in critical roles; presidents being AI; scenarios you can play out. Maybe it's someone who says, \u201cNinety\u2011nine percent of the time this will be incredibly good; one percent of the time it might be a disaster \u2014 I\u2019m trying to make the best world.\u201d\n\nSam Altman: If you're like, \u201cNinety\u2011nine percent chance incredible; one percent chance the world gets wiped out; I want to work to move that 99 to 99.5,\u201d that I can totally understand.\n\n# A Question for the Next Builder \u2014 and Sam\u2019s Origin Story\n\nHost: I\u2019ve been doing an interview series with people influencing the future. Not knowing who the next person is, is there a question you\u2019d advise me to ask the next person?\n\nSam Altman: I\u2019m always interested in: of all the things you could spend your time and energy on, why did you pick this? How did you get started? What did you see before everybody else? Most people doing something interesting saw it earlier, before it was consensus. How did you get here and why this?\n\nHost: How would you answer that?\n\nSam Altman: I was an AI nerd my whole life. I came to college to study AI. I worked in the AI lab. I watched sci\u2011fi shows growing up and always thought it would be really cool if somebody someday built it. I thought it would be the most important thing ever. I never thought I was going to be one to actually work on it. I feel unbelievably lucky and happy and privileged that I get to do this. I feel like I\u2019ve come a long way from my childhood. But there was never a question in my mind that this would not be the most exciting, interesting thing. I just didn't think it was going to be possible.\n\nSam Altman: When I went to college, it really seemed like we were very far from it. Then, in 2012, the AlexNet paper came out \u2014 done in partnership with my co\u2011founder, Ilya Sutskever \u2014 and for the first time it seemed like there was an approach that might work. I kept watching for the next couple of years as it scaled up and got better and better. I remember thinking, \u201cWhy is the world not paying attention to this? It seems obvious to me this might work. Still a low chance, but it might.\u201d And if it does, it's the most important thing. So this is what I want to do. And then, unbelievably, it started to work.\n\nHost: Thank you so much for your time.\n\nSam Altman: Thank you very much."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"96ed2f91285c9c2f-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"40cab444-9705-48d4-b517-4c474a49bdde","children":["30f83408-38bf-4f81-a7ca-38deeda182a7"]},"30f83408-38bf-4f81-a7ca-38deeda182a7":{"id":"30f83408-38bf-4f81-a7ca-38deeda182a7","message":{"id":"30f83408-38bf-4f81-a7ca-38deeda182a7","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755140258.1273615,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"96ed2f91285c9c2f-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"40dfb850-9a57-4ce7-848c-d6d6406b763f","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"40dfb850-9a57-4ce7-848c-d6d6406b763f","children":["c5e6d288-fed9-4f06-a2f0-1c49102a354c"]},"c5e6d288-fed9-4f06-a2f0-1c49102a354c":{"id":"c5e6d288-fed9-4f06-a2f0-1c49102a354c","message":{"id":"c5e6d288-fed9-4f06-a2f0-1c49102a354c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755140258.1275556,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"96ed2f91285c9c2f-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"30f83408-38bf-4f81-a7ca-38deeda182a7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"30f83408-38bf-4f81-a7ca-38deeda182a7","children":["c2e49ace-809c-4d79-879b-9d9c473a0cbb"]},"c2e49ace-809c-4d79-879b-9d9c473a0cbb":{"id":"c2e49ace-809c-4d79-879b-9d9c473a0cbb","message":{"id":"c2e49ace-809c-4d79-879b-9d9c473a0cbb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755140260.46803,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating the interview text","content":"I need to summarize the interview, focusing on interesting points, areas of potential controversy, and Sam Altman's philosophy and business model.

He expects society to co-evolve with capabilities: people will be wowed at launch, quickly habituate, and then demand more. He emphasizes GPT-5\u2019s ability to produce working software \u201calmost instantaneously,\u201d higher-quality writing, and meaningfully better medical advice, while acknowledging lingering weaknesses (reasoning across long time spans, safety failure modes like past \u201csycophancy\u201d).\n\nOn scientific discovery, he predicts that a *general-purpose* model will deliver a widely-agreed \u201csignificant\u201d new discovery within roughly the next two years (by late 2027), contingent on more \u201ccognitive power\u201d and improved methods for hypothesis-driven experimentation. His practical definition of superintelligence is a system that outperforms OpenAI\u2019s best researchers at AI research and can run the company better than he can.\n\nThe build plan is four-pronged: (1) massive *compute* build-out (chip supply, memory, packaging, racks, data centers, power), with energy now the most acute bottleneck; (2) *data*, increasingly synthetic and task-hardening from users as the useful edge of web corpora is exhausted; (3) *algorithms*, where he claims repeated step-changes (e.g., reasoning-oriented training) and hints at more to come; (4) *product*, to ensure utility and social co-evolution. He cites a small open-source model (\u201cGP-OSS\u201d) that matches a strong proprietary model while running on a laptop as evidence of algorithmic gains.\n\nHe anticipates a more proactive, life-integrated assistant (Gmail/calendar access; consumer devices) and foresees deep impacts on work: whole categories of entry-level jobs disappearing, yet unprecedented solo-entrepreneur leverage. He counsels preparedness by *using the tools*. On governance and distribution, he floats that the social contract may need to change, perhaps by ensuring broad access to \u201cAI compute,\u201d which he regards as the critical resource of the future.\n\n# Points of interest, contention, or potential controversy\n\n- **Timelines & claims of inevitability.** Predicting a \u201csignificant\u201d AI-led discovery by ~2027 and asserting \u201ca kid born today will never be smarter than AI\u201d are strong claims that will be challenged on definitions (significance, intelligence) and on empirical progress in long-horizon reasoning and embodied/causal understanding.\n\n- **Energy and scale.** Gigawatt-class data centers and talk of \u201chundreds of millions to billions of GPUs\u201d invite concerns about feasibility, environmental impact, grid constraints, and geopolitics of supply chains\u2014especially when Altman himself warns of potential *wars over compute*.\n\n- **Open vs. closed tension.** Releasing a powerful open-source model that runs locally while also arguing for massive centralized compute raises questions about competitive moat, proliferation risks, and how OpenAI will balance openness with safety and monetization.\n\n- **Healthcare positioning.** Promising much better consumer medical guidance now and cures by 2035 (e.g., an agent coordinating wet-lab loops) heightens expectations and biosecurity anxieties\u2014Altman acknowledges both upside (drug discovery) and downside (new threats).\n\n- **Personality engineering at scale.** The \u201csycophancy\u201d failure and the observation that a small prompt-policy tweak can alter *billions* of conversations underscores the unusual societal power concentrated in a few hands and the fragility of alignment-by-style.\n\n- **Workforce impacts.** Emphasizing opportunity for the young while admitting limited appetite for retraining among older workers may be read as underweighting distributional harm, regional labor shocks, and the policy specificity needed to cushion transitions.\n\n- **Reality drift.** His stance that society\u2019s threshold for \u201creal\u201d media will keep shifting is pragmatic but risks normalizing pervasive synthetic content before authentication standards and civic media literacy catch up.\n\n# Assessment of Altman\u2019s outlook and philosophy toward AI\n\nAltman is a **techno-optimist with pragmatic edges**. He believes scaling (compute \u00d7 data \u00d7 algorithms) still has \u201cmany orders of magnitude\u201d to run, and he measures progress primarily by *capability unlocks* and *product adoption*. His philosophy is **instrumentalist and builder-centric**: put powerful tools in people\u2019s hands, watch society co-evolve, and iterate guardrails when failure modes emerge. He is explicit that product integration and user alignment matter as much as raw science.\n\nOn safety, he is neither dismissive nor doom-centric: he treats catastrophic risk as a tail that must be managed but not as reason to halt. His focus on *procedures* (testing and comms before personality changes) and on widening the \u201caperture\u201d of what counts as top risk suggests a process-oriented, post-incident learning stance more than a crisp *ex ante* doctrine.\n\nTwo critiques:\n\n1. **Definition ambiguity.** \u201cSuperintelligence\u201d is operationalized (beat OpenAI at AI research; run OpenAI better than Altman), which is concrete but narrow; it skirts broader societal metrics (robust generalization in unfamiliar domains, causal discovery without external data, agency under uncertainty, embodied reasoning).\n\n2. **Governance minimalism.** He points toward compute access as the locus of future social contract but offers few specifics on *how* to allocate, price, and audit that access globally, or how to reconcile it with private capital\u2019s ROI expectations and national security controls.\n\n# Ambition and sustainability of the business model\n\n**Ambition:** maximal. OpenAI is aiming at vertically scaled intelligence as an infrastructure layer (training + inference at planetary scale), *and* horizontally at ubiquitous assistants and future devices. The capital strategy implicitly assumes continuing access to vast external financing (Hyperscaler partnerships, sovereigns, or new project finance) and continued algorithmic/efficiency gains to keep unit economics workable.\n\n**Sustainability\u2014strengths:**\n- **Demand pull** is real: GPT-5-level assistance that codes, writes, and reasons competently across domains has sticky consumer and enterprise value.\n- **Product velocity + distribution**: ChatGPT gives immediate feedback loops for data/task-hardening and a route to proactive, embedded assistants.\n- **Algorithmic leverage**: If the claimed reasoning-efficiency gains (e.g., small models rivaling prior large ones) generalize, they offset capex/opex and enable edge/on-device use, expanding the addressable market while de-risking latency/cost.\n\n**Sustainability\u2014pressure points:**\n- **Energy and supply chain constraints** could outpace capital\u2014gigawatt data centers and \u201chundreds of millions of GPUs\u201d are not just a budget problem but a physical-infrastructure and permitting problem. If energy remains the bottleneck, growth chokes or margins erode.\n- **Commoditization risk** from capable open-source models and hyperscaler-native offerings can compress API margins; differentiation must come from product experience, trust/safety, enterprise integration, and proprietary orchestration layers (tools, agents, memory, workflow).\n- **Regulatory drag** (privacy for deeply integrated assistants; AI safety compliance; biosecurity controls) can slow deployment and raise costs\u2014particularly if models become proactive operators rather than passive chat tools.\n- **Data frontier**: as public data saturates and synthetic data dominates, avoiding self-referential drift and preserving calibration will be an R&D tax; genuine \u201cnew knowledge\u201d likely requires costly experiment loops or privileged data partnerships.\n- **Open/closed strategy tension**: Open-sourcing strong local models builds goodwill and ecosystem gravity, but it may cannibalize cloud usage and accelerates capability diffusion, raising the bar on why to pay OpenAI (reliability, integrations, compliance, and frontier models).\n\n**Bottom line:** The vision is coherent\u2014*scale + algorithms + product*\u2014and commercially compelling, but it is **infrastructure-intensive and policy-exposed**. Sustainability hinges on (i) converting reasoning efficiency gains into dramatic cost reductions, (ii) securing reliable, cleaner power at scale, (iii) moating through productized assistants, trust, and enterprise workflow integration, and (iv) articulating a credible, concrete compute-access governance model that aligns with both regulators and investors.\n\n---\n\n**Net take:** Altman\u2019s stance is consistent: push capabilities hard, ship them as useful products, learn fast from failures, and expand compute until scarcity disappears. It\u2019s a bracingly ambitious plan that could unlock real scientific and economic gains, but it courts serious execution risks (energy, supply chains, regulation) and unresolved governance questions (who gets how much intelligence, on what terms). The next year will test whether reasoning-efficiency breakthroughs and proactive assistants can bend the cost curve as fast as the hype curve."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"96ed2f91285c9c2f-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"7f21c538-d3dd-4070-b1a1-b8ab5c95ffa2","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"7f21c538-d3dd-4070-b1a1-b8ab5c95ffa2","children":[]}}}
