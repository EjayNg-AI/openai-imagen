It literally means **\u201cMy Lord\u201d** or **\u201cLord\u201d**, derived from *Adon* (\u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05df), meaning *lord* or *master*, with the first-person possessive suffix *-ai* (*my*).  \n\n### 1. **Theological Context**\n\u201cAdonai\u201d is not a separate deity or being\u2014it is a reverent substitute for the **Tetragrammaton (YHWH, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4)**, the ineffable four-letter name of God revealed to Moses in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 3:14). According to Jewish law and custom, that name is never spoken aloud, as it is considered too sacred to pronounce. When reading scripture, Jews traditionally substitute *Adonai* for *YHWH*.  \n\nThus, when you see **\u201cAdonai\u201d** in a Hebrew prayer (such as the one you quoted), it stands for **the same divine being as \u201cthe LORD\u201d** in most English Bible translations\u2014*the God of Israel*, the Creator and Redeemer.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Usage in Prayer**\nIn liturgy and prayer, \u201cAdonai\u201d signifies **the personal, relational aspect of God**\u2014the One who enters into covenant, delivers from oppression, and sustains creation. The phrase *Baruch Atah Adonai* (\u201cBlessed are You, Adonai\u201d) introduces many Hebrew blessings (*berakhot*), acknowledging God\u2019s active presence in daily life.\n\nIn the prayer you quoted (\u201cA Prayer for the Safe Return of Hostages\u201d), *Adonai* is invoked in that traditional sense:\n> \u201cAdonai, God of compassion, who hears the cries of the oppressed\u2026\u201d\n\nHere, *Adonai* emphasizes God\u2019s moral authority, compassion, and covenantal responsibility to bring justice and mercy\u2014an echo of the Exodus narrative, when God \u201cheard the cry\u201d of the enslaved Israelites and delivered them.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Broader Linguistic and Philosophical Notes**\n- **Substitution practice:** When not praying, observant Jews often say *HaShem* (\u201cThe Name\u201d) instead of *Adonai*, again to avoid casual or profane use of a sacred name.  \n- **In Christian usage:** \u201cAdonai\u201d sometimes appears in hymns or theological writings to emphasize the Hebrew roots of the faith or the reverent aspect of divine lordship.  \n- **Philosophical dimension:** The name *Adonai* encodes the paradox of transcendence and immanence\u2014God as the ultimate Master of all reality who yet relates personally to human beings.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **In Translation and Theology**\n| Term | Hebrew | Meaning | English equivalent |\n|------|---------|----------|--------------------|\n| YHWH | \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 | \u201cBeing\u201d / \u201cI AM WHO I AM\u201d | The LORD |\n| Adonai | \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9 | \u201cMy Lord\u201d | Lord |\n| Elohim | \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd | \u201cGod\u201d (plural form with singular meaning) | God |\n\nThe choice of \u201cAdonai\u201d in your quoted prayer is deliberate\u2014it evokes **reverence, intimacy, and divine compassion** rather than abstract omnipotence.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n\u201cAdonai\u201d is the Hebrew title for **the one God of Israel**, meaning *\u201cMy Lord\u201d*. It functions as a reverent stand-in for the unpronounceable divine name YHWH, expressing both **devotion** and **awe**. The prayer you cited draws directly from this tradition\u2014invoking God as protector, redeemer, and ultimate liberator."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98dd2a19fa43ec6a-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"5383475d-c201-40de-add7-34aaf71826f5","turn_exchange_id":"40d5cc65-a2b8-473c-9f12-ecb2e354945d","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5383475d-c201-40de-add7-34aaf71826f5","children":["bbe7da00-4ab9-409d-91ae-a41f657ea329"]},"bbe7da00-4ab9-409d-91ae-a41f657ea329":{"id":"bbe7da00-4ab9-409d-91ae-a41f657ea329","message":{"id":"bbe7da00-4ab9-409d-91ae-a41f657ea329","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760341647.728,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Please write a version of the prayer that emphasizes that now the living hostages are being set free, and are no longer captives"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98dd3aa62c8ad8e3-SIN","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"6dc31511-4bb4-4038-b31c-2fe7209e5175","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cd03d72f-e6d3-4a64-9368-39651cdc37c5","children":["9f93abd6-f17c-4de8-b9ec-97cd61abdbe7"]},"9f93abd6-f17c-4de8-b9ec-97cd61abdbe7":{"id":"9f93abd6-f17c-4de8-b9ec-97cd61abdbe7","message":{"id":"9f93abd6-f17c-4de8-b9ec-97cd61abdbe7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760341649.416427,"update_time":1760341684.541507,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here is a revised version of **\u201cA Prayer for the Safe Return of Hostages\u201d**, rewritten to emphasize **gratitude, liberation, and renewal** \u2014 recognizing that the hostages are **now free** and returning to life, family, and peace.
