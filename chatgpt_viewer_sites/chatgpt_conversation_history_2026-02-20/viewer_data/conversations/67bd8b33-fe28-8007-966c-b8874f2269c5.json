In that time, I developed frameworks for how to write well and a reputation as a good teacher to learn from. Partially because of the AI wave, I decided to stop teaching. It has only been four months since I shut down my business, but I can no longer imagine teaching writing in a way that resembles anything close to the way I taught in the past.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple: The world of non-fiction writing has fundamentally changed, and many of the skills I've developed and built my career on are becoming increasingly irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThe amount of expertise required to out-do an LLM is rising fast. For example, the quality of a well-prompted, ChatGPT Deep Research report is already higher than what I can produce in a day's worth of work on almost any subject.\r\n\r\nThe question is: What kinds of non-fiction writing will continue to last? Here\u2019s a heuristic: The more a piece of writing comes from personal experience, the less it\u2019s likely to be overtaken by AI. Personal writing, like biographies and memoirs, aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. That's because people have data about their lives that LLMs don\u2019t have.\r\n\r\nHaving a unique perspective helps too. This is Peter Thiel's famous interview question: \"What very important truth do few people agree with you on?\u201d If you have an idiosyncratic way of looking at the world, you don't have much to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe common thread here is humanity. People are also interested in people. Their stories, their struggles, their emotions, their drama, their unique insights into how the world works.\r\n\r\nWant proof? Scroll back to the beginning of this piece. You'll notice that I pulled you in by talking about a battle I\u2019m fighting. If you\u2019ve read this far, it\u2019s because you\u2019re interested in my personal crisis. I haven't thrown any data at you. All I've shared is personal experience.\r\n\r\nThe point is that human interest stories aren't going away. It\u2019s like how computers are already better at playing chess than people, but nobody watches live streams of computers playing chess and Magnus Carlsen is still a huge name. Writing will be the same.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not saying that all writers are screwed. Nor am I saying that we shouldn't teach writing anymore. What I am saying is that the number of people who can gain an audience for their writing and outperform AI has fallen considerably \u2014 and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\nAI will be tougher on writers than it is on readers. Sure readers will have to endure some AI slop, but you can pretty easily avoid it if you're halfway intentional about what you consume. The challenge for non-fiction writers is that every piece of non-fiction writing now competes with the output of ever-improving LLMs and Deep Research reports. I'd say that half of what I read is now LLM-generated (and since time is finite, that means less of my attention is going to human-generated writing).\r\n\r\nGiven everything I\u2019ve said above would I tell my writing students if today was the first day of class?\r\n\r\nI'd start by saying that the bar has been raised. You aren\u2019t just competing against other humans anymore. You're competing against ever-improving LLMs. Fortunately, those same LLMs can help you write better. They\u2019ll instantly give you 80th percentile feedback on your writing, and you can talk through your ideas with them whenever you\u2019re stuck. That's just the beginning, and only a fool would ignore these advancements. I'd also be willing to bet that major changes are coming for the fiction world, but I don't have the first-hand experience to speak about them intelligently.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to discovering ideas, I've also found that jamming with an LLM is more productive than doing it with most people I know (save for a few genius-level conversationalists). And I\u2019m not the only one. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says: \u201cThe new workflow for me is I think with AI and work with my colleagues.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are things to love. There are things to hate. There are things to be excited about and things to be dejected about. I\u2019m neither hopeless nor pollyannish. But my job as your teacher is to point you towards the truth of what\u2019s happening, so you can see it clearly and make a game plan, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel.\r\n\r\nKnow this: What it means to be a journalist, researcher, academic, and full-time author is being rewritten.\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking: \u201cSo David, where are you taking your career?\u201d I\u2019m investing more into personal audio and video. I have a clearer sense for how to build a sustainable competitive advantage in those domains, especially because AI can\u2019t produce high-level video interview content. And whatever writing I do will be more personal and opinionated.\r\n\r\n(And yes, I used AI to write this post)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"91769da2ea74f88e-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"17329619-710a-4e63-a8a2-3e725c6065b2","children":["77d9ed54-dd67-4081-9cdf-406e2ef115ea"]},"77d9ed54-dd67-4081-9cdf-406e2ef115ea":{"id":"77d9ed54-dd67-4081-9cdf-406e2ef115ea","message":{"id":"77d9ed54-dd67-4081-9cdf-406e2ef115ea","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740475232.389892,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"cc98c205-a0c1-4602-b77e-1173b52f7037","request_id":"91769da2ea74f88e-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cc98c205-a0c1-4602-b77e-1173b52f7037","children":["1bcf23e8-468d-42a3-b669-2513fd7dcd6d"]},"1bcf23e8-468d-42a3-b669-2513fd7dcd6d":{"id":"1bcf23e8-468d-42a3-b669-2513fd7dcd6d","message":{"id":"1bcf23e8-468d-42a3-b669-2513fd7dcd6d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740475232.390048,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["This forum post is a candid reflection on how AI is reshaping the landscape of non-fiction writing, leading the author to an existential crisis. It raises several key themes worth analyzing deeply: **the shifting value of human writing, the rise of AI-assisted content creation, competitive pressures on writers, and strategic adaptation in the face of AI advancements**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Declining Value of Traditional Non-Fiction Writing**\nThe author expresses concern that the **bar for non-fiction writing has risen significantly** due to AI's ability to generate well-structured and well-researched content quickly. Traditional skills like summarizing, synthesizing, and structuring arguments\u2014once highly valued\u2014are **now being automated by LLMs** at a level that competes with most human writers. \n\nThis mirrors trends seen in other fields where **automation has displaced skilled professionals**: \n- AI coding assistants reducing demand for junior programmers.\n- AI-generated music and art raising the bar for creative work.\n- Legal AI tools drafting contracts and replacing paralegals.\n\nThis perspective is supported by the fact that AI-generated content is already **widely consumed**\u2014many blogs, research summaries, and even news articles are either partially or entirely written by LLMs. The **invisible encroachment of AI into writing** is real, and many non-fiction writers may not even realize that they\u2019re consuming machine-generated content.\n\n### **2. What Kind of Writing Will Survive?**\nThe author suggests that the **most resilient forms of writing** will be those that rely on:  \n- **Personal Experience** \u2192 Unique life events and firsthand stories that AI can\u2019t fabricate.  \n- **Unique Perspectives** \u2192 Opinions and worldviews that challenge conventional wisdom.  \n- **Human Interest & Storytelling** \u2192 Readers are drawn to the **emotional and dramatic** aspects of human life.\n\nThis aligns with the broader shift in creative industries: **AI is great at generating \u201cstandard\u201d content, but humans excel at originality and emotional nuance**. The analogy to chess is apt\u2014computers are better at playing the game, but people still enjoy watching Magnus Carlsen. Similarly, AI may produce polished, competent writing, but audiences will still seek out **authentic, human voices**.\n\nHowever, a key **counterpoint** is that even **personal experience and storytelling are being augmented by AI**. Many influencers and writers already use AI tools to refine their storytelling, making the boundary between \u201cAI-generated\u201d and \u201chuman-created\u201d increasingly blurry.\n\n### **3. Competitive Pressures & the Shrinking Writing Market**\nOne of the most **sobering points** is that **the number of humans who can sustain a career in writing is shrinking**. The author argues that:\n- Writers are **not just competing against each other anymore**\u2014they're up against machines.\n- AI can **already provide high-level feedback** and act as a brainstorming partner, making writers more productive.\n- The **time and attention economy** is shifting\u2014if AI-generated content takes up more reading time, **human-created writing gets less visibility**.\n\nThis follows the economic principle of **hypercompetition in AI-augmented fields**\u2014as AI raises the quality floor of non-fiction writing, only the **best, most original human writers will survive**. The middle-tier of competent, research-based writing (e.g., freelance articles, corporate reports, thought leadership pieces) **is being automated away**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Adapting to the AI Era: What Comes Next?**\nThe author concludes by sharing their **personal strategy for survival**:\n- **Investing in video and audio** \u2192 AI can generate text, but it struggles with **human charisma, real-time conversation, and high-quality interviews**.\n- **Shifting towards more personal and opinionated writing** \u2192 Being **generic is death** in an AI-dominated world.\n- **Using AI tools rather than fighting them** \u2192 Treating AI as a collaborator rather than a threat.\n\nThis is a **realistic and forward-thinking adaptation**. The idea of **leveraging AI rather than resisting it** is the most pragmatic approach. Many creative professionals are already using AI to enhance, rather than replace, their work.\n\n#### **Possible Future Directions for Writers**\n1. **Hybrid Writing Models** \u2192 Writers will increasingly rely on AI to generate drafts, but **their unique voice and insights will be the differentiator**.\n2. **Interactive & Multimedia Storytelling** \u2192 Writing will integrate **video, podcasts, and interactive content** to remain engaging.\n3. **Hyper-Specialization** \u2192 The most successful writers will cultivate **extreme expertise in niche areas** where AI struggles to replicate deep insight.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Is This Crisis Justified?**\nThe **existential crisis** the author describes is understandable, but **not entirely hopeless**. While AI will continue to erode many writing-based jobs, it also **opens up new possibilities**:\n- AI can **help human writers level up faster**.\n- The **demand for high-quality, personal, and deeply human writing** will persist.\n- Writers who **embrace AI tools will outperform those who resist them**.\n\nThe takeaway is clear: **AI is not killing writing\u2014it is transforming it**. Those who evolve will thrive, while those who rely on old models will struggle. This is a wake-up call, not a death sentence."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"77d9ed54-dd67-4081-9cdf-406e2ef115ea","request_id":"91769da2ea74f88e-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"77d9ed54-dd67-4081-9cdf-406e2ef115ea","children":[]}}}
