Identity Formation Theories\n\n**Ethnogenesis in the Ancient Near East:** The term *ethnogenesis* refers to the process by which a distinct ethnic identity is formed. In the context of ancient Israel, ethnogenesis was a \u201clong, complex process\u201d rather than a single event\u30101\u2020L62-L70\u3011\u30101\u2020L73-L81\u3011. Archaeologist Avraham Faust argues that Israel\u2019s ethnogenesis can be traced to the Iron Age I (c. 1200\u20131000 BCE) through identifiable \u201cethnic markers\u201d in the material record\u30101\u2020L69-L77\u3011. This aligns with broader patterns in the Near East, where new peoples emerged amid the Late Bronze Age collapse (c. 1200 BCE) and its aftermath. The **Arameans** in Syria, for example, appeared between 1100\u2013900 BCE as Amorite-descended tribes forming small states\u301015\u2020L208-L217\u3011\u301015\u2020L229-L237\u3011. Likewise, the **Philistines** arose in coastal Canaan from groups of the \u201cSea Peoples,\u201d blending Aegean and Canaanite cultural elements into a new identity\u30104\u2020L79-L88\u3011. These parallel cases illustrate that Israelite identity did not emerge in isolation, but alongside other regional ethnogeneses during a time of upheaval and migration.\n\n**Social Identity Theory Applied to Ancient Populations:** Modern social identity theory (pioneered by Henri Tajfel) provides a useful framework for understanding how ancient groups like the Israelites formed and maintained identity. Social identity theory emphasizes processes such as categorization (defining who is an insider vs. outsider), boundary formation, and the pursuit of positive distinctiveness for one\u2019s in-group\u301013\u2020L75-L82\u3011. In ancient contexts, these processes often revolved around religion, kinship, and lifestyle. For the early Israelites, identity was partly forged by distinguishing themselves from \u201cothers\u201d \u2013 for instance, defining themselves against the *Canaanites* or *Philistines*. This is evident in boundary-maintaining practices (see Section 2) and in the derogatory use of terms for outsiders. Notably, Egyptian and Mesopotamian records use the term **Habiru/Apiru** to describe rootless or rebellious groups. In the 14th-century BCE Amarna letters, Canaanite kings complain about the *Habiru* raiding their cities\u301036\u2020L115-L123\u3011. While once hypothesized to be early Hebrews, *Habiru* now is understood as a socio-legal category (meaning outlaws or mercenaries) rather than an ethnic label\u301036\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301036\u2020L117-L125\u3011. Nonetheless, some early Israelites may have emerged from Habiru-like elements on society\u2019s fringes, adopting a new identity in contrast to the urban elite\u301036\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301049\u2020L957-L966\u3011. Social identity theory helps explain how such disparate peoples could coalesce: through shared symbols, intergroup differentiation, and collective narratives that foster a sense of \u201cus.\u201d Competition and conflict often intensified this process, as pressure from external enemies encouraged the tribes of Israel to see themselves as one people\u301052\u2020L1061-L1069\u3011.\n\n**The Role of Shared Narrative in Group Formation:** A powerful catalyst for Israelite identity was the development of a shared origin narrative. The Exodus story \u2013 telling of bondage in Egypt, divine deliverance, and a covenant forged at Sinai \u2013 became a foundational myth that bound the Israelite tribes together. Even if historically embellished or compiled later, this narrative served \u201cas a unifying national myth for a diverse and regionally scattered population\u201d\u301019\u2020L426-L434\u3011. By repeatedly retelling the Exodus and wilderness saga, ancient Israelites reinforced a collective memory of liberation by **Yahweh**, their God. This shared story provided \u201ca sense of \u2018us-ness\u2019\u201d and a divine purpose\u30108\u2020L25-L31\u3011. It established core identity markers: Israel was the people whom Yahweh saved and to whom He gave law. Such narrative identity had practical effects: it fostered solidarity across tribal lines and upheld an ethical ideal (loyalty to the covenant) that distinguished Israel from others\u301019\u2020L448-L457\u3011\u301019\u2020L459-L468\u3011. The importance of shared narrative aligns with anthropological insights that myth and memory create social cohesion. In the Hebrew Bible, commands to commemorate the Exodus (e.g. Passover rites and reciting the story to one\u2019s children) institutionalized this memory as a cornerstone of identity (cf. Exod. 12:26\u201327; Deut. 6:20-25). Scholars applying social identity models note that the Exodus narrative encapsulates many elements that build group identity: a common ancestor/hero (Moses), a defining moment of salvation, a covenant law, and the portrayal of foreign nations as the \u201cother\u201d\u301013\u2020L75-L82\u3011\u301019\u2020L430-L439\u3011. Over time, this narrative was invoked by prophets and reformers to call the Israelites to unity and exclusive loyalty to Yahweh, further solidifying the boundaries of the group.\n\n**Comparison with Other Emerging Ethnicities:** The Israelites were one among several new peoples in the Iron Age southern Levant, and comparing their identity formation with groups like the Arameans and Philistines highlights both common patterns and unique features. The **Philistines** offer a contrast: whereas Israel\u2019s identity crystalized out of indigenous Canaanite society, the Philistines were newcomers from the Aegean world. Early Philistine material culture (12th century BCE) is marked by Mycenaean-style pottery and distinct architecture\u30104\u2020L59-L68\u3011\u30104\u2020L79-L88\u3011, suggesting a migrant origin. Yet even the Philistines did not remain a monolithic \u201csea peoples\u201d group \u2013 their culture became an *\u201centangled\u201d culture* as they absorbed influences from neighboring Canaanites over the 12th\u201310th centuries BCE\u30104\u2020L79-L88\u3011. What parallels Israel is the **process**: a blend of multiple origins and traditions merging into a \u201cnew cultural entity\u201d\u30104\u2020L83-L91\u3011. The Philistines maintained clear ethnic boundaries for a time (e.g. their cuisine included pork, unlike Israelites, see Section 2), but over generations their Aegean traits waned and a Levantine identity (Philistine proper) emerged\u30104\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u30104\u2020L79-L87\u3011. The **Arameans**, similarly, arose from a mix of nomadic tribes and local populations in Syria. They spoke a West Semitic language (Aramaic) and between 1100\u2013900 BCE established small kingdoms like Aram-Damascus\u301015\u2020L208-L217\u3011\u301015\u2020L229-L237\u3011. Assyrian records depict the Arameans as initially semi-nomadic (the \u201cAhlamu\u201d) who settled and displaced older groups\u301015\u2020L209-L218\u3011. Like Israel, the Arameans did not have a single founding hero story on the order of the Exodus; their identity gelled gradually through shared language and religion (with the god Hadad often central) and through the external threat of Assyrian campaigns. In sum, all these emerging ethnicities were products of the Late Bronze\u2013Iron Age transition, forging identities via a combination of **shared culture**, **socio-political realities**, and **opposition to others**. Israel\u2019s case is distinguished by the prominence of a religious-national saga (the Exodus) and the eventual development of a strongly monotheistic ideology, but in their early stages the Israelites were very much like their neighbors in negotiating a new identity out of old components.\n\n## 2. Distinguishing Features of Early Israelite Identity\n\nDespite their Canaanite roots, the early Israelites gradually developed a cluster of distinguishing cultural features that set them apart. These included religious practices, social organization, legal traditions, and purity customs that together served as identity markers and boundary mechanisms vis-\u00e0-vis other peoples.\n\n**Religion \u2013 From Monolatry to Monotheism:** The religious trajectory of Israel is often summarized as moving from *monolatry* (worship of one god without denying the existence of others) toward *monotheism* (belief that only one god exists). Archaeologically and textually, it is clear that Iron Age Israelites initially worshipped Yahweh as their primary national god *alongside* other deities. Israelite religion \u201cwas a derivative of the Canaanite religion\u201d\u301017\u2020L217-L225\u3011, inheriting a pantheon headed by El and Asherah (who may have been viewed as Yahweh\u2019s consort in early folk religion)\u301017\u2020L219-L227\u3011. Through most of the monarchic period, average Israelites were effectively polytheistic: for instance, inscriptions from Kuntillat \u2018Ajrud (c. 8th century BCE) invoke \u201cYahweh and his Asherah,\u201d attesting to pluralism. However, Israel\u2019s identity began to differentiate in its **exclusive** loyalty to Yahweh. Biblical narratives portray figures like Joshua and Elijah insisting that Yahweh alone is the God of Israel, hinting that a monolatrous ideal was promoted from early on. Scholars generally agree that strict monotheism only emerged later (during the exilic or post-exilic period), but the roots of that development lie in the earlier **Yahwistic focus**. By the end of the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), Israelite religion had largely purged the recognition of other gods and \u201ctransitioned towards monotheism\u201d\u301017\u2020L239-L248\u3011, with Yahweh proclaimed as creator and sole deity. This religious distinction became a core ethnic marker: whereas Canaanites might worship Baal or Astarte, and Moabites Chemosh, Israelites prided themselves on worshipping Yahweh *above all*. Even before full monotheism, outsiders noticed this focus \u2013 e.g. the Moabite King Mesha refers to Israel\u2019s god Yahweh in his 9th-century BCE stele\u301041\u2020L201-L209\u3011, indicating that the Israelites\u2019 devotion to Yahweh was a recognized trait. In sum, the shift from a largely **Yahweh-centric cult** (monolatry) to **Yahweh-only faith** (monotheism) set Israel apart in the religiously pluralistic milieu of the Near East\u301017\u2020L239-L248\u3011\u301017\u2020L279-L282\u3011. This was both a theological evolution and an identity-shaping process: prophets and reformers used Yahweh-alone worship as a rallying cry to reinforce Israel\u2019s distinctiveness (e.g. the rejection of Baal in 1 Kings 18, or Josiah\u2019s reforms in 2 Kings 23).\n\n**Social Structure \u2013 Egalitarian Villages vs. Canaanite City-States:** One of the starkest differences between early Israelite society and the preceding Canaanite culture lay in settlement patterns and social organization. Late Bronze Age Canaan was dominated by **city-states** \u2013 fortified urban centers like Hazor, Megiddo, and Jerusalem \u2013 ruled by kings and stratified by class. These cities featured palaces and temples and were deeply integrated into imperial economies (Egyptian vassalage)\u301019\u2020L371-L380\u3011\u301036\u2020L139-L146\u3011. By contrast, when the early Israelites emerged (Iron Age I), they did so in the **central hill country** as a network of small, agrarian villages. Archaeological surveys have identified a dramatic spike in rural hill country settlements around 1200\u20131000 BCE: the highland village count rose from only a few dozen to over 300 sites, and the population doubled\u301053\u2020L1012-L1020\u3011\u301053\u2020L1013-L1021\u3011. These villages were typically unwalled, with just a few hundred inhabitants each, and notably **lacked the hallmarks of elite urban culture**. Excavations reveal an absence of opulent buildings or imported luxury goods in the Iron I highlands\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Instead, houses were fairly uniform (the \u201cfour-room\u201d house design became common \u2013 see below) and the community layout suggests a relatively **egalitarian social structure**. Scholars interpret the stark simplicity of material culture as reflecting an \u201cideological\u2026egalitarian ideal,\u201d a conscious rejection of the oppressive palace society of Canaan\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Norman Gottwald famously argued that Israel began as an egalitarian peasant revolt, and even though that specific scenario is debated, the archaeological evidence does indicate a leveling of social distinctions\u30101\u2020L87-L96\u3011\u30101\u2020L97-L100\u3011. For example, the ubiquitous **four-room house** \u2013 a modest mudbrick dwelling with a standard floor plan \u2013 is found in these villages with little variation in size or luxury, suggesting a society of smallholder families with no great economic stratification\u30101\u2020L96-L104\u3011. This stands in contrast to Canaanite cities, where grand mansions and hovel quarters attested to class inequality. Furthermore, early Israel had *no monarchy or central bureaucracy* during this village phase. As Judges 21:25 summarizes, \u201cthere was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.\u201d While this biblical note highlights disorder, it also reflects the decentralized reality of Israel\u2019s tribal society (see Section 4). In anthropological terms, Israel in Iron I was a **segmentary tribal society**, whereas Canaan was a collection of city-states with hierarchical government. The highland villagers likely formed a tight-knit, kinship-based social system (clans and tribes) that made collective decisions through elders or ad hoc leaders (the \u201cjudges\u201d), very different from the dynastic kingships of their Canaanite neighbors\u301048\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301052\u2020L1059-L1068\u3011. This difference in social structure \u2013 egalitarian and kinship-oriented vs. stratified and state-oriented \u2013 became a defining feature of Israelite identity in its formative years.\n\n**Legal Traditions \u2013 Biblical Law vs. Mesopotamian Codes:** Law is another arena where Israelite culture can be compared with surrounding civilizations. The Israelites inherited common Near Eastern legal principles, but their law collections (as preserved in the Bible) also exhibit distinctive emphases. A famous point of comparison is the **Covenant Code** in Exodus (chapters 20\u201323) versus the Babylonian **Code of Hammurabi** (c. 1750 BCE). There are indeed striking parallels: for example, Hammurabi\u2019s Law 117 permits a debtor to sell himself and his family into labor for three years to satisfy a debt, with release in the fourth year, while Exodus 21:2 similarly decrees that a Hebrew slave serve six years and go free in the seventh\u301023\u2020L151-L159\u3011. Likewise, both corpora address false accusations: Hammurabi\u2019s first law mandates death for one who cannot prove an accusation (i.e. perjury)\u301023\u2020L142-L150\u3011, while Exodus 20:16 prohibits bearing false witness\u301023\u2020L144-L150\u3011. Such overlaps suggest a shared legal heritage or influence.\u301023\u2020L109-L117\u3011\u301023\u2020L142-L150\u3011 Some scholars (e.g. David Wright) have argued that Israel\u2019s laws are directly dependent on Mesopotamian precedents, essentially a \u201ccreative rewriting\u201d of older Near Eastern laws\u301023\u2020L111-L119\u3011. However, other experts note that even where the \u201cletter\u201d of laws is similar, the \u201cspirit\u201d can differ significantly\u301023\u2020L119-L127\u3011. Unlike Hammurabi\u2019s Code, which is a royal decree emphasizing the king\u2019s role as lawgiver, biblical law is framed as divine revelation (Moses receives Torah from God) \u2013 underscoring Israel\u2019s self-concept as a covenant community under God\u2019s sovereignty rather than a human king\u2019s edict. Moreover, Mesopotamian law was often class-based (Hammurabi makes different provisions for offenses against nobles, commoners, or slaves), whereas biblical law tends to flatten class distinctions in moral value (e.g. \u201cone law for the native and the stranger\u201d in Numbers 15:16) and shows humanitarian concerns (the Sabbath rest extends to slaves and even animals, debt slaves are freed in the Jubilee, etc.). Scholars have noted that the Mosaic law codes reflect a more **egalitarian ethos** compared to their Mesopotamian counterparts\u301023\u2020L119-L127\u3011. For instance, where Hammurabi\u2019s laws accept brutal retaliatory justice primarily among equals, biblical law begins to inject ethical and theological rationales (every person is seen as created in God\u2019s image, placing some limits on punishment). Additionally, Israel\u2019s prophetic and narrative traditions stress *justice for the widow, orphan, and poor* \u2013 legal principles grounded in Israel\u2019s own memory of being oppressed in Egypt (cf. Exod. 22:21-22). These nuances suggest that, as part of their identity, the Israelites saw their law as a reflection of their unique relationship with Yahweh, distinguishing them from other nations. That said, the **shared ancient Near Eastern legal culture** means Israelite law was not invented from scratch; it evolved from older models like Hammurabi\u2019s code, even as it imbued them with new theological meaning\u301023\u2020L109-L117\u3011\u301023\u2020L119-L127\u3011.\n\n**Dietary and Purity Laws as Boundary Markers:** The Torah\u2019s detailed regulations on food and purity set Israel apart in very tangible ways. Dietary laws (kashrut), especially the prohibition on certain animals, acted as ethnic boundary markers by regulating commensality \u2013 whom one could eat with and what one could eat. Notably, the consumption of **pork** was taboo for Israelites (Leviticus 11:7), and this has left an archaeological signature: pig bones are exceedingly rare in Iron Age highland sites associated with Israel, whereas they are common in contemporary Philistine sites on the coastal plain\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. For a time, scholars trumpeted the absence of pig bones as a definitive ethnic marker of Israelite sites, distinguishing them from \u201cuncircumcised\u201d Philistine or Canaanite settlements. More recent studies caution that the picture is complex \u2013 some non-Israelite groups also avoided pigs for ecological or economic reasons\u301019\u2020L401-L409\u3011, and some early Israelite sites do have a few pig remains. Nevertheless, the **overall pattern** holds: early Israelites overwhelmingly raised and ate sheep, goats, cattle, but not swine, aligning with their dietary law\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. Food customs, in general, are \u201cfundamental ways in which a community or ethnic group can self-define and maintain social boundaries\u201d\u301026\u2020L5-L8\u3011. The biblical laws further banned eating creatures like shellfish, carrion-eating birds, and certain insects, behaviors which would have set Israelites apart from neighbors who had no such scruples (Philistines, for example, had no prohibition on pork or seafood). Beyond diet, laws of **ritual purity** (e.g. regulations on skin diseases, corpse contamination, and bodily emissions in Leviticus) also reinforced group identity. These purity norms made the Israelite way of life distinct and sometimes inconvenient in mixed settings, thereby discouraging assimilation. The book of Leviticus explicitly links Israel\u2019s food laws to holiness: \u201cI have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine\u201d (Lev. 20:25\u201326). In practical terms, such laws would limit social mingling (you couldn\u2019t easily share meals with Philistines who ate pork or with Canaanites who did not tithe or purity-wash as you did). They also fostered internal cohesion \u2013 every Israelite, high or low, was bound by the same purity code, symbolically leveling them as members of one holy community. Anthropologists observe that **boundary-marking practices** (dietary taboos, dress codes, etc.) are common in ethnic formation; for Israel, **circumcision** was another key example.\n\n**Circumcision Practices in Regional Context:** Male circumcision was a physical marker of the covenant between Yahweh and Israel (instituted for Abraham\u2019s household in Genesis 17). By Iron Age times, this practice set Israelite males apart from certain neighbors. Ironically, circumcision was not unique to Israel \u2013 Egyptians and many Canaanites/Phoenicians practiced it as well (Herodotus in the 5th century BCE noted that Egyptians, Colchians, and \u201cSyrians of Palestine\u201d [likely Phoenicians] circumcised their males)\u301033\u2020L189-L197\u3011. However, the **Philistines** pointedly did *not* circumcise, which the Bible emphasizes by repeatedly calling them \u201cuncircumcised Philistines\u201d (e.g. 1 Samuel 17:26). This contrast was so stark that it became an epithet for Philistines and a shorthand for \u201cnon-Israelite\u201d in general. A famous incident in 1 Samuel 18 has King Saul demand a bride-price of 100 Philistine foreskins \u2013 a gory tally made possible only because Philistines were uncircumcised; collecting the foreskins of Israelites would have been unthinkable\u301032\u2020L11-L18\u3011. Thus, circumcision functioned as an ethnic demarcator between Israel and certain neighbors (Philistines, and perhaps others like some of the Sea Peoples). Even among circumcising cultures, Israel\u2019s practice had distinctive features: it was normally performed on infants at eight days old (rather than at puberty, as in some African or Egyptian traditions), and it carried a deep religious significance as \u201cthe sign of the covenant.\u201d By the late pre-exilic period, Israelites saw uncircumcision as a stigma \u2013 Jeremiah 9:25, for instance, lists Egypt, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and the desert tribes as \u201cuncircumcised\u201d in flesh (even though historically some of those may have practiced circumcision) to make a theological point that all nations are uncovenanted. The **persistence of circumcision** through exile into Second Temple Judaism (when many other practices lapsed or changed) underscores its importance as an identity marker. In sum, the *bodily rite* of circumcision, the *behavioural codes* of diet and purity, and the *ritual focus* on Yahweh distinguished the Israelite way of life. These features acted as what scholars call **\u201cboundary markers\u201d** \u2013 cultural signals that maintained the distinction between Israel and \u201cthe nations\u201d (goyim). They reinforced internal solidarity (\u201cwe follow God\u2019s laws that others do not\u201d) and provided visible/audible cues of difference (foreigners could easily notice that Israelites refused pork or kept Sabbath or circumcised their sons, etc.). Such practices, combined with the social and religious structures noted above, collectively formed the mosaic of early Israelite identity.\n\n## 3. External Perceptions of Israel and Its Identity\n\nHow did contemporaneous external sources view the people we call Israelites? In the fragmentary mentions that survive from Egypt and Mesopotamia, we gain valuable outsider perspectives that both corroborate and illuminate Israel\u2019s emerging identity. These sources often use their own terminology (e.g. \u201cHabiru,\u201d \u201cHouse of Omri\u201d) rather than Israel\u2019s self-chosen labels, and they sometimes shed light on how Israel was distinguished from other groups in the region.\n\n**Egyptian Texts \u2013 From \u2018Apiru to Israel:** The earliest potential references to the ancestors of Israel come from New Kingdom Egypt. The Amarna Letters (14th century BCE), a cache of cuneiform correspondence between Canaanite vassal kings and Pharaoh, frequently mention the **\u2018Apiru (Habiru)** as destabilizing elements in Canaan. As noted, *Habiru* was a broad term for social outcasts or rebels and not an ethnic identifier\u301036\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301036\u2020L117-L125\u3011. Some earlier scholars saw \u201cHabiru\u201d as linguistically akin to \u201cHebrew\u201d (Ivri), but this connection remains speculative and indirect\u301042\u2020L13-L22\u3011\u301042\u2020L25-L34\u3011. The significance of the Habiru references is that they describe bands of uprooted people attacking cities and aligning with rival princes\u301036\u2020L115-L123\u3011 \u2013 a scenario not unlike the biblical portrayal of Israel\u2019s tribes conquering Canaan in Joshua or fighting Canaanite kings in Judges. Modern scholarship mostly concludes the Habiru were a mixed lot (mercenaries, brigands, escapees) present throughout the Near East\u301036\u2020L42-L51\u3011\u301036\u2020L79-L87\u3011. While the Habiru were **not** synonymous with \u201cIsraelites,\u201d it\u2019s plausible that early Israel absorbed some of these marginal groups, or that later Israelite collective memory of conquest/rebellion echoes the Habiru phenomenon. The first **explicit** mention of Israel by name occurs in the **Merneptah Stele** from Egypt, dated to circa 1208 BCE. This victory stele of Pharaoh Merneptah includes a line proclaiming *\u201cIsrael is laid waste, his seed is no more\u201d*\u301053\u2020L992-L1000\u3011. Importantly, the Egyptian text uses a hieroglyphic determinative indicating that this \u201cIsrael\u201d is a people or tribal group, not a city-state\u301053\u2020L994-L998\u3011. In the stele\u2019s list of defeated entities in Canaan, Israel appears alongside place-names like Ashkelon and Gezer, suggesting that by 1208 BCE a group known as Israel was significant enough to be deemed an enemy of Egypt\u301053\u2020L994-L1000\u3011. This extrabiblical attestation firmly anchors Israel in Canaan by the late 13th century and reveals how Egyptians viewed them: as a *people without a king or city*. The phrase \u201chis seed is not\u201d implies Egypt saw Israel in terms of its progeny/agricultural viability (perhaps metaphorically boasting of wiping out their lineage or food supply). While propagandistic, Merneptah\u2019s stele provides a crucial snapshot: from an external view, Israel circa 1208 was a socio-political entity distinct from Canaan\u2019s city-states\u301053\u2020L994-L1000\u3011. Some scholars have inferred that Israel at this time was semi-nomadic or tribal due to the determinative and the lack of associated town name\u301053\u2020L995-L998\u3011. In any case, the Egyptians did not call them \u201cCanaanites\u201d; the name *Israel* itself (root *YSR-L*, likely meaning \u201cEl/God fights\u201d) might have been learned by the Egyptians from local usage. This indicates the Israelites had begun to see themselves (and be seen by others) as a coherent group, with a shared name, by the end of the 13th century BCE\u301053\u2020L994-L1000\u3011.\n\n**Assyrian and Moabite Records \u2013 House of Omri and House of David:** By the 9th century BCE, the Israelites had formed kingdoms, and foreign powers referred to them using the names of their founding dynasties. The **northern Kingdom of Israel** was known to Assyrians as \u201cB\u00eet Humri\u201d \u2013 **House of Omri** \u2013 after the Israelite King Omri who founded Samaria and whose dynasty (including Ahab) was noteworthy in regional politics\u301040\u2020L7-L15\u3011. Assyrian inscriptions continued to use \u201cHouse of Omri\u201d as a designation for Israel long after Omri\u2019s line was dethroned, showing how strongly that name stuck in the imperial imagination\u301040\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301040\u2020L19-L28\u3011. For example, the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III (c. 841 BCE) depicts King Jehu of Israel (who was not Omri\u2019s descendant) bringing tribute and labels him \u201cson of Omri\u201d or belonging to Omri\u2019s house\u301038\u2020L21-L25\u3011. This suggests that to outsiders, Israel\u2019s identity was tied to its *monarchy and state*, not just its ethnic name \u2013 the kingdom was effectively synonymous with its ruling house. Similarly, in Mesha\u2019s **Moabite Stele** (c. 840 BCE), King Mesha of Moab describes his rebellion against the Israelites and pointedly calls them \u201cthe **House of Omri**.\u201d He states that Omri had oppressed Moab on behalf of Israel\u2019s god for many years, until Mesha\u2019s own god Chemosh enabled victory\u301041\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301041\u2020L201-L209\u3011. Mesha\u2019s inscription thus confirms that Israel (or at least the northern kingdom) was seen as \u201cOmri\u2019s realm\u201d and that Israel\u2019s **God (Yahweh)** was acknowledged by name in Moab\u301041\u2020L201-L209\u3011. The stele even contains the earliest extrabiblical mention of \u201cYahweh\u201d (rendered as YHWH) in line with Mesha\u2019s claim that he captured Nebo and \u201cdragged the vessels of Yahweh\u201d before Chemosh\u301041\u2020L203-L211\u3011. From Moab\u2019s perspective, then, the Israelites were a distinct people defined by their king (Omri\u2019s dynasty) and their deity (Yahweh) \u2013 a neighboring nation to be contested and defeated\u301041\u2020L203-L210\u3011. Meanwhile, the southern Kingdom of **Judah** was recognized by the Assyrians and others as the **House of David (B\u00eet Dawid)**. The most famous reference is on the **Tel Dan Stele** (a fragmentary Aramaic inscription from the late 9th century BCE, found in northern Israel), which celebrates an Aramean king\u2019s victory and claims to have killed a king of the \u201cHouse of David\u201d\u301037\u2020L11-L18\u3011. This phrase unequivocally refers to the dynasty of David ruling in Jerusalem, marking David as a historical founder of the Judahite royal line. The Tel Dan Stele is significant as it shows that barely a century after David\u2019s supposed reign, surrounding peoples knew of a Judahite entity named after him\u301040\u2020L23-L28\u3011. Likewise, the Assyrians, in their records of campaigning in the region, sometimes distinguished between Israel (House of Omri) and Judah (House of David)\u301040\u2020L23-L28\u3011. For instance, the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in the 8th century mentioned Jehoahaz of \u201cJudah\u201d in a tribute list, indicating Assyria\u2019s awareness of Judah as a separate kingdom (though not using \u201cHouse of David\u201d in that fragment). Another late Assyrian text apparently uses *B\u00eet \u1e0eaw\u00eed* as a term for the area of Judah. Together, these external references confirm that by the 9th\u20138th centuries, the identity of Israel and Judah as nation-states was established in the geopolitical sphere. **Foreigners identified them with their ruling houses**, much as they referred to Aram-Damascus as the \u201cHouse of Hazael\u201d\u301040\u2020L25-L28\u3011. This dynastic naming underscores the importance of kingship in ancient identity, but it also corroborates the existence of a Davidic line, an integral part of Judah\u2019s self-identity in the Bible. \n\n\u301063\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Fragments of the Tel Dan Stele (9th century BCE), an Aramaic inscription that references the \u201cHouse of David\u201d (byt dwd) as the ruling dynasty of Judah\u301040\u2020L23-L28\u3011. This is the earliest archaeological evidence of King David\u2019s lineage, reflecting how neighboring Arameans perceived Judah\u2019s identity through its founder-king.* \n\n**Neighboring Perspectives and Nomenclature (Hebrews, Israelites, Judeans):** Different outsiders used different terms for the people of Israel/Judah over time, reflecting both shifts in Israelite identity and the outsiders\u2019 viewpoints. The term **\u201cHebrew\u201d** (Heb. *Ivri*) is interestingly rare in foreign records but appears in the Bible often in contexts of foreigners speaking or in older stories (e.g. the Egyptians call the slaves \u201cHebrews\u201d in Exodus). Scholars note that *\u201cHebrew was almost certainly not originally an ethnic designation\u201d* within Israel\u301042\u2020L25-L33\u3011. It seems to have been applied by others to Israelites, perhaps meaning \u201cpeople from across (the river)\u201d or derived from a social term (*Habiru*). Crucially, *none* of Israel\u2019s neighbors in known inscriptions refer to them as \u201cHebrews,\u201d and the Hebrew Bible never calls the nation \u201cthe Hebrew people\u201d in narrative voice\u301042\u2020L25-L33\u3011. Rather, \u201cHebrew\u201d is used when Israelites are in contact with foreigners or in multi-ethnic settings (e.g. Philistines calling David and his band \u201cHebrews\u201d in 1 Samuel 29:3)\u301042\u2020L39-L47\u3011. This suggests \u201cHebrew\u201d carried a connotation akin to *outsider or sojourner*. Indeed, 1 Samuel 14:21 draws a distinction between \u201cHebrews\u201d and \u201cIsraelites,\u201d implying that not all Hebrews were Israelites until they switched loyalty\u301042\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u301042\u2020L43-L50\u3011. We might infer that neighboring peoples like the Philistines used \u201cHebrews\u201d as a catch-all for these hill people who lived on the margins of Canaanite society \u2013 a term seen from the outside. Over time, as Israel established formal states, the terms **\u201cIsraelites\u201d** and **\u201cJudeans\u201d** (Yehudim, origin of \u201cJews\u201d) became the standard. \u201cIsraelite\u201d (*Yisraeli*) was initially the identity of all the tribes descended from Israel/Jacob; after the kingdom split (c. 930 BCE), **\u201cIsraelite\u201d often specifically meant members of the northern kingdom**, while those of the southern kingdom were \u201cJudahites/Judeans.\u201d The Bible maintains \u201cIsrael\u201d as an overall spiritual identity (and post-722 BCE Judeans still saw themselves as Israel in a broader sense), but in, say, Assyrian usage, *Israel* vs. *Judah* were distinct entities. By the 6th\u20135th centuries BCE, when the southern people were exiled and returned, the term **\u201cJudean\u201d (Jew)** took hold as the primary name for the people of Judah (and by extension all Israel, since Judah was what remained). This evolution of nomenclature \u2013 from *Habiru* to *Hebrew* to *Israelite* to *Judean/Jew* \u2013 reflects changing contexts. Early on, the Israelites were seen as a loose group of upland clans (Habiru/Hebrews). With nationhood, they were the Israelites of Omri\u2019s or David\u2019s house. After the fall of the northern tribes, the identity consolidated around Judah (Judeans), which after the exile gave rise to the term \u201cJew.\u201d Notably, even these terms carried nuances of insider vs. outsider perspective. For example, texts from the Persian period refer to the community in Yehud (Judah) as *Yehudim* (Jews), and the Bible\u2019s post-exilic books (like Ezra-Nehemiah) adopt that term, whereas pre-exilic texts prefer \u201cIsraelites.\u201d Thus, external pressures and administrative labels (like the Persian province name Yehud) influenced identity terms. In summary, neighboring peoples perceived the Israelites first as semi-nomadic \u201cHebrews,\u201d then as the people of particular kings or dynasties (\u201cHouse of Omri,\u201d \u201cof David\u201d), and finally as the people of Judah (Jews). Each label highlights a facet of identity: *Hebrew* emphasizing socio-geographic otherness, *Israelite* emphasizing lineage from a common ancestor, and *Judean* emphasizing political-territorial identity in Judah. The fact that *neighbors rarely if ever used the term \u201cIsraelite\u201d in inscriptions* (they preferred dynastic terms) is a reminder that our modern ethnic terms may not fully overlap with ancient categories \u2013 *ethnicity, statehood, and dynasty were intertwined* in antiquity. Nevertheless, the foreign witness confirms that by the Iron Age, the people of Israel/Judah were seen as a distinct ethnic-national group, with their own land, kings, and god.\n\n## 4. Internal Development of Israelite Identity\n\nWithin the Israelite community itself, identity was not static; it underwent significant development from the initial tribal confederation to the more centralized monarchy and beyond. Several key phases and factors in Israel\u2019s internal evolution can be discerned: the loose tribal league of the **Judges period**, the unifying force of **Yahwistic religion**, the crystallization of a national narrative (e.g. the **Exodus**), and the eventual pressures that led to monarchy and a more exclusive identity.\n\n**Tribal Confederation and the Amphictyony Debate:** According to the Bible, after the settlement in Canaan but before the rise of kings, Israel existed as a federation of twelve tribes with no permanent central authority. Early biblical poetry (like the *Song of Deborah* in Judges 5) gives a glimpse of this period, depicting a coalition of tribes fighting together against a Canaanite oppressor\u301052\u2020L1059-L1068\u3011. In the mid-20th century, scholar Martin Noth theorized that Israel\u2019s twelve-tribe system was organized as an *amphictyony* \u2013 a term drawn from ancient Greek leagues of tribes centered on a shared sanctuary (such as Delphi) with a rotating leadership. Noth suggested that pre-monarchic Israel had a similar arrangement: twelve tribes bound in a sacred covenant to Yahweh, possibly gathering at Shiloh or Shechem for joint festivals, which provided an institutional unity\u301044\u2020L222-L231\u3011\u301044\u2020L225-L233\u3011. This hypothesis attempted to explain how Israel functioned as a nation without a king \u2013 essentially as a religious league. However, the amphictyony model has been widely critiqued and is largely rejected today. Scholars point out that it imposes a Greek analogy that doesn\u2019t quite fit Israel\u2019s context\u301044\u2020L228-L235\u3011. For one, **archaeology has not confirmed a centralized pre-monarchic sanctuary** of the sort required; multiple cult sites existed (Shiloh, Bethel, Gilgal, Dan, etc.), and there was no single Delphic oracle equivalent. Also, the number *twelve* may be a later schematization \u2013 biblical tribal lists vary (e.g. some omit Levi or Joseph\u2019s sons are split), suggesting the full twelve-tribe roster was not fixed early on\u301044\u2020L230-L238\u3011. Moreover, in Greece the amphictyony was solely a religious alliance, whereas in Israel\u2019s case the tribal union had social, military, and political dimensions beyond just cult\u301044\u2020L230-L238\u3011. Recent scholarship instead emphasizes **kinship bonds** and pragmatic alliances: the tribes were organized around extended families and clans, and they could band together in war when necessary\u301052\u2020L1059-L1068\u3011. There may have been an informal sense of a \u201cleague\u201d \u2013 the Hebrew term *edah* (congregation) and *am* (people) are used for Israel in this period \u2013 but no standing council of all tribes is evidenced apart from the ad hoc gatherings under leaders like Deborah or Samuel. In summary, Israel\u2019s initial internal structure was a *loose confederation*: \u201ca loose tribal confederation in the hill country, without a centralized government\u201d\u301048\u2020L1-L9\u3011. This means that identity at this stage was primarily tribal (e.g. \u201cI am a Benjaminite, you are an Ephraimite\u201d) moderated by an overarching sense of common ancestry and faith (worship of Yahweh as the *God of Israel*). **Tribal identities** could at times trump national unity \u2013 as the Book of Judges reports, some tribes failed to answer calls to arms (Judg. 5:16-17 chastises Reuben, Gilead, Dan, etc., for not joining the fight). Yet, the very preservation of those critiques in Israel\u2019s literature indicates a remembered ideal of solidarity. The periodic assemblies, shared sanctuaries, and inter-tribal marriages all helped maintain a cultural unity-in-diversity. The tribal confederation period thus served as the *crucible of Israelite identity*: it forged a people out of disparate clans by means of common language, intermingling, collective memory of Exodus/conquest, and above all **Yahwism** as a unifying religion.\n\n**The Role of Yahwism in Group Cohesion:** If any single factor held the tribal confederation together, it was the worship of *Yahweh* as the national God. Scholars believe that \u201cthe shared worship of Yahweh played a role in the emergence of Israel\u201d as a distinct group\u301017\u2020L279-L282\u3011. Unlike their Canaanite neighbors who each had patron deities (Tyre had Melqart, Moab had Chemosh, etc.), the Israelite tribes \u2013 despite geographical spread \u2013 increasingly rallied around *Yahweh of Israel*. Early on, Yahweh may have been regionally worshipped in the southern deserts (some think the Midianites or Shasu contributed Yahweh to Israel\u2019s religion\u301046\u2020L899-L907\u3011), but by the time Israel was in Canaan, Yahwism became their defining cult. The Ark of the Covenant, a central symbol in the narratives, is portrayed as a unifying religious artifact that traveled between tribal areas, symbolizing Yahweh\u2019s presence leading all Israel. When the tribes are described assembling, it\u2019s often in the context of religious acts \u2013 e.g. renewing the covenant (Joshua 24 at Shechem) or crying out to Yahweh together for deliverance (Judges 2:4-5). This suggests that **covenantal theology** was a key integrative force: the concept that all tribes were bound by the covenant with Yahweh given through Moses. Indeed, the very term \u201ccongregation of Israel\u201d implies a religious assembly. Yahwism provided common rituals (like the Passover, if it was observed, or later the festivals of Yahweh) that all tribes could partake in, transcending local affiliations. It also provided a moral-legal framework (the Torah) that applied to everyone, creating a sense of shared values and norms. In group identity terms, Yahwism was an *in-group badge*: those who participated in the Yahweh-alone covenant were part of Israel; those who worshipped Baal or other gods were behaving \u201clike the nations\u201d and could be deemed outsiders (hence biblical polemics against idolatry function not just as theological statements but as boundary enforcement within the identity). One can observe that during crises in Judges, it\u2019s often a return to Yahweh that precedes victory, implying that fidelity to Yahweh equates to national strength and unity. The stories of internal conflict (like the near civil war with Benjamin in Judges 20) are resolved on religious grounds (consulting Yahweh\u2019s oracle, making offerings) as if to say that divine guidance was the arbiter among tribes. In short, **Yahwism created a spiritual nationalism** that was critical to Israel\u2019s identity. Over time, especially by the late monarchy and exile, this religious identity became even more paramount \u2013 when land and king were lost, it was the worship of Yahweh (now fully monotheistic Judaism) that preserved Israel\u2019s identity. But even in the earliest stage, we can infer that a Moabite could become an Israelite (e.g. Ruth the Moabitess) by adopting Yahweh and joining the community, whereas an Israelite who abandoned Yahweh for other gods was seen as betraying Israel. Such was the centrality of Yahwism to group cohesion and definition.\n\n**The Exodus and Conquest as Foundational Mythos:** Internally, the Israelite identity coalesced around certain shared narratives of origin, chief among them the Exodus from Egypt and the subsequent conquest/settlement of Canaan. As discussed, these stories likely took shape over time (and may telescope the experiences of only some groups into a national epic), but by the time of the monarchy, they were firmly entrenched as *the* story of Israel\u2019s birth. The Exodus narrative in particular served as what scholars call a **charter myth**: it explained to the Israelites who they were (former slaves freed by Yahweh\u2019s mighty hand), why they were special (chosen by God, given a covenant), and what their mission was (to live as a holy nation in a promised land)\u301019\u2020L428-L436\u3011\u301019\u2020L448-L457\u3011. This saga was \u201ccalled upon throughout Scripture\u201d and was pivotal for the community\u2019s self-understanding\u301013\u2020L43-L51\u3011\u301013\u2020L47-L55\u3011. During the Judges period and early monarchy, the Exodus story and the figure of Moses likely already functioned as historical memory that bound the tribes beyond immediate kin ties. The **Book of Judges** even uses the refrain that the Israelites did evil and forgot Yahweh \u201cwho had brought them out of Egypt,\u201d implying that the author expected this memory to have been a deterrent to unfaithfulness. The **Conquest narrative** (mostly in Joshua) likewise shaped identity by providing a divine mandate to the Israelites \u2013 the land was theirs by God\u2019s gift, won under Joshua\u2019s leadership. Although archaeological evidence shows the biblical conquest as described (a swift, comprehensive military campaign) is not historically confirmed\u30109\u2020L189-L198\u3011\u30109\u2020L203-L211\u3011, the story\u2019s power in identity formation was real. It painted the Israelites as *God\u2019s instrument of justice* against Canaanite wickedness, reinforcing a moral distinction (Israel vs. Canaan) and a sense of destiny. Many scholars see these narratives as being compiled or given final form in the monarchic or exilic period to solidify a fractured community\u301019\u2020L472-L480\u3011. For example, during the Babylonian exile, the Exodus story\u2019s themes of liberation and covenant would resonate strongly, reasserting Israel\u2019s identity when their nation was in ruins\u301019\u2020L472-L480\u3011. As an internal matter, by the post-exilic period the Israelites (now mainly Judeans/Jews) increasingly defined themselves through these foundational myths instead of through political or tribal terms. **\u201cAll Israel\u201d became an ideological concept** tied to the covenant story \u2013 even those from Judah or Levi could call themselves \u201cIsrael\u201d because they shared the foundational history and the covenant with Yahweh. Thus, the telling and retelling of the Exodus, wilderness, and conquest narratives were central to the ongoing process of identity formation. They provided a continuous thread from past to present, and a lens through which later generations interpreted new events (e.g. the return from Babylon was seen as a second Exodus). Internally, then, Israel\u2019s identity was anchored in a sacred history that all members, scattered as they might be, could claim. In anthropological terms, they were a **memory community**, defined by a common remembered past as much as by anything else.\n\n**The Judges Period as an Identity Crucible:** The era of the Judges (roughly 1200\u20131020 BCE) was a formative crucible for Israelite identity, albeit a tumultuous one. In this period, the Israelites were \u201ca loose tribal confederation\u2026without a centralized government\u201d\u301048\u2020L1-L4\u3011, facing constant external threats (from Moabites, Midianites, Ammonites, Philistines, etc.) and occasional internal strife. It was in the fires of these conflicts that disparate tribes learned to see each other as brethren. The Book of Judges portrays cycles where different regions of Israel are oppressed and then delivered by local heroes (the judges), but occasionally the text shows *pan-tribal cooperation*. The clearest example is Deborah and Barak\u2019s war against Sisera (Judges 4\u20135), where tribes from the north and center (Ephraim, West Manasseh, Issachar, Zebulun, Naphtali) unite, while others are rebuked for abstaining\u301052\u2020L1061-L1069\u3011. This event, probably reflecting a genuine coalition, would have reinforced a sense of *shared fate*: victory required Israelite unity, and the song of Deborah is essentially a nationalistic paean celebrating \u201cthe people of Yahweh\u201d rallying together. On the flip side, the moral chaos and civil discord in Judges (e.g. the Benjamite war in Judges 20\u201321) demonstrated the perils of disunity and the need for a more stable collective structure (\u201cthere was no king\u2026\u201d). By the end of this era, it seems a consensus emerged among the tribes that a centralized leadership (a king) was needed \u2013 which itself is an identity marker: the willingness to form a single polity. When Saul was anointed as the first king (1 Samuel 11), the biblical text notes that \u201call the people came together as one,\u201d indicating a new stage of identity where **statehood** supplemented kinship. In short, the Judges period was an age of **identity negotiation** among the Israelites: they were figuring out how to balance tribal autonomy with national solidarity. The outcome of this crucible was an identity that could support a united monarchy. By the time of Samuel, the Israelites could collectively demand, \u201cGive us a king to lead us like other nations\u201d (1 Sam. 8:5) \u2013 paradoxically using a foreign model (monarchy) to reinforce their own distinct nationhood. It is worth noting that even as a monarchy emerged, the old tribal identities didn\u2019t vanish \u2013 they remained subdivisions of identity (much as states in a federation). However, a pan-Israelite identity was now strong enough to subsume those when needed. In sum, through the trials and judges of the pre-monarchic age, the Israelites transitioned from a *coalition of tribes* into a *people aware of their national unity*. The internal development of identity during this period laid the groundwork for the more concrete national institutions (king, Temple, capital city) that would follow in the monarchy, which in turn would further solidify what it meant to be Israelite.\n\n## 5. Evidence Presentation and Weighting\n\nReconstructing the emergence of Israelite identity requires a careful weighing of different categories of evidence \u2013 **archaeological (material culture), textual (biblical and epigraphic), and sociological/anthropological** data \u2013 each with its own strengths and limitations. A balanced historical approach ranks these evidence types in a rough hierarchy of reliability (with contemporary material evidence often prioritized) but also synthesizes them to form a coherent picture. Below we survey the key evidence and discuss how each contributes to our understanding:\n\n**Material Culture Shifts (c. 1200\u20131000 BCE):** Archaeology provides the most direct window into the lifestyle and cultural practices of early Israel, albeit an indirect voice on matters of identity. As mentioned, around 1200 BCE the central hill country of Canaan experienced a settlement revolution: hundreds of **small villages** sprang up in areas that had been sparsely inhabited\u301053\u2020L1012-L1020\u3011\u301053\u2020L1013-L1021\u3011. These Iron Age I sites share certain traits that archaeologists initially took to be ethnic markers of the emergent Israelites. Notable traits include the prevalence of **collared-rim pithoi** (large storage jars with a thick folded rim), the near-total **absence of pig bones**, the appearance of the **four-room house** architectural plan, and the lack of fortifications or monumental buildings\u301053\u2020L1003-L1011\u3011\u301053\u2020L1007-L1014\u3011. These features contrasted with Late Bronze Age Canaanite cities (which had pig remains, different pottery styles, two-room houses, defensive walls, temples, palaces, etc.). It was thus tempting to ascribe the new assemblage to a new people (the Israelites) arriving or emerging. Indeed, many scholars still see these traits as reflecting a new ethos (simple agrarian life, possibly informed by new socio-religious values) consistent with Israelite origins\u301019\u2020L385-L393\u3011\u301019\u2020L390-L398\u3011. However, archaeologists have also cautioned that none of these traits is **exclusively** Israelite. Collared-rim jars, for example, have been found in non-Israelite contexts and may just indicate a general chronological horizon\u301053\u2020L1018-L1025\u3011. The four-room house, while often called the \u201cIsraelite house,\u201d also appears in neighboring regions eventually\u301053\u2020L1018-L1025\u3011. Even the pig taboo is not wholly unique \u2013 contemporary highland Aramean sites also lack pig bones, and ecological reasons (hilly terrain is ill-suited for pig husbandry) could explain some of the abstention\u301053\u2020L1025-L1033\u3011. Therefore, material culture must be interpreted carefully: rather than providing a **bright-line ethnic identifier**, these shifts attest to a **broader cultural transformation** in highland society around 1200 BCE\u301053\u2020L1018-L1027\u3011\u301053\u2020L1025-L1033\u3011. Most scholars agree that this transformation corresponds to the formation of early Israel, but it\u2019s recognized that the settlers themselves likely had Canaanite origins. In other words, the change in pottery and village layout reflects **Canaanite villagers adopting a new lifestyle** (possibly driven by socio-economic collapse of cities and new ideologies of egalitarianism)\u301019\u2020L371-L380\u3011\u301019\u2020L385-L393\u3011. One striking piece of negative evidence is the **absence of temples or large cultic structures** in these early villages. Unlike Canaanite cities that had prominent temples to Baal or Asherah, Iron I highland sites show no monumental religious buildings \u2013 worship may have been conducted in open-air altars or simple local shrines (like the 12th-c. BC \u201cBull Site\u201d altar in Samaria hills)\u301017\u2020L279-L287\u3011. This absence is significant: it suggests a decentralization (or familial focus) of worship and possibly an iconoclastic streak consistent with later Israelite aniconism. It might also indicate that the highlanders eschewed the grand cult practices of the Canaanite city elites, which aligns with the biblical portrayal of early Israelite religion being centered on the Ark and simple altars rather than temple buildings until Solomon\u2019s Temple. In sum, the material culture of 1200\u20131000 BCE reveals continuity with Canaanite traditions (in everyday ceramics, farming techniques, etc.\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011) but also notable departures that correlate with Israel\u2019s emergence: new settlement patterns, simpler socio-economic organization, and subtle symbolic choices (like food taboos, house layout) that could encode a new identity\u301019\u2020L385-L393\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. Material evidence is thus foundational \u2013 it grounds the discussion in *hard data* about how people lived \u2013 but it must be correlated with textual evidence to be sure those villagers were *calling themselves* Israelites (the Merneptah stele shows at least one outsider did, by 1208 BCE).\n\n**Textual Evidence and Its Hierarchy:** The textual evidence for Israel\u2019s early identity comes in several layers, each with different historical reliability. At the top of the hierarchy are **contemporary inscriptions** from neighboring cultures \u2013 e.g. the Merneptah Stele (c.1208 BCE) naming Israel\u301053\u2020L992-L1000\u3011, the Moabite Mesha Stele (c.840 BCE) referring to Israel and Yahweh\u301041\u2020L201-L209\u3011, and the Tel Dan Stele (c. 830\u2013750 BCE) referencing the House of David\u301040\u2020L23-L28\u3011. These are invaluable because they provide an outsider\u2019s snapshot and generally have no bias to inflate Israel\u2019s antiquity or glory (indeed, they often boast of defeating Israel). Such inscriptions confirm key points: that a people called \u201cIsrael\u201d was in Canaan by the late 13th century, that by the 9th century Israel had kings and was identified by them (Omri\u2019s dynasty), and that Judah\u2019s ruling house was traced to a founder named David by that time\u301040\u2020L23-L28\u3011. Next in reliability come the **early biblical texts** that are widely considered to preserve ancient material \u2013 chiefly certain poems and archaic passages. Examples include the *Song of Deborah* (Judges 5) and the *Song of the Sea* (Exodus 15). Linguistically and stylistically, these poems appear old (perhaps 12th\u201311th century in origin) and likely were transmitted orally before being incorporated into the later narratives. They are precious for historians because they provide an internal voice of early Israel. The Song of Deborah, for instance, gives a tribal snapshot (listing tribes, mentioning foes like Sisera) that aligns with a pre-monarchic milieu and reflects an Israelite identity framed by tribal coalition and Yahwistic faith (\u201cPraise Yahweh for the avenging of Israel,\u201d Judg.5:2)\u301052\u2020L1061-L1069\u3011. These early texts suggest that even before kings, the Israelites had a concept of themselves as *\u201cthe people of Yahweh\u201d* and could enumerate their constituent tribes \u2013 a sign of ethnic consciousness. Another early poem, the *Blessing of Moses* (Deut. 33), if early, enumerates tribes and speaks of a unified people blessed by Yahweh. There are also fragments like the *Song of Miriam* (Exod. 15:21) and *Oracles of Balaam* (Numbers 23\u201324) which may carry old traditions (e.g. \u201ca star shall come out of Jacob\u201d). All these point to an emergent identity and a sense of destiny. After these, we have the **core narratives of the Deuteronomistic History** (Deuteronomy through 2 Kings). These books, compiled in their final form during the 7th\u20136th centuries BCE, weave earlier sources and traditions (including the Judges stories, Samuel, and the early monarchic chronicles) into a grand narrative with a clear theological agenda\u301048\u2020L13-L16\u3011. While they cannot be taken at face value for 2nd-millennium events (they anachronistically portray things like nationhood existing at Moses\u2019 time), they do contain very ancient memories and reflect how the Israelites of the monarchic period understood their origins. We have to critically evaluate these texts: for example, the Book of Joshua\u2019s conquest account might be a later ideological construct, yet it could preserve a kernel of truth about gradual infiltration and skirmishes\u30109\u2020L203-L211\u3011. The stories of judges probably have a historical basis in local heroes, but their framework (\u201cagain the Israelites did evil\u2026 and Yahweh raised up X to save them\u201d) reflects the exilic compilers\u2019 theology of covenant failure\u301048\u2020L13-L16\u3011. Therefore, in weighting evidence, these biblical historical books are used **in conjunction with archaeology**: where they align (e.g. the destruction of Hazor in late 13th century fits Joshua\u2019s account of Hazor\u2019s burning), we gain confidence; where they clash (Jericho\u2019s archaeology shows no city at Joshua\u2019s time\u30109\u2020L189-L197\u3011), archaeology usually wins out. Finally, **post-exilic texts** (like Chronicles, or additions in Ezra-Nehemiah) reflect a later re-interpretation of identity. By post-exilic times, the term \u201cIsrael\u201d could mean the religious community centered on Jerusalem (including remnants of all tribes), and genealogies were sometimes shaped to promote inclusivity or particular claims (Chronicles, for example, reshapes certain narratives to fit post-exilic concerns). These later reflections are more valuable for what they tell us about evolving identity concepts (e.g. the idea of \u201cAll Israel\u201d being reconstituted, or the emphasis on pure lineage vs. foreign wives in Ezra-Nehemiah), rather than about the actual emergence process. In summary, the historian gives **pride of place to inscriptions and early poetry**, uses the Deuteronomistic History critically (teasing out older source material from later editorial layer), and reads post-exilic writings as evidence of how identity was reinforced or redefined in light of exile and return. \n\n**Sociological and Anthropological Evidence:** Complementing archaeological and textual data, we consider the social structures, economy, and institutions that underpinned Israel\u2019s identity formation. Anthropological parallels (from studies of tribal societies) help us infer aspects that might not be explicit in texts. For instance, kinship was clearly the organizing principle of early Israel \u2013 the very notion of *tribes* implies extended kin networks tracing back to eponymous ancestors (the 12 sons of Jacob). While the genealogy of Jacob\u2019s sons is part of biblical tradition, it likely encodes real political relationships (e.g. Leah tribes vs. Rachel tribes might reflect older alliances). From a sociological perspective, *kinship provided a ready-made sense of peoplehood*: calling each other \u201cbrother Israelites\u201d was more than metaphor, it was believed they shared blood through the patriarchs. This familial conception of nation (Israel as one big family) is a powerful bonding mechanism common to many ethnic groups. It meant that inter-tribal conflict could be framed as fraternal strife and thus resolvable (see Judges 21 where the Israelites weep, \u201cO LORD, why has one tribe lacking in Israel?\u201d after war with Benjamin, showing kinship concern even after violent conflict). Economically, early Israel was a **agrarian, subsistence society** of farmers and herders\u301052\u2020L1041-L1049\u3011\u301052\u2020L1043-L1051\u3011. The move to a sedentary farming lifestyle in the highlands itself may have been a deliberate social strategy \u2013 possibly by former pastoralists or semi-nomads settling down. The terracing of hillsides and construction of grain silos in villages illustrate a communal commitment to agriculture\u301019\u2020L389-L397\u3011. This economic shift fostered stability and roots in the land, strengthening territorial identity (\u201ceach tribe in its inheritance\u201d). It also likely encouraged social egalitarianism: in small farm villages, there was little surplus to support a distinct ruling class, so households were relatively equal and local elders shared leadership. This is supported by the uniform house sizes and lack of elite graves from that period\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011\u30101\u2020L96-L104\u3011. The military aspect of society also informs identity: without a standing army, defense fell to mobilizing the able-bodied men of each tribe in times of crisis, which the biblical text reflects in the mustering of tribes under judges or the early kings. Such a model required a sense of unity and shared cause \u2013 you answered the call to arms because those under attack were fellow Israelites. The Song of Deborah shames tribes that stayed out of the fight, showing an expectation of mutual defense as part of being Israel\u301052\u2020L1061-L1069\u3011. In the monarchy period, a standing army began to form (David\u2019s mighty men, Solomon\u2019s chariots), which also signifies identity consolidation \u2013 men from various tribes serving a single king. Another sociological dimension is **religious personnel and institutions**. Early Israel did not have a highly developed priesthood or temple infrastructure like Egypt or Babylon. Instead, we read of Levites scattered among tribes, judges building altars, prophets delivering oracles. This diffuse religious structure meant ordinary households likely had significant religious roles (the father as family priest at sacrifices, etc.). Such decentralization might have kept religion very *accessible and common*, reinforcing group identity in every home. Only later with the Jerusalem Temple and a formal priesthood (after 10th c. BCE) did a central religious authority emerge, and even then local identity (e.g. a Levite in Ephraim vs. the Aaronite priests in Jerusalem) sometimes clashed (as seen in stories like Judges 17\u201318). The sociological evidence thus paints early Israel as a classic case of a **\u201cstateless society\u201d** coalescing into a state: strong kinship ties, segmentary lineage structure, tribal leadership, communal norms, and a unifying high god, eventually giving way to monarchy, bureaucracy, and centralized cult. Each stage \u2013 tribal league, united kingdom, divided kingdoms, exile community \u2013 added new layers to Israel\u2019s identity but also drew on earlier building blocks. For example, when the kingdom split in 922 BCE, the northern tribes could fall back on the old idea of a tribal league (hence they survived separately as \u201cIsrael\u201d for 200 years), while Judah developed a somewhat separate identity focused on Davidic kingship and the Temple. Yet both still saw themselves as Israel (the prophets often speak of eventual reunification). This dynamic again underscores that identity was a **historical process**, adapting to new political realities while trying to maintain a continuous self-concept.\n\n## 6. Competing Theories of Israelite Origins\n\nScholars have proposed several models to explain *how* the Israelite people came into being in the late second to early first millennium BCE. Each theory emphasizes different mechanisms and evidence, and the debate remains lively. The four main models are often labeled the **Conquest Model**, the **Peaceful Infiltration Model**, the **Peasant Revolt (Internal Revolution) Model**, and a more synthetic **Mixed Multitude Model**. Evaluating these theories involves examining archaeological data, textual hints, and comparative anthropological scenarios. Below is a comparative overview:\n\n- **Conquest Model:** This is the traditional view derived from the biblical Book of Joshua \u2013 that a united Israelite force, led by Joshua after Moses\u2019 death, invaded Canaan from outside and **conquered** it in a relatively short, decisive military campaign (c. 13th century BCE). In scholarly form, this model was championed by 20th-century figures like William F. Albright and Yigael Yadin. They pointed to archaeological destruction layers at sites like Hazor, Lachish, and Debir around 1200 BCE as evidence of Joshua\u2019s conquests, and took the biblical narrative in Joshua 1\u201312 as a reflection (albeit telescoped) of real events. The Conquest Model sees the Israelites as an external force \u2013 perhaps originally coming from Transjordan or Egypt (in line with the Exodus tradition) \u2013 who invaded Canaan, toppled the city-states, and settled in their place. **Supporting evidence** includes the Merneptah Stele\u2019s implication of conflict with Israel by 1208 BCE, as well as some burned cities that could correspond to Joshua\u2019s victories (Hazor\u2019s destruction by fire is often cited, as Joshua 11:11 claims Hazor was burned)\u30109\u2020L189-L197\u3011. However, the **critiques** of the Conquest Model are substantial. Archaeology shows that many key cities cited in Joshua (Jericho, Ai, Gibeon) were not fortified or even occupied at the supposed time of conquest\u30109\u2020L189-L197\u3011\u30109\u2020L199-L202\u3011. The destruction levels that do exist could have been caused by the Sea Peoples or internal rebellions, not necessarily an Israelite blitzkrieg. Moreover, the model struggles to explain the **cultural continuity** between Canaanite and Israelite material culture\u301019\u2020L379-L388\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011 \u2013 if Israel were a foreign invader, one might expect more clear cultural breaks. As a result, by the late 20th century, few archaeologists still held to a literal conquest as described in Joshua\u301050\u2020L1-L8\u3011. The conquest narrative is now often seen as an idealized national epic (perhaps to give theological justification for Israel\u2019s claim to the land) rather than a precise account of historical events\u30109\u2020L203-L211\u3011.\n\n- **Peaceful Infiltration Model:** Proposed by German scholars Albrecht Alt and Martin Noth in the mid-1900s, this theory posits that the Israelites were **semi-nomadic pastoralists** (possibly from outside Canaan, like the desert fringes or Transjordan) who **migrated peacefully** into the sparsely populated highlands of Canaan and gradually settled down. In this view, there was no violent conquest; rather, waves of pastoral clans moved seasonally, then permanently, into Canaan over generations (13th\u201312th centuries BCE), taking over land that had been abandoned or was lightly defended. Eventually these clans coalesced into the tribes of Israel. **Evidence in favor** includes the lack of widespread destruction layers (which fits a nonviolent entry), and the fact that the earliest Israelite sites are in the highlands \u2013 areas which could be seen as free space where nomads could settle without major clashes\u301019\u2020L385-L393\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. The model also explains certain biblical hints like the Israelites\u2019 pastoral background (Abraham, Jacob, Moses all have herding associations). It accounts for a gradual increase in settlements consistent with immigration. **Critiques**, however, point out that the Infiltration Model doesn\u2019t adequately explain *why* these nomads suddenly settled or why they developed a new identity rather than blending into Canaanite society. Also, archaeology indicates much of the highland population growth could have been from **sedentarization of local pastoralists** and refugees from lowland cities, not necessarily foreign nomads coming in. The model also struggles with the origin of Yahwism \u2013 if purely nomadic groups came from outside, what prompted their exclusive Yahweh religion (if we assume it was formed in Canaan)? Moreover, the peaceful scenario doesn\u2019t match biblical tradition of periodic fighting; though one could argue those fights (with Canaanites) occurred but were small scale. The infiltration idea has lost favor as the sole explanation, but aspects of it are still considered valid: namely, that some portion of early Israel were pastoral groups settling down and that the process was not one of continual warfare.\n\n- **Internal Revolution (Peasant Revolt) Model:** Advanced in the 1960s\u201370s by George Mendenhall and Norman Gottwald, this theory flips the script and sees the Israelites as **indigenous Canaanite peasants** who **rebelled** against the oppressive city-state system and created a new society in the hills. Influenced by Marxist social analysis, Gottwald in *The Tribes of Yahweh* argued that worsening economic conditions and forced labor under the Canaanite rulers led rural serfs and habiru mercenaries to band together, inspired by a liberating ideology (possibly the worship of Yahweh, advocating social justice and egalitarian values). These rebels fled or overthrew the city centers and established an **egalitarian rural commune society** \u2013 which became Israel\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011\u30101\u2020L90-L98\u3011. **Supporting evidence** comes from the aforementioned *egalitarian aspects* of the highland villages (uniform housing, lack of elites)\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011\u30101\u2020L96-L104\u3011. The idea that early Israel had an \u201cegalitarian ideal\u201d\u30101\u2020L85-L93\u3011 fits well with a social revolution narrative. The presence of the term *Habiru* in Amarna letters as social bandits lends historical plausibility to an underclass revolt\u301036\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301036\u2020L117-L125\u3011. Also, the continuity in pottery styles from Late Bronze to Iron I\u301053\u2020L1003-L1011\u3011\u301053\u2020L1018-L1024\u3011 suggests the highland inhabitants were originally Canaanites (who changed their socio-political structure, not their entire culture). The Revolt Model resonates with the biblical theme in Exodus of slaves escaping oppression (though Gottwald secularized that as peasants against Canaanite overlords rather than Israel vs Pharaoh). **Critiques** of this model note that it somewhat romantically projects modern revolutionary ideology onto ancient people. There\u2019s little direct evidence of a coordinated, ideologically driven revolt. No manifestos or distinct revolutionary destruction layers appear \u2013 indeed many Canaanite cities fell not to peasant uprising but likely to external invasions or were abandoned. Also, the timeline is fuzzy: a slow migration of discontented peasants leaving cities might be more accurate than a sudden revolt. The model also requires that those rebels had a unifying belief (Yahwism) that was markedly different from Canaanite religion, but as we know, early Israelite religion was not so starkly different at first (they still shared many Canaanite religious elements). Still, the Internal Revolution theory has influenced most reconstructions in that it highlights **social and economic factors** in ethnogenesis and underscores that many Israelites were originally native to the land (ex-Canaanites) who forged a new identity by rejecting the old socio-political order\u301019\u2020L379-L388\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. \n\n- **Mixed Multitude (Symbiosis) Model:** Increasingly, scholars favor a nuanced model that incorporates elements of the above \u2013 essentially a **hybrid origin** for Israel. This view holds that early Israel included a \u201cmixed multitude\u201d (to borrow the Exodus term) of different groups: some dislocated Canaanite city dwellers, some pastoral nomads from within Canaan, some pastoralists from Transjordan or the Sinai (Midianites/Shasu), and possibly a small group of escapees from Egypt who brought the Moses/Exodus narrative and the worship of Yahweh\u301049\u2020L957-L966\u3011\u301049\u2020L963-L970\u3011. These diverse groups **gradually coalesced** in the highlands and through shared experiences (settling new villages, occasional battles with neighbors, and the forging of common worship practices) formed a unified identity. In this model, there was neither a single invasion nor a single uprising, but a **complex process of ethnogenesis** involving migration, resettlement, adaptation, and alliance. Archaeologist Israel Finkelstein suggests that the population increase in the hills was due to the collapse of Canaan\u2019s urban culture \u2013 villagers moved uphill to self-sustaining farms when Egyptian domination ended \u2013 combined with nomads settling down due to climate or economic pushes\u301019\u2020L371-L380\u3011\u301019\u2020L385-L393\u3011. These settlers were mostly Canaanite in culture but, over a century or two, **adopted new symbols of group identity** (like avoiding pork, choosing certain pottery styles, and elevating Yahweh\u2019s cult)\u301019\u2020L399-L408\u3011\u301053\u2020L1007-L1015\u3011. The \u201cmixed multitude\u201d model readily accounts for why early Israelite material culture is so Canaanite \u2013 because they largely were Canaanites \u2013 and also allows that there are new elements (Yahweh may have been a new or syncretized deity, possibly introduced by a smaller group from the south). It also aligns with genetic and linguistic continuity (Hebrew is essentially a Canaanite dialect). The **Exodus tradition** can be integrated by suggesting that a small group of Hebrew slaves did escape Egypt and merge with the highland settlers, their story gaining prominence as a theological paradigm of liberation which then became the collective memory\u30109\u2020L203-L212\u3011. The **evidence for this composite model** is essentially the sum of evidence for all partial contributions: settlement patterns (internal), lack of drastic cultural break (internal development), Egyptian references to Shasu of \u201cYhw\u201d (hinting worship of Yahweh outside Israel), and the biblical insistence that some founding figure (Moses) brought laws from outside (which could reflect a real contribution of an external group\u2019s influence on a mainly native population). The **critique** of this model is that it can become too nebulous \u2013 if Israel is made of almost everyone (Canaanites, nomads, some Egyptians), then what exactly differentiates them? Proponents answer that it was the *fusion of these elements under a new ideological umbrella* \u2013 the covenant with Yahweh and perhaps an ethical-social vision that distinguished Israel (we might liken it to how \u201cAmericans\u201d formed from diverse immigrants with a new common creed, on a very different scale). This model has the benefit of flexibility and fits the evidence of diversity within early Israel (tribes had varying traditions, even different dialects perhaps). It underscores that **identity is a process**, not a single event \u2013 Israelite identity was negotiated over time by various sub-groups until by Iron Age II it solidified into the national identities of Israel and Judah.\n\nIn modern scholarship, the conquest and pure infiltration models have largely been set aside in favor of approaches that highlight indigenous origins and multi-faceted processes\u301050\u2020L1-L8\u3011\u301050\u2020L15-L22\u3011. The mixed model is often combined with the revolt model in a sense that the highland settlements were largely indigenous, but some \u201crevolt\u201d or rejection of the old order took place \u2013 possibly influenced by a minority with a new Yahwistic faith. Thus, most scholars today would say early Israel arose *internally* in Canaan through a transformation of late Bronze Age society, rather than through a massive external invasion or entirely new population\u301019\u2020L379-L388\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. The ongoing debates focus on the proportion of influence each factor had (e.g. how much of the population might have been former slaves from Egypt? Did the ideology of Yahwism originate inside Canaan or outside? etc.). Crucially, all theories acknowledge that by around 1000 BCE, a distinct people calling themselves Israel existed in the highlands, laying claim to a shared ancestry and religion, which is corroborated by archaeological and textual evidence. The theoretical differences are about the journey to get to that point. \n\n### *Table: Comparative Models of Israelite Origins*\n\n| Model                    | Proponents (classic)         | Mechanism of Emergence                                      | Supporting Evidence                                    | Challenges                                           |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Conquest Model**       | W.F.

The current consensus leans towards a **hybrid model**: Early Israel formed **internally** in Canaan through a confluence of social transformation and minor influxes, not by a large invading force\u301019\u2020L379-L388\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011. The Israelites\u2019 identity was \u201cforged in the crucible\u201d of Canaan\u2019s collapse \u2013 an internal evolution with perhaps a spark from outside (the Moses group and Yahwism) acting as a catalyst\u30108\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301049\u2020L963-L970\u3011. Identity formation was thus incremental: the highland villagers of Iron I likely did not initially see themselves as a single nation, but over a couple of centuries, shared cult and conflict led them to identify as **Israel**, a people distinct from Egypt, distinct from Canaanites, and opposed to Philistines, bound by their god Yahweh.\n\n## Conclusion: Identity as a Historical Process\n\nThe emergence of Israelite identity was not a single event that one can pin on a map with a date; it was a **centuries-long process**, woven from many threads \u2013 migration, adaptation, rebellion, unification, and covenant. From scattered tribes of diverse origin, a self-conscious nation was formed, a people who remembered \u201cwe were slaves in Egypt,\u201d who worshipped the God of Israel, and who upheld laws and customs setting them apart. This process illustrates how **identity in history is dynamic**: it evolves in response to social pressures, external labels, and internal innovations. \n\nIn the case of Israel, we see an identity that began perhaps as a loose coalition of hill country clans but crystallized through **shared memory** (the Exodus-Conquest epic), **shared faith** (Yahwism and the covenant), and **shared struggle** (conflicts during Judges and early monarchy). The archaeological record traces the material imprint of this new society \u2013 the villages, houses, and lifestyle that distinguished it from the old Canaanite order\u301019\u2020L385-L393\u3011\u301053\u2020L1003-L1011\u3011. External records from Egyptians, Moabites, and Assyrians show us the moments when Israel stepped onto the international stage as a recognizable entity, known by its unique name and its kings\u301053\u2020L992-L1000\u3011\u301041\u2020L201-L209\u3011. Internally, Israel\u2019s own literature \u2013 compiled and edited over generations \u2013 reveals how the Israelites chose to tell their story, emphasizing themes of liberation, covenant, and a special destiny, thereby continuously reforging their group identity in light of new experiences (settlement, monarchy, exile)\u301019\u2020L472-L480\u3011\u301019\u2020L428-L436\u3011.\n\nThe formation of Israelite identity also invites comparison with how other peoples formed: the Philistines, who appear suddenly and then gradually assimilate into the Levantine milieu\u30104\u2020L79-L88\u3011; the Arameans, who coalesced from nomads into kingdoms and imparted their language to a whole region; or the *\u201cmixed multitude\u201d* of the Persian-period Jews, who had to redefine identity after losing nationhood. In each case, identity is both **invention and inheritance** \u2013 crafted from new circumstances yet claiming continuity with the past. Israel\u2019s identity was no exception: the Israelites took elements of their Canaanite heritage (language, agricultural practices, place-based traditions) and *reinterpreted* them within a new framework of \u201cbeing Israel,\u201d the people chosen by Yahweh\u301049\u2020L971-L979\u3011\u301017\u2020L279-L287\u3011.\n\nUltimately, the historical emergence of Israelite identity underscores a fundamental truth for the study of ethnicity: what unites a people is as much a matter of **shared belief and narrative** as it is of shared blood. The Israelites came to see themselves as brothers not because of unbroken biological lineage (indeed, their ancestors were a mix), but because they believed in the same God, honored the same laws, and remembered the same stories of where they came from. Over time, those beliefs and stories were solidified into scriptures, and the identity persisted even when its physical manifestations (a kingdom, a temple) were gone. Thus, Israelite identity outlived the Iron Age, carrying forward into **Judaism** and beyond \u2013 a testament to the power of narrative and covenant in defining a people. \n\nFrom a historian\u2019s perspective, piecing together Israel\u2019s emergence is a multidisciplinary detective work. It requires reading a stele in Cairo Museum that says \u201cIsrael\u201d\u301053\u2020L994-L1000\u3011, digging in the highland soil to uncover family courtyards and plastered granaries, analyzing songs and laws preserved across millennia, and considering models of how communities form. The consensus view that Israel emerged largely out of Canaan but differentiated itself through distinctive practices and beliefs\u301019\u2020L379-L388\u3011\u301019\u2020L399-L407\u3011 speaks to an evolutionary model of ethnogenesis. Israel\u2019s case may be unique in its details, but it exemplifies a common pattern in human history: **in the crucible of collapse and opportunity, new identities are born**, forged by those who choose to remember their past a certain way and commit to living together under common values. The Israelites chose to remember a deliverance by their God and to live as a holy people under that God\u2019s law \u2013 and in doing so, they became a people. Their identity was, in effect, their greatest historical creation. \n\n**Sources Cited:**\n\n- Dever, William G. *Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From?* (2003).  \n- Faust, Avraham. *Israel\u2019s Ethnogenesis: Settlement, Interaction, Expansion and Resistance* (2006).
