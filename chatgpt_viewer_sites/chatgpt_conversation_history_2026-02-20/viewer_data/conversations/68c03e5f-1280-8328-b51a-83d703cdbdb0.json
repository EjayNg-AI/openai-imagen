       /* follows section background */\n  color: var(--text);             /* black in light, white in dark */\n  border: 1px solid var(--text);  /* black in light, white in dark */\n  border-radius: clamp(16px, 2.2vw, 24px);\n  padding: clamp(22px, 3.6vw, 40px); /* same comfort range as testimonial cards */\n}\n\n/* Large centered title: clone the split-section title sizing */\n.section--approach .box-title {\n  margin: 0 0 clamp(10px, 1.2vw, 18px);\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: 800;\n  line-height: 1.1;\n  font-size: clamp(2.1rem, 3.4vw, 3.1rem); /* mirrors .section--split .section-title */\n}\n\n/* Constrain line length like your split text block */\n.section--approach .box-body {\n  max-width: 68ch;   /* same as .section--split .split-text */\n  margin: 0 auto;    /* center within the card */\n}\n\n/* Paragraph sizing + spacing = same as split sections */\n.section--approach .box-body p {\n  font-size: clamp(1.06rem, 0.6rem + 1vw, 1.25rem);\n  line-height: 1.7;\n  margin: 0 0 clamp(10px, 1.4vw, 18px);\n}\n\n/* Lists: mirror spacing/indent; li sizes come from your .list--lg rule */\n.section--approach .box-body :is(ul, ol) {\n  margin: 0 0 clamp(10px, 1.4vw, 18px);\n  padding-left: clamp(22px, 2.2vw, 30px);\n}\n```\n\n**What this matches:**\n\n- **Container width:** identical to `.section--split .split { max-width: min(1160px, 86vw) }` so the box occupies roughly the same width as the image\u2011text sections. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- **Title sizing:** uses the same clamp as `.section--split .section-title`, only centered here. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- **Paragraph sizing:** copied from `.section--split .split-text p`. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- **List sizing:** your `.split-text ul.list--lg > li` rule already sets the larger list font; by keeping `split-text` and `list--lg`, the box inherits it. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- **Comfortable padding:** matches the feel of your testimonial/card components (`clamp(22px, 3.6vw, 40px)`), so spacing is consistent. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- **Theme\u2011aware colors:** `var(--text)` resolves to **black in light** and **white in dark** (set in your design tokens), so both the **text and border** automatically flip by theme. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3) Notes & small gotcha (background alternation)\n\nYour main content alternates section backgrounds using `nth-child(odd/even)` under `#main-content`. Inserting this new section as the first child will flip the light/alt backgrounds of the later sections. If you want to **preserve** the current backgrounds of \u201cElementary Maths\u201d and \u201cAdditional Maths\u201d exactly as before, add this optional override:\n\n```css\n/* Optional: lock backgrounds so adding the Approach section doesn't flip colors */\n#main-content > #e-maths { background: var(--bg); }\n#main-content > #additional-maths { background: var(--bg-alt); }\n```\n\n(Otherwise, it\u2019s fine to let them swap.) \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 4) Why this is responsive by construction\n\n- All sizes use your existing `clamp(...)` scales, so **mobile through desktop** is already covered. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- Width is capped like the split sections, with centered inner content (`max-width: 68ch`), preventing overly long lines. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Quick test checklist\n\n1. Toggle theme (your toggle sets `data-theme=\"dark\"/\"light\"`): verify the **border flips** with text color. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n2. Resize down to \u2264900px to confirm it still reads comfortably and matches the **typographic scale** of the E/A sections. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n3. If desired, apply the optional background override in \u00a73.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also sketch content guidelines (e.g., suggested subsections/bullets) tuned for quick scanning and SEO, but

This ensures both readability and dynamic layout fitting.\n\n**Revisiting and refining**\n\nPiecing together final touches: increasing paragraph size and border thickness, aligning with design tokens, and ensuring theme consistency. Adding file citations for thoroughness.\n\n**Refining the enhancements**\n\nI\u2019m finalizing paragraph size and border thickness. Considering cache purge if needed. The user-requested changes are now explicitly aligned with earlier styles for clarity."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 7m 21s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-97c830669ccb5f41-SJC","parent_id":"e1e39974-3c60-45aa-b5cf-8b5f8f2632ac","request_id":"97c830669ccb5f41-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","timestamp_":"absolute","finished_duration_sec":441,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e1e39974-3c60-45aa-b5cf-8b5f8f2632ac","children":["6439211d-f421-4696-a12d-c4b40647b48f"]},"6439211d-f421-4696-a12d-c4b40647b48f":{"id":"6439211d-f421-4696-a12d-c4b40647b48f","message":{"id":"6439211d-f421-4696-a12d-c4b40647b48f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757436676.367142,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Got it \u2014 two surgical tweaks:\n\n- **Enlarge the first and last paragraphs** in the approach box to the same **\u201clead\u201d scale** used under the *Elementary Maths* and *Additional Maths* section headings, so the hierarchy feels consistent. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- **Thicken the box border** while keeping it theme\u2011aware (`var(--text)` \u2192 white in dark mode, black in light). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n> **Where to edit:** append the snippet below to `assets/css/secondary-maths.css` (this file is already linked from `secondary-school-maths.html`). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file2\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n```css\n/* ===== PATCH: Approach box text + border ===== */\n\n/* Make the 1st and last paragraphs bigger (match .section--split .lead) */\n.section--approach .box-body p:is(:first-of-type, :last-of-type) {\n  /* Mirrors the lead paragraph scale used in E/A sections */\n  font-size: clamp(1.18rem, 1.05rem + 1.2vw, 1.6rem); /* \u2190 same as .section--split .lead */\n  line-height: 1.7;\n  margin: 0 0 clamp(10px, 1.6vw, 20px);              /* \u2190 same spacing as .lead */\n}\n\n/* Tablet/phone adjustment: keep parity with .section--split .lead at \u22641200px */\n@media (max-width: 1199.98px) {\n  .section--approach .box-body p:is(:first-of-type, :last-of-type) {\n    font-size: clamp(1.02rem, 0.9rem + 0.8vw, 1.35rem);\n    line-height: 1.55;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Thicker, theme-aware border for the card */\n.section--approach .approach-box {\n  border-width: 2px; /* was 1px; text color var(--text) already flips by theme */\n}\n```\n\n### Why this stays consistent\n- Those `font-size` and `margin` values **exactly mirror** the `.section--split .lead` rules already used under your \u201cElementary Maths\u201d and \u201cAdditional Maths\u201d titles, so the visual rhythm and hierarchy remain uniform. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- The `@media (max-width: 1199.98px)` block reproduces the same **tablet/phone scaling** as your existing lead paragraphs. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201  \n- The border still uses `var(--text)`, so it\u2019s **white in dark mode** and **black in light mode**, matching your global tokens. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file3\ue201\n\n---\n\n#### Optional (more robust, if you might add more paragraphs later)\nIf you plan to insert additional paragraphs before/after the list, the `:first-of-type` / `:last-of-type` targeting could become brittle. In that case, add a `class=\"lead\"` to the two paragraphs in your approach HTML and replace the first rule with:\n\n```css\n.section--approach .box-body p.lead {\n  font-size: clamp(1.18rem, 1.05rem + 1.2vw, 1.6rem);\n  line-height: 1.7;\n  margin: 0 0 clamp(10px, 1.6vw, 20px);\n}\n@media (max-width: 1199.98px) {\n  .section--approach .box-body p.lead {\n    font-size: clamp(1.02rem, 0.9rem + 0.8vw, 1.35rem);\n    line-height: 1.55;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSame look, but **explicitly** marked paragraphs.\n\n---\n\n**Cache busting tip:** if you don\u2019t immediately see the changes, bump the query version on the page\u2019s stylesheet link (e.g., `secondary-maths.css?v=1.0.5`) to invalidate the browser cache. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer the border even bolder, `border-width: 3px;` will still sit well with your design; 2px just matches the weight you already use for other bordered UI (e.g., arrow discs) and keeps the card refined.

That keeps them narrower than the centered title. To make those paragraphs take up *approximately the same width as the title* on wider screens (\u2265 900 px), you can override that constraint.\n\nHere\u2019s a patch for `assets/css/secondary-maths.css` (page-scoped)\u301020\u2020source\u3011:\n\n```css\n/* ===== PATCH: Widen lead paragraphs in Approach box on desktop ===== */\n@media (min-width: 900px) {\n  .section--approach .box-body p.lead {\n    max-width: none;          /* remove the 68ch clamp */\n    width: 100%;              /* fill full card width */\n    text-align: center;       /* optional: align like the title */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Why this works\n- On smaller viewports, your existing responsive scaling still applies (lead shrinks gracefully)\u301021\u2020source\u3011.  \n- At \u2265 900 px, the **title already stretches across the full box width** (capped by the card container at `min(1160px, 86vw)`)\u301021\u2020source\u3011. The override lets the `<p class=\"lead\">` text match that same span.  \n- You can decide whether to keep `text-align: left` or `text-align: center`. If you want a **block-paragraph look**, leave it left; if you want **symmetry with the centered title**, use center.  \n\n### Optional refinements\nIf you\u2019d prefer not to stretch *all* leads, you can target just the **first and last paragraphs** in that box:\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 900px) {\n  .section--approach .box-body p.lead:first-of-type,\n  .section--approach .box-body p.lead:last-of-type {\n    max-width: none;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, if you later add mid-section leads, they won\u2019t be widened by default.\n\n---\n\nDo you want the widened leads to be **center-aligned like the title**, or still **left-aligned but full-width**?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":146,"end_ix":157,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"tuition-css-1.0.0.css","id":"file-LVJaW57oPKJid4xa5E4JfG","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"cited_message_idx":21,"cited_message_id":"b1cb744f-b3ad-4dd3-9b9d-01303e90be0b","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null}}},{"start_ix":415,"end_ix":426,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"secondary-maths.css","id":"file-XtwByPTQzHDbtJAkUCFE2N","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"cited_message_idx":20,"cited_message_id":"2ac374ec-f3e9-45ee-80f0-c1e5d8c1e374","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null}}},{"start_ix":886,"end_ix":897,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"tuition-css-1.0.0.css","id":"file-LVJaW57oPKJid4xa5E4JfG","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"cited_message_idx":21,"cited_message_id":"b1cb744f-b3ad-4dd3-9b9d-01303e90be0b","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null}}},{"start_ix":1027,"end_ix":1038,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"tuition-css-1.0.0.css","id":"file-LVJaW57oPKJid4xa5E4JfG","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"cited_message_idx":21,"cited_message_id":"b1cb744f-b3ad-4dd3-9b9d-01303e90be0b","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\u301021\u2020source\u3011","start_idx":146,"end_idx":157,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"tuition-css-1.0.0.css","id":"file-LVJaW57oPKJid4xa5E4JfG","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":21,"message_id":"b1cb744f-b3ad-4dd3-9b9d-01303e90be0b","file_index":null,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\u301020\u2020source\u3011","start_idx":415,"end_idx":426,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"secondary-maths.css","id":"file-XtwByPTQzHDbtJAkUCFE2N","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":20,"message_id":"2ac374ec-f3e9-45ee-80f0-c1e5d8c1e374","file_index":null,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\u301021\u2020source\u3011","start_idx":886,"end_idx":897,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"tuition-css-1.0.0.css","id":"file-LVJaW57oPKJid4xa5E4JfG","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":21,"message_id":"b1cb744f-b3ad-4dd3-9b9d-01303e90be0b","file_index":null,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null},{"matched_text":"\u301021\u2020source\u3011","start_idx":1027,"end_idx":1038,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"tuition-css-1.0.0.css","id":"file-LVJaW57oPKJid4xa5E4JfG","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":21,"message_id":"b1cb744f-b3ad-4dd3-9b9d-01303e90be0b","file_index":null,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null}],"request_id":"97c8709ebdc19c9e-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"939dd0a6-2755-441b-87d0-0e3053898200","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"939dd0a6-2755-441b-87d0-0e3053898200","children":["fbf9d013-b4aa-4301-949e-bcd7d5a5c905"]},"fbf9d013-b4aa-4301-949e-bcd7d5a5c905":{"id":"fbf9d013-b4aa-4301-949e-bcd7d5a5c905","message":{"id":"fbf9d013-b4aa-4301-949e-bcd7d5a5c905","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757439737.601,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["With

This file already holds the approach box styling and the `.lead` clamp we\u2019re matching. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201\n\n### A) Make the \u201cApproach\u201d list the **same size** as your `.lead` text\nYour page CSS defines the lead scale here:  \n`.section--approach .box-body p.lead { font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 1.05rem + 1.2vw, 1.5rem); \u2026 }` (with a tablet/phone variant). We\u2019ll mirror that onto the list items *within the box only*. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201\n\n```css\n/* ===== PATCH A: Approach-box list items = same size as .lead ===== */\n.section--approach .box-body ul.list--lg > li,\n.section--approach .box-body ol > li {\n  font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 1.05rem + 1.2vw, 1.5rem);\n  line-height: 1.7; /* mirrors .lead */\n}\n\n/* Tablet/phone scale \u2014 mirrors your .lead media rule */\n@media (max-width: 1199.98px) {\n  .section--approach .box-body ul.list--lg > li,\n  .section--approach .box-body ol > li {\n    font-size: clamp(1.02rem, 0.9rem + 0.8vw, 1.35rem);\n    line-height: 1.55;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> This targets only the \u201cApproach\u201d box (`.section--approach .box-body \u2026`), leaving list sizes elsewhere unchanged. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201\n\n### B) Recolour **all non\u2011hero** list items:  \n- **Dark mode:** bright orange (a bit brighter than your accent card)  \n- **Light mode:** dark magenta  \n- **Contrast:** both colours exceed WCAG 4.5:1 on your backgrounds (\u224810:1 on dark backgrounds and \u224811:1 on light backgrounds), so readability is solid.\n\n```css\n/* ===== PATCH B: Theme-aware list colours (non-hero only) ===== */\n/* Light mode: dark magenta on sections inside #main-content */\n:root[data-theme=\"light\"] #main-content .section li {\n  color: #660066; /* dark magenta, ~11:1 contrast on your light bgs */\n}\n\n/* Dark mode: bright orange (brighter than your accent #f59e0b) */\n:root[data-theme=\"dark\"] #main-content .section li {\n  color: #ffbd44; /* bright orange, ~9\u201310:1 contrast on your dark bgs */\n}\n\n/* (Optional) If any list items carry stronger per-element colours, let links keep their own hues */\n#main-content .section li a {\n  color: inherit;         /* or remove this to keep your existing section link colours */\n  text-decoration-color: currentColor;\n}\n```\n\n- Scoping to `#main-content .section li` avoids touching the **hero bullets**, which live outside `<main>` and already have their own colour rules. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue201  \n- If you want this **site\u2011wide**, move the same rules to `assets/css/tuition-css-1.0.0.css`; otherwise keeping them in `jc-maths.css` limits the change to this page only. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Sanity checks after applying\n\n1) **Approach box:** Confirm the list items are visually indistinguishable in size from the adjacent `.lead` paragraphs at both \u22651200px and <1200px breakpoints. \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201  \n2) **Colours:**  \n   - Dark mode: list items appear bright orange with strong contrast over your dark section backgrounds.  \n   - Light mode: list items appear dark magenta with strong contrast over your light section backgrounds.  \n   - Links inside list items still show your intended link colour (if you keep the existing link rules), or inherit the list colour if you apply the optional rule.\n\n3) **Cache busting:** bump the CSS query version in the `<link>` for `jc-maths.css` (e.g., `?v=1.1.2`) if the browser holds onto the old file.

text still follows `var(--text)` (black/light, white/dark).  \n2) Contrast: both `#660066` on light backgrounds and `#ffbd44` on dark backgrounds maintain strong contrast against your section backgrounds.  \n\nIf anything else in the Approach box should also adopt the accent (e.g., the title underline, custom bullets), we can hook those into `var(--list-accent)` too.
