Preliminaries: what \u201cenergy\u201d means in cosmology\n\nIn general relativity (GR), the fundamental quantity is the **stress\u2013energy tensor** \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\). \u201cEnergy density\u201d is \\(T_{00}\\) in a suitable frame; pressures and fluxes are the spatial components.\n\nTwo key facts:\n\n1. **Local conservation always holds** (where GR applies):  \n   \\[\n   \\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu} = 0.\n   \\]  \n   This gives, for a homogeneous fluid in a Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) universe,\n   \\[\n   \\dot{\\rho} + 3H\\left(\\rho + \\frac{p}{c^2}\\right) = 0,\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\rho\\) is energy density, \\(p\\) is pressure, and \\(H\\) is the Hubble parameter.\n\n2. **Global energy need not be conserved.** Noether\u2019s theorem says you get a conserved energy only if spacetime has time-translation symmetry. FLRW cosmologies are explicitly time-dependent \u2192 there is no global time-translation symmetry \u2192 there is no unique, covariant notion of \u201ctotal energy of the universe\u201d, and hence no global conservation law.\n\nSo: whenever I say \u201cenergy conservation\u201d below, I\u2019m careful to mean **local** conservation, not a global constant-of-motion.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Planck era (quantum gravity regime)\n\n**Timescale:** \\(t \\lesssim t_{\\rm Pl} \\sim 5.4\\times 10^{-44}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\)  \n**Energy scale:** \\(E_{\\rm Pl} \\sim 1.22\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}\\)  \n**Temperature:** \\(T \\sim 10^{32}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\)\n\n### Nature of energy\n\nHere our theories break down:\n\n- Spacetime curvature is of order the Planck scale; quantum fluctuations of the metric are large.\n- Any realistic description needs a full **quantum theory of gravity** (string theory, loop quantum gravity, asymptotic safety, whatever your poison).\n\nIn this regime:\n\n- The classical metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is not a good background;  \n- The usual stress\u2013energy tensor is replaced by some sort of operator \\(\\hat{T}_{\\mu\\nu}\\) whose expectation value may not even be meaningful on scales \\(\\sim t_{\\rm Pl}\\);  \n- Even the distinction between \u201cmatter energy\u201d and \u201cgravitational energy\u201d is suspect.\n\nSo, honestly: we **do not know** what the \u201cenergy\u201d content looks like here. Any statement is model dependent.\n\n### Energy conservation?\n\nYou can\u2019t even cleanly talk about classical local conservation before you have a semiclassical spacetime. So the safest statement is:\n\n- **Energy conservation in the usual GR sense is not even well-defined in the Planck era.**\n- Only once the universe exits the Planck regime and admits a classical (or semiclassical) FLRW description does \\(\\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\) become a sharply meaningful equation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Grand Unified Theory (GUT) era\n\n**Rough timescale:** \\(t \\sim 10^{-43} - 10^{-36}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\)  \n**Energy scale:** \\(E \\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}\\)\n\nAssume that by now:\n\n- We have a smooth FLRW spacetime (classical GR).\n- Gravity is classical; matter is described by **quantum field theory (QFT)** in curved spacetime.\n- Gauge forces may be unified in some GUT (for example \\(SU(5)\\), \\(SO(10)\\), etc).\n\n### Nature of energy\n\nDominant contributions:\n\n1. **Radiation-like thermal bath**:\n   - A hot plasma of relativistic particles: gauge bosons of the unified group, fermions, scalars, etc.\n   - Equation of state parameter \\(w := p/(\\rho c^2) \\approx 1/3\\).  \n   - Energy density scales as \\(\\rho_{\\rm rad} \\propto a^{-4}\\) with scale factor \\(a(t)\\).\n\n2. **Vacuum / potential energy of scalar fields**:\n   - GUT symmetry breaking is typically implemented by scalar fields (GUT \u201cHiggses\u201d) with some potential \\(V(\\phi)\\).\n   - When the field sits in a local minimum or flat region of \\(V(\\phi)\\), that contributes **vacuum energy** with \\(w \\approx -1\\).\n\nWhich dominates depends on the model. In many inflationary scenarios, a scalar field energy density (the inflaton) becomes dominant just before inflation.\n\n### Transformations in this era\n\n- As the universe cools and undergoes **symmetry breaking**, vacuum expectation values of scalar fields change.\n- Energy can move between:\n  - **vacuum energy** (potential)  \n  - **kinetic energy** of scalar fields  \n  - **thermal energy** of the particle plasma.\n\nThink of a cosmological phase transition: the symmetric high-temperature vacuum rolls or tunnels into a lower-energy broken-symmetry vacuum, releasing latent heat into the plasma.\n\n### Energy conservation?\n\nNow GR + QFT in curved spacetime applies, so:\n\n- **Local conservation holds:**  \n  \\(\\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\).\n\nBut globally:\n\n- As the universe expands, the energy in a comoving volume of radiation decreases (because of redshift and volume expansion).\n- There is no compensating global \u201caccounting ledger\u201d that keeps track of \u201cwhere the lost energy went\u201d in an invariant way.\n\nSo again: **no global conservation law**, but **good local conservation**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inflationary epoch\n\n**Rough timescale:** \\(t \\sim 10^{-36} - 10^{-32}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\) (model dependent)  \n**Energy scale:** typically around the GUT scale, but not fixed by observations\n\nStandard picture: the universe is dominated by a scalar field \\(\\phi\\), the **inflaton**. Its energy\u2013momentum tensor looks like:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + V(\\phi),\n\\quad\np_\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 - \\frac{1}{6}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 - V(\\phi),\n\\]\n\nin appropriate units (ignoring factors of \\(c\\)).\n\nDuring **slow-roll inflation**:\n\n- The inflaton is nearly homogeneous: gradients small.\n- \\(\\dot{\\phi}^2 \\ll V(\\phi)\\).\n- So \\(p_\\phi \\approx - V(\\phi) \\approx -\\rho_\\phi\\), i.e. \\(w \\approx -1\\) like a cosmological constant.\n\n### Nature of energy\n\nThe universe is dominated by:\n\n- **Vacuum-like energy**: the nearly constant potential energy \\(V(\\phi)\\) of a homogeneous scalar field.\n- Pre-existing radiation or matter is diluted exponentially by the expansion: effectively negligible.\n\nThis is similar in character to what we now call **dark energy**, but at a much higher energy scale and for a finite duration.\n\n### Transformations during inflation\n\n- The inflaton field is slowly rolling down its potential.\n- Energy is mostly stored as potential energy \\(V(\\phi)\\) with a small kinetic correction.\n- Physical volume of any comoving patch grows as \\(a^3\\), and \\(a\\) itself grows \u2248 exponentially.\n\nSo, within a comoving patch:\n\n- **Energy density** \\(\\rho_\\phi\\) ~ constant,  \n- **Total inflaton energy** in that physical volume grows as \\(\\propto a^3\\).\n\nThis is the first place where people\u2019s intuition about energy conservation really breaks:\n\n> It looks like you are creating more and more inflaton energy out of \u201cnothing\u201d as space inflates.\n\nBut this is exactly the consequence of **no global energy conservation in GR** for time-dependent cosmologies. There is no coordinate-independent global energy to conserve. Heuristic explanations sometimes talk about \u201cnegative gravitational energy\u201d balancing the inflaton energy, but that\u2019s at best a quasi-Newtonian metaphor, not a rigorous GR statement.\n\n### Energy conservation?\n\n- **Local conservation still holds**: the inflaton obeys the Klein\u2013Gordon equation in curved spacetime; the stress\u2013energy is covariantly conserved.\n- **Global energy conservation does not hold**: the total \\(E = \\rho_\\phi V\\) in a comoving region increases as \\(V \\propto a^3\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. End of inflation: (p)reheating\n\nWhen the inflaton reaches a steep part of its potential or a minimum, slow roll ends:\n\n- \\(\\dot{\\phi}\\) becomes large.\n- The expansion ceases to be almost de Sitter and transitions toward a more standard radiation-dominated FLRW.\n\n### Nature of energy\n\nAt and after the end of inflation:\n\n1. The inflaton field energy becomes **oscillatory** around the minimum of its potential. For a quadratic minimum \\(V(\\phi)\\sim m^2\\phi^2/2\\), a homogeneous oscillating scalar behaves like nonrelativistic matter with \\(w\\approx 0\\).\n\n2. The inflaton **decays** into other fields:\n   - Perturbatively: \\(\\phi \\rightarrow \\text{other particles}\\) via couplings.\n   - Or non-perturbatively (parametric resonance): \u201cpreheating\u201d.\n\n3. The decay products interact, scatter, and thermalise into a hot plasma of relativistic particles.\n\nThis conversion of inflaton energy into a hot plasma is **reheating**. The temperature reached is called the **reheating temperature** \\(T_{\\rm RH}\\).\n\n### Transformations\n\nOne can write coupled continuity equations for inflaton energy density \\(\\rho_\\phi\\) and radiation density \\(\\rho_r\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dot{\\rho}_\\phi + 3H(\\rho_\\phi + p_\\phi/c^2) = -\\Gamma \\rho_\\phi,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{\\rho}_r + 4H\\rho_r = +\\Gamma \\rho_\\phi,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Gamma\\) is an effective decay rate.\n\n- The **loss** of energy from \\(\\rho_\\phi\\) is exactly the **gain** in \\(\\rho_r\\) (ignoring subdominant channels), plus redshift/expansion terms.\n- This is local energy\u2013momentum conservation in action.\n\n### Energy conservation?\n\n- Again: **locally** respected via these coupled equations.\n- No global conservation: during and after reheating, radiation redshifts; the energy of photons in a comoving volume decreases as \\(a^{-1}\\) on top of the volume factor. That energy does not go anywhere globally; the spacetime lacks the symmetry needed for a conserved global quantity.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Radiation-dominated era\n\n**Timescale:** From reheating until **matter\u2013radiation equality**, roughly \\(t\\sim 10^{-32}\\text{ s}\\) up to \\(t\\sim 47{,}000\\) years.  \n**Nature of energy:**\n\n1. **Relativistic species dominate**:\n   - Photons, neutrinos, relativistic e\u00b1, maybe other light relics.\n   - Equation of state \\(w \\approx 1/3\\).\n   - \\(\\rho_{\\rm rad} \\propto a^{-4}\\) (three powers for volume dilution, one for redshift of photon energy).\n\n2. **Matter is present but subdominant**:\n   - Non-relativistic dark matter and baryons exist but their energy density scales as \\(\\rho_{\\rm m}\\propto a^{-3}\\), which falls slower than radiation, so they eventually catch up.\n\n### Transformations within this era\n\nSeveral key microphysical events are just energy re-distributions within the plasma:\n\n- **Pair creation / annihilation** (e.g. \\(e^+e^-\\leftrightarrow \\gamma\\gamma\\)): reshuffles energy between species.\n- **Neutrino decoupling**: neutrinos drop out of thermal equilibrium; afterwards their temperature redshifts separately.\n- **Matter\u2013antimatter annihilation**: mostly annihilates to photons, leaving a tiny baryon asymmetry.\n\nAll of that is happening against the background of expansion, which continuously redshifts radiation.\n\n### Energy conservation?\n\n- In a comoving volume, the total radiation energy \\(E_{\\rm rad}(t)\\) decreases as \\(a^{-1}(t)\\).  \n- That \u201clost\u201d energy is not converted into another globally tracked reservoir; it\u2019s simply not globally conserved.\n\nLocally, everything is fine; the Boltzmann equations + Einstein equations enforce \\(\\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Matter-dominated era and beyond (\u201cthereafter\u201d)\n\n**Matter\u2013radiation equality** occurs when \\(\\rho_m = \\rho_{\\rm rad}\\); after that:\n\n1. **Matter-dominated era** (nonrelativistic matter wins):\n   - Cold dark matter and baryons dominate the energy budget.\n   - Equation of state \\(w \\approx 0\\).\n   - \\(\\rho_m \\propto a^{-3}\\).\n\n   Now the energy in a comoving volume of matter is constant (ignoring structure formation and local physics): volume growth cancels the density fall-off.\n\n2. **Dark energy-dominated era** (late times, \\(z \\lesssim 0.7\\)):\n   - Some vacuum-like component (cosmological constant or similar) with \\(w \\approx -1\\) dominates.\n   - Energy density \\(\\rho_\\Lambda\\) is roughly constant; energy in a comoving patch grows like \\(a^3\\).\n\nConceptually, dark energy is quite similar to the inflaton vacuum energy, but at a vastly lower scale and with no known decay (so far as we know today).\n\n### Transformations\n\n- As the universe expands, \\(\\rho_{\\rm rad}\\) falls faster than \\(\\rho_m\\), causing the **transition from radiation domination to matter domination**.\n- Later, \\(\\rho_m\\) falls while \\(\\rho_\\Lambda\\) stays constant, causing the **transition to dark energy domination**.\n\nThese are not usually thought of as \u201cenergy conversion processes\u201d (like reheating) but as **relative scaling** of components under expansion. The microphysics that creates dark matter, baryons, and dark energy has already happened earlier.\n\n---\n\n## 7. So\u2026 did energy conservation hold throughout?\n\nNow we can finally give a clean answer to your last question.\n\n### 7.1 Local vs global\n\n- For **all epochs after the Planck era**, once we have a classical FLRW background plus matter described by QFT, the local conservation law\n  \\[\n  \\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\n  \\]\n  holds exactly, modulo quantum anomalies (which are negligible at the level of standard cosmology).\n\n  This is the rigorous sense in which \u201cenergy\u2013momentum is conserved\u201d in GR.\n\n- There is **no well-defined globally conserved total energy** of the FLRW universe:\n  - No global timelike Killing vector \u2192 no Noether energy charge.\n  - Definitions like Arnowitt\u2013Deser\u2013Misner (ADM) energy require asymptotic flatness; FLRW is not asymptotically flat.\n  - Quasi-local notions of energy work for finite regions but don\u2019t give a global conserved number either.\n\nSo:\n\n> **Energy conservation, in the naive global sense, does not hold in the early Big Bang (or at any time) in an FLRW universe.  \n> But local energy\u2013momentum conservation holds whenever GR applies.**\n\n### 7.2 Inter-epoch transformations, viewed through conservation\n\nHere\u2019s how you can think of each transition:\n\n- **Planck \u2192 GUT era**:  \n  \u201cEmergence\u201d of a classical spacetime and well-defined stress\u2013energy tensor from quantum gravity. Energy notions become meaningful only *after* this.\n\n- **GUT epoch**:  \n  Energy mostly in relativistic quantum fields + scalar potentials. Symmetry breaking reshuffles energy between vacuum energy, kinetic energy of fields, and thermal energy. Locally conserved.\n\n- **GUT \u2192 Inflation** (if inflation occurs near GUT scale):  \n  Inflaton (or some scalar) comes to dominate \\(\\rho\\) via its potential \\(V(\\phi)\\); energy goes from \u201cthermal + fields\u201d to \u201ccoherent vacuum-like scalar\u201d. Local conservation holds via the Einstein\u2013Klein\u2013Gordon system.\n\n- **Inflation \u2192 Reheating**:  \n  The quintessential \u201cenergy conversion\u201d in early cosmology. The homogeneous inflaton condensate decays into particles. Local conservation is explicit in the coupled continuity equations.\n\n- **Reheating \u2192 Radiation era**:  \n  Newly created particles thermalise into a hot plasma. Energy continually redshifted by expansion.\n\n- **Radiation \u2192 Matter \u2192 Dark energy domination**:  \n  No dramatic conversion; the different components with different equations of state (\\(w=1/3,0,-1\\)) just scale differently with \\(a(t)\\), so the dominant form of energy changes over time.\n\nIn none of these stages is there a consistent, observer-independent notion of \u201ctotal energy before\u201d and \u201ctotal energy after\u201d that must match. There *is* a consistent local bookkeeping at the level of fields and fluids.\n\n---\n\n## 8. If you want to push further conceptually\n\nGiven your background, you might find it fruitful to:\n\n- Look at **Noether charges** in GR with boundary terms: where and when you can define an energy (ADM, Bondi, Komar) and why FLRW flunks those criteria.\n- Examine the **continuity equation** in FLRW,\n  \\[\n  \\dot{\\rho} + 3H(\\rho+p/c^2) = 0,\n  \\]\n  as the precise mathematical encoding of \u201cwhat replaces global energy conservation\u201d in homogeneous cosmology.\n- Analyse specific inflation models and reheating mechanisms (e.g. preheating via parametric resonance) at the level of Bogoliubov transformations and particle creation in curved spacetime.\n\nBut the core conceptual bottom line for the early Big Bang is:\n\n- The **form** of energy changed radically (quantum gravitational \u2192 unified relativistic plasma \u2192 inflaton vacuum \u2192 hot radiation \u2192 matter \u2192 dark energy).  \n- **Local** energy\u2013momentum conservation held throughout the regimes we can actually model.  \n- A **global** \u201ctotal energy of the universe\u201d that\u2019s conserved simply does not exist in the GR description of an expanding universe."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"307ac483-4ba8-4ab4-8e1d-f677c78d267e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"b74d5414-1456-4dc2-9bec-2b34c9406525","turn_exchange_id":"01f40b62-036e-44dc-93cd-7c6dc1cf35d1","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"b74d5414-1456-4dc2-9bec-2b34c9406525","children":["1b45fa84-9515-472f-9d35-db9c5cd3fa33"]},"1b45fa84-9515-472f-9d35-db9c5cd3fa33":{"id":"1b45fa84-9515-472f-9d35-db9c5cd3fa33","message":{"id":"1b45fa84-9515-472f-9d35-db9c5cd3fa33","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763535724.453,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Let us look at the universe as it is today.

How much vacuum energy is \u201ccreated per second\u201d today?\n\nFirst, we need some numbers.\n\n- Present-day Hubble parameter \\(H_0\\) (Hubble constant):  \n  \\(H_0 \\approx 67.4\\ \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}} \\approx 2.18\\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n\n- Vacuum (dark energy) density \\( \\rho_{\\text{vac}} \\):  \n  Observations give  \n  \\[\n  \\rho_{\\text{vac}} \\approx 5.96\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}\n  \\approx 5.36\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}\n  \\]\n  using \\(E = \\rho c^2\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn2search12\ue201  \n\n- Comoving radius of the observable universe today:  \n  \\(R_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 46.5\\ \\text{billion light years} \\approx 4.4\\times 10^{26}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n  This corresponds to a comoving volume  \n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{obs}} \\approx \\frac{4\\pi}{3} R_{\\text{obs}}^3 \\approx 3.6\\times 10^{80}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n  \\]\n\nAssume:\n\n- Dark energy *is* genuine vacuum energy with **constant** energy density (cosmological constant \\(\\Lambda\\));  \n- We look at a **fixed comoving patch** whose physical volume grows with the scale factor \\(a(t)\\). Take that patch to be \u201cthe region that is the observable universe today.\u201d\n\n### Energy in vacuum in that region now\n\nCurrent vacuum energy in that comoving region:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{vac}}(t_0) = \\rho_{\\text{vac}} V_{\\text{obs}}\n\\approx (5.36\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}})\\times (3.6\\times 10^{80}\\,\\mathrm{m^3})\n\\approx 2\\times 10^{71}\\,\\mathrm{J}.\n\\]\n\nOrder-of-magnitude: \\(E_{\\text{vac}} \\sim 10^{71}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\) inside today\u2019s observable universe.\n\n### How fast does this energy increase?\n\nFor any comoving region in a Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) universe:\n\n- Physical volume scales as \\(V(t)\\propto a(t)^3\\),\n- The rate of change is\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 3H(t)\\,V(t).\n  \\]\n\nAssuming \u201ccurrent rate\u201d means we freeze \\(H(t)\\approx H_0\\) (ignore acceleration, as you requested) and evaluate the instantaneous rate at **today**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E_{\\text{vac}}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n= \\rho_{\\text{vac}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n= \\rho_{\\text{vac}} \\cdot 3H_0 V_{\\text{obs}}.\n\\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{vac}} \\approx 5.36\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}} \\)\n- \\( H_0 \\approx 2.18\\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\)\n- \\( V_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 3.6\\times 10^{80}\\,\\mathrm{m^3} \\)\n\ngives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E_{\\text{vac}}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\approx 1.3\\times 10^{54}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}.\n\\]\n\nEquivalently, via \\(E = mc^2\\), this corresponds to a mass creation rate (if you insist on a mass equivalent):\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} \\sim \\frac{1.3\\times 10^{54}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}}{c^2}\n\\approx 1.4\\times 10^{37}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}}\n\\sim 7\\times 10^6\\ M_\\odot/\\text{s},\n\\]\nwhere \\(M_\\odot\\) is one solar mass.\n\nFor comparison:\n\n- Total luminosity of all stars in the observable universe is \\(\\sim 10^{49}\\,\\mathrm{W} = 10^{49}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n\nSo *in this bookkeeping*, vacuum energy in \u201cour\u201d observable comoving patch increases at a rate roughly **\\(10^5\\) times larger** than the total stellar power output of all stars.\n\n### But what does \u201ccreated\u201d even mean here?\n\nKey conceptual points:\n\n- In **general relativity (GR)** there is **no globally conserved total energy** in an expanding FLRW spacetime. There is no timelike Killing vector, hence no conserved Noether charge you can interpret as \u201ctotal energy of the universe\u201d.\n- The quantity I just computed is:\n  > \u201cThe instantaneous rate at which \\(E_{\\text{vac}}(t)=\\rho_{\\text{vac}}V(t)\\) increases *inside a comoving region whose volume is that of the observable universe today*.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an invariant cosmic observable; it\u2019s a perfectly well-defined but **coordinate-dependent** bookkeeping number. Locally, all that\u2019s happening is:\n\n- The vacuum energy **density** stays constant;  \n- The region\u2019s physical volume increases;  \n- So \\(E_{\\text{vac}}\\) in that region increases.\n\nThere is no local process where some other component is losing energy and vacuum energy is \u201cgaining\u201d it; it is just the consequence of constant \\(\\rho_{\\text{vac}}\\) and growing \\(V\\) in a spacetime without global energy conservation.\n\nIf the universe is spatially infinite, then both the total vacuum energy and its \u201cincrease per second\u201d are formally infinite; you *must* specify a finite region to get a finite number.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Will vacuum energy eventually turn into other forms?\n\nShort answer for the standard picture: **No, not in the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM model**.\n\nHere are the possibilities.\n\n### 2.1 Cosmological constant \\(\\Lambda\\) (the baseline \u039bCDM model)\n\nThe \u201cvanilla\u201d model of late-time cosmology is \u039bCDM (\u201cLambda cold dark matter\u201d), in which:\n\n- Dark energy is exactly a **cosmological constant**: a constant term in Einstein\u2019s equations, equivalent to a vacuum energy density with equation of state \\(w = p/\\rho c^2 = -1\\).\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{vac}} \\) is strictly constant in time and space.\n- There are **no couplings** that exchange energy between vacuum and matter or radiation.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Vacuum energy **never decays** into other components.\n- Matter and radiation densities keep dropping (\\(\\rho_{\\rm m}\\propto a^{-3}\\), \\(\\rho_{\\rm rad}\\propto a^{-4}\\)), while \\(\\rho_{\\text{vac}}\\) stays constant.\n- The universe asymptotically approaches a **de Sitter** phase: exponential expansion with fixed Hubble parameter \\(H_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\Lambda/3}\\).\n\nThere is an associated **Gibbons\u2013Hawking temperature** for the de Sitter horizon, \\(T \\sim \\hbar H_\\infty/(2\\pi k_B)\\), and the horizon can be thought of as radiating very weakly, but that is not a practical mechanism for converting vacuum energy into matter in any significant amount; the flux is absurdly tiny and the global energy accounting is still ill-defined.\n\nSo: under strict cosmological constant physics, vacuum energy just **stays vacuum energy**, forever, while its fractional dominance increases.\n\n### 2.2 Dynamical dark energy (quintessence, etc.)\n\nIn many models dark energy is not a pure cosmological constant but comes from a **scalar field** \\(\\phi\\) with some potential \\(V(\\phi)\\):\n\n- Equation of state parameter \\(w\\) is close to \\(-1\\) now, but can vary in time.\n- As \\(\\phi\\) rolls, \\(V(\\phi)\\) can decrease and its energy can, in principle, turn into kinetic energy and/or radiation/matter.\n\nThese \u201cdynamical dark energy\u201d models (quintessence, k-essence, coupled dark energy, etc.) are *heavily* constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae, and large-scale structure: current data are consistent with \\(w = -1\\) to within a few percent and show no compelling evidence for strong coupling to matter. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n\nSo while it is **logically possible** that:\n\n- Today\u2019s vacuum-like component is metastable and will later roll/decay, converting energy into other forms,\n\nwe have **no empirical evidence** that this is happening at a measurable rate, and any such process must be extremely slow on Hubble timescales.\n\n### 2.3 Metastable vacuum and bubble decay\n\nA more radical possibility is that our current vacuum is a **false vacuum**:\n\n- Quantum tunnelling could nucleate a bubble of lower-energy \u201ctrue vacuum\u201d.\n- Inside that bubble, the vacuum energy would be lower (possibly zero or negative), and the energy difference would appear as a blast of radiation/particles.\n\nThis would indeed be a dramatic \u201cconversion\u201d of vacuum energy into other forms, but:\n\n- It is purely speculative; no sign of such an instability is seen in cosmology.\n- If it happens, it likely nukes our standard model vacuum and everything in it, so not a useful energy source.\n\nBottom line: this is a theoretical curiosity, not something you can build into a realistic forward model with current data.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Conceptual summary\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- **How much vacuum energy is \u201ccreated per second\u201d today?**  \n  In a comoving region whose present size is the observable universe, the vacuum energy (assuming constant density) increases at the rate\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E_{\\text{vac}}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\bigg|_{t_0}\\sim 10^{54}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}},\n  \\]\n  about \\(10^5\\) times the total stellar power output in that same region.\n\n- **Is that real energy creation?**  \n  It\u2019s \u201creal\u201d in the sense that \\(E_{\\text{vac}}=\\rho_{\\text{vac}}V\\) for that region does increase, but **there is no global energy conservation law** in an expanding FLRW spacetime, so you must not try to interpret this as energy being siphoned from some other reservoir.\n\n- **Will this vacuum energy turn into other forms?**  \n  - In the **standard cosmological constant (\u039bCDM) picture**: *no*. Vacuum energy remains what it is; matter and radiation dilute; the universe tends to de Sitter.  \n  - In **dynamical dark energy or decaying vacuum models**: maybe, but current observations say any such evolution must be tiny today.  \n  - In exotic **vacuum decay** scenarios: yes, in a catastrophic phase transition, but that\u2019s speculative and unobserved.\n\nSo the forward-looking view, if you take \u039bCDM at face value, is slightly brutal: the vacuum energy density stays put, its integrated amount in any comoving region grows with volume, and there is no known mechanism that will ever convert this dark energy into something we can use or that will reheat the universe again."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":643,"end_idx":677,"safe_urls":["https://www.iac.es/es/ciencia-y-tecnologia/publicaciones/planck-2018-results-vi-cosmological-parameters","https://www.iac.es/es/ciencia-y-tecnologia/publicaciones/planck-2018-results-vi-cosmological-parameters?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344382189_Planck_2018_results_VI_Cosmological_parameters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344382189_Planck_2018_results_VI_Cosmological_parameters?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344382189_Planck_2018_results_VI_Cosmological_parameters?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"(PDF) Planck 2018 results: VI.
