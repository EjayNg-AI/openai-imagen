The startup, founded on MIT research, produces chips using gallium nitride (GaN), a material considered more efficient than traditional silicon. These chips are designed for AI data centers, which are notorious for high power consumption and energy losses due to heat during voltage conversion. Vertical's unique approach involves stacking transistors vertically rather than the traditional horizontal layout, potentially reducing chip size and heat generation.\n\nBacked by Playground Global, Vertical aims to disrupt the power chip market\u2014currently populated by established companies like Renesas, Infineon, and Power Integrations\u2014who are also developing GaN chips in collaboration with Nvidia.

Lilly announced promising results from two late-stage clinical trials of its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron. The pill showed superior blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to other treatments. Orforglipron, which mimics the appetite-suppressing GLP-1 hormone, demonstrated a reduction in A1C levels by up to 1.7%, outperforming AstraZeneca\u2019s dapagliflozin (Farxiga), which achieved a 0.8% reduction. A second trial showed an even greater A1C reduction of 2.1% when orforglipron was combined with insulin glargine. Both trials also reported weight loss and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors over a 40-week period across various dosages. Eli Lilly highlights these results as reinforcing orforglipron's potential to become a new standard of care for type 2 diabetes. Approval submissions for diabetes treatment are planned for 2026, with obesity treatment submissions expected by the end of 2025.

The overhaul includes requirements for 20-year regional transmission planning assessments, revisited every five years, new cost-sharing plans, and periodic project re-evaluation for cost-overruns or delays. FERC also emphasizes modifying existing facilities instead of replacing them and involving state agencies and public meetings in the planning processes.

Materials announced it is expecting a $600 million revenue loss in fiscal 2026 due to expanded U.S. export restrictions, particularly targeting exports to China.

The company foresees an additional $110 million revenue impact for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. This development adds further strain to chip equipment makers already affected by U.S. tariffs and a weak Chinese market. Despite these challenges, Applied Materials reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue of $7.30 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and a 2.5% annual increase to $27.18 billion for fiscal 2024. U.S. officials are also pushing strategies to reduce dependency on Taiwan for chip manufacturing, proposing a 50-50 production split.

These rules aim to support the Biden administration's objective to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050 by making the power grid more resilient to climate-fueled extreme weather events. The overhaul includes requirements for 20-year regional transmission planning assessments, revisited every five years, new cost-sharing plans, and periodic project re-evaluation for cost-overruns or delays. FERC also emphasizes modifying existing facilities instead of replacing them and involving state agencies and public meetings in the planning processes. The decision received mixed reactions; Chairman Willie Phillips stressed its urgency, while Commissioner Mark Christie criticized it as overreaching. The action is expected to enhance the power grid, supported by initiatives like President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes clean energy projects.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5news20\ue201","start_idx":10315,"end_idx":10333,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/samsung-set-highest-q3-profit-three-years-ai-demand-lifts-chip-prices-2025-10-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/samsung-set-highest-q3-profit-three-years-ai-demand-lifts-chip-prices-2025-10-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Samsung set for highest Q3 profit in three years as AI demand lifts chip prices","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/samsung-set-highest-q3-profit-three-years-ai-demand-lifts-chip-prices-2025-10-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1760310171,"snippet":"Samsung Electronics is anticipated to report its highest third-quarter profit since 2022, with analysts projecting an operating profit of 10.1 trillion won ($7.11 billion) for Q3 2025\u2014a 10% year-over-year increase. The profit boost is largely attributed to rising memory chip prices driven by strong server demand and inventory rebuilding tied to artificial intelligence (AI) growth. Although Samsung has faced delays in supplying its latest high-bandwidth memory (HBM3E) chips to Nvidia, its conventional memory chip segment has performed strongly, aided by a 171.8% year-on-year increase in DRAM prices.\n\nDespite this, competitors like SK Hynix and Micron have reaped more benefits from the AI-driven market. Samsung\u2019s restricted access to China due to U.S. regulations has limited its growth as well. However, new deals with OpenAI and Tesla have improved investor sentiment. These include a $16.5 billion foundry deal with Tesla and supply partnerships for AI projects. Samsung\u2019s shares have surged over 43% since announcing the Tesla deal, and expectations are rising for its contract chip manufacturing business. Still, risks remain due to potential U.S. tariffs and China's export controls on rare earth materials.

Initiated during Trump's first term and expanded by the Biden administration through the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the BRIC program had allocated approximately $1 billion, with $133 million already distributed to around 450 applicants. These grants were utilized for projects such as elevating roads and installing drought-resistant systems. The cuts follow a broader trend of the Trump administration targeting federal programs related to climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

The states argue that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) overstepped its authority by terminating the multibillion-dollar grant initiative, which had already been approved and funded by Congress. The program, established in 2018, finances up to 75% (or 90% in rural areas) of infrastructure projects designed to mitigate damage from natural disasters, such as flood walls, evacuation shelters, and road improvements. FEMA's abrupt decision, announced in April, has come under scrutiny, especially following deadly floods in Texas earlier this month. The states, led by Washington and Massachusetts, claim that the termination violates the principle of separation of powers. FEMA defended its decision by labeling the program as wasteful and politically influenced, but has not formally responded to the lawsuit. Since its inception, BRIC has distributed approximately $4.5 billion across nearly 2,000 projects, primarily benefiting coastal states.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6news19\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6news21\ue201","start_idx":4019,"end_idx":4076,"safe_urls":["https://elpais.com/mexico/economia/2025-10-12/mexico-trabaja-para-solventar-la-escasez-de-electricidad-que-ancla-su-manufactura.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ir.prologis.com/press-releases/detail/1025/prologis-reports-third-quarter-2025-results?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.prologis.com/insights-news/research/impacts-nearshoring-demand-mexican-logistics-real-estate?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/prologis-tops-quarterly-estimates-strong-warehouse-leasing-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/prologis-tops-quarterly-estimates-strong-warehouse-leasing-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Prologis tops quarterly estimates on strong warehouse leasing","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/prologis-tops-quarterly-estimates-strong-warehouse-leasing-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1760534926,"snippet":"Prologis, a San Francisco-based warehouse-focused real estate investment trust, exceeded Wall Street expectations for its third-quarter 2025 revenue and core funds from operations (FFO), driven by strong leasing demand.

CrowdStrike has implemented a new quality control check to prevent future occurrences and released information to fix affected systems, although recovery is expected to take time. This incident has highlighted the vulnerability of organisations to single points of failure in their IT systems.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":65}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue201","start_idx":10078,"end_idx":10097,"safe_urls":["https://ir.atimaterials.com/news-events/news-details/2025/ATI-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ir.atimaterials.com](https://ir.atimaterials.com/news-events/news-details/2025/ATI-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"ATI Announces Second Quarter 2025 Results","url":"https://ir.atimaterials.com/news-events/news-details/2025/ATI-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753920000,"snippet":"Aerospace and defense sales of $762 million, representing 67% of Q2 2025 sales.

The company reported a record 62 million square feet in lease signings during the quarter. Quarterly core FFO came in at $1.49 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.44. Total revenue reached $2.21 billion, surpassing the expected $2.16 billion.\n\nAmid heightened logistics activity from importers preparing for potential U.S. tariffs, demand for warehouse storage has surged. CEO Hamid Moghadam noted that the logistics market is nearing an inflection point for rent and occupancy growth, calling it one of the most promising market conditions he has seen in four decades. In light of its strong performance, Prologis raised its 2025 core FFO forecast to a range of $5.78\u2013$5.81 per share, up slightly from its previous outlook.

This update affected approximately 8.5 million Windows devices, leading to disruptions in various sectors including aviation and banking. The U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee has requested a testimony from CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, and the financial losses are estimated to be $5.4 billion for U.S. Fortune 500 companies, excluding Microsoft. The issue was traced to a fault in CrowdStrike's Falcon platform, which contained problematic content data due to a bug in the company's internal quality control mechanism. CrowdStrike has implemented a new quality control check to prevent future occurrences and released information to fix affected systems, although recovery is expected to take time.

Avoiding unreliable sources and substituted Techradar with accurate data center revenue.\n\n**Analyzing customer concentration**\n\nI\u2019m looking at turn4search6's Q2 FY26 SEC 10-Q, showing Customer A at 20% and Customer B at 15%. Overall, the customer concentration is notably high, so further exploration is necessary.\n\n**Building scenario models**\n\nI\u2019m approximating FY2026 EPS for NVDA, factoring in base case assumptions like FY2026 revenue around $200B and net margins around 54%, while noting the importance of avoiding unsupported claims.\n\n**Evaluating both potential outcomes**\n\nI\u2019m working through a base case scenario with steady growth, gradual customer diversification, and stable margins. Then, I\u2019m examining downside risks like capex cuts, algorithmic advances, and regulatory crackdowns.\n\n**Evaluating volatility**\n\nI'm analyzing a \"vol of vol\" event risk, focusing on a potential 20-30% drop from negative headlines like major cloud capex cuts. Historical drawdowns, notably a 65% drop in 2022, are also considered.\n\n**Analyzing NVDA's dynamics**\n\nI\u2019m mapping out NVDA's current momentum, guidance, and market factors. Considerations include AI capex, NVIDIA's software moat, data center growth, high-performance computing, and potential share loss.\n\n**Evaluating tail risks**\n\nExamining factors like sovereign AI developments, HPC victories, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Monitoring key metrics and geopolitical influences to assess NVDA's stability and market dynamics.\n\n**Gathering updates**\n\nI\u2019m pulling together credible Reuters FAQs regarding SK Hynix sales, HBM constraints, and NVDA supply. I\u2019ll integrate insights on NVDA's China forecasts and export controls.\n\n**Charting growth scenarios**\n\nI'm piecing together potential growth paths for NVDA, factoring in variable EPS growth and market multiples. Analyzing positive and negative risks to pinpoint ideal growth rates and forecasts.\n\n**Mapping supply chain dynamics**\n\nI\u2019m examining NVDA's reliance on TSMC for Blackwell 4NP. This helps identify potential ripple effects across the semiconductor industry and offers more precise analysis of current and future impacts.\n\n**Interpreter of NVDA investment**\n\nI\u2019m refining the NVDA investment evaluation, detailing compute demand, supply constraints, software moat, and risk factors. Presenting scenarios, price ranges, and potential EPS impacts.\n\n**Charting future potential**\n\nExamining NVDA's valuation tail risks and rewards, I\u2019m assessing different EPS scenarios, including short-term expectations and long-term growth, with a focus on monitoring and hedging strategies."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 8m 4s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-16727f90-7add-4f05-b09d-fd8ccb279f66","parent_id":"1dfd886b-b79f-4189-8bce-91149c5b560a","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":30,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"request_id":"16727f90-7add-4f05-b09d-fd8ccb279f66","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","turn_exchange_id":"d0dfdd0d-6066-4b2b-a8e9-30e8de974f93","timestamp_":"absolute","finished_duration_sec":484,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1dfd886b-b79f-4189-8bce-91149c5b560a","children":["ac992e88-fffa-4095-ae46-75142bc27455"]},"ac992e88-fffa-4095-ae46-75142bc27455":{"id":"ac992e88-fffa-4095-ae46-75142bc27455","message":{"id":"ac992e88-fffa-4095-ae46-75142bc27455","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762239224.056417,"update_time":1762239004.94838,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s a hard\u2011nosed assessment of **NVIDIA (NVDA)** at **today\u2019s price**\u2014what\u2019s priced in, where upside/downside can come from, and the **fat\u2011tailed** outcomes (both good and bad) you actually have to underwrite.\n\n\ue200finance\ue202turn1finance0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Where the stock is now & what\u2019s implied\n\n- **Price / size.** NVDA is ~**$206.9** per share (~**$5T** market cap; first company to hit that mark on **Oct 29, 2025**). \ue200cite\ue202turn1finance0\ue202turn2news29\ue201  \n- **Run\u2011rate fundamentals (company\u2011reported).** **Q2 FY26** revenue **$46.7B** (+56% y/y), **Data Center $41.1B** (+56% y/y), **GAAP GM 72.4%**, **GAAP net income $26.4B**\u2014**in a single quarter**.

This milestone was fueled by the soaring demand for its GPUs, which have become essential for training and deploying AI technologies such as ChatGPT and image generators. The company has rapidly grown since early 2023, particularly benefiting from the global AI boom. Within just 79 trading days, Nvidia's valuation jumped from $4 trillion to $5 trillion, and earlier took only 41 trading days to rise from $3 trillion to $4 trillion.\n\nAs of this milestone, Nvidia's market cap surpasses Microsoft's ($4.025 trillion) and Apple's ($4 trillion), placing it at the top of the S&P 500. The company accounts for a significant 18.6% of the S&P 500's gains in 2025 through September. Nvidia has also returned $24.2 billion to shareholders in the first half of fiscal 2026 via stock buybacks and dividends. Its CEO, Jensen Huang, now holds a fortune of $179.6 billion, ranking 8th on Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires List. Nvidia\u2019s market value now exceeds Japan\u2019s GDP, which stands at $4.28 trillion.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201","start_idx":780,"end_idx":798,"safe_urls":["https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/NVDA-F2Q26-Quarterly-Presentation-FINAL.pdf"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Q4 Holdings](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/NVDA-F2Q26-Quarterly-Presentation-FINAL.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"PowerPoint Presentation","url":"https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/NVDA-F2Q26-Quarterly-Presentation-FINAL.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Q4 Holdings"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search6\ue201","start_idx":922,"end_idx":955,"safe_urls":["https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/pe-ratio?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([StockAnalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"NVIDIA (NVDA) Statistics & Valuation","url":"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The next confirmed earnings date is Wednesday, November 19, 2025, after market close. ...

revised its forecast for AI-related infrastructure investments by major tech companies, expecting spending to surpass $2.8 trillion by 2029, up from a previous estimate of $2.3 trillion. The increase is attributed to early, aggressive investments by hyperscalers\u2014large-scale data center operators such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet\u2014as well as rising enterprise demand for AI capabilities. By 2026, AI capital expenditures are projected to reach $490 billion.\n\nThis surge in spending follows the explosive growth of AI technologies after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite challenges like China's development of cheaper alternatives and concerns about U.S. trade tariffs under President Donald Trump. Citigroup estimates that the global need for AI computing will require 55 gigawatts of additional power by 2030, costing around $2.8 trillion, with $1.4 trillion to be spent in the U.S. alone.\n\nNotably, tech firms are increasingly turning to borrowing rather than relying solely on profits to finance these vast infrastructure projects. This trend is impacting their free cash flows and raising questions among investors about sustainable funding methods. Citigroup also highlights that enterprises such as Eli Lilly, Hitachi, and Wolters Kluwer are already demonstrating real-world AI use, validating the technology\u2019s value.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Dell'Oro Group"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201","start_idx":2968,"end_idx":2987,"safe_urls":["https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-just-announced-record-60-billion-buyback-heres-what-it-means-investors?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-just-announced-record-60-billion-buyback-heres-what-it-means-investors?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nvidia Just Announced a Record $60 Billion Buyback","url":"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-just-announced-record-60-billion-buyback-heres-what-it-means-investors?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Aug 28, 2025 \u2014 \"During the first half of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $24.3 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends,\" the ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Nasdaq"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3news21\ue202turn3news22\ue201","start_idx":3694,"end_idx":3724,"safe_urls":["https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-spending-stocks-alphabet-amazon-meta-d583f520?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-price-target-lowered-slowing-data-center-builds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-spending-stocks-alphabet-amazon-meta-d583f520?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"An AI Spending Slowdown Would Drag Down the Market: Goldman Sachs","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-spending-stocks-alphabet-amazon-meta-d583f520?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1757348940,"snippet":"Goldman Sachs has issued a warning that the current AI-driven investment boom, which has been a major driver of stock market gains, may slow significantly, posing risks to the broader market. Analysts noted that Big Tech firms like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have poured over $300 billion into AI capital expenditures in the past year, propelling earnings for companies involved in data center infrastructure, including power suppliers and semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nHowever, Goldman predicts a sharp deceleration in AI capex growth starting in Q4 2025 and extending into 2026. If spending falls back to 2022 levels ($158 billion), compared to the anticipated $433 billion for 2026, it could slash the S&P 500\u2019s projected sales growth by 30%, posing a \"substantial downside risk.\" While forecasts for AI investment have continued to rise, with 2026 capex estimates increasing by $70 billion recently, future earnings reports will be critical in testing the sustainability of this spending surge.

Analyst Atif Malik cited lower GDP projections, Microsoft\u2019s revised spending plans, and macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014including the impact of Trump administration tariffs\u2014as key reasons behind the revised outlook. These reduced capital expenditures are likely to limit sales of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and Marvell\u2019s custom AI accelerators.

The Blackwell chips, noted for their increased speed and efficiency, are now scheduled to ship in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Huang was in Denmark to launch a new supercomputer, Gefion, featuring 1,528 GPUs.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn10search5\ue201","start_idx":6082,"end_idx":6102,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tech-leaders-ramp-up-ai-spending-alphabets-cash-flow-wins-investor-favor-2025-10-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tech-leaders-ramp-up-ai-spending-alphabets-cash-flow-wins-investor-favor-2025-10-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Tech

current AI-driven investment boom, which has been a major driver of stock market gains, may slow significantly, posing risks to the broader market. Analysts noted that Big Tech firms like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have poured over $300 billion into AI capital expenditures in the past year, propelling earnings for companies involved in data center infrastructure, including power suppliers and semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nHowever, Goldman predicts a sharp deceleration in AI capex growth starting in Q4 2025 and extending into 2026. If spending falls back to 2022 levels ($158 billion), compared to the anticipated $433 billion for 2026, it could slash the S&P 500\u2019s projected sales growth by 30%, posing a \"substantial downside risk.\" While forecasts for AI investment have continued to rise, with 2026 capex estimates increasing by $70 billion recently, future earnings reports will be critical in testing the sustainability of this spending surge. A slowdown could signal weaker AI demand and hurt long-term growth expectations, although it might also ease concerns about return on investment for hyperscalers.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Barron's"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4news17\ue201","start_idx":8430,"end_idx":8448,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-takes-eu-antitrust-regulators-court-probing-ai-startup-runai-bid-2025-02-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-takes-eu-antitrust-regulators-court-probing-ai-startup-runai-bid-2025-02-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nvidia takes EU antitrust regulators to court for probing AI startup Run:ai bid","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-takes-eu-antitrust-regulators-court-probing-ai-startup-runai-bid-2025-02-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1740423517,"snippet":"Nvidia has filed a lawsuit against EU antitrust regulators for accepting an Italian request to investigate its acquisition of AI startup Run:ai, despite a previous court ruling limiting their power over minor deals.

Additionally, Huang was in Denmark to launch a new supercomputer, Gefion, featuring 1,528 GPUs.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202NVDA: Fresh context on growth, policy & supply\ue202turn2news29,turn5news20,turn5news21,turn7news29,turn9news17,turn3news20,turn3news21\ue201","start_idx":10283,"end_idx":10423,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/2579fbc39a8e0107db3912bc7ba9a256?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://images.openai.com/static-rsc-1/oCfidtA3Uj4l4BHG8bT0arMHhVSUhcgTIZOEzSLTv3hqaMmopKRZSAUOsmeK2gxuxeLaf3-I5CtOjIQcDl46eoeKbznL4PACwvxFIoNJKWe_SuEnqB7fmKfNkgLu5LGbheLrpa7SFYUZ8c192yL5kmCXMRPVTXSxFn2TARZ3paC5XyGtJ2eLVfWebaSK--55xQCEcKlXZ0VhykO2UeG0cP1qv5SgrCwdJ-xuPALxaD_A3ctSui3Pu9nAL7gfJRkXzzKO82KltEJhJdzM4sSNTgafOlf_a2uBmKmbY1xw2NkCkhkhQii84TfeaBujOoxzTBShu4d_7b0iM6nO2rxmRg","https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-spending-stocks-alphabet-amazon-meta-d583f520?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-center-demand-push-us-power-use-record-highs-2025-26-eia-says-2025-06-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-centers-could-use-9-us-electricity-by-2030-research-institute-says-2024-05-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-design-flaw-with-blackwell-ai-chips-now-fixed-ceo-says-2024-10-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/china/citigroup-forecasts-big-techs-ai-spending-cross-28-trillion-by-2029-2025-09-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/sk-hynix-says-readying-hbm4-production-after-completing-internal-certification-2025-09-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"alt":"- [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/2579fbc39a8e0107db3912bc7ba9a256?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-center-demand-push-us-power-use-record-highs-2025-26-eia-says-2025-06-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-centers-could-use-9-us-electricity-by-2030-research-institute-says-2024-05-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/sk-hynix-says-readying-hbm4-production-after-completing-internal-certification-2025-09-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-design-flaw-with-blackwell-ai-chips-now-fixed-ceo-says-2024-10-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/citigroup-forecasts-big-techs-ai-spending-cross-28-trillion-by-2029-2025-09-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-spending-stocks-alphabet-amazon-meta-d583f520?utm_source=chatgpt.com)","prompt_text":"\nnavlist containing the following URLs:\n- [Nvidia has started the $5 trillion club.

revised its forecast for AI-related infrastructure investments by major tech companies, expecting spending to surpass $2.8 trillion by 2029, up from a previous estimate of $2.3 trillion. The increase is attributed to early, aggressive investments by hyperscalers\u2014large-scale data center operators such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet\u2014as well as rising enterprise demand for AI capabilities. By 2026, AI capital expenditures are projected to reach $490 billion.\n\nThis surge in spending follows the explosive growth of AI technologies after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite challenges like China's development of cheaper alternatives and concerns about U.S. trade tariffs under President Donald Trump. Citigroup estimates that the global need for AI computing will require 55 gigawatts of additional power by 2030, costing around $2.8 trillion, with $1.4 trillion to be spent in the U.S. alone.\n\nNotably, tech firms are increasingly turning to borrowing rather than relying solely on profits to finance these vast infrastructure projects. This trend is impacting their free cash flows and raising questions among investors about sustainable funding methods. Citigroup also highlights that enterprises such as Eli Lilly, Hitachi, and Wolters Kluwer are already demonstrating real-world AI use, validating the technology\u2019s value.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Data center demand to push US power use to record highs in 2025, '26, EIA says","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-center-demand-push-us-power-use-record-highs-2025-26-eia-says-2025-06-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook, U.S. electricity consumption is projected to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, driven largely by the growing demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Total power demand is forecasted to increase from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025 and 4,283 billion kWh in 2026. Residential, commercial, and industrial electricity usage is also expected to rise, nearing or exceeding historical record levels. In terms of energy sources, natural gas is projected to decline slightly from 42% of power generation in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026, while coal's share slowly decreases and renewables rise from 23% in 2024 to 27% in 2026.

According to the Electric Power Research Institute, which conducted the analysis, the growth rate in electricity consumption by data centers could range from 3.7% to 15% annually, depending on the adoption and energy efficiency of technologies like generative AI. The increasing demand for power by data centers, along with the expansion of manufacturing and transportation electrification, is revitalizing the US electricity industry after decades of stagnant growth. Large data centers require significant power, comparable to that needed for 750,000 homes. This rise in electricity demand could strain the grid, leading to higher power bills and potential outages. The institute highlighted the rapid growth of the data center business, notably post-2022 with OpenAI's ChatGPT, stressing the need for improved energy efficiency and grid investments. In 2023, about 80% of the US data center load was concentrated in 15 states, primarily Virginia and Texas.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Microsoft CTO claims company will mainly use its own AI ...","url":"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-cto-claims-company-will-mainly-use-its-own-chips-for-ai-in-the-future/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Oct 2, 2025 \u2014 Microsoft also announced plans for the Maia 200 - but in June 2025, reports emerged that it was pushing back mass production until 2026.

ASML is appealing long-term but high-risk with its valuation. Micron sees cyclical risks, Vertiv\u2019s recent run could be overextended. NVDA offers enormous potential but heavy risk. Given the user's preference for precise analysis, I think I'll prioritize a solid long-term bet despite some structural risks.\n\n**Evaluating ASML as a strong pick**\n\nASML is a unique monopoly with high switching costs and long-term potential, especially with EUV tech being essential for both logic and memory. Despite risks like export controls and cyclical nature, its long-term outlook remains strong. I'll fetch the latest data and valuations to confirm if it's a sound choice.\n\n**Confirming ASML's potential**\n\nI need to ensure our sources are solid for a strong recommendation on ASML. I'll gather the latest results, including guidance, shipments, and key insights around its EUV monopoly and High-NA expansion. This will confirm ASML\u2019s unique position in the market and help assess its valuation against the backdrop of long-term growth.\n\n**Scenario analysis for ASML**\n\nI will gather key data for ASML, including Q3 2025 results, revenue, gross margin, bookings, and backlog. I\u2019ll also confirm High-NA shipments and its EUV monopoly claim. To complete the picture, I'll reference the forward P/E valuation from reliable sources and include a price chart for clarity.\n\n**Explaining ASML vs. NVDA**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on ASML\u2019s structural advantages, like its oligopoly and service-based revenue model, and explain why it offers better downside protection while having similar upside to NVDA. I'll include potential positive and negative scenarios, plus key indicators to watch, particularly bookings, shipments, and forecasts.\n\n**Choosing ASML over others**\n\nI\u2019ll present ASML\u2019s case using its unique co-specific advantages like a durable monopoly, multi-customer base, and potential for technological leaps. I'll briefly compare it to NVDA, citing its lower customer risk and less dependence on capex. I'll focus on why ASML is the better pick at current prices.\n\n**Compiling information for ASML analysis**\n\nI want to gather solid, credible sources like ASML\u2019s press releases and SEMI updates. The risk on export control and China\u2019s 2026 impact is important, and I\u2019ll mention that ASML expects 2026 sales to be in line with 2025. I\u2019ll also include the Q3 bookings and \u20ac3.6b in EUV sales, plus add a stock price chart for clarity.\n\n**Explaining why ASML stands out**\n\nASML has a strong moat due to its monopoly on EUV, supported by a very complex supply chain. It\u2019s durable with increasing adoption in DRAM and HBM, plus the rising use of High-NA. Earnings are strong with expanding service revenue. Risks include export controls and geopolitical concerns, but competitor potential is minimal.\n\n**Why I choose ASML now**\n\n- Moat: EUV monopoly, complex supply chain.\n- Durability: Growing adoption in DRAM/HBM, High-NA adoption.\n- Earnings: Service revenue rising.\n- Risks: Export controls, China, supply fragility.\n- Positive scenarios: Memory EUV and advanced packaging.\n- Negative: If computational advances reduce EUV need\u2014a low likelihood.\n\nASML isn\u2019t cheap, but compared to NVDA, it's more balanced. For a 5-year outlook, key conditions include adoption rates and China mix.\n\n**Why ASML now?**\n\nI\u2019ll present ASML with a clear rationale. The finance widget will show the stock chart. For comparison:\n\n- **NVDA**: High P/E, but $5T market cap introduces more volatility.\n- **ASML**: High P/E but less risk; expected revenue growth around 12-15%, with IRR in the low-teens. \n\nScenario analysis: Bull: High-NA adoption = higher IRR. Bear: Export controls = mid-single-digit IRR."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 5m 57s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"saserver-japanwest-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-5f5b28a9-2628-450a-872e-924436122cea:JP","parent_id":"858ad29f-6457-4149-8843-239c1e04f66d","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":30,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_691495a3b7fc81919d2ac1a56e1679c0","async_task_conversation_id":"691495a3-b820-8321-aebb-2289039dd0ec","async_task_created_at":"2025-11-12T14:11:48.068075Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"858ad29f-6457-4149-8843-239c1e04f66d","request_id":"5f5b28a9-2628-450a-872e-924436122cea","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","turn_exchange_id":"8726c2cd-f847-413a-8c5f-ec3137067e7c","timestamp_":"absolute","finished_duration_sec":357,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"858ad29f-6457-4149-8843-239c1e04f66d","children":["5ed80c17-ae0b-49cf-99b2-35e29d8a5d29"]},"5ed80c17-ae0b-49cf-99b2-35e29d8a5d29":{"id":"5ed80c17-ae0b-49cf-99b2-35e29d8a5d29","message":{"id":"5ed80c17-ae0b-49cf-99b2-35e29d8a5d29","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762956708.285868,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"async_task_id":"promode_691495a3b7fc81919d2ac1a56e1679c0","async_task_type":"pro_mode","request_id":"5f5b28a9-2628-450a-872e-924436122cea","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"94034f4e-5818-41b0-bb1e-38e35c21c0b1","turn_exchange_id":"8726c2cd-f847-413a-8c5f-ec3137067e7c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"94034f4e-5818-41b0-bb1e-38e35c21c0b1","children":["f56e4493-7f5e-41d9-b56b-4cee08da024e"]},"f56e4493-7f5e-41d9-b56b-4cee08da024e":{"id":"f56e4493-7f5e-41d9-b56b-4cee08da024e","message":{"id":"f56e4493-7f5e-41d9-b56b-4cee08da024e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762957066.133848,"update_time":1762956925.377849,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**My pick today: _ASML_ (NASDAQ: ASML).**\n\n\ue200finance\ue202turn0finance0\ue201\n\n### Why this one name?\nASML is the **non\u2011replicable choke point** in the semiconductor stack: it\u2019s the **sole supplier of EUV lithography**\u2014and is now shipping **High\u2011NA EUV** into volume manufacturing.

The company believes its forecasts, based on discussions with chipmakers about capacity plans, provide a clearer picture of future performance. New orders, which take 6-18 months to fulfill, often lead to misleading quarterly interpretations. The decision came as ASML reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter bookings, pushing its stock up by 7%. Analysts acknowledge the decision, noting that while it reduces short-term transparency, it aligns with a longer-term view of business stability. Recent figures showed a sharp increase in fourth-quarter bookings compared to the third quarter, influenced by significant orders from Taiwan's TSMC, which plans substantial capital spending in 2025. Overall, despite initial concerns about transparency, the move is seen as a sensible adjustment by ASML to mitigate stock volatility.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news59\ue201","start_idx":4662,"end_idx":4680,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tsmc-still-evaluating-asmls-high-na-intel-eyes-future-use-2025-05-27/","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tsmc-still-evaluating-asmls-high-na-intel-eyes-future-use-2025-05-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tsmc-still-evaluating-asmls-high-na-intel-eyes-future-use-2025-05-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"TSMC still evaluating ASML's 'High-NA' as Intel eyes future use","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tsmc-still-evaluating-asmls-high-na-intel-eyes-future-use-2025-05-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1748358745,"snippet":"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the leading contract chipmaker globally, is continuing to evaluate the adoption of ASML's high numerical aperture (High-NA) machines for its future technology nodes. Although offering improved speed and precision, these machines cost nearly $400 million\u2014almost double the price of current equipment\u2014making their cost-effectiveness a key consideration. TSMC executive Kevin Zhang stated that the upcoming A14 node and its enhancements can achieve significant advancements without requiring High-NA EUV machines. TSMC is focusing on maximizing the capabilities of its existing Low-NA EUV tools. Meanwhile, Intel plans to incorporate High-NA systems into its future 14A manufacturing process to bolster its contract chip business and better compete with TSMC, yet it will still offer conventional technology options. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet indicated that customers are expected to test High-NA machines for high-volume use through 2026-2027 before deploying them in advanced nodes. To date, ASML has delivered five of these massive 180-ton machines to Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. Last year, Zhang had explicitly stated that TSMC does not plan to use High-NA for its A16 node, citing the high cost as a deterrent.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":59}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":4782,"end_idx":4801,"safe_urls":["https://www.semi.org/en/semi-press-release/semi-reports-global-total-semiconductor-equipment-sales-forecast-to-reach-125.5-billion-dollars-in-2025","https://www.semi.org/en/semi-press-release/semi-reports-global-total-semiconductor-equipment-sales-forecast-to-reach-125.5-billion-dollars-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([SEMI](https://www.semi.org/en/semi-press-release/semi-reports-global-total-semiconductor-equipment-sales-forecast-to-reach-125.5-billion-dollars-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"SEMI
