Today\u2019s episode marks a first for us: we have a male guest in the hot seat. We hope you enjoy this episode with David Shapiro.\n\n## Introducing David Shapiro and Post\u2011Labor Economics\n\n- Jessica: Today\u2019s guest is someone I discovered while scrolling through YouTube, searching for insights into AI and its ripple effects across society. I was immediately struck by how clearly and urgently he was addressing the questions that many of us, including myself, are just beginning to ask. And then by chance I learned that he lives right here in my city in Raleigh, North Carolina. David Shapiro is a systems thinker, philosopher, and AI researcher who developed a framework and wrote a book about post\u2011labor economics, which is all about what happens when technology reshapes our world so drastically that many traditional jobs simply aren\u2019t needed anymore. And so today we\u2019re going to talk about imagining a world where machines, robots, and AI handle most of the tasks humans once performed. We\u2019re going to tackle some big questions, like: How do we find purpose and meaning if we don\u2019t have traditional jobs to define our lives? How should society distribute money and resources if jobs aren\u2019t the primary way people earn their living? And what kind of lives can we build when technology frees us from routine work? David\u2019s work has captured the attention of academics, policymakers, and tech innovators. So David, welcome to Women Talking About AI.\n- David: Thanks for having me. It\u2019s good to talk again.\n- Jessica: Yeah, I\u2019m excited. We talk a lot offline, and it\u2019s nice to bring this online and bring Kimberly into the fold. I know I bore Kimberly with all my musings about what\u2019s happening in the economy, but Kimberly always brings this really interesting perspective as an applied linguist, and David, I was talking to you earlier, so I\u2019ll be curious to hear what Kimberly takes out of this conversation. Let\u2019s dive in. I just described what post\u2011labor economics is based on my understanding of it. Dave, tell us what post\u2011labor economics is for you and how you came to be interested in it.\n\n## Defining Post\u2011Labor Economics and David\u2019s Path\n\n- David: I define post\u2011labor economics pretty simply. Fundamentally, what we\u2019re looking at is the decoupling of economic productivity from human inputs. In other words, GDP will no longer be directly correlated to labor. This trend has actually been going on for quite a long time, and it\u2019s only accelerating with each new wave of technology\u2014starting with factory robots and the internet and computers\u2014and now, of course, with artificial intelligence and humanoid robots, it\u2019s accelerating further. As for how I got into this: my original career was in technology for 15 years, focused on cloud computing and data center infrastructure, where there\u2019s a huge amount of automation. My interest in automation branched into artificial intelligence and machine learning. Then a few years later, the GPT wave and ChatGPT came out, and the rest is history. Initially, I wanted to participate in AI safety and alignment research, but over time I realized that, while it\u2019s not solved, it\u2019s already getting all the time, money, and attention it needs. Every major corporation and university is participating in AI safety research. Meanwhile, my audience\u2014I have a relatively large audience on YouTube and other platforms\u2014kept asking, \u201cOkay, you convinced us AI isn\u2019t going to turn into Skynet and kill everyone. What about the economy? What about jobs? How are we going to make ends meet as AI ramps up exponentially?\u201d By answering that question, I coined the term \u201cpost\u2011labor economics,\u201d almost as a throwaway line: this is what we\u2019re talking about. Over time, that framework has been refined. I\u2019ve been working on it for about the last two years\u2014doing research, talking to economists, fielding these ideas\u2014and that leads us here today.\n- Jessica: You really touched on a lot that was top of mind for me because I was kind of in a crisis when Kimberly and I first started doing research on AI. I\u2019m not going to lie: my initial impetus was fear-based. I was worried. I\u2019m a consultant and a researcher, and I thought, \u201cIf this technology can do a lot of the work that I do, am I even going to have a job?\u201d So I set out to understand it as much as I could so I could wrap my head around it. That\u2019s how I deal with fear\u2014learn as much as I can. You were making really strong connections to meaning\u2011making\u2014which I\u2019d read about in Fe Lee\u2019s book\u2014and you call yourself a philosopher, which I find interesting because so many things intersect when you become interested in AI. Your framework is interdisciplinary. I\u2019d love you to touch on the six pillars of the framework at a high level, and then we\u2019ll dive into them.\n\n## The Six Pillars Overview\n\n- David: Absolutely. Working through history and economics, I realized post\u2011labor economics needed to be codified into a framework or pedagogical structure so it can be learned and taught. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent most of this year doing: taking big ideas from different domains and tying them together. The six pillars are:\n  1) The rise of automation. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing and discussing\u2014not just generative AI, but many forms of automation rising for centuries.\n  2) The decline of labor. We look at the decoupling of productivity from labor inputs, the undermining of labor power, and what has happened historically as labor has shifted across paradigms\u2014from agricultural to manufacturing and now a service-based economy.\n  3) Power and the social contract. When labor power erodes, how do you keep society balanced? Historically, where labor is cheap, life becomes devalued. For instance, the bubonic plague reduced Europe\u2019s population and led to democratic reforms because labor became scarce and workers had leverage\u2014like an involuntary strike.\n  4) Measuring the great decoupling. We look at econometrics and dashboards already used globally to track this decoupling and consider possible de novo metrics to define what we\u2019re optimizing for. The short version: we should broaden property\u2011based economic participation rather than wage\u2011based participation.\n  5) Concrete interventions. There are two primary pillars: the pyramid of prosperity (how to distribute and allocate the new wealth generated by AI and robotics) and the pyramid of power (how to construct a new social contract in which the ability to withhold labor becomes politically and economically less relevant).\n  6) Life after labor. We look at first principles of the human animal\u2014what\u2019s needed for happiness and health\u2014and we examine philosophical angles as well. This takes us through what\u2019s happening, why, what to do, and what the results might be. Nothing is set in stone, but we\u2019re doing the best we can.\n\n## Pillar One: Automation, Jobs, and the \u201cNew Jobs\u201d Misconception\n\n- Jessica: What I learned through your work is there\u2019s a misnomer around technology creating new jobs. We hear, with every new technology, that we get new jobs. But when you look at the data, there can be a net loss\u2014it\u2019s not always replacing the jobs that are lost. Everything feels new to a new generation, so we can learn from history. Walk us through what you\u2019ve learned about automation and the misnomer around technology replacing lost jobs.\n- David: The primary principle is that technology is deflationary: it makes goods and services cheaper. Historically, when prices come down\u2014food is a great example\u2014we see dramatic shifts. In 1800, about three\u2011quarters of Americans were farmers. By 1900 it was 40%, and today it\u2019s about 2%. Automation and general\u2011purpose technologies made food production so efficient that workers were liberated to do other things\u2014like YouTube creators. So you might say technology creates more jobs, but it\u2019s not a direct causal link. It\u2019s a downstream effect of liberated capital and new categories. For instance, you couldn\u2019t explain \u201csoftware developer\u201d to an industrialist in the 1850s. Technology creates entire sectors that didn\u2019t exist. The assumption is it will again. However, consider what humans offer that\u2019s monetizable: four basic \u201cfood groups\u201d\u2014strength, dexterity, cognition, and empathy. We automated strength away with steam and diesel. We\u2019re automating dexterity with robots and humanoids. Right now we\u2019re automating cognition as generative AI models get exponentially better. They\u2019re able to work autonomously for exponentially longer, roughly doubling every four to seven months. So when an AI can do an hour of autonomous work today, by year\u2019s end it\u2019s two hours, and so on\u2014it\u2019s accelerating with no clear signs of slowing. Combine that with job tasks going away in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Manufacturing employment in America peaked around 22 million in 1979; today it\u2019s about half that, yet output has tripled. That\u2019s what you expect in an automated economy: less input, more output\u2014abundance\u2014but millions of jobs have gone away and not been replaced. So what remains for humans? Empathy. As cognition and dexterity are automated and strength is long gone, remaining jobs will cluster around empathy: communication, trust, relationships, authenticity, experience. We\u2019re moving toward a meaning or experience economy\u2014an empathy\u2011based labor arrangement\u2014but there isn\u2019t a fifth paradigm beyond that, and typically by now you\u2019d expect to see early signs if there were one. Some propose a \u201ccare economy\u201d because healthcare is 20% of the U.S. economy, but with advanced AI and robotics, healthcare costs could drop dramatically. \n\n## Productivity, Adoption Timelines, and Safety Nets\n\n- Jessica: I want to zoom in on productivity. You mentioned AI\u2019s capabilities doubling every four to seven months and the amount of work it can do. Already, companies like Nvidia: the average senior engineer is making around $400,000 a year but producing the equivalent of a million dollars a year in revenue. That\u2019s problematic as people lose jobs and money flows to corporations, which brings us to UBI and universal basic services. Help us connect the dots: what does this mean for the next ten years as the impacts arrive in real time? What\u2019s your thought on a timeline for UBI? I know you don\u2019t know for sure, but you\u2019ve theorized about it. And what does this mean for my students?\n- David: If I could predict the future, I\u2019d be a lot wealthier. But we can look at empirical trends. First, AI is getting smarter fast. Benchmarks\u2014standard tests of model capability\u2014are being saturated. When scores reach greater than 95%, from a machine\u2011learning perspective the domain is essentially solved. We\u2019ve seen this across natural language understanding and coding. Math is being attacked now. Six months ago models had solved basic high\u2011school math; now they\u2019re scoring at the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad\u2014one step shy of the millennium problems. Math underpins physics, chemistry, cryptography\u2014so the network effects are enormous. Another trend is agent autonomy. You need memory, tool use, and more sophisticated cognitive architectures for computer\u2011using agents to be autonomous for longer and still succeed. That\u2019s going up exponentially too. Model sizes and compute density are also increasing\u2014multiple exponentials pointing the same way. That\u2019s capabilities. On diffusion: as of earlier this year, only about 20% of Fortune 500 companies had an official use case for generative AI. That\u2019s ramping quickly and follows a sigmoid curve: slow, then rapid adoption, then tapering. We\u2019re at the ramp\u2011up, not the 50% point yet, but the trend suggests 70\u201390% of the Fortune 500 will be using generative AI by about 2028 at the latest, and the broader industry saturates by roughly 2030\u20132032. A few laggards might remain\u2014say, in construction\u2014but AI will keep improving. So we\u2019ll hit a tipping point where uptake accelerates as capability improves, fueling each other. We can\u2019t predict exact outcomes because of first\u2011, second\u2011, and third\u2011order effects. We have to measure as we go. Microsoft just released a report listing the top 40 AI\u2011exposed jobs\u2014economists, teachers, CNC programmers, sales reps, and more. At first glance, they have little in common, but one principle emerges: language in, language out. If your primary input is language (reading, listening) and your primary output is language (writing, speaking), there\u2019s no reason a machine can\u2019t already do much of that work today. Institutional factors\u2014regulation, inertia\u2014slow things, but uptake is accelerating. A big wave is coming. As for UBI: historically, particularly in the U.S., governments pull out all the stops when unemployment exceeds roughly 11\u201314%. That\u2019s when Social Security was implemented, and during COVID, stimulus checks went out. There\u2019s no hard rule, but historically, once above that range\u2014and the longer it stays there\u2014the more drastic the measures. During FDR\u2019s term, the New Deal came after several years above 11%; unemployment peaked around 23\u201324%, didn\u2019t stay there long, but remained above 11\u201314% for years. With that amount of economic pain, political pressure mounts to act. This is why I\u2019m working so hard on this book: so there\u2019s a roadmap when the political pressure is there. Governments worldwide are taking baby steps. Some policies aren\u2019t explicitly aimed at this problem, but they help. For instance, baby bonds: several U.S. states give each qualifying birth a trust of $1,000\u2013$3,000; the federal government is about to start trialing that. That\u2019s universal basic capital\u2014ensuring everyone can participate in the future economy. There are many more examples. On the power side, many nations are experimenting with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\u2014divisive, because of surveillance risks, but if implemented correctly, they could reduce transaction costs by providing an alternative to Visa and SWIFT. The EU is trialing blockchain\u2011based IDs; several European nations use blockchain for land records and democratic processes, reducing corruption and speeding dispute resolution. None of this is a silver bullet. UBI is necessary but not sufficient within the broader pyramid of prosperity. Governments do lag; historically, sometimes by decades. But industrial cycles are shortening: the first industrial revolution unfolded over ~150 years; the second over ~70\u201390 years; the digital revolution over ~50 years; and this fourth, arguably only 10\u201320 years in, is already picking up speed. Hence pillar four: measure what matters, because if you don\u2019t have data, you don\u2019t have anything.\n\n## Measuring the Great Decoupling: Beyond GDP\n\n- Jessica: I\u2019d love to talk about that. You said GDP is the wrong measurement.\n- David: I\u2019m proposing two new measurements. They\u2019re not battle\u2011tested yet; they\u2019re illustrative of how we can measure better and why we should. Measurements provide feedback and track progress. GDP is useful but flawed. There\u2019s a joke that China is building skyscrapers and then demolishing them\u2014and both activities count toward GDP because they involve spending, even though you\u2019re creating and then destroying value. GDP doesn\u2019t capture lived experience. For example, labor\u2019s share of total income peaked decades ago at about 64% and is now around 52%. More of total income is B2B\u2014money circulates between businesses and doesn\u2019t materialize in paychecks. GDP misses that. Metric one: the Economic Agency Index. Categorize household income into three buckets: wages (you get paid by an employer or clients), property\u2011based income (stocks, bonds, rental properties, business dividends), and transfers (from the government: Social Security, nutrition assistance, welfare, Medicare/Medicaid, etc.). The index creates a ratio\u2014think z\u2011scores\u2014so you can see property\u2011based income going up over time. Many economists agree wages are declining as a component of aggregate demand and household income globally. If you don\u2019t want to rely on government transfers\u2014UBI would be a transfer\u2014you need market\u2011based solutions, which means broadening property ownership. But if you\u2019re not measuring how much property income households have, you can\u2019t optimize or compare regions. Metric two: the Inclusive Capital Income Ratio. Take the median household in any region and look at the share of its income from inclusive capital\u2014dividends, bonds, collectively owned community assets, sovereign wealth funds. Today, this number is abysmally low\u2014around 6% or less in most places. Wealthy tech hubs might hit 10% because of tech stocks. In the future, I\u2019d like to see 50\u201370% of median household income coming from inclusive capital tied to growth driven by AI, robotics, and eventually cheap energy like solar and nuclear. Once you have these measurements\u2014even if they\u2019re preliminary\u2014you can compare cities, states, and nations to see what works, track over time, and course\u2011correct.\n\n## Power, Social Contract, and the Risks of Capital Concentration\n\n- Jessica: I also think about reports shaping people\u2019s perceptions. There\u2019s so much talk about productivity, but if you\u2019re an individual worker inside an organization, all that productivity isn\u2019t translating to skyrocketing wages as profits skyrocket. The gap between haves and have\u2011nots grows. That feeds into your discussion of the social contract and power. As laborers, even if we\u2019re ten times more productive using the tech, if wages don\u2019t move, we don\u2019t gain power. And when we lose a job, we have no leverage. This ties to what we\u2019re seeing in the economy and with democracy\u2014again, not to get political, but authoritarian approaches. AI feeds into that. There\u2019s a misconception that if you don\u2019t learn AI, you\u2019ll lose your job, so you must use it. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t learn it, but we need curiosity and nuance: who benefits, how are we using it, and what are the effects?\n- Kimberly: I\u2019ll jump in. I love that you\u2019re bringing in power and authoritarianism\u2014not that we want to be political\u2014but I\u2019m thinking about meaning\u2011making. When we lose labor as a source of power, we also lose one of the main ways people have historically claimed their voice or visibility in society. From my perspective as a linguist, it\u2019s not just economics; it\u2019s about who gets to speak, who has a voice, and the discourse of \u201cif you work, you matter.\u201d If labor fades and AI takes over, there\u2019s a real danger that large groups of people won\u2019t have power, won\u2019t be seen as meaning\u2011makers in the system. What do you think, Dave? Am I way off?\n- David: This is why pillar three\u2014social contract and power\u2014is the darkest hour of the framework. Historically, when labor is cheap or people become fungible\u2014about the worst way to describe humans\u2014states devalue human life. Often it comes down to pragmatic concerns: you need humans as soldiers, to work fields and factories. If you have an abundance of humans without leverage\u2014no credible way to extract concessions from those in power\u2014it ends poorly for humans. I want to differentiate two kinds of meaning: meaning to society, and personal or existential meaning. In society, the most durable leverage has been the ability to withhold labor\u2014a credible threat. If you go on strike, the owners\u2014robber barons or the state\u2014have to negotiate. As labor becomes less relevant through AI and automation\u2014humanoid robots included\u2014companies will say, \u201cStrike all you want; we\u2019ll replace you with machines.\u201d Economists broadly agree we\u2019re in a regime of capital intensification\u2014capital becomes more important than labor\u2014and capital concentration\u2014what capital matters is in fewer hands. Define capital as whatever resource or asset is most valuable. In agrarian economies, land. Then factories in industrial economies. Today, tech. Look at the most valuable companies to infer the paradigm: IBM and Coca\u2011Cola in the mid\u201120th century; now Nvidia, Microsoft, and the internet platforms. Technology is good\u2014it\u2019s deflationary and can increase quality of life when democratized\u2014but capital intensification and concentration risk putting control in the hands of owners for an indefinite period. The World Economic Forum popularized the line, \u201cYou will own nothing and be happy.\u201d We\u2019re heading toward a rentier economy\u2014everything as a subscription. But if consumers can\u2019t earn money, they can\u2019t pay for subscriptions. The system collapses. This isn\u2019t partisan; anytime you have more than three people in a room, politics are involved\u2014and money makes it worse. The question becomes: in the future, how do we force a negotiation of power and redistribution? It won\u2019t necessarily mean revolt or rebellion\u2014some nations will adapt better than others. Plenty of people in governments are trying to solve the problem for pragmatic reasons\u2014monitoring household income, aggregate demand, purchasing power. Cryptographic, blockchain\u2011based systems reduce corruption and can sell themselves: e.g., property sales on blockchain have significantly fewer fraud claims and faster resolution. Still, we could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Ultimately, everyone\u2019s interests align away from indefinite capital concentration, because if that happens the economy collapses and it doesn\u2019t matter how many shares of Nvidia or Google you own\u2014nobody can afford goods, services, or subscriptions. That\u2019s the attractor state unless we change tracks, which is where interventions and measurements come in.\n\n## Individual vs Collective Narratives: Work Ethic, Status, and Meaning\n\n- Jessica: You mentioned some nations will do better than others. I think about Western culture and values\u2014hyper\u2011individualism. We\u2019re not a collectivist society, yet these issues are societal and systemic. But the problem often lands on the individual to solve.\n- David: This goes back to Adam Smith and Keynes and other thinkers who say humans are fundamentally selfish\u2014rational self\u2011interest. There\u2019s some truth, but taken to extremes it\u2019s unsustainable. There\u2019s always tension between individual and group\u2014people belong to many groups: family, work, professional affiliations, expanding circles of belonging. Patricia Churchland, a philosopher turned neuroscientist, in Braintrust, shows neurologically how much you care varies with how close or \u201cother\u201d the group is to you\u2014there\u2019s physical evidence that this is how humans work. At the same time, we need systems\u2014constitutional democracy provides social glue. Another kind of social glue is a new narrative. The Protestant work ethic\u2014Martin Luther and John Calvin\u2014framed work as righteous, divinely sanctioned, morally correct. Max Weber wrote around 1912 that Calvinism may have propelled capitalism in the West: the harder you work, the more your reward is justified at a divine level. Agree or disagree, that\u2019s been the prevailing norm\u2014which basically rewards workaholism. It\u2019s ordinal: not just that work is sacred, but that laziness is evil. If you\u2019re not rich, you\u2019re a bad person. I had friends whose parents lived in rural North Carolina; they felt guilt and shame because they weren\u2019t rich and came from very religious communities\u2014pride and shame, paradoxically entwined. That\u2019s how we got here. A new narrative\u2014a new understanding of what is moral, ethical, and valuable\u2014will take time. Sometimes individuals catalyze it, but then you have to spread the message and build a movement. I think society will adapt. It\u2019s also instinctive. Will Storr\u2019s The Status Game explains human behavior as that of social apes\u2014status and rank are ever\u2011present, with different ways to gain or lose status and meta\u2011rules around status games. That predates money and modern war. Animals play status games; my dog is very status conscious\u2014she defers to a big German Shepherd at the park because he\u2019s big and strong, and she\u2019ll bully smaller dogs because she\u2019s stronger. Studies show even babies as young as three to six months are status conscious\u2014observing which babies and which adults are higher status. So, first principles\u2014neuroscience, evolution, biology\u2014suggest a new narrative will find new ways to create status. If you lose the ability to work or establish status that way, you\u2019ll find it elsewhere. In prison, where there\u2019s no normal economy, the currency is respect: you earn it by showing deference or providing services\u2014cigarettes, medical or legal advice. That universal underpinning will shape the next narrative: new status games. Some people prefer money, some fame. My status game is being right\u2014or rather becoming more right over time. It\u2019s an intellectual status game. Everyone plays these games, consciously or not.\n\n## Rest as Resistance, Human Needs, and Sustainable Living\n\n- Kimberly: Can we go back to workaholism? Have you read Rest Is Resistance by Tricia Hersey?\n- David: I have not, but I read a bunch of other books about burnout while preparing for my own burnout. Tell me about it.\n- Kimberly: She\u2019s an African\u2011American woman who argues that rest is spiritual and a form of resistance. In a post\u2011labor economy, how do we build a system where people don\u2019t have to rely on power plays like withholding labor just to matter? Ultimately it\u2019s about signaling value: \u201cI\u2019m not going to perform for you just so you\u2019ll pay me. I\u2019m already worthy in and of myself because I\u2019m a human being having a spiritual experience in a body.\u201d It\u2019s about encoding dignity, agency, and contribution in ways decoupled from normal measurements.\n- David: From an economics perspective, that can manifest as labor strikes\u2014withholding labor; economic withdrawal\u2014refusing to participate in parts of the economy; tax resistance\u2014using strategies to avoid taxes or refusing to pay them. On the personal and spiritual side, you consciously frame it as rebellion. In the U.S., some young people do \u201cbed rotting\u201d\u2014staying in bed. In China, there was the \u201clying flat\u201d movement, which evolved into \u201clet it rot\u201d when the state said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t work, you won\u2019t have babies and the state will implode.\u201d The youth said, \u201cWe don\u2019t care\u2014let it rot.\u201d Being lazy as rebellion is global. It\u2019s not necessarily sustainable. I\u2019m not criticizing it\u2014collective movements signal unhappiness effectively\u2014but living in chronic burnout and disengagement isn\u2019t a good life. Nations like Japan have 80\u201390% of people burned out and disengaged\u2014that\u2019s no way to live. So: how would we prefer to live? If AI liberates humanity from drudgery, how do we want to live? I\u2019ve studied this from a few angles. Three frameworks stand out. First, Roger Walsh\u2019s Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLCs): eight behaviors\u2014time in nature, exercise, rest, recreation, friends and family, spirituality, giving back, and more\u2014that, if practiced, make you happier; it\u2019s clinically validated. Second, Self\u2011Determination Theory (SDT), which identifies three psychological needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. These frameworks are newer than Maslow and, I think, better. Third, Glasser\u2019s Choice Theory, which looks at core needs like power, freedom, fun, belonging\u2014if those needs are met, you\u2019re protected against mental\u2011health issues. Work can satisfy some needs\u2014competence, autonomy (income gives you control over time and body), and relatedness (colleagues, community). But work doesn\u2019t satisfy many TLC items beyond perhaps contribution, which is closer to volunteering. That\u2019s why I use multiple lenses. Another organic form of economic withdrawal is collapsing birth rates: people choosing not to have children because they\u2019re stressed or don\u2019t trust their environment. Some blame feminism or contraception, but many married, well\u2011to\u2011do people are choosing not to have kids. It\u2019s a passive resistance to current economic conditions.\n\n## The River vs the Garden: A Life Model\n\n- Kimberly: I have so many follow\u2011ups. I\u2019m still thinking about Rest Is Resistance. I\u2019m not familiar with TLC or the other frameworks you mentioned, but if I read a framework with six or eight items, I\u2019ll turn it into a checklist. If I have five out of six, I \u201cshould\u201d feel better\u2014but I don\u2019t. All I\u2019ve gained is knowledge. There\u2019s a difference between knowing and embodying. Do any of those frameworks shift us away from productivity? Because I can make anything productive\u2014\u201cHow many steps can I get in?\u201d I need a new language.\n- David: Jessica and I were talking about this before. I wrote a blog post after a small revelation: the River versus the Garden. The River is a linear life course\u2014school, job, marriage, children, house, retirement\u2014the prescribed path. You always end at the sea\u2014retirement, golden years, grandchildren. The Garden is a different mentality\u2014a spiritual, personal metaphor I needed. Whether you use a three\u2011, six\u2011, or eight\u2011point framework, instead of rushing through and checking boxes, think of life as cultivating different beds in a garden. There\u2019s no finish line. You tend and nourish different areas\u2014finances, relationships, health, mission\u2014and they change over time. One year it\u2019s carrots and cabbages; the next, hot peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes; maybe you add chickens to fertilize the soil. Ask: is this area flourishing, growing, or does it need nourishment? That\u2019s how I move through life now. It\u2019s an attitude shift\u2014an experience, not a production goal.\n- Jessica: It\u2019s a total paradigm shift. Since Kimberly and I shut down Moxy, we\u2019ve been calling this my big pause. I\u2019m not allowed to make big, rash decisions. It\u2019s the garden mentality\u2014find joy in your day. Don\u2019t immediately jump into email and work. It\u2019s been nice. My goal is to notice. I\u2019m not supposed to accomplish anything or find a new hobby\u2014I was pressuring myself to find one and it was stressing me out. This river mentality is so ingrained. It\u2019s like that fish who doesn\u2019t know what water is. We go to school, and I was brought up with the Protestant work ethic. I wanted to be a journalist; my mom said, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t make any money. Be financially independent\u2014go into healthcare,\u201d which I did. I think about educators\u2014so many in our audience are in K\u201112 or higher ed\u2014and the impact they have on the next generation. How do we prepare them to thrive in this new economy? Let\u2019s end there because it ties back to education.\n\n## Education in a Post\u2011Labor Future\n\n- David: I think about this often. If I had a child right now, I\u2019d focus on communication, boundaries, self\u2011care, cooking, relationships. Neurological development matters\u2014learning math and visuospatial skills has benefits. I just saw a study that a two\u2011month course teaching children philosophy increases critical thinking. There are many ways to construct an educational paradigm. But if we\u2019re moving away from a service\u2011based economy\u2014primarily cognition and STEM\u2014toward an experience or meaning economy where empathy is the primary human offering, then we should emphasize musical skills and fine arts, communication, negotiation, presentation. One of the most surprising things I learned in my tech career was how to run meetings. That\u2019s why I\u2019m good on camera and on podcasts: talking to people you might only speak with once, communicating clearly, figuring out next steps. I never imagined that skill would parlay into a YouTube career and movement\u2011building. From first principles: what do people want from each other, and what do they need to be happy and healthy? I\u2019d teach TLC, SDT, and Glasser\u2019s Choice Theory, and practice them with the River versus Garden mentality\u2014build a lifestyle framework around that. Of course, include other knowledge and skills: a classical education, reading the classics, and a strong understanding of civics, history, economics\u2014the world you live in. Above all, I\u2019d like to see education pivot to focus on children\u2019s natural curiosity. Public education in America is very good at educating curiosity out of children. With AI\u2019s power and possibilities, there\u2019s no reason not to fully indulge curiosity and see where it goes\u2014even if it\u2019s not economically valuable, it\u2019s enriching. Use project\u2011based learning: set students in a direction and empower their exploration.\n- Jessica: I love that. I recently read about Alpha School. They\u2019re not new\u2014around since 2019\u2014but it\u2019s a private school, very expensive, like $3,000 a year, so it\u2019s not very accessible. It started in Texas and now it\u2019s in big cities. Basically, children spend two hours a day with AI and the rest of the day doing project\u2011based activities, interacting with other students. The data seems promising. I like using AI to personalize learning\u2014one student said he\u2019s in eighth\u2011grade math, tenth\u2011grade history, ninth\u2011grade English\u2014moving at his own pace. I get concerned about full\u2011AI schools that have rolled out in China where it\u2019s just servers and kids at home on computers, not socializing. But the Alpha model\u2014even though it\u2019s not accessible\u2014gives me hope we\u2019re trying to figure things out with new models, and maybe we\u2019ll get indications over time of how effective they are.\n- David: Absolutely.\n\n## Pits and Peaches\n\n- Jessica: This has been wonderful. We end every episode with our pit and our peach\u2014something my partner does at dinner with his kids: the low and high of your day. It can be your week or your year\u2014just something you want to share. I\u2019ll go first. My peach: I\u2019m in LA visiting a close friend and colleague, and I\u2019m about to go to Tahoe to visit a friend who just had a baby. She\u2019s been trying to get pregnant for a while, and I\u2019m excited to see her in this new role as a mom because I\u2019ve known her as my friend I travel and have fun with. My pit: last night we got a tsunami warning in LA and I couldn\u2019t sleep. I thought a tsunami was coming and I\u2019d have to evacuate. I was frantically refreshing the news, thinking about where I\u2019d go in my rental car to escape a tsunami. It was scary, but we\u2019re fine.\n- David: My peach is that I finished the post\u2011labor economics framework. I\u2019ve been working hard on it\u2014getting the six parts out and doing a dress rehearsal as a blog series for the book. The book is called The Great Decoupling. I\u2019m giving my brain a break for a week or two and then I\u2019ll pull it together for the final book. My pit is that I\u2019m still recovering from burnout. I\u2019m pretty far along, but I\u2019ve got another three to six months before I can get back to full energy and training and exercising like I prefer. Silver lining: I\u2019m in better shape than I was six months or a year ago.\n- Jessica: We\u2019ve talked a lot about burnout. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with and have taken some alternative approaches to addressing. I have to ask\u2014how do you know you have three to six months left?\n- David: Lots of research\u2014pretty standard reconditioning literature. People recovering from post\u2011COVID fatigue syndromes and overtraining. It\u2019s well\u2011studied when you know what to look for, as you\u2019d understand from the research space.\n- Kimberly: My pit is that I use exercise as physical and mental health conditioning, and I have three different tears in my glute\u2014but it\u2019s really my hip. I\u2019d been treating it as bursitis, but it wasn\u2019t. My physical therapist said from the start, \u201cThis is not bursitis,\u201d and the doctor didn\u2019t believe her. I finally got an MRI. I\u2019m going to have to have surgery. It won\u2019t get better until I do. It\u2019s a pretty big surgery and I don\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m constantly circling the toilet vortex: if I don\u2019t do it, I keep hurting; if I do it, I\u2019m down for months. My peach is actually this conversation. The garden metaphor is helping me reframe things in my life. I left academia, joined Jessica on an entrepreneurial mission\u2014very different from anything I\u2019d done\u2014and now I\u2019m doing something else, also very different. I\u2019m loving the garden metaphor\u2014crop rotation. I don\u2019t always need the same carrots growing. Carrots can leach the soil, and the professional life I\u2019d chosen was leeching my soul. I didn\u2019t have a metaphor for it, and then you said that. Forgive me, but I stopped thinking about post\u2011labor economics and started thinking about me\u2014because everything\u2019s about me\u2014and I realized I needed to rotate the crops. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now, and it feels really good.\n- Jessica: Amazing. That\u2019s a great way to end. Thank you, David. Can you shout out your book one more time\u2014what it\u2019s called, when it\u2019ll be out, and where people can find it?\n- David: The title is The Great Decoupling. We have a companion\u2014a fictional version of the transition\u2014called The Last Worker. They\u2019re just about done. We don\u2019t have a release date yet. If you follow me on any of my social media\u2014it\u2019s all on my Linktree in the show notes\u2014I\u2019ll announce it everywhere as soon as there\u2019s a pre\u2011order. We\u2019re aiming for early next year, if not mid\u2011year.\n- Jessica: Amazing. I will definitely be reading it. Thank you for all that you do in this space. I\u2019ve learned so much from you, and I hope our listeners are also learning. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have you back at some point.\n- David: Excellent. Thank you for having me, and have a great day.\n\n## Closing\n\n- Announcer: Thanks for tuning in to Women Talking About AI. If you enjoyed this conversation, please be sure to follow the show, leave us a review, and share this episode with a friend or colleague who\u2019s thinking about the future of work. It really helps more people find us.

As AI becomes a standard component across departments, its fragmented deployment leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and governance challenges. Many enterprises rely on \"vertical AI\" embedded within specific tools, leading to overlapping functionalities and organizational silos.\n\nThe article calls for a strategic pivot toward interoperability, emphasizing that AI tools should seamlessly share context, follow unified governance, and integrate across platforms. This approach can reduce operational costs, streamline compliance, and maximize AI's value. Centralized governance and interoperable infrastructure can help organizations control sprawl and align AI use with broader business goals.\n\nUltimately, the piece advises enterprise leaders to prioritize usability, security, and cohesion over simply accumulating AI features. The future competitive edge will come from orchestrated, integrated AI systems rather than ad hoc implementations.

The report describes this as a \"shadow economy of productivity gains,\" indicating that many organizations are unaware of these efficiency boosts. Notably, two-thirds of these workers are personally covering the costs of the AI tools they use.\n\nVanguard's chief economist, Joe Davis, likens the integration of AI to the rise of the personal computer, emphasizing that AI will augment rather than replace most jobs by redirecting focus to human-centric tasks. However, the firm also acknowledges that AI may automate 25% of current working hours and impact up to 20% of occupations by 2035, effectively freeing the equivalent of one workday per week.\n\nAdditionally, a McKinsey survey shows workers are using generative AI far more than executives realize, with employees three times more likely to report using it for over 30% of their tasks.

Over 58,000 children are eligible for state-run trust funds they can access at age 18, with accounts starting at $4,500. The program, inspired by economists Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity\u2019s 2010 federal policy proposal, aims to reduce childhood poverty and address the racial wealth gap by offering greater investments to low-income families. California\u2019s program will eventually expand to cover all low-income newborns, aligning with similar efforts in states like Connecticut, which began a baby bonds program in 2023. Connecticut\u2019s initiative grants newborns $3,200 restricted to wealth-building uses such as education and homeownership. Baby bonds are increasingly seen as a form of reparative justice, offering bipartisan appeal by focusing on children and promoting economic opportunity. Studies suggest baby bonds can significantly narrow racial wealth disparities, with experts viewing them as one key piece in a broader strategy to address systemic inequality and promote long-term financial stability for disadvantaged youth.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1740150041.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/f460a989-d5b8-4f39-aa7e-c0400a699ff7","title":"Republicans propose $1,000 'Trump account' for American babies","snippet":"Republicans in the U.S. have proposed a new initiative to create $1,000 \"Trump Accounts\"\u2014baby-bond style investment funds\u2014for every American baby born between December 31, 2024, and January 1, 2029. Spearheaded by Senator Ted Cruz, the program is part of a new tax bill recently passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Initially named \"MAGA accounts,\" they were renamed to honor former President Trump. The proposal allows for annual contributions up to $5,000, to be invested in established U.S. equity indexes, with access restricted until the child turns 18. Cruz argues the initiative promotes capitalism by encouraging widespread business ownership from a young age, projecting accounts could grow to $170,000 by adulthood. The plan is estimated to cost over $17.3 billion. However, it has drawn criticism from Democrats for glorifying Trump and from the Tax Foundation for increasing tax code complexity.

Known as the \"Invest America Act\" or \"MAGA Accounts\" in the draft legislation, the plan aims to provide each child with a private investment account managed by Wall Street firms, allowing family and friends to contribute up to $5,000 annually. Over time, compounded interest and a projected 7% annual growth could yield up to $170,000 by age 18. The funds could be used for education, housing, or starting a business. The proposal, included in the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee's draft tax bill supported by Donald Trump, is expected to cost the federal government at least $3.6 billion annually. While similar to Democratic \"baby bond\" proposals from Sen. Cory Booker, Cruz's version emphasizes private sector management and is supported by Wall Street. However, the legislation faces scrutiny due to its financial implications and will undergo extensive negotiation in Congress amidst broader debates over federal spending and the national debt.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1747163094.0,"attribution":"www.houstonchronicle.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_689780c36b708007bb1d6b20bfc858c9","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Validating baby bonds programs and related proposals","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"96c8db4148a8fd8d-DFW","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"3dc12ac9-94a0-42d3-8856-6370f78546b2","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3dc12ac9-94a0-42d3-8856-6370f78546b2","children":["2cb4a39c-3c6b-4615-bf16-57d1028b6cae"]},"2cb4a39c-3c6b-4615-bf16-57d1028b6cae":{"id":"2cb4a39c-3c6b-4615-bf16-57d1028b6cae","message":{"id":"2cb4a39c-3c6b-4615-bf16-57d1028b6cae","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754759380.455973,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Verifying tuition claim","content":"Alright, I need to check the accuracy of the Alpha School tuition claim.

The new law provides eligible families with over $10,000 annually to cover private school tuition and related educational expenses, with $2,000 allocated for homeschoolers. The law, which will launch in 2027, limits participation for families earning above 500% of the federal poverty line to 20% of total funds. The voucher program is touted as the largest of its kind in U.S. history and represents Abbott\u2019s most significant legislative achievement. Supporters, including GOP leaders and private school advocates, lauded the bill for empowering parents to choose better educational environments. However, critics\u2014such as Democratic lawmakers, educators, and unions\u2014warn it will siphon more than $1 billion from public schools by 2030 and lacks safeguards to ensure aid reaches the intended students. The bill faced years of opposition but passed after Abbott invested heavily in unseating anti-voucher Republicans. The debate over funding priorities and education equity is expected to continue into upcoming elections.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1746303497.0,"attribution":"www.expressnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_689780c36b708007bb1d6b20bfc858c9","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching tuition details for Alpha School Texas","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"96c8db4148a8fd8d-DFW","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"34ea9c1b-4efb-4d29-80a6-555e543523a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"34ea9c1b-4efb-4d29-80a6-555e543523a9","children":["fd9dd55c-77e1-4471-be4c-a0e33a2deded"]},"fd9dd55c-77e1-4471-be4c-a0e33a2deded":{"id":"fd9dd55c-77e1-4471-be4c-a0e33a2deded","message":{"id":"fd9dd55c-77e1-4471-be4c-a0e33a2deded","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754759387.333605,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Verifying tuition and moving forward","content":"Alright, it looks like the correct Alpha School tuition is $40,000 a year, not the previously mentioned $3,000.

Because labor\u2019s bargaining power collapses when it can\u2019t credibly be withheld, the old social contract fails unless we (a) **measure the decoupling properly**, (b) **broaden capital income** so median households earn from assets instead of wages, and (c) **re-anchor human purpose** around health, relationships, community and status systems that don\u2019t require wage work. He packages this as six pillars: the rise of automation; the decline of labor; power and the social contract; measuring the decoupling; concrete interventions (prosperity + power \u201cpyramids\u201d); and life after labor.\n\n# Where the argument is well supported\n\n**1) Output decouples from jobs in automation-heavy sectors.** In the U.S., manufacturing employment peaked around 19.5M in 1979 and is ~12.7M today, yet real output rose substantially across the period. The stylized fact\u2014fewer people, more output\u2014is real (even if \u201ctripled\u201d is too strong). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n**2) Labor\u2019s share has trended downward.** Standard series for the U.S. nonfarm business sector show a multi-decade decline with a pronounced dip post-2000 (it fell below 60%, bottoming around 56% in 2011). That\u2019s consistent with capital deepening and with the political-economy point that bargaining power tied to labor wanes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n**3) AI capability is rising fast and diffusing broadly.** Newer benchmarks (e.g., MMMU, GPQA, SWE-bench) have seen double-digit year-over-year jumps, and enterprise adoption of AI/gen-AI is now mainstream rather than fringe. Multiple large surveys report a majority of organizations using AI or gen-AI in at least one function. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n**4) Power really is the crux.** Once \u201cwithholdable labor\u201d ceases to be a binding constraint, you must either (i) embed new bargaining chips (ownership, participation rights, data dividends), or (ii) rely on technocratic benevolence (fragile), or (iii) accept rising authoritarian temptations. Framing interventions around **distribution of capital** and **institutional checks** is therefore directionally correct.\n\n# Where the episode overreaches (and how to fix it)\n\n**A) Adoption timelines.** The claim that \u201conly ~20% of large firms had an official gen-AI use case earlier this year\u201d undershoots credible surveys: McKinsey reported ~65% regular gen-AI use by early-to-mid-2024; Stanford\u2019s AI Index cites ~71% reporting gen-AI in at least one function and ~78% reporting AI use overall in 2024. If anything, **formal** adoption is already much higher; the unlabeled \u201cshadow use\u201d among employees pushes it higher still. The policy takeaway (urgency) stands, but the baseline is further along than implied. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n**B) \u201cIMO-level\u201d math and \u201cdomain solved.\u201d** Current models achieve stellar AIME/USAMO-adjacent results (OpenAI\u2019s o1 crossed the USAMO cutoff via sampling; o3/o4-mini post extremely high AIME accuracy, especially with tools), but that\u2019s not \u201cInternational Mathematical Olympiad level,\u201d which demands novel reasoning under adversarial evaluation and strict proctoring. Benchmarks like GPQA Diamond remain hard and are explicitly monitored to avoid saturation. Conclusion: progress is rapid, but the **super-human-math blanket claim** is premature; don\u2019t anchor timelines to it. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n**C) \u201cEmpathy is the last paradigm.\u201d** It\u2019s a useful heuristic but too deterministic. Three counter-pressures: (1) **task re-bundling**\u2014automation eliminates tasks, not entire jobs, and spawns complementary and supervisory tasks; (2) **regulatory/assurance layers**\u2014law, safety, audit, and governance can entrench \u201chuman in the loop\u201d requirements; (3) **institutionalized human agency**\u2014politics, security, compliance, and rights enforcement are not easily reducible to empathy alone. Shapiro\u2019s conclusion is plausible; it isn\u2019t proven.\n\n**D) Education example (Alpha).** The episode cites an \u201cAlpha School\u201d model with AI-led 2-hour academics and says it costs \u201cabout $3,000/year.\u201d Published tuition is **about $40,000/year** at Austin campuses\u2014a full order of magnitude higher\u2014so the equity/access story is very different than portrayed. The **2-hour personalization** is interesting; the **price point** today is elite. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n**E) CBDCs and digital IDs.** The upside for frictions and integrity is real, but it\u2019s vital to state the civil-liberties risk plainly and distinguish between **digital identity** (e.g., EU eIDAS 2.0 wallets) and **retail CBDCs** (e.g., China\u2019s e-CNY pilots). These are separate levers with different trade-offs; the episode compresses them. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search7\ue201\n\n# Turning Pillar 4 (\u201cmeasure what matters\u201d) into concrete, auditable metrics\n\nShapiro\u2019s instinct to move beyond GDP is correct. Two proposed measures can be made far stricter:\n\n**1) Economic Agency Index (EAI).** Define for household \\(i\\): \\(W_i\\) (labor), \\(P_i\\) (property/asset income: dividends, interest, rents, pass-through profits; exclude realized capital gains for volatility), \\(T_i\\) (transfers). Let \\(S^P_i = P_i/(W_i+P_i+T_i)\\). For region \\(R\\), estimate \\(EAI_R = \\mathrm{median}_i(S^P_i)\\) or a robust trimmed mean. Track over time and compare across regions. Source microdata: CPS ASEC for flows; SCF for asset incidence; reconcile to NIPA categories. The **goal** is to lift \\(EAI_R\\) for the *median* household, not just the mean (which is sensitive to the top tail).\n\n**2) Inclusive Capital Income Ratio (ICIR).** Restrict \\(P_i\\) to \u201cinclusive\u201d assets (broad-based index funds in public retirement accounts, sovereign/municipal wealth dividends, co-ops, ESOPs). Define \\(ICIR_R = P^{\\mathrm{incl}}_{\\tilde{i}}/(W_{\\tilde{i}} + P_{\\tilde{i}} + T_{\\tilde{i}})\\) where \\(\\tilde{i}\\) indexes the median-income household. This isolates the *distributive* piece Shapiro cares about (shared assets vs. billionaire-owned capital). If you want comparability and policy accountability, publish both **level** and **growth** of ICIR by region.\n\nThese definitions avoid z-scores (which muddle interpretability across time) and can be published as clean shares with confidence intervals and microdata documentation.\n\n# What \u201cconcrete interventions\u201d would actually look like\n\n**Universal basic capital (UBC) beats pure UBI** as a *structural* fix because it moves households onto the returns-to-capital curve. The notable U.S. proof-of-concept is **Baby Bonds**: Connecticut seeds \\$3,200 in a trust at birth for Medicaid-covered newborns, redeemable for specified wealth-building uses in adulthood; federal proposals would scale a \\$1,000 seed with progressive top-ups. California is piloting a targeted variant. This is exactly the kind of **inclusive-capital flow** ICIR should capture. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2news39\ue201\n\n**Sovereign/municipal wealth vehicles** (energy, data, spectrum, land value uplift) can create region-wide dividends without means-testing drama; pair with **ESOP/coop tax preferences** to broaden firm-level ownership. \n\n**Payments rails and identity** should be decoupled: use **privacy-preserving digital ID** (EU eIDAS-2 wallets) to reduce fraud and admin friction, and analyze **CBDCs** carefully\u2014BIS and trackers emphasize both efficiency gains and surveillance risks\u2014before you tie income distribution to a directly state-visible wallet. **Programmability** is power; legislate on-chain privacy budgets and clear guardrails up front. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search7\ue201\n\n**Competition/data-mobility policy** matters more than a \u201crobot tax.\u201d If the decoupling rents pool in a handful of platforms, you won\u2019t rescue median households with transfers alone. Mandate **data portability and model interoperability**, curb self-preferencing, and open access to critical upstream inputs (foundation model APIs, compute credits) for SMEs and co-ops.\n\n# Education: good instincts, but mind the selection effects\n\nThe episode\u2019s educational north star\u2014communication, boundaries, self-care, negotiation, presentation, arts, and project-based learning\u2014fits a future where language, trust, and embodied interaction dominate remaining human work. Keep it\u2014but **do not underweight math/science**: visuospatial and formal reasoning are upstream of agency and meta-learning, and the biggest productivity premiums appear when humans supervise, compose, and *verify* machine outputs. As for the Alpha model, the two-hour personalization is legitimately interesting; the current **\\$40k/year** tuition tells you it\u2019s not yet an equitable, scalable public model. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n# What to watch (to falsify or corroborate the thesis)\n\n1) **Median capital income share** (EAI/ICIR). If it doesn\u2019t rise, post-labor pain will be politically unmanageable.  \n2) **Task-level automation in language-in/language-out jobs.** Work Trend/AI Index-style data will show whether the \u201cempathy moat\u201d is thick enough or whether agentic systems chew into more of those tasks than expected. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n3) **Employment/population and hours worked** in the most exposed occupations vs. output per worker. If you get rising output with flat-to-falling hours and stagnant wage shares, you\u2019re in the decoupling zone. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n4) **Policy diffusion**: baby bonds (state and federal), ESOP incentive uptake, regional/sovereign wealth funds, municipal dividends, and privacy-constrained digital identity deployments. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n\n# Bottom line\n\nThis is a thoughtful, interdisciplinary synthesis with three real strengths: it (i) refuses to treat GDP or \u201cproductivity\u201d as an end state, (ii) reframes the *unit of analysis* around household agency (own capital, don\u2019t just receive transfers), and (iii) centers power instead of tech fetishism. The weak points are fixable: be stricter on adoption/capability claims; avoid determinism about \u201cempathy as the last job\u201d; keep education grounded in general-purpose reasoning; and define the new metrics so they\u2019re **auditable and comparable**.

Over 58,000 children are eligible for state-run trust funds they can access at age 18, with accounts starting at $4,500. The program, inspired by economists Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity\u2019s 2010 federal policy proposal, aims to reduce childhood poverty and address the racial wealth gap by offering greater investments to low-income families. California\u2019s program will eventually expand to cover all low-income newborns, aligning with similar efforts in states like Connecticut, which began a baby bonds program in 2023. Connecticut\u2019s initiative grants newborns $3,200 restricted to wealth-building uses such as education and homeownership. Baby bonds are increasingly seen as a form of reparative justice, offering bipartisan appeal by focusing on children and promoting economic opportunity. Studies suggest baby bonds can significantly narrow racial wealth disparities, with experts viewing them as one key piece in a broader strategy to address systemic inequality and promote long-term financial stability for disadvantaged youth.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search7\ue201","start_idx":8031,"end_idx":8063,"safe_urls":["https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU%2BDigital%2BIdentity%2BWallet%2BHome?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU%2BDigital%2BIdentity%2BWallet%2BHome?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"EU Digital Identity Wallet Home - European Commission","url":"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU%2BDigital%2BIdentity%2BWallet%2BHome?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1739836800.0,"snippet":"The European Digital Identity Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 was adopted on 20 May 2024.
