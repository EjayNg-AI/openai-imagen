This is especially so when the centre is located in a ground-floor HDB shop unit within a residential block. Below is a detailed overview of the key obligations and requirements, organized by category:\n\n## 1. Zoning and Use Approvals (HDB/URA)\n\n**Permissibility of Tuition Centre Use:** Tuition centres are generally allowed to operate in HDB commercial units (including those on the ground floor of residential blocks), but approval is required to ensure the use aligns with planning rules. In urban planning terms, a tuition centre is classified as a **\u201cCommercial School\u201d (Use Class 18)** under URA\u2019s use classes\u301024\u2020L82-L90\u3011. HDB considers tuition or enrichment centres an allowable trade in HDB commercial premises\u301024\u2020L107-L115\u3011. \n\n**HDB Change-of-Use Application:** If the unit\u2019s current approved use is not already \u201ctuition centre\u201d or \u201ceducation centre,\u201d the operator must apply for a Change of Trade/Use with HDB **before** starting operations. This is done via the GoBusiness portal by submitting an \u201cApplication for Changes (HDB Commercial Properties)\u201d \u2013 essentially requesting to change the trade category (e.g. from retail shop to tuition centre)\u30107\u2020L153-L162\u3011\u30107\u2020L165-L173\u3011.  \n- HDB maintains a list of *Allowable Trades* for its commercial units. Since \u201cTuition Centre\u201d is on this list, HDB can typically approve the change quickly (sometimes within 1 day)\u30107\u2020L165-L173\u3011.  \n- A non-refundable administrative fee is payable to HDB for the application (approximately **$107 including GST** for standard cases)\u30107\u2020L169-L173\u3011. Higher fees (~$214) apply if the unit has an attached living quarter or more complex change.  \n- **URA Approval:** For HDB properties, URA\u2019s planning permission is generally routed through HDB. You will receive either a **Grant of Written Permission** from URA or an **HDB approval letter** explicitly allowing use of the premises as a tuition/enrichment centre\u301019\u2020L130-L138\u3011\u301037\u2020L151-L158\u3011. This document is required later for MOE licensing.\n\n**Compliance with Planning Conditions:** Operating without the proper change-of-use approval is an offense under the Planning Act. Owners or tenants who commence an unauthorized use (e.g. running a tuition centre without approval) can face steep fines (up to $200,000 for first offense)\u30106\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Always secure the HDB/URA nod first to avoid such penalties.\n\n**Residential Considerations:** If the HDB unit has an attached residential **living quarter** upstairs (common in some shophouses), note that living areas may also be converted for certain uses (including education centres) with permission\u301024\u2020L111-L119\u3011. However, disruptive uses (bars, nightclubs, etc.) are disallowed in HDB blocks to protect residents\u2019 peace\u301024\u2020L113-L119\u3011. A tuition centre is generally compatible with HDB residential environments, provided noise and operating hours are kept reasonable.\n\n## 2. Licensing and Registration (MOE)\n\n**MOE Registration Requirement:** Under the Education Act, **any centre offering education to 10 or more persons must be registered with the Ministry of Education (MOE)** as a private school\u301012\u2020L111-L119\u3011\u301020\u2020L123-L131\u3011. In this scenario (3 classes of 4\u20135 students each, up to ~15 students on-site), the tuition centre **must** be registered. This process is often informally referred to as obtaining an \u201cMOE licence,\u201d and it grants the *Certificate of Registration of a School*.\n\n**Purpose of Registration:** MOE registration ensures the centre meets basic standards in safety, curriculum, and management. It is **not** an endorsement of educational quality, but is legally required for operation\u30109\u2020L1-L5\u3011. Once registered, the centre must display the MOE registration certificate at the premises\u301020\u2020L124-L132\u3011.\n\n**Key Criteria for MOE Registration:** To successfully register as a private school/tuition centre, the operator must fulfill several criteria and submit required documents:  \n- **Legal Entity:** The business must be a legal entity registered with ACRA. A sole proprietorship is acceptable (MOE allows sole-prop, partnership, LLP, or company)\u301019\u2020L139-L147\u3011. The business name should reflect an educational nature (e.g. \u201cABC Tuition Centre\u201d)\u301016\u2020L133-L140\u3011.  \n- **Premises Approval:** Proof of URA or HDB approval for use of the premises as a tuition centre is required\u301019\u2020L130-L138\u3011. (As noted in section 1, this will be the HDB approval letter for an HDB unit.)  \n- **Floor Plan & Facilities:** An **SCDF-approved layout plan** for the unit, indicating it is set up for use as a school/tuition centre, must be submitted\u301037\u2020L146-L154\u3011. The premises should be fully renovated and furnished as needed *before* applying to MOE\u301016\u2020L111-L119\u3011. MOE will conduct a site inspection to verify safety and suitability.  \n- **Fire Safety:** A valid **Fire Safety Certificate (FSC)** issued by SCDF for the premises is required as part of the application\u301037\u2020L146-L154\u3011. (See section 3 on SCDF compliance.)  \n- **School Management Committee (SMC):** The applicant must form a School Management Committee with at least one manager (referred to as the \u201cSupervisor\u201d) and other members to oversee the school\u2019s operations\u301020\u2020L124-L132\u3011. For a sole proprietorship, an *Appointment Note* must be submitted to appoint the SMC members\u301019\u2020L139-L147\u3011, and each SMC member completes Form CM. Typically, the sole proprietor can be Supervisor, and you would appoint 2-3 other individuals (they could be family, senior staff, etc.) to the committee.  \n- **Courses & Teachers:** Details of the courses offered and their syllabi must be provided (usually tuition follows MOE school syllabus, which is acceptable), and all teachers must be registered with MOE (more in section 4). Forms detailing the courses (Form RC) and teacher particulars/qualifications (Form RT) are part of the submission\u301019\u2020L162-L170\u3011\u301019\u2020L174-L182\u3011.\n\n**Application Process:** Registration is done online via the GoBusiness licensing portal. The applicant (preferably the business owner or proposed Supervisor) will fill in the forms and upload the required documents\u301016\u2020L119-L128\u3011\u301016\u2020L133-L140\u3011. The **application fee is about S$392.52 (before GST)** (~S$420 with GST) and is non-refundable\u301035\u2020L131-L134\u3011. Processing takes roughly 2 weeks after all documents are in order\u301037\u2020L186-L194\u3011, including a final site inspection visit by MOE officers.\n\n**Outcome and Maintenance of Licence:** Once approved, MOE will issue the **Certificate of Registration of School**. This certificate currently **does not require periodic renewal** \u2013 it remains valid as long as the school operates, *provided* that the school keeps its information up to date\u301035\u2020L113-L121\u3011. However, some ongoing obligations include:  \n- Re-registering or updating the **SMC members every 3 years** (or whenever they change)\u301035\u2020L113-L121\u3011.  \n- Submitting amendment applications to MOE whenever there are changes, such as adding new courses, hiring new teachers, relocating, or changing the school name\u301010\u2020L118-L127\u3011.  \n- Continuing to comply with all regulations (fire safety, teacher vetting, etc.). MOE can revoke the registration if conditions are breached.\n\nIn summary, MOE registration is a critical step that formally licenses the tuition centre to operate. It ensures the centre has proper governance, qualified teachers, and a safe environment for students.\n\n## 3. Fire Safety and Building Requirements (SCDF)\n\n**Fire Code Compliance:** A tuition centre must meet the fire safety standards set by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The HDB shop unit will need to be evaluated for compliance with the Fire Code, considering its new use as an educational facility with multiple classrooms. Key requirements typically include: adequate means of escape (exit doors/corridors), emergency exit lighting, exit signs, fire alarms or detectors, and fire-fighting equipment (e.g. extinguishers). Any renovation works to partition the unit into classrooms must conform to fire safety rules (e.g. use of proper fire-rated materials if required, not blocking exit routes, etc.).\n\n**Plan Approval:** Before renovating, the operator should engage a **Qualified Person (QP)** (a registered architect or engineer) to draw up the renovation plans and fire safety plans. These plans must be **submitted to SCDF\u2019s Fire Safety & Shelter Department (FSSD)** for approval. SCDF will review aspects like occupancy load, exit access, and fire protection systems. Once FSSD approves the plans and the renovation/installation works are completed, the QP will arrange for inspection.\n\n**Fire Safety Certificate (FSC):** **By law, an FSC must be obtained from SCDF *before* the premises can be used or occupied** for the new purpose\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011. The FSC is issued only after all required fire safety works are completed and inspected. In practice, this means after renovating the unit into the classroom layout, installing the necessary fire safety measures, and passing inspection, SCDF will issue the FSC. Using the premises without first obtaining the FSC is an offense under the Fire Safety Act\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011. (The MOE will also not register the centre without seeing the FSC\u301037\u2020L146-L154\u3011.)\n\n- *Note:* If there are minor outstanding fire safety issues preventing immediate issuance of the FSC (e.g. a back-ordered exit sign), SCDF may grant a **Temporary Fire Permit (TFP)** to allow temporary occupancy\u301026\u2020L99-L107\u3011. A TFP is typically valid for up to 6 months and indicates the major safety provisions are in place, with only minor issues pending. However, a full FSC must follow once those issues are resolved.\n\n**Occupancy Load and Layout:** Given the centre will host at most ~15 students + a few staff at any one time, the occupant load is relatively low. This is advantageous for fire safety \u2013 one exit door is likely sufficient if it is at least 1m wide and the travel distance from the classrooms to the exit is within allowed limits per the Fire Code. The QP will calculate and ensure compliance with occupant load standards (e.g. classrooms typically have an occupancy factor based on floor area). They will also ensure exit routes are unobstructed and lead to a safe dispersal area. Because the student count is under 50, the centre would not be classified as a high-capacity public assembly; thus, some stricter requirements (like automatic sprinkler systems or emergency voice communication systems) are **not typically mandated** for such a small centre. The existing building\u2019s fire protection (HDB blocks often have basic alarm systems and hose reels) coupled with portable fire extinguishers in the unit may suffice.\n\n**Fire Safety Maintenance:** Even after obtaining the FSC, the centre must maintain all fire safety equipment in working order. For example:  \n- Fire extinguishers should be serviced annually.  \n- Exit lights/emergency lights should be tested regularly.  \n- Ensure no changes are made to the layout that would invalidate the approved fire safety plan (any further renovations must be re-approved by SCDF).\n\nUnlike large buildings, **small single-unit premises are typically not required to have a certified Fire Safety Manager or an annual Fire Certificate** (the **Fire Certificate** is an annual compliance certificate required for certain large or high-occupancy buildings, e.g. those with occupant load > 200, or very large floor area)\u301025\u2020L53-L60\u3011. A modest tuition centre in an HDB shop usually falls below these thresholds. Thus, ongoing fire safety compliance mainly involves good housekeeping (keeping escape routes clear, etc.) and annual checks of equipment.\n\nIn summary, **SCDF requirements** will entail an upfront effort (and cost) to ensure the premises are up to code and to secure the Fire Safety Certificate, but once done, the ongoing obligations are manageable (periodic maintenance). These measures are critical for the safety of the students and staff in case of emergencies\u301020\u2020L124-L132\u3011.\n\n## 4. Teacher Qualifications and Requirements\n\n**MOE Teacher Registration:** All teachers/instructors at the tuition centre must be registered with MOE as part of the centre\u2019s licensing. During the MOE registration process, you will submit a **Teacher Registration Form (Form RT)** for each teacher, along with their personal details and educational qualifications\u301019\u2020L174-L182\u3011\u301019\u2020L193-L201\u3011. MOE will review and approve each teacher before issuing the licence. In essence, **every teacher must be cleared and \u201cpermitted to teach\u201d by MOE**, so you cannot simply hire an unreported teacher once you\u2019re licensed \u2013 any new teacher would require an amendment to the MOE registration.\n\n**Educational Qualifications:** While MOE does not require tuition teachers to have formal teaching credentials (they don\u2019t need to be ex-MOE school teachers or have a NIE teaching diploma), they **do expect teachers to be academically qualified in the subjects they teach**. The centre must submit copies of each teacher\u2019s relevant certificates \u2013 e.g. O-level/A-level certificates, diplomas, university degrees, etc. \u2013 to demonstrate they are competent to teach the level/subject offered\u301019\u2020L193-L201\u3011. Generally, a teacher should have qualifications *at least one level higher* than what they are teaching (for example, a tutor teaching Secondary 4 Math should ideally have done Math at A-level or have a related diploma/degree). MOE will evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. If a teacher\u2019s qualifications are not straightforward, MOE might issue a **\u201cPermission to Teach\u201d** letter with certain conditions, or in rare cases they may reject a teacher who lacks sufficient credentials.\n\n**Good Character and Criminal Clearance:** Importantly, MOE screens teachers for safety as well. **Teachers must declare any criminal convictions, especially those related to sexual or violent offenses**\u301020\u2020L129-L133\u3011. MOE will **not register any teacher who has been convicted of serious crimes**, particularly offenses that would pose a risk to children\u301020\u2020L129-L133\u3011. This acts as a basic background check, though it\u2019s largely an honor system of declaration backed by potential verification. (Separately, the government has considered mandating broader criminal records screening for those working with children\u301020\u2020L139-L147\u3011, but as of 2025 the MOE registration declaration is the main mechanism.)\n\n**MOE Teacher Registry:** Once approved, teachers are listed in the centre\u2019s registration records. The centre is responsible for ensuring only registered teachers conduct classes. If a teacher leaves, or a new one is hired, the centre must inform MOE (via an amendment application to register the new teacher). All new teachers must be approved *before* they start teaching. There is no public \u201clicense\u201d issued to individual teachers, but internally MOE treats them as registered instructors under the centre\u2019s license.\n\n**Other Requirements:** There is no specific requirement for teachers to be Singapore citizens or PRs \u2013 foreigners can teach if they have legal work passes, and they too must be registered with MOE. (If hiring foreign instructors, the centre would additionally need to comply with Ministry of Manpower work pass regulations, which is outside MOE\u2019s scope.) Also, there isn\u2019t a mandated teacher-to-student ratio for tuition centres, but maintaining small class sizes (like 4\u20135 students as planned) is pedagogically sound and not an issue for regulations. \n\nIn short, **all tutors must be fit and proper in terms of qualifications and character**. Ensure you recruit tutors who have a strong academic background in their subject and a clean record. They do *not* need to be MOE school teachers, but many centres consider MOE-trained teachers an asset (though not a legal requirement).\n\n## 5. Insurance Requirements (Public Liability and Others)\n\nWhile operating a tuition centre, having the right insurance is highly advisable to protect against unforeseen events. Here\u2019s a look at insurance considerations:\n\n**Public Liability Insurance:** This is **strongly recommended** for a business where students (minors) and members of the public will be on the premises. Public liability insurance covers third-party claims of bodily injury or property damage that occur in connection with your business. For example, if a student or parent is accidentally injured on-site (slip and fall, etc.) or if a fire in your unit causes damage to neighboring shops, public liability insurance would cover legal claims and compensation. In Singapore, such insurance is considered a *\u201cmust-have\u201d for businesses interacting with the public*\u301032\u2020L78-L86\u3011 \u2013 it shields you from potentially ruinous lawsuit costs. \n\n- **Status**: There is *no law* that explicitly mandates a tuition centre to have public liability insurance (unlike, say, motor vehicle insurance which is compulsory). However, it may be effectively required by other parties. For instance, HDB (as landlord) might include in the tenancy agreement that the tenant should maintain insurance for public liability or fire. Even if not stipulated, it is prudent to have it. Premiums for a small centre are relatively affordable (often a few hundred dollars per year for coverage in the range of S$500k to S$1 million).\n\n**Work Injury Compensation Insurance:** If the tuition centre has employees (which it likely will, if you have other teachers on payroll), you must consider **Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) insurance**. Under the WICA, **it is mandatory to purchase work injury insurance for**: (a) all manual employees (not likely applicable to tutors), and (b) all non-manual employees earning below a certain monthly salary threshold (this threshold was $2,600 and has been rising; by 2024 it is around $2,600\u2013$2,800, and set to further increase). Many part-time tutors or support staff could fall under this category. Even if a tutor\u2019s salary is above the mandate threshold, it\u2019s wise to have coverage for all staff, as any workplace injury (like an accident in the classroom) could otherwise result in out-of-pocket compensation liability. WICA insurance premiums depend on the staff profile and payroll, but for a small centre, the annual premium is not high (maybe a few hundred dollars). This insurance will cover medical expenses and compensation for employees if they get injured in the course of work.\n\n**Property Insurance:** You should also consider insuring the centre\u2019s contents (furniture, computers, etc.) against fire, theft, or other damage. HDB will insure the building structure, but not the contents or your renovations. A **fire insurance or business property policy** can cover renovation investments (e.g. the cost of the partitions, air-conditioners) and contents. This may be bundled with a business insurance package.\n\n**Professional Indemnity Insurance:** This is not commonly taken by tuition centres, but some might opt for it. It covers claims arising from professional services \u2013 for example, if a parent alleges that poor instruction caused their child to fail (a somewhat unlikely claim to win, but it\u2019s more relevant for financial or legal advisory businesses). For a tuition centre, this is usually not necessary, and such claims are rare.\n\nIn summary, **insurance is about risk management**. At minimum, **Public Liability Insurance** is highly recommended to cover injury or accidents involving students and visitors\u301032\u2020L78-L86\u3011. If you have any employees, **WICA insurance is legally required** (for those under the salary threshold, which covers most non-highly-paid staff). These will constitute recurring annual costs. It\u2019s wise to budget for insurance as part of your operating expenses, even though it\u2019s not a licensing requirement per se.\n\n## 6. Compliance Cost Estimates (One-time and Recurring)\n\nBelow is a summary of the expected costs associated with the regulatory compliances discussed. These are approximate figures as of 2024/2025, meant to guide budgeting:\n\n- **HDB Change of Use Application:** One-time administrative fee of **approximately S$107** (inclusive of GST) for HDB\u2019s trade change approval\u30107\u2020L169-L173\u3011. (If the unit already has an approved use as a tuition centre, this may not be needed. Otherwise, budget for it.) No recurring cost.  \n- **Renovation and Fit-Out (including Fire Safety Works):** This can vary significantly. For a small centre (three classrooms), basic renovation and partitioning might cost in the range of **S$10,000 or more** (depending on materials and design). Specifically for fire-safety compliance, include costs for installation of exit signs, emergency lighting, extinguishers, possibly a fire alarm panel or detectors if required. Also budget for a QP (architect/engineer) to prepare plans and handle the FSC process \u2013 professional fees could be **~S$1,000\u2013$3,000** for a simple project. SCDF\u2019s plan processing fees are modest (often on the order of a few hundred dollars or less). These are **one-time costs** to get the place ready and certified. Ongoing facility costs would include annual servicing of fire equipment (perhaps **~S$100/year** for extinguisher servicing, etc.).  \n- **MOE Registration Fee:** One-time **S$392.52 (before GST)** application fee (about S$420 with GST) to register the centre with MOE\u301035\u2020L131-L134\u3011. This is paid upon application. There is **no annual licence fee** \u2013 the registration is valid indefinitely. (However, if you need to amend the registration, there might be small fees for amendments; MOE\u2019s site does not list a fee for amendments like adding teachers, so it may be free.)  \n- **Business Registration (ACRA):** The cost to register a sole proprietorship is low: S$115 for 1 year (or S$175 for 3 years). Since the business is already registered, you likely already paid this. **Renewal is S$30 per year** (or S$90 for 3 years)\u301041\u2020L23-L31\u3011\u301041\u2020L45-L49\u3011. This is a recurring cost to keep the business registration active. *(Note: If you ever convert to a Pte Ltd company for expansion, incorporation would cost a one-time S$315 and thereafter ~$60/year for annual returns, but as a sole prop those don\u2019t apply.)*  \n- **Insurance:** Public liability insurance premiums for a small tuition centre are roughly **S$300\u2013$600 per year** for a standard coverage amount\u301032\u2020L78-L86\u3011. Work injury insurance might add another few hundred if applicable. These are **recurring annual** costs. (Property insurance, if taken, could be bundled into the same policy package for perhaps a bit more.)  \n- **Miscellaneous Licences/Permits:** If you put up a signboard or advertisement on the shopfront, you may need a signboard licence. HDB/Town Council usually require approval for signage for consistency and safety. There might be a one-time application cost in the ballpark of **S$200** (cost can vary; some Town Councils charge a token fee or none at all for small business signage, but if the sign is large and considered an advertisement, BCA could levy an annual fee based on size). Also factor in the fabrication of the sign itself.  \n- **Ongoing Compliance/Admin:** While not fees, consider costs of ongoing compliance such as staff training in safety, first aid kits, etc. These are minor but good to budget a small amount annually.\n\nFor clarity, here is a **summary table of key compliance costs**:\n\n| **Compliance Item**                     | **One-Time Costs (S$)**                                      | **Recurring Costs (S$)**                   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **HDB Change-of-Use Approval**          | ~$107 (incl. GST) administrative fee\u30107\u2020L169-L173\u3011           | N/A (one-time)                             |\n| **MOE Registration (Licence)**          | ~$420 (incl. GST) application fee\u301035\u2020L131-L134\u3011             | N/A (no annual renewal fee)                |\n| **Premises Renovation & Fit-Out**       | *Varies widely*: <br>\u2013 **SCDF plan submission & consultancy**: ~$1,000\u2013$3,000 <br>\u2013 **Partitioning, signage, etc.**: ~$10,000 (estimate for basic setup) | N/A (one-time capital expense; maintenance only) |\n| **Fire Safety Certification (SCDF)**    | Included in above (SCDF fees are minimal; obtaining the FSC is part of renovation cost)\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011. | **Fire equipment servicing**: ~$100/year (e.g. extinguisher maintenance) |\n| **Public Liability Insurance**          | N/A                                                          | ~$300\u2013$600 per year\u301032\u2020L78-L86\u3011          |\n| **Work Injury Insurance**              | N/A                                                          | ~$200\u2013$500 per year (depends on staff wages) |\n| **Business Registration (ACRA)**        | ~$115 for initial 1-year registration (already incurred)     | $30 per year (renewal)\u301041\u2020L45-L49\u3011       |\n| **Signage/Advertisement Permit**        | ~$200 (one-time for signboard approval; varies)              | N/A (unless annual fee for large signage)  |\n\n**Note:** The above costs are estimates for compliance-related items. *They do not include operational costs like rent, utilities, salaries, etc.* It\u2019s also wise to have some contingency budget for compliance \u2013 for example, if SCDF requires additional works, or if MOE asks for modifications (such as installing CCTV or a viewing panel on classroom doors for safety \u2013 not a strict rule, but sometimes encouraged), there could be extra costs.\n\nFinally, remember that **compliance is an ongoing responsibility**. Even after all initial approvals and licences are obtained, the tuition centre must continuously adhere to the regulations (e.g. keeping within approved use, ensuring safety standards, updating MOE on changes, renewing insurances, etc.). By planning ahead with the above obligations and costs in mind, you can operate your tuition centre with peace of mind, focusing on providing quality education while meeting all legal requirements. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Housing & Development Board \u2013 Guidelines on allowable trades and change of use for HDB commercial properties\u301024\u2020L107-L115\u3011\u30107\u2020L165-L173\u3011  \n- Urban Redevelopment Authority \u2013 Planning permission and use class for commercial schools\u301024\u2020L82-L90\u3011  \n- Ministry of Education \u2013 **Education Act** and Private Education regulations (registration requirements for private schools/tuition centres)\u301012\u2020L111-L119\u3011\u301020\u2020L123-L132\u3011  \n- Ministry of Education \u2013 Registration process and document checklists for private schools (forms, committee, teachers, etc.)\u301019\u2020L130-L139\u3011\u301037\u2020L146-L154\u3011  \n- Singapore Civil Defence Force \u2013 Fire Safety requirements (Plan approval, Fire Safety Certificate before occupancy)\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011  \n- Parliamentary Reply on Tuition Industry \u2013 Confirmation of MOE registration requirement and teacher vetting for centres with >10 students\u301020\u2020L124-L133\u3011  \n- ACRA \u2013 Business registration and renewal fees for sole proprietorships\u301041\u2020L45-L49\u3011  \n- Insurance Industry sources \u2013 Importance of public liability insurance for businesses interacting with the public\u301032\u2020L78-L86\u3011."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":811,"end_ix":823,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Change Of Use Of Property for Commercial Spaces - A Complete Guide For Businesses in Singapore | DollarsAndSense Business","url":"https://dollarsandsense.sg/business/change-of-use-of-property-for-commercial-spaces-a-complete-guide-for-businesses/#:~:text=Class%2016%3A%20Pet%20Shop%20Class,Building%20Class%2018%3A%20Commercial%20School","text":"Class 16: Pet Shop Class 17: Community Sports And Fitness Building Class 18: Commercial School","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":24,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":82,"end_line_num":90},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":914,"end_ix":928,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Change Of Use Of Property for Commercial Spaces - A Complete Guide For Businesses in Singapore | DollarsAndSense Business","url":"https://dollarsandsense.sg/business/change-of-use-of-property-for-commercial-spaces-a-complete-guide-for-businesses/#:~:text=For%20HDB%20shophouses%20or%20commercial,operator%20family%20restaurant","text":"For HDB shophouses or commercial spaces, you will need to seek\u00a0HDB\u2019s approval for change of trade.

Below is the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u202f\u202fWhy Step\u202f2 (HDB trade code) is mandatory **to verify**\n\n* HDB\u2019s **Allowable Trades** list explicitly names \u201cTuition\u202fcentres\u201d as a permitted trade for shop units\u3010turn0search6\u3011.  \n* Operating a trade that is *not* recorded on HDB\u2019s tenancy file is a breach of lease conditions and HDB can issue summonses or terminate the tenancy.  \n* Therefore **every new tenant must confirm the trade code** for the unit.  \n  *If the code is already \u201cTuition/Enrichment\u201d, no fresh Change\u2011of\u2011Trade application is required; if it is still \u201cRetail\u201d, you must file the GoBusiness Application for Changes and pay the S$107 fee\u3010turn1search1\u3011.*\n\n## 2\u202f\u202fWhy Step\u202f3 (URA Written Permission) may or may not require a *new* application\n\n* URA classifies tuition centres as **\u201cCommercial School \u2013 Use\u202fClass\u202f18\u201d**\u3010turn0search2\u3011.  \n* A unit that is already Use\u202fClass\u202f18 (shown on URA\u202fSPACE or proven by a past Written\u202fPermission) can continue as such; planning permission \u201cruns with the land\u201d until the trade changes again. Operating without the correct use class attracts penalties of up to S$200\u202f000 under the Planning Act\u3010turn5view0\u3011.  \n* Hence **every tenant must make sure the Written\u202fPermission exists**, but **only tenants of units that have never been converted need to lodge a new change\u2011of\u2011use application** via GoBusiness.\n\n## 3\u202f\u202fWhy Step\u202f4 (SCDF fire\u2011safety clearance) is still relevant for *all* centres\n\n* Under the Fire Safety Act, **no premises that have undergone \u201cfire safety works\u201d (e.g., adding partitions, exits, emergency lights) may be occupied until SCDF issues a Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) or, in limited cases, a Temporary Fire Permit (TFP)\u3010turn2search1\u3011\u3010turn5search6\u3011**.  \n* If the previous operator has already obtained an FSC for the *current* layout, the new tenant may continue using it, but:  \n  * you must keep the FSC on the premises for inspection\u3010turn5search1\u3011;  \n  * any new renovation that alters walls, doors, exits or adds classrooms triggers a fresh **plans submission by a Qualified\u202fPerson** and a new FSC.  \n* Even the smallest tuition centre must keep exit routes clear, maintain extinguishers, and service emergency lights\u2014these duties bind every occupier under the Fire Code, irrespective of MOE size thresholds\u3010turn5search5\u3011.\n\n## 4\u202f\u202fHow centre size (student head\u2011count) changes the picture\n\n| Centre size at one time | MOE licence? | Must *check* Steps\u00a02\u20114? | When you must **apply** |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u2264\u202f3 students (home\u2011based) | **No**; falls under HDB Home\u2011Based Business Scheme | Verify that activity stays within flat (different framework) | Apply for nothing beyond home\u2011based rules |\n| 4\u202f\u2013\u202f9 students in HDB shop | **No** (below Education\u2011Act threshold) | **Yes** \u2013 confirm HDB trade, URA use class, FSC | Apply only if approvals missing or you renovate |\n| \u2265\u202f10 students concurrently | **Yes** \u2013 MOE Certificate of Registration of School required\u3010turn1search0\u3011\u3010turn4search0\u3011 | **Yes** | Must obtain MOE licence *after* Steps\u202f2\u20114 are in place |\n\n> **Key point:** land\u2011use (HDB/URA) and fire\u2011safety laws apply to *all* tuition centres; MOE licensing only starts at the 10\u2011student mark.\n\n## 5\u202f\u202fTypical scenarios\n\n### Scenario\u00a0A \u2013 Premises already a tuition centre, no renovation planned  \n* Landlord shows you HDB approval letter and URA Written\u202fPermission; FSC is dated last year and floor\u2011plan matches existing layout.  \n* **You do not re\u2011apply** for Steps\u202f2\u20114, but you keep certified copies on site, service fire extinguishers annually and make sure your class size remains within approved occupant load.\n\n### Scenario\u00a0B \u2013 Premises were a retail shop, you plan to build 3 classrooms  \n1. **Step\u202f2:** File Change\u2011of\u2011Trade with HDB (S$107).  \n2. **Step\u202f3:** Architect lodges URA change\u2011of\u2011use to Class\u202f18.  \n3. **Step\u202f4:** Same architect submits fire\u2011safety plans to SCDF; after works are done, engage Registered\u202fInspectors for FSC.  \n4. If you will have \u2265\u202f10 students at peak, apply for MOE registration next.\n\n## 6\u202f\u202fBottom\u2011line answer to your question\n\n> **Yes, a small tuition centre must still *ensure* that Steps\u00a02\u00a0(HDB trade code), 3\u00a0(URA Written\u00a0Permission) and 4\u00a0(Fire\u2011safety clearance) are properly in place\u2014but it only needs to *apply* for them if they have not already been secured by a prior operator or if new renovation invalidates the old approvals.**\n\nSkipping any of these checks leaves the business exposed to enforcement action by HDB, URA and SCDF, even if the centre teaches just a handful of students."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\u3010turn0search6\u3011","start_idx":725,"end_idx":739,"safe_urls":["https://www.hdb.gov.sg/business/commercial/managing-your-unit/change-of-use/allowable-trades?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"alt":"([Housing & Development Board](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/business/commercial/managing-your-unit/change-of-use/allowable-trades?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"webpage","title":"Allowable Trades -
