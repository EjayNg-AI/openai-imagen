I\u2019ll start with the most basic and general introduction to coordinate systems as used in physics, without going into advanced material yet.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is a Coordinate System?\n\nIn physics, a **coordinate system** is a way of assigning numbers (coordinates) to points in space so that we can describe positions, motions, and physical laws mathematically.  \n- It provides a **frame of reference**: where is the origin, which directions are positive, how do we measure distances?\n- It turns geometry and motion into algebra and calculus.\n\nWithout coordinates, you would have to describe motion verbally (\u201cthe ball is moving north-east, slowing down\u201d). With coordinates, you can write precise equations:  \n\\[\nx(t) = v_0 t + \\tfrac{1}{2} a t^2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Do We Need Different Coordinate Systems?\n\nNot all physical problems are equally suited to one system. For example:\n- If you are tracking a car moving along a straight road, **Cartesian coordinates** (x, y, z) are natural.  \n- If you are studying planetary orbits around the sun, **polar or spherical coordinates** are much more convenient, because the motion is naturally circular or elliptical.\n\nSo the choice of coordinate system often makes the problem **simpler**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Basic Ingredients of a Coordinate System\n\nAny coordinate system in physics must specify:\n1. **Origin** \u2013 the reference point (e.g., Earth\u2019s center, laboratory corner).\n2. **Axes / Directions** \u2013 how we orient and measure directions.\n3. **Coordinates** \u2013 numbers that locate a point relative to the origin.\n4. **Metric (distance rule)** \u2013 how to compute distances between points using those coordinates.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Most Familiar System: Cartesian Coordinates\n\n- **Axes**: three perpendicular lines (x, y, z).  \n- **Coordinates**: a point is given by \\((x, y, z)\\).  \n- **Distance** between two points:  \n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n  \\]  \n- **Applications**: mechanics, kinematics in flat space, lab setups.\n\nCartesian coordinates are the default in physics because they are simple and match our intuition about length and direction.\n\n---\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve only given you the **foundation**: what coordinate systems are, why we use them, and the basic Cartesian example.  \n\nWould you like me to next introduce **curvilinear coordinates** (polar, cylindrical, spherical) and show how they generalize Cartesian coordinates, or would you prefer me to first expand on **reference frames** (e.g., moving vs stationary observers) before going further?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"979381517b99ce29-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"95721116-53e5-41f1-b598-ee391879494b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"95721116-53e5-41f1-b598-ee391879494b","children":["28783f7f-c19b-4154-a616-176f2c97e9bc"]},"28783f7f-c19b-4154-a616-176f2c97e9bc":{"id":"28783f7f-c19b-4154-a616-176f2c97e9bc","message":{"id":"28783f7f-c19b-4154-a616-176f2c97e9bc","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756884369.926,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Okay, we do reference frames"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"979384733fc43db1-BOM","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9b3f56fb-6338-48bd-9ef2-8d23c999297e","children":["398d9b1e-ae4f-441b-919f-2a09094e20a9"]},"398d9b1e-ae4f-441b-919f-2a09094e20a9":{"id":"398d9b1e-ae4f-441b-919f-2a09094e20a9","message":{"id":"398d9b1e-ae4f-441b-919f-2a09094e20a9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756884370.660022,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Perfect. Let\u2019s build carefully on **reference frames**, since they are the context in which coordinate systems are actually *used* in physics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is a Reference Frame?\n\nA **reference frame** is essentially a *perspective* from which you describe motion and events.  \n\n- It tells you **where the origin is**, how the **axes are oriented**, and whether the frame is **moving** or not.  \n- The same physical event can look very different in different frames.  \n\nExample:  \n- A passenger in a moving car says, \u201cI am at rest.\u201d  \n- An observer on the roadside says, \u201cYou are moving at 60 km/h.\u201d  \nBoth statements are correct, but they are made in different reference frames.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Frames and Observers\n\nEvery reference frame is tied to an **observer** (real or imagined). That observer uses their own coordinates and clock to measure:\n- **Position**: where is the object?  \n- **Velocity**: how fast and in which direction is it moving?  \n- **Acceleration**: how quickly is its velocity changing?\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types of Reference Frames\n\n1. **Inertial Frame**  \n   - A frame in which Newton\u2019s first law holds: a body not acted on by forces moves with constant velocity (straight line, uniform speed).  \n   - Example: an observer in deep space far from gravity and accelerations.\n\n2. **Non-inertial Frame**  \n   - A frame that is accelerating or rotating relative to an inertial frame.  \n   - In these frames, Newton\u2019s laws don\u2019t look \u201cclean\u201d unless we add **fictitious forces** (centrifugal force, Coriolis force).  \n   - Example: standing on Earth (which rotates), or inside a car taking a sharp turn.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Galilean Relativity (Classical Physics)\n\nBefore Einstein, physics assumed:\n- **Time is absolute**: all observers agree on the same clock time.  \n- **Space is absolute**: lengths are the same in all frames.  \n- Only velocity is relative.  \n\nMathematically, if two frames differ by a constant relative velocity \\(v\\), their coordinates are related by a **Galilean transformation**:\n\\[\nx' = x - vt, \\quad t' = t\n\\]\nThis works perfectly for Newtonian mechanics at everyday speeds.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Importance in Physics\n\n- Choosing the right reference frame simplifies calculations.  \n- For many problems, we assume Earth is an inertial frame \u2014 good approximation unless precision or cosmological scales matter.  \n- In rotating or accelerating systems (weather systems, rotating machinery, satellites), non-inertial effects are essential.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 Up to now, we\u2019ve stayed in **classical mechanics**.  \n\nDo you want me to next move into (a) more detail about **non-inertial frames and fictitious forces** (centrifugal, Coriolis, etc.), or (b) make the leap into **special relativity**, where reference frames force us to rethink time and space themselves?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"979384733fc43db1-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"28783f7f-c19b-4154-a616-176f2c97e9bc","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"28783f7f-c19b-4154-a616-176f2c97e9bc","children":["dacf7d18-fa93-4501-bd61-51244ccd2659"]},"dacf7d18-fa93-4501-bd61-51244ccd2659":{"id":"dacf7d18-fa93-4501-bd61-51244ccd2659","message":{"id":"dacf7d18-fa93-4501-bd61-51244ccd2659","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756885727.905,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I assume in x' = x-vt, the x and x' can be in 3 dimensions"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9793a599ba66fd41-BOM","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"398d9b1e-ae4f-441b-919f-2a09094e20a9","children":["5e454225-1ff5-4295-b981-df595979f2d8"]},"5e454225-1ff5-4295-b981-df595979f2d8":{"id":"5e454225-1ff5-4295-b981-df595979f2d8","message":{"id":"5e454225-1ff5-4295-b981-df595979f2d8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756885728.493526,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes \u2014 exactly.

Let me carefully untangle how they interact.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Galilean Transformations are About Frames, Not Coordinates\n\n- A **Galilean transformation** relates two **inertial reference frames** in classical mechanics.  \n- It answers: *if observer S measures an event at \\((\\mathbf{r},t)\\), what does observer S\u2032 measure if S\u2032 moves at constant velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) relative to S?*  \n- The standard form is written in **Cartesian coordinates**:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{v}t, \\quad t' = t.\n  \\]\n\nSo Galilean transformations are not inherently tied to \u201cCartesian-ness\u201d \u2014 but they are most transparently expressed that way.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Coordinate Systems Are Independent of Frames\n\n- A **coordinate system** (Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, spherical, \u2026) is a way of labeling points **within one frame**.  \n- You can use Cartesian coordinates in frame S, and polar coordinates in the *same* frame S, and both describe the same physics.  \n- Coordinate transformations (like \\(x = r\\cos\\theta\\)) are not the same thing as frame transformations (like \\(x' = x - vt\\)).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Galilean Transformations in Curvilinear Coordinates\n\nIf you choose a curvilinear system (say, polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\) in 2D), then a Galilean transformation still applies \u2014 but the algebra is more complicated:\n\n1. Start with Cartesian:  \n   \\[\n   x' = x - v_x t, \\quad y' = y - v_y t\n   \\]\n\n2. Convert to polar using:  \n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\quad \\theta = \\arctan(y/x)\n   \\]\n\n3.

Let me sharpen and clarify the distinction carefully:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Curvilinear Coordinates = Smooth Reparametrization of Space\n\n- In Euclidean space, we can always start with Cartesian coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\).  \n- A **curvilinear coordinate system** \\((q^1, q^2, q^3)\\) is then defined by a smooth, one-to-one, differentiable mapping:\n  \\[\n  (x,y,z) = \\mathbf{X}(q^1, q^2, q^3)\n  \\]\n  with a non-vanishing Jacobian determinant.  \n\n- Examples:\n  - Polar: \\(x = r\\cos\\theta, \\; y = r\\sin\\theta\\).  \n  - Spherical: \\(x = r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\; y = r\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\; z = r\\cos\\theta\\).\n\nSo: curvilinear coordinates are not new frames; they are new *labels* on the same frame.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Galilean Transformation = Change of Frame\n\nA Galilean transformation between inertial frames \\(S\\) and \\(S\u2032\\) is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{v}t, \\quad t' = t\n\\]\n\nThis is **affine linear** in \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), with time appearing explicitly.\n\n- It is not merely a \u201cchange of coordinates\u201d in the same space.  \n- It shifts the *origin in space as a function of time*, because the new frame is moving.  \n- But yes, geometrically, it can be thought of as a **linear (affine) automorphism** of Euclidean space-time (in the Newtonian sense).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Your Analogy to \u201cChange of Basis\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s overlap, but a subtle difference:\n\n- A **change of basis** in linear algebra (say, rotating axes) corresponds to a **linear coordinate transformation**:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{r}' = A \\mathbf{r}, \\quad A \\in GL(3,\\mathbb{R})\n  \\]\n  This is purely geometric, independent of dynamics, no time shift.\n\n- A **Galilean transformation** is broader: it\u2019s a change of basis **plus** a time-dependent translation of the origin:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{r}' = A\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{b}(t), \\quad \\mathbf{b}(t) = -\\mathbf{v}t\n  \\]\n\nSo strictly speaking, a Galilean transformation is not just a change of basis but an **affine transformation in Newtonian spacetime**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Putting It Together\n\n- **Curvilinear coordinates**: nonlinear re-labelings of a single frame. Locally they look like a smooth change of variables from Cartesian.  \n- **Change of basis**: linear re-labeling (rotation, scaling) within a single frame.  \n- **Galilean transformation**: affine linear transformation relating different inertial frames.  \n\nAll three live in the same hierarchy:  \n- Galilean \u2192 frame change  \n- Change of basis \u2192 coordinate choice within a frame (linear)  \n- Curvilinear \u2192 coordinate choice within a frame (nonlinear, but differentiable)\n\n---\n\n\u2705 So your statement is almost right:  \n- **Curvilinear coordinates** = local diffeomorphisms from Cartesian.  \n- **Galilean transformations** = not quite just a change of basis, but an **affine linear transformation of Newtonian spacetime** (linear in space + time-dependent translation).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **illustrate this explicitly** with an example, e.g. *Galilean transformation in polar coordinates*, showing the difference between a change of basis vs curvilinear mapping?

Why Fictitious Forces Appear  \n\n- In an inertial frame:  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}\n  \\]  \n  works without modification.  \n\n- In a non-inertial frame (accelerating or rotating):  \n  observers measure a different acceleration \\(\\mathbf{a}'\\).  \n  To preserve the form of Newton\u2019s 2nd law, they must invent an **extra force term**:  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{F}' = m\\mathbf{a}' = \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{fictitious}}\n  \\]\n\nThus fictitious forces are not due to physical interactions, but due to the observer\u2019s own accelerating coordinate system.  \n\n---\n\n# 2.

Rotating Frames (More Interesting)  \n\nNow suppose the frame rotates with angular velocity \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\).

Earth as a Non-Inertial Frame  \n\nAlthough we often approximate Earth as inertial, strictly speaking it\u2019s rotating:  \n- **Centrifugal force** slightly reduces effective gravity (strongest at equator).  \n- **Coriolis force** deflects wind and ocean currents, creating trade winds and cyclones.  \n- Engineers must account for Coriolis force in long-range artillery, missiles, or even GPS satellite corrections.  \n\n---\n\n# 5. Summary  \n\n- Fictitious forces arise in **non-inertial frames**.  \n- They are proportional to mass (like gravity), but they don\u2019t come from physical interactions.  \n- Key examples:  \n  - Translational acceleration \u2192 \\(-m\\mathbf{A}\\)  \n  - Centrifugal \u2192 outward \u201cpush\u201d  \n  - Coriolis \u2192 sideways deflection of moving bodies  \n  - Euler \u2192 during changing angular velocity  \n\nThey are indispensable for making sense of physics from the perspective of a non-inertial observer.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to now **illustrate Coriolis and centrifugal effects with actual equations of motion** (e.g. deflection of a falling body on Earth), or would you prefer we next pivot into **special relativity**, where inertial frames themselves take on a deeper meaning?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"979c956a4a4aaecd-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"3c6df584-c1d2-4147-97a4-b495086d83fa","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3c6df584-c1d2-4147-97a4-b495086d83fa","children":["df65c73f-9c8b-4e90-ad1a-ec0eacb029d7"]},"df65c73f-9c8b-4e90-ad1a-ec0eacb029d7":{"id":"df65c73f-9c8b-4e90-ad1a-ec0eacb029d7","message":{"id":"df65c73f-9c8b-4e90-ad1a-ec0eacb029d7","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756979647.144,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Illustrate Coriolis and centrifugal effects with actual equations of motion and explain why these have an actual impact on real world experiences (for example, Coriolis forces are needed to explain El Nino patterns)"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"979c9a8c2d70aecd-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7926b9e8-35a2-4e20-bd02-c6568ee743c2","children":["5fdf4cc2-ae85-4916-bd0e-9d40e17fe955"]},"5fdf4cc2-ae85-4916-bd0e-9d40e17fe955":{"id":"5fdf4cc2-ae85-4916-bd0e-9d40e17fe955","message":{"id":"5fdf4cc2-ae85-4916-bd0e-9d40e17fe955","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756979647.697442,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Excellent \u2014 let\u2019s make the fictitious forces very concrete with **equations of motion** and **real-world consequences**.  \n\n---\n\n# 1. Equations of Motion in a Rotating Frame  \n\nLet\u2019s set things up:  \n\n- Frame \\(S\\): inertial, fixed to the stars.  \n- Frame \\(S\u2032\\): rotating with angular velocity \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\) (think Earth).  \n- Position vector in rotating frame: \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\).  \n- Velocity in rotating frame: \\(\\mathbf{v}' = \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\).  \n\nThe acceleration observed in \\(S\u2032\\) is related to the true acceleration by:  \n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a}' = \\mathbf{a} - 2 \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}' - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}) - \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}} \\times \\mathbf{r}\n\\]  \n\nThus Newton\u2019s law in the rotating frame becomes:  \n\n\\[\nm\\mathbf{a}' = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{real}} + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{Euler}}\n\\]\n\nwith:  \n- Coriolis: \\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} = -2m\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}'\\)  \n- Centrifugal: \\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} = -m\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{r})\\)  \n- Euler: \\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{Euler}} = -m \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}} \\times \\mathbf{r}\\)  \n\n---\n\n# 2. Centrifugal Force on Earth  \n\nOn Earth, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\) is constant:  \n\\[\n|\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}| \\approx 7.29 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{rad/s}\n\\]  \n\nAt latitude \\(\\lambda\\), centrifugal acceleration is:  \n\\[\na_{\\text{centrifugal}} = \\Omega^2 R \\cos\\lambda\n\\]  \n\n- At equator (\\(\\lambda=0\\)): maximum \\(\\approx 0.034\\, \\text{m/s}^2\\).  \n- At poles: zero.  \n\n**Impact:**  \n- Effective gravity is reduced by ~0.3% at equator vs poles.  \n- Earth is not a perfect sphere \u2014 it bulges at the equator because of this.  \n- Engineers account for this in precise measurements (e.g., satellite orbits, surveying).  \n\n---\n\n# 3. Coriolis Force on Moving Objects  \n\nThe Coriolis force is velocity-dependent:  \n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} = -2m \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}'\n\\]  \n\nIn Earth coordinates:  \n- \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\) points northward along Earth\u2019s axis.  \n- If an object moves east-west or north-south, Coriolis deflects it sideways.  \n\n**Example: Object dropped from rest at height \\(h\\) at latitude \\(\\lambda\\).**  \n\n- In Earth\u2019s frame, vertical velocity grows: \\(v_y' = -gt\\).  \n- Coriolis force has horizontal component:  \n  \\[\n  a_x' = 2\\Omega v_y' \\sin\\lambda = -2\\Omega g t \\sin\\lambda\n  \\]  \n- Integrate twice: sideways displacement after falling time \\(T = \\sqrt{2h/g}\\):  \n  \\[\n  x(T) = -\\tfrac{2}{3} \\Omega g T^3 \\sin\\lambda\n  \\]  \n- At mid-latitudes (\\(\\lambda \\sim 45^\\circ\\)), dropping from 100 m gives sideways drift ~2 cm.  \n- Tiny for daily life, but measurable in experiments.  \n\n---\n\n# 4. Meteorology: Coriolis & Large-Scale Winds  \n\n- Air moving northward in the Northern Hemisphere is deflected eastward.  \n- This deflection shapes **trade winds**, **jet streams**, and **cyclones**.  \n- Without Coriolis, winds would just flow straight from high to low pressure.  \n- With Coriolis, they spiral \u2014 hurricanes rotate counterclockwise in the north, clockwise in the south.  \n\n**El Ni\u00f1o / La Ni\u00f1a:**  \n- These climate oscillations are driven by coupled ocean-atmosphere flows across the Pacific.  \n- Coriolis deflection influences equatorial currents and the Walker circulation.  \n- The buildup or relaxation of warm water in the eastern Pacific depends sensitively on these deflections.  \n\n---\n\n# 5. Real-World Engineering Impacts  \n\n- **Artillery / missiles:** Long-range trajectories must correct for Coriolis drift (kilometers of error otherwise).  \n- **Aviation:** Flight paths, especially polar routes, require corrections.  \n- **Satellite launches:** Equatorial launches benefit from maximum centrifugal + Earth\u2019s eastward rotation.  \n- **Civil engineering:** Precise geodesy and GPS corrections incorporate centrifugal effects.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Summary**:  \n- **Centrifugal**: changes effective gravity, shapes Earth\u2019s bulge.  \n- **Coriolis**: deflects moving bodies, essential in weather, climate, and navigation.  \n- Both are \u201cfictitious\u201d in that they vanish in an inertial frame, yet they have very *real observable consequences* because we live in a rotating non-inertial frame (Earth).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to now **demonstrate the mathematics of Coriolis in fluid dynamics** (e.g., why geostrophic balance explains trade winds), or would you prefer we next pivot toward **special relativity** and the deeper view of inertial frames?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"979c9a8c2d70aecd-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"df65c73f-9c8b-4e90-ad1a-ec0eacb029d7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"df65c73f-9c8b-4e90-ad1a-ec0eacb029d7","children":[]}}}
