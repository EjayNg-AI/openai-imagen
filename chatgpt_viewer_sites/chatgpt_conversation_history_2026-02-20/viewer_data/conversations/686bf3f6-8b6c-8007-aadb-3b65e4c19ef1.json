What Special Relativity (SR) Gives You\u2014and What It Leaves Out  \n| Aspect | Special Relativity |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| *Foundational postulates* | (i) The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames. (ii) The speed of light in vacuum is the same constant \\(c\\) for all observers. |\n| *Spacetime model* | Flat 4-D Minkowski spacetime with fixed metric \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}=\\mathrm{diag}(-1,1,1,1)\\). |\n| *Transformations* | Global Lorentz symmetry; coordinates related by linear Lorentz transformations. |\n| *Physics described* | Kinematics and dynamics of particles and fields **without gravity**. All observers are inertial or connected by boosts/rotations; accelerated frames are handled only locally by introducing fictitious forces. |\n\n**Limitations**  \n* Gravity must be treated as an external Newtonian potential\u2014an uneasy graft onto a fundamentally flat geometry.  \n* Accelerated observers and curved trajectories cannot be described globally without leaving the SR framework.  \n* No mechanism to explain why inertial mass equals gravitational mass; Newton\u2019s \u201caction-at-a-distance\u201d force remains conceptually separate from the fabric of spacetime.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Einstein\u2019s Bridge: How GR Extends SR  \n\n| Ingredient | How SR is \u201cpromoted\u201d in GR |\n|------------|---------------------------|\n| **Equivalence Principle** | Local experiments in a freely falling lab cannot distinguish uniform gravity from inertial motion. *Operational consequence*: at each spacetime point you can choose coordinates in which SR holds to first order. |\n| **Geometry** | Replace the fixed Minkowski metric \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\) with a *dynamical* metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\) on a 4-D pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Curvature \\(R^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\mu\\nu}\\neq 0\\) encodes gravitational effects. |\n| **Motion** | Free particles follow *geodesics* of \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) rather than straight lines. Their equation of motion generalises SR\u2019s \\(d^2x^\\mu/d\\tau^2=0\\) to \\(\\nabla_{u}u^\\mu=0\\). |\n| **Field equations** | Geometry is sourced by energy and momentum: \\[G_{\\mu\\nu}= \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4}\\,T_{\\mu\\nu},\\] where \\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the (non-linear) Einstein tensor. Gravity is no longer a force but the manifestation of spacetime curvature produced by matter-energy. |\n| **Symmetry** | Global Lorentz invariance is replaced by **general covariance**: the laws take tensor form valid in *any* coordinates, inertial or not. SR survives as the *local* tangent-space limit where \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\to\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\). |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Insights & Phenomena Unique to General Relativity  \n\n| Class of insight | Examples & Why SR can\u2019t supply them |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Gravitational time dilation & redshift** | Proper time between two events depends on gravitational potential: \\(\\Delta \\tau = \\Delta t\\,\\sqrt{1+2\\Phi/c^{2}}\\). Verified by atomic-clock tests and GPS. SR predicts only kinematic (velocity-based) time dilation. |\n| **Light deflection & gravitational lensing** | Curvature bends null geodesics. Multiple-image lensing, Einstein rings, weak-lensing shear maps underpin observational cosmology. SR\u2019s straight-line light propagation in flat space cannot account for the effect. |\n| **Perihelion precession of Mercury** | Extra \\(43''\\) per century arises from spacetime curvature near the Sun; Newtonian+SR corrections miss the full value. |\n| **Shapiro time delay** | Radar signals grazing a massive body take longer than SR\u2019s light-travel-time calculation due to curvature of both space *and* time. |\n| **Frame-dragging & geodetic precession** | Rotating masses twist spacetime (Lense\u2013Thirring effect). Confirmed by Gravity Probe B and LAGEOS. No analogue in SR. |\n| **Black holes & horizons** | Solutions like Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics reveal event horizons, singularities, and ergospheres. SR cannot generate trapped-surface geometry. |\n| **Gravitational waves** | Ripples \\(h_{\\mu\\nu}\\) in spacetime that propagate at \\(c\\), detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In SR, transverse metric perturbations can be gauged away because the background is fixed and flat. |\n| **Cosmology: expanding or contracting universes** | FLRW solutions show scale-factor dynamics \\(a(t)\\), leading to Big-Bang cosmology, cosmic microwave background, and dark-energy-driven acceleration. SR, with no dynamical metric, enforces an eternally static, flat spacetime. |\n| **Energy conditions & singularity theorems** | Hawking\u2013Penrose theorems link energy conditions to inevitable singularities under generic gravitational collapse or initial cosmological expansion. SR has no curvature to yield such global constraints. |\n| **Gravitational binding energy & global conservation issues** | In GR energy\u2013momentum is locally conserved (\\(\\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\)), but no unique global energy for the gravitational field exists except in special asymptotically flat cases\u2014revealing limits of our Newtonian intuition. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. What \u201cBuilds Upon\u201d Means Mathematically  \n\n1. **Local Flatness**: At any point \\(p\\) in a GR spacetime, choose Riemann normal coordinates so \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}(p)=\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and \\(\\partial_\\alpha g_{\\mu\\nu}(p)=0\\). Here SR holds to leading order\u2014showing SR is literally tangent-space physics.  \n2. **Curvature Tensors**: The failure of parallelogram closure encoded in \\(R^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\mu\\nu}\\) measures deviation from SR.  \n3. **Action Principle**: The Einstein\u2013Hilbert action \\(S=\\frac{c^{3}}{16\\pi G}\\int R\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^{4}x + S_{\\text{matter}}[g,\\Psi]\\) reduces to SR\u2019s free-field action when \\(R=0\\) and \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}=\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\).  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Forward-Looking Perspective  \n\n* **Beyond GR**: Singularities and the inability to accommodate quantum fields non-perturbatively signal the need for quantum gravity (loop gravity, string theory, asymptotic safety, etc.).  \n* **Modified-gravity proposals** seek to explain cosmic acceleration or dark-matter phenomena by altering \\(G_{\\mu\\nu}=8\\pi G T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) (e.g., \\(f(R)\\), scalar\u2013tensor, massive gravity).  \n* **Experimental frontier**: Pulsar timing arrays, next-gen GW detectors (Einstein Telescope, LISA) and precise satellite clocks probe the regime where post-Newtonian GR merges into the fully non-linear strong-field domain\u2014tests SR cannot meaningfully engage with.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Bottom Line  \n\n*Special Relativity is the local, flat-space limit of General Relativity.* GR inherits SR\u2019s Lorentz invariance **locally**, then elevates spacetime geometry to a dynamical, matter-coupled entity. This move unlocks an entire landscape of gravitational phenomena\u2014time dilation in a gravitational well, lensing of light, black holes, gravitational waves, and an evolving universe\u2014that SR\u2019s fixed flat spacetime cannot even formulate, much less predict.\n\nUnderstanding this ladder\u2014from inertial Minkowski patches to globally curved manifolds\u2014clarifies why SR remains indispensable in particle physics and local experiments, yet why GR is necessary for describing the structure, dynamics, and fate of the universe itself."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"fb82c74a-1ea4-407d-adc5-50a42270d452","request_id":"95b8ac543907f8d0-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"fb82c74a-1ea4-407d-adc5-50a42270d452","children":["0f8f493e-2436-425a-a0c0-a3a17c41db7a"]},"0f8f493e-2436-425a-a0c0-a3a17c41db7a":{"id":"0f8f493e-2436-425a-a0c0-a3a17c41db7a","message":{"id":"0f8f493e-2436-425a-a0c0-a3a17c41db7a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751905651.718,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What happens when we also promote the concept that the Planck energy is invariant for all observers?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95b8b5b34e19f8d0-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"70cf42f3-8b93-4269-8ee8-9840ce6f2fd5","children":["007ebe1f-9338-4aab-b138-e40b166796aa"]},"007ebe1f-9338-4aab-b138-e40b166796aa":{"id":"007ebe1f-9338-4aab-b138-e40b166796aa","message":{"id":"007ebe1f-9338-4aab-b138-e40b166796aa","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751905663.968424,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring Planck energy invariance","content":"The user is likely referring to doubly special relativity (DSR) or related theories like Rainbow Gravity, where the Planck energy (and possibly the Planck length) becomes invariant for all observers.

Coupling to gravity: \u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d  \n\nMagueijo & Smolin\u2019s **gravity\u2019s rainbow** extends DSR to curved spacetime by making the metric energy-dependent, \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}(E)=g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\Xi(E/E_{\\text{P}})\\) \ue200cite\ue202turn5academia10\ue201.  Consequences being explored include:\n\n* Energy-dependent horizons and Hawking temperature of black holes.  \n* Early-universe cosmology with modified Friedmann equations that can soften the horizon problem.  \n* Compact-star structure where Planck-scale corrections slightly shift maximum masses \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue201.\n\nConsistency with the equivalence principle remains delicate; most proposals apply DSR only in freely-falling local frames and let curvature dominate on larger scales.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What *doesn\u2019t* change?  \n\n* **Low-energy limit**: For \\(E\\!\\ll\\!E_{\\text{P}}\\) the deformed algebra linearises and SR/GR is recovered.  \n* **General covariance** survives locally; deformations live in the momentum-space sector.  \n* **Quantum-field construction** is largely undeveloped; a fully interacting DSR-covariant QFT has yet to emerge.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Experimental outlook  \n\n* **Time-of-flight tests** from bright transients (GRB 221009A, GRB 190114C) already bound linear Planck-scale dispersion at or above \\(E_{\\text{P}}\\) and will keep improving with CTA and LHAASO-KM2A upgrades \ue200cite\ue202turn6search3\ue201.  \n* **High-statistics cosmic-ray spectra** and **neutrino telescopes** may reveal suppressed threshold anomalies.  \n* **Laboratory tests** (optical cavities, cold-atom interferometry) aim at quadratic-order effects but are orders of magnitude away from sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Bottom line  \n\nPromoting the Planck energy to a second invariant **preserves Einstein\u2019s relativity principle** yet forces spacetime\u2013momentum geometry to become nonlinear.  The resulting DSR frameworks yield tantalising hints\u2014curved momentum space, minimal length, relative locality\u2014but so far **no confirmed deviation from SR/GR**.  Current astrophysical limits already probe, and in some cases exceed, the na\u00efve Planck scale for linear effects, pushing viable DSR phenomenology into more subtle (quadratic or higher-order) regimes.  Whether these deformations are the low-energy fingerprints of quantum gravity or mere mathematical curiosities remains one of the most active frontiers in fundamental physics."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201","start_idx":438,"end_idx":457,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_special_relativity?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_special_relativity?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Doubly special relativity","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_special_relativity?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1742463611.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":1050,"end_idx":1067,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/html/2506.08111v1"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.08111v1))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"DSR-relativistic spacetime picture and the phenomenology of Planck-scale-modified time dilation","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2506.08111v1","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arxiv.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201","start_idx":1202,"end_idx":1221,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16721?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16721?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] arXiv:2403.16721v1 [gr-qc] 25 Mar 2024","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16721?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1711324800.0,"snippet":"Section II is devoted to a summary of relevant 3D-quantum-gravity results and results on the relative-locality momentum space which admits \u03ba ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arxiv.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201","start_idx":1381,"end_idx":1400,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_locality?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_locality?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Relative locality","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_locality?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1719627506.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6search2\ue202turn6search0\ue201","start_idx":2054,"end_idx":2086,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14295?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.L081501?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([link.aps.org](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.L081501?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14295?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Lorentz invariance violation limits from GRB 221009A | Phys.

Why look at DSR in cosmology?\n\nEarly-universe puzzles that remain at least partly unexplained in vanilla GR + Standard Model include  \n\n* the **horizon** and **flatness** problems,  \n* the **initial singularity**,  \n* the **trans-Planckian problem** (modes we observe today began with sub-Planckian wavelength),  \n* CMB anomalies (e.g. power suppression at large scales, hemispherical asymmetry), and  \n* emerging tensions such as the **H\u2080 discrepancy**.\n\nAll of these involve physics near (or conceptually beyond) the Planck scale, precisely where DSR modifies kinematics by adding an invariant energy \\(E_{\\rm P}\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. DSR mechanisms that feed into early-universe dynamics  \n\n| DSR ingredient | Cosmological channel | Key idea |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------|\n| **Energy-dependent speed of light** \\(c(E)\\) | \u201cVarying-\\(c\\)\u201d or *rainbow* cosmologies | At very high energies \\(v_\\gamma \\!>\\! c_0\\) lets widely separated regions thermalise without inflation, addressing the horizon and flatness problems. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201 |\n| **Modified dispersion relations (MDRs)** \\(E^2 - p^2 + f(E/E_{\\rm P}) = m^2\\) | Trans-Planckian initial conditions & primordial spectra | MDRs alter the vacuum fluctuations that seed structure; scale-invariant spectra can arise without slow-roll inflation or imprint oscillatory features in the power spectrum. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201 |\n| **Curved momentum space / \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 algebra** | \u201cRelative locality\u201d at large distances | Different observers disagree on event coincidence; in expanding spacetime this can change how we interpret CMB anisotropies from super-horizon modes. |\n| **Gravity\u2019s Rainbow / energy-dependent metric** \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}(E)\\) | Modified Friedmann equations & bounces | Quantum-gravity corrections act as an effective, density-dependent cosmological constant, yielding non-singular big-bounce solutions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Concrete proposals & what they claim to solve  \n\n### 3.1 VSL / Rainbow solutions to the horizon & flatness problems  \n* **How it works** \u2013 For \\(E\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}E_{\\rm P}\\) the photon speed can scale as \\(c(E)\\!\\sim\\!E/E_{\\rm P}\\). In the first \\(10^{-35}\\,\\text{s}\\) causal horizons grow much faster than the scale factor, bringing the CMB surface into causal contact without requiring \\(60\\) e-folds of inflation.  \n* **Status** \u2013 Consistency with BBN and CMB acoustic peaks forces the high-energy phase to end well before \\(T\\!\\sim\\!1\\,\\text{MeV}\\). Current bounds admit a window but leave little room for large linear corrections in \\(c(E)\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n\n### 3.2 MDRs & the primordial power spectrum  \n* MDRs modify the mode-function initial conditions (\u201c\\(\\alpha\\)-vacua\u201d); depending on the sign of the leading correction \\(f(E/E_{\\rm P})\\) one obtains small oscillations or a suppression of power at \\(k\\!\\lesssim\\!0.002\\,\\text{Mpc}^{-1}\\). Planck 2018 + ACT still allow \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) amplitudes for oscillatory features with period \\(\\Delta k/k\\!\\sim\\!10^{-2}\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n* A growing literature links MDRs to the **Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC)**: a built-in \\(E_{\\rm P}\\) cutoff ensures no sub-Planckian mode ever stretches outside the Hubble radius, potentially rescuing high-scale inflation from TCC bounds. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n### 3.3 Bounce cosmologies from \u03ba-deformation or Rainbow gravity  \n* Modified Friedmann equations acquire a positive \\(E_{\\rm P}^{-2}\\rho^{2}\\) term that halts collapse at \\(\\rho\\sim\\rho_{\\rm P}\\) and triggers a bounce. Recent f(R)-Rainbow models show the conserved Noether charge plays the role of an effective cosmological constant, smoothing the singularity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n* Such bounces leave characteristic \u201cringing\u201d in the scalar and tensor spectra at \\(k\\!\\gtrsim\\!0.05\\,\\text{Mpc}^{-1}\\), currently just below LiteBIRD\u2019s projected sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Observational constraints & open issues  \n\n| Observable | Present limit | What would support / falsify a DSR signal? |\n|------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **CMB time-of-flight (energy-dependent \\(c\\))** | No energy-dependent phase delay between low-\u2113 and high-\u2113 CMB photons; bounds \\(|\\eta_{(1)}| \\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-15}\\) for linear MDR. | A systematic multipole-dependent phase shift would point toward DSR-style VSL. |\n| **GRB / TeV blazar lags** | Fermi-LAT & LHAASO constrain linear MDR coefficient to \\(|\\eta_{(1)}|\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-16}\\). | Detection of a redshift-induced, sign-consistent lag across multiple bursts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 |\n| **Scalar-index running / oscillations** | Planck-2024 data mildly prefer a small negative running; DSR oscillatory templates are neither ruled out nor favoured. | High-resolution CMB polarisation (LiteBIRD, CMB-S4) measuring coherent oscillations. |\n| **Bounce imprints in \\(r(k)\\)** | Current tensor-to-scalar ratio \\(r<0.035\\) at \\(k=0.05\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). | A scale-dependent \\(r\\) rising at high \\(k\\) but suppressed at low \\(k\\) would match Rainbow-bounce predictions. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Unresolved theoretical hurdles  \n\n* **\u201cSoccer-ball\u201d problem** \u2013 how macroscopic energy\u2013momentum sums reduce to standard additivity so BBN and late-time cosmology are unaffected.  \n* **Coupling to full GR** \u2013 a complete, background-independent formulation that reproduces DSR locally but allows curved spacetime globally is still incomplete.  \n* **Interacting Quantum Field Theory** in \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 space remains under construction, making precision predictions\u2014especially for non-Gaussianity\u2014difficult.  \n* **Parameter degeneracy** \u2013 many DSR signatures (e.g. slight power suppression) can also arise from features in the inflaton potential or early-dark-energy models; disentangling them requires high-precision, multi-probe data.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Forward-looking agenda  \n\n1. **CMB-pol & spectral-distortion missions** (LiteBIRD, PIXIE) will test oscillatory or running signatures predicted by MDRs down to parts-in-10\u2074.  \n2. **Next-generation GRB detectors** (CT\u200bA, THESEUS) could tighten linear MDR limits by two orders of magnitude, pushing viable DSR models toward quadratic corrections.  \n3. **21-cm tomography** of the dark ages provides a clean laboratory for trans-Planckian imprints that inflation might erase but DSR VSL scenarios would preserve.  \n4. **Theoretical priority** \u2013 build a self-consistent DSR-covariant scalar-tensor sector to compute non-Gaussian statistics and compare to upcoming \u03bc-distortion measurements.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nDSR supplies a **conceptual toolkit**\u2014Planck-invariant kinematics, curved momentum space, energy-dependent metrics\u2014that can *in principle* address several open problems of the very early universe. It offers concrete alternatives to inflation for horizon/flatness, mechanisms for singularity resolution, and distinctive imprints on primordial perturbations. **But every claimed success comes with model-building caveats, and present data already exclude the simplest, most dramatic DSR signatures.** The next decade of CMB polarisation, spectral-distortion, and high-energy transient astronomy will decisively test the more subtle predictions that remain viable."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":1243,"end_idx":1262,"safe_urls":["https://pirsa.org/s004?page=45&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([pirsa.org](https://pirsa.org/s004?page=45&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Cosmology and Gravitation - PIRSA","url":"https://pirsa.org/s004?page=45&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"However the simplest realizations result from bimetric theories and deformed dispersion relations and DSR.
