Faced with up to 100 bills to fund, traditional one-person-one-vote systems were deemed inefficient for capturing caucus members' priorities. Quadratic voting, introduced by economist Glen Weyl, assigns a cost to votes, increasing quadratically, to compel voters to express the intensity of their preferences honestly. In this system, voters could cast multiple votes on bills they cared most about but at an escalating cost, intended to balance strong preferences without dominance by well-funded interests. Using 100 virtual tokens instead of actual dollars, House Democrats effectively used this method to highlight top priorities, with the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act emerging as the leading bill. This test suggests the potential for quadratic voting to refine democratic processes by enabling more nuanced expression of voter preference and addressing issues of majority dominance and disproportionate influence.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1555412400.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68679cec2980800793b8f39e2f7be3db","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"3badbb46-07df-4167-8ede-790fca0df1b7","request_id":"959d8bfc9e00ce33-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3badbb46-07df-4167-8ede-790fca0df1b7","children":["2af59747-1816-422c-b400-7d147354b610"]},"2af59747-1816-422c-b400-7d147354b610":{"id":"2af59747-1816-422c-b400-7d147354b610","message":{"id":"2af59747-1816-422c-b400-7d147354b610","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751620851.925228,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring governance via DAOs","content":"In the context of blockchain-based DAOs, on-chain governance uses smart contracts that incentivize delegates with tokens that can be slashed if policies fail.

None of them is a silver bullet, but each tries\u2014through design rather than mere exhortation\u2014to *make doing the right thing the rational strategy for office-holders*.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Contractual\u2010Mandate Representation  \n**Core idea.**  Candidates run on a *formally binding platform* (often called a *mandate*).  Once elected, deviating from those promises automatically triggers penalties: forfeiture of salary, instantaneous recall, or legal damages.\n\n*Historic precedents*  \n*  **Imperative mandates** in parts of the French Revolution and early Soviet councils were attempts to let local assemblies recall deputies who strayed from instructions.  \n*  **Modern proposals** sometimes tie ministers\u2019 pay to macro-indicators (median real wage growth, Gini coefficient, carbon-budget compliance).  \n\n**Strengths** \u2013 Creates an explicit *principal-agent contract*.  \n**Weaknesses** \u2013  Difficult to draft metrics that cannot be gamed; rigid mandates hamper crisis flexibility; may incentivise short-term optics over long-term welfare.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sortition (Lottocracy) with Accountability Layers  \n**Core idea.**  Replace or complement elections with **randomly selected citizens\u2019 assemblies**.  Because members cannot *campaign* or be *re-elected*, they lack incentives to court donors or factions, and (statistically) mirror the population\u2019s interests.\n\nModern theorists add:  \n\n1. **Rotation & term limits** (prevent entrenchment).  \n2. **Deliberative scaffolding** (professional facilitation, expert testimony).  \n3. **Post-hoc auditing** (citizen juries grade assembly decisions; poor grades bar future public appointments).\n\nRecent work shows that sortition needs *its own* accountability checks to avoid complacency or capture by facilitators \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Quadratic Voting & Quadratic Funding  \n**Core idea.**  Give every citizen an equal budget of \u201cvoice credits.\u201d  Casting *k* votes for or against a measure costs *k\u00b2* credits.  The rising marginal cost forces voters (and delegated legislators) to reveal *intensity*, not just direction, of preference.  In theory that maximises aggregate welfare in public-goods problems.  \n\n*Proof-of-concept.*  Colorado\u2019s House Democratic caucus used QV in 2019 to set budget priorities; participants reported that high-intensity but minority priorities surfaced without log-rolling \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0news29\ue201.\n\n**How it \u201cforces\u201d the common good.**  Buying lopsided vote blocks quickly exhausts credits, so self-interested over-investment is self-penalising.  Strategic coalitions must **pay the true social cost** of dominating an agenda.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Futarchy (Vote on Values, Bet on Beliefs)  \n**Designer.** Robin Hanson (2000s).\n\n**Mechanism.**  \n\n1. **Elect** representatives only to define a clear, auditable *national welfare metric* (e.g., inflation-adjusted median income, health-adjusted life expectancy).  \n2. **Open prediction markets** for every policy proposal: \u201cIf policy X is adopted, what is the expected value of the welfare metric in, say, 2028?\u201d  \n3. **Implement the policy** whose market price implies the highest expected welfare.  Traders who guess wrong lose money; those who forecast genuine improvements profit \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n**Why it aligns incentives.**  \n* Politicians cannot cherry-pick evidence\u2014markets aggregate distributed knowledge.  \n* Speculators are literally *paid* to seek the policy that maximises the agreed-upon \u201ccommon good\u201d metric.  \n* Representatives focus on *defining* the metric (the value judgement), not on technocratic detail.\n\n**Objections.**  Metric selection may itself be politicised; markets could be thin or manipulable during crises; some goods (e.g., civil liberties) are hard to monetise.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Liquid or Delegative Democracy with Instant Recall  \nCitizens can either vote directly or *delegate* their vote to a proxy who can, in turn, redelegate, forming fluid trust networks.  Because delegation is **revocable at any moment**, proxies (de facto legislators) must continuously please their constituents or lose voting power.  Several blockchain-based \u201cDAO\u201d constitutions now implement this with smart-contract-governed token voting; slashing or freezing a delegate\u2019s tokens if they breach stated policy preferences is technically feasible.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Smart-Contract Pay & \u201cSkin-in-the-Game\u201d Mechanisms  \nDrawing on principal-agent theory, some researchers propose that salaries, pensions, or even a stake in a *national sovereign wealth fund* for legislators be **escrowed** and paid out only if predefined, ex-post social indicators beat a baseline.

Faced with up to 100 bills to fund, traditional one-person-one-vote systems were deemed inefficient for capturing caucus members' priorities. Quadratic voting, introduced by economist Glen Weyl, assigns a cost to votes, increasing quadratically, to compel voters to express the intensity of their preferences honestly. In this system, voters could cast multiple votes on bills they cared most about but at an escalating cost, intended to balance strong preferences without dominance by well-funded interests. Using 100 virtual tokens instead of actual dollars, House Democrats effectively used this method to highlight top priorities, with the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act emerging as the leading bill. This test suggests the potential for quadratic voting to refine democratic processes by enabling more nuanced expression of voter preference and addressing issues of majority dominance and disproportionate influence.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"wired.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":3471,"end_idx":3503,"safe_urls":["https://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-deep-dive-into-futarchy-what-national-governments-and-private-organisations-can-learn-from-a-9408aa2fb887?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([hanson.gmu.edu](https://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [medium.com](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-deep-dive-into-futarchy-what-national-governments-and-private-organisations-can-learn-from-a-9408aa2fb887?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Futarchy: Vote Values, But Bet Beliefs - Robin Hanson","url":"https://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"This short manifesto describes a new form of government.

The amendment banned abortions unless the mother's life was at risk, even in cases of rape, incest, or fatal fetal abnormalities. Early exit polls indicated a victory for those advocating for the repeal, and the official results confirmed it, with 66.4% voting in favor and 33.6% against. This historic decision will allow Ireland to reform its abortion laws and provide women with much-needed access to reproductive healthcare. The campaign for repeal was significantly influenced by the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, who died from a septic miscarriage after being denied an abortion.

The Demos think-tank, in collaboration with Involve, suggests implementing more participatory methods, including panels, assemblies, and juries. These would involve representative groups of citizens in the policy-making process, aiming to enhance trust and incorporate diverse experiences and perspectives into governance. The long-term goal is for the government to change its approach, moving from a top-down governance model to one inclusive of ordinary citizens' input. This could result in better-informed decisions and increased public trust in the political system.

This transformation began when students and civil society groups occupied Parliament in protest of a trade deal with Beijing. The government later invited some protesters to mentor ministers and others to become participation officers. The key was integrating technology-based methods, like the open-source tool Polis, to engage citizens in policy-making. As a result, trust in the government soared above 70%. This approach emphasizes the importance of mutual trust between the state and citizens, a lesson that other nations, such as the UK, can learn from.
