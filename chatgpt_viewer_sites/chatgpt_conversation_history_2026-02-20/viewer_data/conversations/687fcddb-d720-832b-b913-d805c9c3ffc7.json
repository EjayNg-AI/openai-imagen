At 74 years old, Greenspan\u2019s cautious decision-making is explored against the backdrop of rising interest rates, a move met with skepticism on Capitol Hill and in the media. Despite criticism and calls for his resignation, Greenspan remains resilient, emphasizing a career marked by intellectual rigor and an understanding of economic principles formed under influences like Ayn Rand. The article traces his background from a New York upbringing, a stint as a musician, and a shift into economics at NYU. His tenure at the Federal Reserve is highlighted by his efforts to balance economic growth with inflation control, underscoring his pragmatic rather than ideological approach. Greenspan's personal life, including his marriage to Andrea Mitchell, and his intimate knowledge of the American economy, are detailed, showcasing a man deeply ingrained in the complexities of national financial stewardship as he faces the challenges of a booming economy and potential speculative excesses in the stock market.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":955929600.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gq.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gq.com/story/ayn-rand-dick-books-fountainhead","title":"The Bitch is Back","snippet":"The article \"The Bitch is Back\" reflects on the intense experience and transformations that readers, especially college students, undergo when they first read the works of Ayn Rand, particularly \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged.\" It criticizes the fervent idolization of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, focusing on reason, individualism, and unfettered capitalism, which often grips young intellects during a vulnerable phase, transforming some into what the author dubs \"Ayn Rand Assholes\" (ARA).

These ARAs are marked by a dogmatic and superior attitude, often carrying their Randian beliefs into influential positions in society, contributing to anti-regulation and libertarian policies that have had significant economic implications.

Rand humorously comments on soda cans, jokes about Rearden Metal from her book \"Atlas Shrugged,\" and shares her fond memories of Phil Donahue. She expressed strong support for capitalistic values and predicted that her influence would grow, with a new generation embracing her philosophies by 2013. Her writing style mixed personal anecdotes, philosophical assertions, and sharp critiques, often integrated with humor.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1374465600.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_687fce18ccac8007987ac4168191c5d3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"9634bf858f0ba24f-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"b339f13b-9c61-46fe-b171-b506183fe66b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b339f13b-9c61-46fe-b171-b506183fe66b","children":["f03ac6af-c3fd-40ea-8ab8-a99db7464d06"]},"f03ac6af-c3fd-40ea-8ab8-a99db7464d06":{"id":"f03ac6af-c3fd-40ea-8ab8-a99db7464d06","message":{"id":"f03ac6af-c3fd-40ea-8ab8-a99db7464d06","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753206341.940524,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"search_query\": [\n    {\n      \"q\": \"\\\"your mother and your wife\\\" Ayn Rand\\\"\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"\"your mother and your wife\" Ayn Rand\""}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","request_id":"9634bf858f0ba24f-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"f5b7ec02-096f-42bb-a7f9-730b8eac28ea","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"f5b7ec02-096f-42bb-a7f9-730b8eac28ea","children":["770d1e4e-45a6-430a-ac18-993dff40a42a"]},"770d1e4e-45a6-430a-ac18-993dff40a42a":{"id":"770d1e4e-45a6-430a-ac18-993dff40a42a","message":{"id":"770d1e4e-45a6-430a-ac18-993dff40a42a","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1753206347.703412,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.drkenner.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.drkenner.com/relationships/210918b","title":"The Rational Basis\u00ae of Happiness Podcast - Dr. Ellen Kenner","snippet":"You shouldn't have to choose between your mother and your wife.

Known for her 1957 novel \"Atlas Shrugged\" and its influential Objectivist philosophy, Rand believed in individual self-interest as man's highest ethical ideal. Despite a small dedicated following, her philosophy gains renewed attention during times of perceived government overreach. Rand's works face criticism, with \"Atlas Shrugged\" criticized for verbosity and stylistic flaws. The rise in her book's sales reflects a societal backlash against socialism, promoted by figures like Glenn Beck. Two new biographies, Anne C. Heller\u2019s \"Ayn Rand and the World She Made\" and Jennifer Burns's \"Goddess of the Market,\" provide fresh perspectives on her life and influence. Rand's fierce individualism has left a lasting impact on American culture, inspiring various modern entrepreneurs while her works remain a contentious topic due to her polarizing views and personal austerity.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1257134400.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gq.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gq.com/story/ayn-rand-dick-books-fountainhead","title":"The Bitch is Back","snippet":"The article \"The Bitch is Back\" reflects on the intense experience and transformations that readers, especially college students, undergo when they first read the works of Ayn Rand, particularly \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged.\" It criticizes the fervent idolization of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, focusing on reason, individualism, and unfettered capitalism, which often grips young intellects during a vulnerable phase, transforming some into what the author dubs \"Ayn Rand Assholes\" (ARA). These ARAs are marked by a dogmatic and superior attitude, often carrying their Randian beliefs into influential positions in society, contributing to anti-regulation and libertarian policies that have had significant economic implications. The piece critiques the unyielding certainty and lack of subtlety in Rand's writing and her followers, ultimately blaming Rand for a negative cultural and economic impact.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1256806800.0,"attribution":"www.gq.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_687fce18ccac8007987ac4168191c5d3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"9634bf858f0ba24f-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"f03ac6af-c3fd-40ea-8ab8-a99db7464d06","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f03ac6af-c3fd-40ea-8ab8-a99db7464d06","children":["c23f50f6-1eec-42d1-9a6c-a65201fa9c45"]},"c23f50f6-1eec-42d1-9a6c-a65201fa9c45":{"id":"c23f50f6-1eec-42d1-9a6c-a65201fa9c45","message":{"id":"c23f50f6-1eec-42d1-9a6c-a65201fa9c45","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753206350.228274,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"search_query\": [\n    {\n      \"q\": \"\\\"If your mother and your wife were both drowning\\\" objectivism\\\"\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"\"If your mother and your wife were both drowning\" objectivism\""}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","request_id":"9634bf858f0ba24f-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"770d1e4e-45a6-430a-ac18-993dff40a42a","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"770d1e4e-45a6-430a-ac18-993dff40a42a","children":["bc5a3ade-3f5f-4fad-8ae0-fc00cb6109a6"]},"bc5a3ade-3f5f-4fad-8ae0-fc00cb6109a6":{"id":"bc5a3ade-3f5f-4fad-8ae0-fc00cb6109a6","message":{"id":"bc5a3ade-3f5f-4fad-8ae0-fc00cb6109a6","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1753206356.6922042,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"forum.objectivismonline.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://forum.objectivismonline.com/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F42869-saving-your-child-in-a-drowning-train-moral-or-altruistic%2F=","title":"SAVING YOUR CHILD IN A DROWNING TRAIN: MORAL OR ...","snippet":"The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics\u2014the standard by which one judges what is good or evil\u2014is man's life, or: that which is required ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1691107200.0,"attribution":"forum.objectivismonline.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reddit.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1l4pcj5/will_you_save_your_mother_or_your_wife/","title":"Will you save your mother or your wife? : r/hypotheticalsituation","snippet":"Consider both your mother and your spouse are drowning, but sadly you can only save ONE, would you choose to save your mother or your spouse?","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749168000.0,"attribution":"www.reddit.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"philosophy.stackexchange.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/22404/how-does-objectivism-see-altruism-during-an-accident","title":"ayn rand - How does objectivism see altruism during an accident?","snippet":"Depends on the relationship you have with the person drowning and your skill to swim.

Published 75 years ago, on May 7, 1943, it was shaped by the historical context of World War II and Rand's opposition to collectivist ideologies. Rand, an immigrant from the Soviet Union who became critical of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, initially wrote the book as a meditation on popularity but evolved it into a political statement addressing the dangers of collectivism and the growing influence of the state. The novel gained popularity through word-of-mouth, even during times of paper rationing, and a subsequent film adaptation. Its influence persisted as it spoke to postwar concerns about mass conformity and inspired conservative and libertarian thought, particularly during times of political upheaval such as the 1960s and 1970s. Rand's work continues to resonate, with figures like Paul Ryan and President Trump citing her influence, and her ideas permeating modern conservative discourse and Silicon Valley entrepreneurship.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1525700737.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newyorker.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/09/possessed-3","title":"Possessed","snippet":"Ayn Rand, notable for her strong beliefs against government-delivered services, is the only American on national postage stamps with such views.

The article traces his background from a New York upbringing, a stint as a musician, and a shift into economics at NYU. His tenure at the Federal Reserve is highlighted by his efforts to balance economic growth with inflation control, underscoring his pragmatic rather than ideological approach.

Jahrhunderts. Geboren 1905 in Russland, floh sie vor dem sozialistischen Regime und lie\u00df sich in den USA nieder, wo sie als Drehbuchautorin und Romanautorin arbeitete. Ihr bekanntestes Werk ist \"The Fountainhead\" (1943), das den rationalen Egoismus thematisiert, indem es die Geschichte des unabh\u00e4ngigen Architekten Howard Roark erz\u00e4hlt. Rands Philosophie basiert auf Individualismus und Kreativit\u00e4t und ist besonders im technologieorientierten Silicon Valley beliebt. Sie kritisierte Kollektivismus und setzte Vertrauen in die sch\u00f6pferische Macht des Einzelnen. Trotz ihrer kontroversen Ansichten \u00fcber Egoismus und Feminismus, verteidigte sie stets das individuelle Recht auf Freiheit und Selbstbestimmung. Rands Ideen bieten einen liberalen Gegenpol zu kollektivistischen Ans\u00e4tzen und bleiben auch Jahrzehnte nach ihrem Tod relevant.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1668436652.0,"attribution":"www.welt.de"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newyorker.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/09/possessed-3","title":"Possessed","snippet":"Ayn Rand, notable for her strong beliefs against government-delivered services, is the only American on national postage stamps with such views. Known for her 1957 novel \"Atlas Shrugged\" and its influential Objectivist philosophy, Rand believed in individual self-interest as man's highest ethical ideal. Despite a small dedicated following, her philosophy gains renewed attention during times of perceived government overreach. Rand's works face criticism, with \"Atlas Shrugged\" criticized for verbosity and stylistic flaws. The rise in her book's sales reflects a societal backlash against socialism, promoted by figures like Glenn Beck. Two new biographies, Anne C. Heller\u2019s \"Ayn Rand and the World She Made\" and Jennifer Burns's \"Goddess of the Market,\" provide fresh perspectives on her life and influence. Rand's fierce individualism has left a lasting impact on American culture, inspiring various modern entrepreneurs while her works remain a contentious topic due to her polarizing views and personal austerity.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1257134400.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_687fce18ccac8007987ac4168191c5d3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"9634bf858f0ba24f-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"d8f3e325-4625-424c-b70b-8375fd6b0798","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d8f3e325-4625-424c-b70b-8375fd6b0798","children":["43bbc2aa-b811-42b3-9c38-4ed21af18efc"]},"43bbc2aa-b811-42b3-9c38-4ed21af18efc":{"id":"43bbc2aa-b811-42b3-9c38-4ed21af18efc","message":{"id":"43bbc2aa-b811-42b3-9c38-4ed21af18efc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753206415.63978,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking for the 1979 Q&A","content":"It looks like I might have to search for Q&A from the 1979 Phil Donahue show, since that might be where Ayn Rand was asked about saving her wife or mother in a drowning situation.

Chait critiques Objectivism as a vulgar reversal of Marxism, where only the rich contribute value while others are deemed parasites. Rand\u2019s novels, such as \"Atlas Shrugged,\" exhibited stark ideological parallels to Social Realism with flat, didactic characters. The piece also compares Rand\u2019s cultish following to a Soviet-like state, illustrating how dissenters like Nathaniel Branden faced excommunication and loyalty oaths.
