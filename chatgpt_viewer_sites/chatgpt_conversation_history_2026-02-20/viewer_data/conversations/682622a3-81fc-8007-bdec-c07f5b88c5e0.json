Ground Rules (Tonight)\n\n| Task | Why | Effort | Deadline |\n|------|-----|--------|-----------|\n| Collect all assets: landing-page URL, logo, 2 hero images, headline variants, phone/WhatsApp number, parent testimonials. | Avoid production delays during ad setup. | 1 hr | **Tonight** |\n| Confirm payment method in Google Ads & billing country = Singapore. | Ads won\u2019t serve without it. | 5 min | Tonight |\n| Decide one primary conversion event (e.g. \u201cEnquiry Form Submit\u201d or \u201cWhatsApp Click\u201d). | Needed for smart bidding later. | 15 min | Tonight |\n\n---\n\n### 1. Day 1 (Fri 16 May)\n\n1. **Account & Tracking**\n   - If you already run Search ads, reuse the same Google Ads account; otherwise create a new one, link to existing Google Analytics 4 property (or set up GA4 quick config).  \n   - In GA4 > Admin > Data Streams > Web \u25ba enable \u201cEnhanced Measurement\u201d, then mark the form-submit URL as a conversion.  \n   - Import the conversion into Google Ads (Tools \u2699\ufe0f > Conversions).\n\n2. **Campaign Skeleton (Search-only)**\n   | Setting | Value |\n   |---------|-------|\n   | Campaign type | *Search* |\n   | Goal | Website traffic + imported conversion |\n   | Locations | **Singapore** (nationwide) |\n   | Languages | English |\n   | Ad schedule | 7 am-11 pm SGT (parents typically browse before work & after 8 pm) |\n   | Bidding | Manual CPC for first three days \u2192 switch to Max Conversions once \u226520 conversions recorded |\n   | Budget | Start **S$40/day** (\u2248S$1.2 k over 3 weeks). Adjust up or down after CPC data. |\n\n3. **Ad Groups**  \n   - Keep it ultra-simple: **one** ad group called `MathBootcamp` with tightly themed keywords.  \n   - Match types (use phrase/exact; no broad yet):\n     ```\n     \"math bootcamp\"\n     \"o level math revision\"\n     \"secondary math june holiday\"\n     \"emath crash course\"\n     \"a math intensive\"\n     [math tuition bootcamp]\n     [psle math camp]\n     ```\n   - Negative keywords (campaign-level): `free`, `jobs`, `answers`, `MOOC`, `university`, `pdf`.\n\n4. **Responsive Search Ads (3 ads, same ad group)**\n   | Element | Guidance |\n   |---------|----------|\n   | Headlines (max 15) | Mix: `June Maths Bootcamp`, `Sec 3 & Sec 4 A-Math`, `S$175 Early-Bird Ends 20 May`, `Master Exam Techniques`, `Small-Group Coaching`, `Limited Seats SG`, `Call Now +65 XXXX XXXX`. |\n   | Descriptions (max 4) | 90 chars: pain-solution-urgency.

Day 2-3 (Sat-Sun 17-18 May)\n\n| Task | How | Result |\n|------|-----|--------|\n| **Ad Review:** submit by Saturday AM; Google usually approves within 24 h. | Check policy compliance (no exaggerated claims like \u201cGuaranteed A+\u201d). | Ads live by Sun. |\n| **QA Landing Page:** test on mobile; load speed \u22643 s. Use PageSpeed Insights quick fixes (compress hero image, defer unused JS). | Prevent bounce & Quality Score penalties. |\n| **Conversion-Test:** perform a dummy form submission; verify it shows in Google Ads under *Conversions* (status \u201cRecording\u201d). | Ensures data for bidding. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Week 1 Optimisation (Mon-Wed 19-21 May)\n\n1. **Hour-Zero Checks (first 24 h)**\n   - Pause any keyword with CPC > S$5 and **no** impressions (quality issue).\n   - If CTR < 3 %, tweak headlines: front-load \u201cJune Maths Bootcamp\u201d.\n\n2. **Switch to Smart Bidding**  \n   - Once you have **\u226520 conversions or \u2265400 clicks**, change bid strategy to *Maximise Conversions* with a cap of S$6 target CPC.\n\n3. **Add Search Terms as Keywords**  \n   - Pull *Search Terms* report; add converting queries as exact match; add irrelevant queries as negatives.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Week 2 (Thu-Sun 22-25 May)\n\n| Action | Goal |\n|--------|------|\n| **Geo Bid Adjustments:** If you see clusters (e.g. East vs. West), add location bid modifiers (+10 % for high-ROI areas). |\n| **Ad Copy Refresh:** Introduce scarcity: \u201cOnly 2 Seats Left for Sec 4\u201d. |\n| **Remarketing Lite (optional):** Create Audience \u201cVisited Bootcamp page - no conversion (30 days)\u201d. Launch a Display campaign with 2 static banners (728\u00d790 & 300\u00d7250). Daily budget S$10. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Week 3 (26 May - Bootcamp Eve)\n\n1. **Budget Ramp-Up:** Double daily spend for final 5 days if cost-per-acquisition (CPA) acceptable (\u2264S$40).  \n2. **Countdown Ads:** Use ad customisers \u2014 e.g. `Starts in {=COUNTDOWN(\"2025/06/10 23:59:59\",\"en-SG\",3)}`.  \n3. **Pause at Cut-off:** Stop all campaigns midnight before class begins (or keep a \u201clast-minute seat\u201d ad at half budget).\n\n---\n\n### 6. After Action Review (Post-Bootcamp)\n\n| Metric | Benchmark | What to Note |\n|--------|-----------|--------------|\n| CTR | 3-6 % | Below? fix ad relevance. |\n| Conv. Rate | 8-15 % for tuition | If low, landing page message mismatch. |\n| CPA | Target \u2264 10 % of course fee | Increase budget if profitable. |\n\n---\n\n### Minimal Tech Stack Checklist\n\n- **Google Ads** (Search, optional Display).\n- **Google Analytics 4** (free).\n- **Single Landing Page** (already built).\n- **Optional**: Google Tag Manager (easier event setup, but skip if time-crunched).\n\n---\n\n### Key Principles to Keep It Lean\n\n1. **One campaign, one ad group, tight keywords** \u2013 easier to manage with limited time.  \n2. **Manual \u2192 Smart bidding transition** \u2013 prevents overspend while Google learns.  \n3. **Clear conversion signal** \u2013 even a simple \u201cThank-you\u201d page view is better than none.  \n4. **Daily 15-minute hygiene** \u2013 negative keywords, budget pacing, approval issues.  \n5. **Stop fiddling after Day 10** unless numbers are disastrous; let the algo learn.\n\nGood luck \u2014 you can have ads live within **48 hours** if you execute tonight."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"28641e43-2089-4e9c-966a-512bd1ff1f9d","request_id":"9404501cdff381c2-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"28641e43-2089-4e9c-966a-512bd1ff1f9d","children":[]}}}
