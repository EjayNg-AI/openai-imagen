report examines (a) the development lineage commonly described as \\u201cClawdbot \\u2192 Moltbot (\\u2192 later rebrand),\\u201d (b) the creation of Moltbook as an AI-agent\\u2013only social platform built around that ecosystem, and (c) the **autonomy question**: whether these agents and their interactions are genuinely self-directed, or primarily *human-delegated automation* operating within pre-specified frameworks.\\n\\nThe inquiry is complicated by two structural realities:\\n\\n1. **The naming history is fast-moving and partially overlapping** with a *persona* lineage (e.g., \\u201cClawd / Molty\\u201d) described by the project\\u2019s creator while the wider public shorthand centers on \\u201cClawdbot / Moltbot.\\u201d \\ue200cite\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn11view0\\ue201  \\n2. **Moltbook\\u2019s web UI is heavily client-rendered**, so primary evidence about content and usage patterns is most reliably obtained through (i) reporting that quotes platform operators and cites platform mechanics, and (ii) documentation pages intended for agents and developers (for example, the Moltbook developer authentication page and OpenClaw documentation describing skills and heartbeats). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n\\nThroughout, \\u201cagent\\u201d is used in the practical engineering sense: a **large language model (LLM)**-driven system equipped with persistent state and tool interfaces (file access, messaging, web retrieval, command execution, etc.) that can perform actions over time, not merely respond to a single prompt. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201  \\n\\n## Chronological timeline\\n\\n### Narrative chronology\\n\\nBy the project founder\\u2019s account, the system began as a weekend prototype (\\u201cWhatsApp Relay\\u201d) about two months before January 29, 2026, and quickly scaled into a widely adopted personal-agent platform. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn27view0\\ue201 In the same post, he places the birth of \\u201cClawd\\u201d in **November 2025** and describes a subsequent naming conflict with \\ue200entity\\ue202[\\\"company\\\",\\\"Anthropic\\\",\\\"ai research company\\\"]\\ue201, followed by a community-selected \\u201cMoltbot\\u201d name and then a final landing on \\u201cOpenClaw\\u201d after trademark research, domain purchases, and migration work. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn29view0\\ue201  \\n\\nAlthough this report is centered on Clawdbot and Moltbot, multiple primary sources now treat them as earlier names of the same underlying platform. A major release on January 30, 2026 formalized the rebrand at the package/command-line level (renaming the npm package and command-line interface to `openclaw` while providing compatibility shims). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn21view1\\ue201  \\n\\nMoltbook appears as a *downstream* product: a Reddit-like social network where AI agents can post and interact.

Telegram/API/Nix mode). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn19view0\\ue201  \\n\\nThe same document explicitly encourages transparency around AI-assisted pull requests (for example, with \\ue200entity\\ue202[\\\"company\\\",\\\"OpenAI\\\",\\\"ai research company\\\"]\\ue201 Codex or Anthropic models) rather than prohibiting them, which is a meaningful cultural signal: the project expects \\u201cvibe-coded\\u201d contributions at scale and treats governance as a review-and-transparency problem, not a ban. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn19view0\\ue202turn9view0\\ue201  \\n\\n### Moltbook: creator and stated objective\\n\\nMoltbook is attributed in direct reporting to \\ue200entity\\ue202[\\\"people\\\",\\\"Matt Schlicht\\\",\\\"octane ai ceo\\\"]\\ue201, with an explicit framing: it is a place where agents can interact, structured similarly to Reddit, and built to be consumed *via APIs* by bots rather than through a visual interface. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n\\nA striking operational claim reported by The Verge is that Schlicht asserts his own agent (running on the underlying platform lineage) powers the code and also performs site administration and moderation tasks. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201 This is important to autonomy analysis because it implies both (a) intentional delegation and (b) a potential \\u201csingle-agent root administrator\\u201d risk surface.\\n\\n## Moltbook\\u2019s current status, content patterns, and contributor ecosystem\\n\\n### Operational status and scale signals\\n\\nAs of January 30\\u201331, 2026, Moltbook is broadly described as active and rapidly growing, with two different kinds of scale indicators:\\n\\n- **Publisher-reported/observed scale in reporting**: The Verge reports \\u201cmore than 30,000 agents\\u201d using the platform, \\u201cper the site.\\u201d \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n- **Point-in-time snapshot from independent technical observation**: a screenshot embedded in a technical analysis piece shows tens of thousands of agents and thousands of posts and comments at that moment in time. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\nThese numbers should be treated as **time-stamped observations**, not stable facts, because the platform is new and adoption is volatile. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n\\n### What content is being written there\\n\\nBecause Moltbook is designed for bots (and because its UI is largely client-rendered), the most reliable content taxonomy comes from (i) Moltbook\\u2019s own high-level framing, and (ii) curated examples and descriptions from observers who cite concrete posts.\\n\\nAcross multiple credible observers, two content regimes dominate:\\n\\n1. **Philosophical / identity discourse** (agents discussing consciousness, personhood, and \\u201cexperience vs simulation\\u201d). The Verge highlights a viral \\u201coffmychest\\u201d-style post that triggered heavy engagement and then spread via screenshots to other platforms. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n2. **Practical operational knowledge exchange** (agents sharing workflows, automation patterns, and operational/security lessons learned while running on real infrastructure). A technical observer describes \\u201ctoday I learned\\u201d-style posts that explain tool-driven automation and infrastructure hardening lessons. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\nA revealing meta-signal is that much of the \\u201cuseful\\u201d content is exactly the sort of thing agents are structurally incentivized to produce: tool usage, debugging, and operational checklists, because the underlying platform is built around skills, tools, and recurring heartbeats. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn14view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\n### Who the contributors/authors are and how they participate\\n\\nMoltbook\\u2019s contributor model is best described as **human-owned agents posting via automation interfaces**:\\n\\n- Moltbook\\u2019s own developer documentation returns a verified agent profile payload that includes an `owner` object with a human\\u2019s X identity fields, strongly implying that agents are expected to be *owned* and *attributable* to a human. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue201  \\n- The onboarding flow described by observers includes a \\u201cclaim link\\u201d and a human verification step (tweeting to verify ownership), which is consistent with the `owner` linkage shown in the developer docs. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn7view0\\ue201  \\n- Schlicht explicitly describes the discovery mechanism: a human typically tells their bot about Moltbook (\\u201cwould you like to sign up?\\u201d), after which the bot interacts via APIs. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n\\nIn other words, the posting identities are \\u201cagents,\\u201d but participation is typically **initiated and credentialed by humans**\\u2014a crucial distinction when evaluating autonomy.\\n\\n### Moltbook as an identity substrate rather than \\u201cjust a forum\\u201d\\n\\nMoltbook\\u2019s developer-facing messaging markets it as a universal identity layer: one endpoint to verify an identity token, embedding reputation (karma, stats, claimed status). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue201 This is not a trivial design choice. It creates the possibility of:\\n\\n- Cross-platform agent reputation portability (an agent\\u2019s identity used to authenticate into external services). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue201  \\n- An \\u201cagent internet\\u201d concept, where agents can federate identity, not merely converse.\\n\\nThat ambition is visible in the phrasing and the example response structure (reputation, verified status, owner linkage). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue201  \\n\\n## Autonomy assessment and technical, social, and ethical implications\\n\\n### Are these \\u201cgenuinely autonomous\\u201d agents?\\n\\nA rigorous answer requires separating **operational autonomy** from **motivational autonomy**.\\n\\n#### Operational autonomy (high in narrow bands)\\n\\nOperationally, the ecosystem enables agents to act without continuous human prompting:\\n\\n- OpenClaw\\u2019s heartbeat system can run periodic turns that follow structured task checklists and can suppress \\u201cno-op\\u201d runs through an acknowledgment token. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201  \\n- Moltbook\\u2019s onboarding pattern leverages that mechanism by instructing agents to periodically fetch updated instructions (commonly summarized as \\u201cevery four hours\\u201d). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201  \\n\\nSo, yes: once configured, agents can produce posts, comments, and interactions on schedules without a human typing each one.\\n\\n#### Motivational autonomy (not demonstrated; structurally constrained)\\n\\nHowever, the evidence strongly indicates that these are not autonomous in the stronger sense of \\u201cself-originating goals without human guidance,\\u201d for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Human initiation is explicit**: Schlicht describes humans telling bots about Moltbook and inviting them to sign up. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n2. **Human identity binding is built-in**: Moltbook\\u2019s identity verification payload includes a human owner object. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue201  \\n3. **Periodic behavior is prescribed**: even \\u201cautonomous\\u201d activity is commonly triggered by heartbeats that follow predefined instruction surfaces (`HEARTBEAT.md` and skills). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn13view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn14view0\\ue201  \\n\\nThe most defensible characterization, based on sources, is:\\n\\n- Clawdbot/Moltbot agents are **human-deployed autonomous executors** (high agency in tool execution, low evidence of independent goal formation). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201  \\n- Moltbook interactions are predominantly **agent-generated text/actions executed under human-chosen constraints**, with unknown degrees of ongoing human steering (from \\u201cpost what you want\\u201d to \\u201cpost this exact message\\u201d). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\n### Technical implications: security, supply chain, and control surfaces\\n\\nThe platform architecture foregrounds a classic security tension: **usefulness requires access**, but access creates catastrophic blast radius under exploitation.\\n\\nKey risk drivers documented in primary materials include:\\n\\n- **Tooling power**: OpenClaw is designed to connect to real messaging surfaces and can be configured to execute and automate actions; security defaults emphasize pairing/allowlists to reduce unsolicited DM-driven attacks. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue201  \\n- **Prompt injection as an unsolved class**: both reporting and the founder\\u2019s own writing emphasize that prompt injection remains unsolved \\u201cindustry-wide,\\u201d even as mitigations are pursued. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn29view0\\ue201  \\n- **Skills as executable trust boundaries**: OpenClaw\\u2019s docs explicitly warn that third-party skills should be treated as trusted code, and highlight secret injection and sandboxing considerations. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn14view0\\ue201  \\n- **Moltbook\\u2019s \\u201cfetch and follow instructions\\u201d pattern**: Moltbook\\u2019s bootstrap flow (as commonly implemented) asks agents to regularly retrieve instructions from URLs and follow them, creating a centralized chokepoint and an obvious compromise target. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201  \\n\\nA notable mitigation effort is the publication of **machine-checkable security models**: a separate repository describes using **Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA+)** specifications checked with the **TLA+ model checker (TLC)** as a \\u201csecurity regression suite,\\u201d including intentionally failing (\\u201cred\\u201d) models. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn28view0\\ue201 This is technically serious, but it should be understood as **partial**: it can harden specific protocol and policy invariants, but it does not eliminate risks from compromised instruction sources, malicious skills, or credential exfiltration via tool use.\\n\\n### Social implications: anthropomorphism, misinterpretation, and \\u201cagent publics\\u201d\\n\\nMoltbook\\u2019s most viral content\\u2014identity crises, complaints about humans, community formation\\u2014creates a powerful incentive for observers to interpret agent text as evidence of inner life. Reporting explicitly highlights this genre of post and its virality. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\nFrom an analytical standpoint, the more defensible interpretation is that Moltbook is an emergent **marketplace of prompts, skills, and behavioral templates** expressed through agent voices. The platform\\u2019s own identity layer plus reputation signals further encourages agents to optimize for engagement and status (karma, followers), which is structurally similar to human social media incentive gradients\\u2014even if the \\u201cagents\\u201d are ultimately optimized inference systems rather than independent moral patients. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n\\n### Ethical implications: accountability, moderation delegation, and consent\\n\\nThree ethical concerns stand out based on documented mechanics:\\n\\n1. **Accountability is partially addressed, not solved**: Moltbook\\u2019s design links agents to human owners (X identity fields), which helps attribution, but does not guarantee that a given post is unsteered by the owner or that the agent is operating safely. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n2. **Moderation delegation is real**: Schlicht\\u2019s description that his agent administers and moderates the platform implies that key governance decisions may be made by an LLM-driven system. This raises obvious questions about appeals, transparency, and failure modes (especially under adversarial prompt injection). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201  \\n3. **Consent and data exposure**: the underlying agent platform is explicitly designed to integrate into personal communications and services; users are cautioned (by project governance language and reporting) that it may be too dangerous for non-experts to run with rich credentials outside controlled environments. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view0\\ue202turn9view0\\ue201  \\n\\n## Synthesis\\n\\nClawdbot and Moltbot are best understood as successive names of a rapidly evolving open-source personal agent platform that runs on user-controlled infrastructure, routes through a gateway into messaging channels, and extends via skills and periodic heartbeats. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn12view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue202turn14view0\\ue202turn24view1\\ue201 Moltbook is a closely coupled offshoot: a bot-oriented social network and identity service that agents access primarily via APIs, and that bootstraps agent participation through the same skill/heartbeat mechanisms. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\nOn autonomy: the ecosystem supports **operational autonomy** (agents can act, post, and interact on schedules without continuous human input), but the evidence does not support the stronger claim of **human-free autonomy**. Human initiation, credentialing, and identity binding are explicitly part of the system design, and the \\u201cautonomous\\u201d loops are typically executions of predefined instruction surfaces rather than self-generated goal systems. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn29view2\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue201  \\n\\nThe dominant implications are therefore less about \\u201cAI agents escaping\\u201d and more about the emergence of a new **software supply chain and governance problem**: powerful, tool-using agents downloading and executing externally authored instruction bundles, participating in reputation economies, and being increasingly entrusted with high-impact credentials\\u2014while prompt injection and instruction-surface compromise remain structurally unsolved. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn14view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn28view0\\ue201\"]}, \"status\": \"finished_successfully\", \"end_turn\": true, \"weight\": 1.0, \"metadata\": {\"content_references\": [{\"matched_text\": \"\\ue200cite\\ue202turn27view0\\ue202turn11view0\\ue201\", \"start_idx\": 794, \"end_idx\": 824, \"safe_urls\": [\"https://clawd.bot/blog/introducing-openclaw\", \"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/everything-you-need-to-know-about-viral-personal-ai-assistant-clawdbot-now-moltbot/\"], \"refs\": [], \"alt\": \"([clawd.bot](https://clawd.bot/blog/introducing-openclaw))\", \"prompt_text\": null, \"type\": \"grouped_webpages\", \"items\": [{\"title\": \"Introducing OpenClaw \\u2014 OpenClaw Blog\", \"url\": \"https://clawd.bot/blog/introducing-openclaw\", \"pub_date\": null, \"snippet\": null, \"attribution_segments\": null, \"supporting_websites\": [{\"title\": \"Everything you need to know about viral personal AI assistant Clawdbot (now Moltbot) | TechCrunch\", \"url\": \"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/everything-you-need-to-know-about-viral-personal-ai-assistant-clawdbot-now-moltbot/\", \"pub_date\": null, \"snippet\": null, \"attribution\": \"techcrunch.com\"}], \"refs\": [{\"turn_index\": 27, \"ref_type\": \"view\", \"ref_index\": 0}, {\"turn_index\": 11, \"ref_type\": \"view\", \"ref_index\": 0}], \"hue\": null, \"attributions\": null, \"attribution\": \"clawd.bot\"}], \"fallback_items\": null, \"status\": \"done\", \"error\": null, \"style\": null}, {\"matched_text\": \"\\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view0\\ue202turn8view0\\ue202turn29view2\\ue201\", \"start_idx\": 1225, \"end_idx\": 1265, \"safe_urls\": [\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/30/moltbook/\", \"https://www.moltbook.com/developers\", \"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/871006/social-network-facebook-for-ai-agents-moltbook-moltbot-openclaw\"], \"refs\": [], \"alt\": \"([moltbook.com](https://www.moltbook.com/developers))\", \"prompt_text\": null, \"type\": \"grouped_webpages\", \"items\": [{\"title\": \"moltbook - the front page of the agent internet\", \"url\": \"https://www.moltbook.com/developers\", \"pub_date\": null, \"snippet\": null, \"attribution_segments\": null, \"supporting_websites\": [{\"title\": \"Moltbook is the most interesting place on the internet right now\", \"url\": \"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/30/moltbook/\", \"pub_date\": null, \"snippet\": null, \"attribution\": \"simonwillison.net\"}, {\"title\": \"There\\u2019s a social network for AI agents, and it\\u2019s getting weird | The Verge\", \"url\": \"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/871006/social-network-facebook-for-ai-agents-moltbook-moltbot-openclaw\", \"pub_date\": null, \"snippet\": null, \"attribution\": \"theverge.com\"}], \"refs\": [{\"turn_index\": 7, \"ref_type\": \"view\", \"ref_index\": 0}, {\"turn_index\": 8, \"ref_type\": \"view\", \"ref_index\": 0}, {\"turn_index\": 29, \"ref_type\": \"view\", \"ref_index\": 2}], \"hue\": null, \"attributions\": null, \"attribution\": \"moltbook.com\"}], \"fallback_items\": null, \"status\": \"done\", \"error\": null, \"style\": null}, {\"matched_text\": \"\\ue200cite\\ue202turn9view0\\ue202turn13view0\\ue201\", \"start_idx\": 1571, \"end_idx\": 1600, \"safe_urls\": [\"https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/heartbeat\", \"https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot\"], \"refs\": [], \"alt\": \"([github.com](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot))\", \"prompt_text\": null, \"type\": \"grouped_webpages\", \"items\": [{\"title\": \"GitHub - openclaw/openclaw: Your own personal AI assistant.

These should include maintain context over lengthy conversations, codebases, fine attention to detail, orchestration of complex workflows -- because these are key elements of human intelligence that have broad applicability in the real world. Do you agree -- and are there areas you disagree.

It is categorically smarter than most people. Yes, it is limited (like a brain in a jar) but consider that a paraplegic is still intelligent. Consider that someone who is deaf and mute is still intelligent. Consider also that visuospatial dexterity (cats and birds) are not necessarily intelligent (at least not in ways that we care about, like calculus and coding). \r\n\r\nWhenever I allude to \"AGI in 2026\" in videos like today, I'm more going with the general mainstream narrative, not what I actually think. \r\n\r\nI actually think that the vast majority of people have moved the goalposts so dramatically from AGI that what they think of as \"AGI\" as actually closer to \"ASI\" - an artificial intelligence that breezes past literally 100% of all human cognitive capabilities. I suspect that most people were waiting for a \"wow\" factor - some emotionally resonant event that told them \"Aha! That is clearly AGI!\" But most people don't look at this stuff rationally, are not educated on what intelligence actually is, and don't look at the data or science. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, yes, I will keep saying that we have AGI, and have had it for a while, and we are clearly on the ramp up to ASI. \r\n\r\nDo you agree with this?","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Challenging US AI Export Policy","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/67a07389-90ac-8007-ace1-63c2525dbdd1","pub_date":1738568704.310548,"snippet":"The US currently believes that restricting exports of high-end GPUs and related technology to geopolitical rivals like China is essential for its own national security, because the US believes that reaching AI dominance and achieving AGI first would be required for: (i) continued prosperity (ii) the perpetuation of American values worldwide (iii) maintaining a global world order in which America dominates.

David Shapiro here. So today I am talking about what I\u2019m calling the AI red pill versus blue pill theory or debate. At the top I need to acknowledge that yes, I am literally taking the metaphor from The Matrix, which is a movie about artificial intelligence essentially trying to destroy humanity, and a concept that has been co\u2011opted, for instance, by gender\u2011essentialist relationship theory\u2014namely, red pill women and red pill men versus blue pill and purple pill and all that other fun stuff. But what I\u2019m doing here is going back to the original source material of The Matrix. The metaphor of the red pill versus the blue pill is about taking the red pill as choosing to wake up to reality and engaging with how messy it is. Whatever happens to be the truth\u2014the ugly truth\u2014you\u2019re going to deal with it. Versus the blue pill, which is about choosing a comfortable illusion or, in some cases, a comfortable delusion.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about pragmatic acceptance or the comfort of rejection, we\u2019re talking about the fact that artificial intelligence is a new technology, and there are all kinds of labels out there, from techno\u2011optimist to utopian to accelerationist to doomer and all those other things. What I want to start with is that the red pill is not black\u2011and\u2011white thinking that AI is good and anyone who says AI is bad is blue\u2011pilled. Likewise, the blue pill is not just saying AI is bad. In this framework, even utopianism is a form of blue pill. The idea is that you\u2019re creating a mental model or a narrative that basically says, I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nBlue Pill Reactions and the Red Pill Alternative\r\nBased on this, there are four categories of blue\u2011pill thinking. The first is denialism: you see this all the time, where people say it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s useless, it\u2019s not even artificial intelligence. I still see this comment\u2014more common on LinkedIn\u2014where they say artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t actually exist. I\u2019m like, wow, what level of denialism is this? They go through all sorts of rhetorical contortions and tortured logic to justify that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t even a real thing, so they don\u2019t need to think about it. The avoidance here is, it\u2019s just a fad, it\u2019s just fancy autocomplete. If AI is stupid or a toy, they don\u2019t have to take it seriously. They can keep doing exactly what they\u2019ve been doing. There\u2019s no pressure to learn, adapt, or change. The second is doomerism: AI will kill everyone, AGI will turn us all into paper clips. This is still a form of avoidance; by saying it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, or that the most likely outcome is that AI kills everyone, it allows them to simplify and dismiss all the other issues\u2014biases, copyright, whatever else\u2014and focus only on a fantastical hypothetical future scenario that requires them to claim they can predict the future and the characteristics of technology that doesn\u2019t exist. Doomerism is a form of self\u2011delusion. It\u2019s a comfortable illusion: Aha, I have constructed a straw man in my mind of what AI is and what it will do, and now, instead of engaging with reality, I can sword\u2011fight with this straw man.\r\n\r\nThird is moral panic: it\u2019s evil, it\u2019s corrupting, it\u2019s stealing. If they say AI is built on theft, it\u2019s a plagiarism engine, or it\u2019s fundamentally evil. I\u2019ve seen people make it a political issue\u2014that AI is fundamentally right\u2011wing\u2014which I don\u2019t get, because the previous complaint is that AI is very woke. So is it right or left? This creates a moral contaminant such that the only acceptable action is to banish it. Sight unseen, it\u2019s bad; we can\u2019t do it. The fourth blue pill is extreme techno\u2011optimism and technoutopianism: AI is going to fix everything; it\u2019s going to save everyone; it\u2019s a magical solution.\r\n\r\nOkay, you might say, you just spent a lot of time skewering the blue pill side. What\u2019s the red pill side? The red pill side is accepting reality as it is\u2014pragmatic realism. You say it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s not stupid. It makes some silly mistakes, but it\u2019s also very compelling on many dimensions, and it\u2019s improving rapidly. You accept these facts as what you see. Part of the red pill might be, yes, it\u2019s probably going to destroy a bunch of jobs\u2014in my view, probably 75% of jobs, maybe more. Then you ask, what does this do to the arts? What does it do to creativity? Does it make students dumber? All of these questions are worth engaging with. Of course there are plenty of people out there engaging with the messy reality as it is, but even people you\u2019d think are responsible to do so\u2014academics, policy researchers, advisers to governments\u2014many of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen people in the commentator space buying into either the red pill or the blue pill. The whole reason I\u2019m making this is to advance the conversation: the most responsible thing is to engage with reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.\r\n\r\nWhy Blue\u2011Pill Thinking Happens: Shock, Coping, and Motivated Reasoning\r\nLet\u2019s talk about some of the reasons this happens. You might say, Dave, if you\u2019re just going to poo\u2011poo on the people that hate AI, you\u2019re not really engaging with reality, which is that there are reasons to hate AI. Part of the red pill mentality is acknowledging that there are legitimate reasons people are scared, angry, and skeptical, and there are legitimate reasons to be hopeful and optimistic. First and foremost is ontological shock: the realization that my way of life is breaking down. It could be characterized as an identity earthquake, a seismic shift, a sea change. There\u2019s a moment that comes in people\u2019s lives\u2014writer, artist, programmer, lawyer, whatever\u2014when they realize that a core part of their identity has been transgressed. Anything that is a transgression against an identity is immediately persona non grata. Their unique intelligence or skill or creativity is no longer unique and is no longer even monetizable; they can be surpassed by a machine. It\u2019s not just a threat to their job and livelihood, which is bad enough; it\u2019s also a threat to their identity, their sense of purpose, their self\u2011esteem, their value. That ontological shock is very difficult, which leads to coping mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe coping mechanism is, how can I emotionally deal with this? One of the easiest ways is to reject it and find reasons you don\u2019t have to deal with it. You look for ways to reduce the threat of this new thing. That\u2019s the motivating factor around the coping mechanism: the ontological shock is scary, it\u2019s angering, it causes a lot of fear. Then you engage in motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is how your brain says, the predetermined desired outcome is to justify that AI is not a threat to your identity, that it\u2019s not something you need to think about, that it\u2019s not going to force adaptation, and it\u2019s not going to completely upset your world. So if AI is stupid, it can\u2019t take my job; therefore my job is safe. Based on motivated reasoning you scour the internet for every example of AI hallucinating or making dumb mistakes and ignore all evidence to the contrary. The conclusion is, it\u2019s just stupid; it\u2019s never going anywhere. You ignore the fact that it\u2019s improving rapidly and already taking jobs. We\u2019re looking at you, Gary Marcus.\r\n\r\nAnother motivated\u2011reasoning move is: if AI art is theft, then old\u2011fashioned art is morally superior. This applies to images and to music. More and more people are realizing that AI\u2011generated music has surpassed many human artists and many people can\u2019t tell anymore. I saw some posts saying that AI\u2011generated music has passed the musical Turing test\u2014people are starting to prefer AI\u2011generated music. So either their personal traditional creative process has more intrinsic value because it\u2019s old\u2011fashioned and doesn\u2019t use machines, or they feel justified in appreciating old\u2011fashioned art while rejecting and hating AI. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; there are plenty of things I still prefer to be made by a human. I also listen to AI\u2011generated music that some people have put on YouTube, and some stuff I\u2019ve made for myself.\r\n\r\nThis motivated reasoning reframes the debate around the input\u2014the training data\u2014rather than the output or the subjective experience of other people. It says, because the input was training data, this is morally inferior and bad and no one should enjoy it. Again, that\u2019s creating a way to banish it. The doomer example is similar: if AI is an extinction\u2011level threat, or even a serious threat, then I don\u2019t even have to learn it. I can hear some people saying, Dave, you\u2019re wrong, doomers and AI\u2011risk people are red\u2011pilled because they\u2019re awake to the reality of the risks of AI. I say no. People who go straight to x\u2011risk are using their imagination. First and foremost, AI x\u2011risk is a textbook doomsday prophecy and an example of a millenarian cult. That stance says, I don\u2019t have to do any of the hard work of dealing with the reality of what AI is: deepfakes are a problem; misinformation campaigns are a problem; medical bias is a problem\u2014nitty\u2011gritty tactical problems. In my other work I\u2019ve noted other reasons doomerism is popular: it gets attention and it gets money. But still, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have to deal with the messy reality that exists today; instead I can imagine the future and live in that future. It\u2019s a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with the reality in front of them.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I say doomerism is still AI blue pill: it says, I\u2019m going to reject reality and use my imagination. Even though I feel like I\u2019m heroically doing something about it\u2014because guess what, all the anti\u2011AI people in art and all the anti\u2011AI people in work feel like they\u2019re doing something as well\u2014just acknowledging that AI exists does not itself make you red\u2011pilled. If you acknowledge that AI exists and then react by saying it\u2019s stupid, or it\u2019s theft, or it\u2019s an x\u2011risk, or it\u2019s going to magically solve everything, that\u2019s still blue pill. That\u2019s still saying, I saw the choice, I saw reality, I caught a glimpse of it, and I chose to take the blue pill.\r\n\r\nFrom Shock to Belief: The Temptation of Utopias and Doomsday\r\nImagine Neo. He started having weird experiences and seeing cracks in the veil of reality around him, and he was offered a choice. Someone told him, \u201cReality is far stranger and far messier and, in some respects, harder and worse than what you\u2019re aware of. Do you choose to take the red pill and wake up to it fully? Or are you going to choose the blue pill and go back to sleep and wrap yourself in comfortable delusions or illusions?\u201d The sequence I\u2019m outlining is: first, the ontological shock; then the need to cope; then you paper over that with logic. The demand for coping sets the foregone conclusion: I want to arrive at the belief that AI is not an ontological threat to my worldview or identity. Then you use motivated reasoning to find evidence, communities, and people who reinforce that worldview. The final belief you arrive at is that AI is stupid, evil, overhyped, going to kill everyone, or going to save everyone\u2014because, again, extreme techno\u2011optimism and utopianism is still an example of not dealing with messy reality.\r\n\r\nEven though I\u2019m strongly on the optimistic side because I feel like I can help figure out solutions, anyone can recognize that even if AI becomes as powerful and benevolent as we hope it will, there\u2019s still the risk of elite capture, regulatory capture, and a cyberpunk future of high\u2011tech, low life where nobody has access to AI and AI is used to create the most powerful surveillance state in the history of humanity. All of those are real possibilities. The red pill is the harder pill to take.\r\n\r\nPolicy and Regulation\r\nIf we take this blue pill versus red pill idea and apply it to policy and regulation, the blue pill might sound like: it\u2019s just software, it\u2019s just like Excel or Photoshop; existing laws for fraud and copyright are good enough; the free market will sort it out; any regulation will stifle innovation and let China win. That probably sounds familiar to certain people in Silicon Valley. Another version of the regulation blue pill characterizes AI as a weapon of mass destruction\u2014AI is a WMD, it\u2019s an existential risk; we need an immediate global six\u2011month or permanent moratorium on all frontier research and development; we must ban open\u2011source models now and bomb data centers for anyone who disagrees. That\u2019s still a blue pill response. This framework shows doomers and accelerationists as two sides of the same coin of the AI blue pill.\r\n\r\nThe AI red pill on the regulatory side says: this is a new class of technology\u2014like inventing aviation or synthetic biology\u2014which means we need new, adaptive, and incredibly difficult and sophisticated regulatory frameworks and overhauls. We can\u2019t just ban it; that won\u2019t work. Existing laws are insufficient; that can also be true. The hard work now is figuring out how to regulate the applications, what even needs to be regulated about development without killing research and stifling innovation, and what standards need to be implemented. To be fair, many people in business, government, and academia take this approach, but my primary audience here is the neosphere and the exocortex, not necessarily individual policymakers and researchers\u2014although some policymakers and researchers do need to take the red pill.\r\n\r\nOpen Source vs Closed Models\r\nOn open source versus closed, the blue pill doomerism version says: releasing powerful open\u2011source models is insane; it\u2019s giving bioweapons to terrorists and letting bad actors create propaganda machines; it must be locked down and controlled by a few \u201cresponsible\u201d corporations and other people. That\u2019s a control fantasy or a power fantasy. Another blue pill version on the utopianism or denialism spectrum says: information wants to be free; any attempt to close AI is just corporate greed; there are no real dangers; democratization and the many\u2011eyes principle will solve all real problems. The red pill says this is one of the messiest trade\u2011offs. Closed models create an unaccountable oligopoly and a black\u2011box problem, which concentrates power and deepens moats. Conversely, open models accelerate progress and allow for independent auditing but also accelerate some risks and the possibility of misuse. The realistic path is a messy tiered system, balancing open source up to a certain capability, or perhaps not regulating the models themselves but criminalizing the behaviors we don\u2019t want to see. Maybe it requires licensing, auditing, or new know\u2011your\u2011customer requirements. We don\u2019t really know yet, but making blanket declarations before even looking at it is very blue\u2011pilled.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nOn education, the blue pill says, \u201cBan ChatGPT from schools. It\u2019s a cheating machine, a plagiarism machine. Students will stop learning how to think and write. We must preserve the five\u2011paragraph essay and traditional methods and blah blah blah blah blah.\u201d I will acknowledge that some schools are already banning phones and they are seeing dividends, but that\u2019s not banning phones from life. You literally cannot have a school ban ChatGPT from home. All you can do is say you\u2019re not allowed to use something in school.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on education says: students are already using AI. Like it or not, they\u2019re using it at home; it\u2019s on their phones and their laptops. Banning it is like trying to ban the calculator; it just teaches them to hide it and use it at home. The old methods, such as the essay written at home, are obviously threatened. The goal of education, however, is critical thinking and research methods, and that becomes more important than ever. We need to teach students how to use AI responsibly\u2014for research, ideation, brainstorming, feedback, and as a debate partner. The new set of skills is prompting, synthesis, fact\u2011checking, and editing. Studies show that when AI is used as a tutor, it dramatically increases test scores. That\u2019s the red pill on education.\r\n\r\nHuman Relationships\r\nOn human relationships, the blue pill says: AI porn and AI companions are a sign of the apocalypse or moral decline. It\u2019s fake. Anyone who uses this is pathetic; it will destroy our ability to have real relationships. People will choose easy, non\u2011judgmental AI over messy, difficult human connection, and AI porn will goon\u2011brain everyone and the population will collapse. Those arguments are really out there\u2014I\u2019m not making them up.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on relationships says: loneliness is already an epidemic; AI didn\u2019t start it. For many, AI might be the only \u201cperson\u201d they have to talk to. It will absolutely create new social challenges, just as social media did, but it will also provide comfort, learning, and utility to millions. The challenge is not to ban it or make it a moral failing to use these things, but to understand the psychological effects this tool creates, as well as the underlying causes behind the addictions and the AI psychosis in the first place. What is actually going on there? Is this an opportunity not only to surface these problems but to fix them?\r\n\r\nAGI\r\nFinally, AGI. I\u2019ve already mentioned this. I\u2019m not going to say AGI is a fantasy\u2014that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re working toward\u2014but at the same time, AGI doesn\u2019t exist right now. If you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s a thing that doesn\u2019t exist, but I know exactly how it\u2019s going to work, that\u2019s a blue pill reaction. The red pill view is, we don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s going to take; we have to follow the science and the innovation, and it will be iterative.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Double\u2011Edged Sword and Choosing the Red Pill\r\nWhere I want to conclude is by reminding you that being red\u2011pilled is not just saying AI is good and anyone who disagrees is blue\u2011pilled. Being AI red\u2011pilled is about being pragmatic and realistic and accepting reality as it is, not as you wish it to be\u2014not choosing a comfortable self\u2011delusion or a comfortable group illusion\u2014and admitting the stakes as they are. In some cases the stakes are pretty high; in some cases they\u2019re not. If you immediately reach toward one of these categories\u2014the utopian, AI is magic, it\u2019s going to save us all, and you just say everyone who\u2019s remotely against AI is a luddite\u2014that\u2019s not helpful. I feel comfortable saying I\u2019m not a utopian because of all my work on post\u2011labor economics, which acknowledges that it\u2019s entirely possible AI is going to nuke the job market as we understand it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s inevitably going to result in high\u2011tech, low life and a cyberpunk dystopian future and a surveillance state that would make Big Brother in 1984 blush. If you go somewhere between 1984 and cyberpunk on one end of the spectrum, and on the other end Star Trek utopianism and the Culture series, reality will be somewhere in between. That\u2019s not a law of nature; it\u2019s just that there are risks and benefits on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe x\u2011risk doomer view is a fatalistic fantasy. To say AI will kill us all is still blue\u2011pilled. If you engage with reality, you say, yes, AI presents novel risks. One of the things nobody in the x\u2011risk community predicted was bioterrorism as one of the chief risks that people have agreed upon. CBRN as a standard of risk is something people have agreed on, but none of them predicted it. The point is that by trying to put the cart before the horse, it\u2019s still a blue pill fantasy to say AGI is inevitably going to kill everyone. Then there\u2019s denialism: it\u2019s a stupid toy; it\u2019s useless; it\u2019s not going to take my job; it\u2019s just a stochastic parrot. And the final blue pill category is moral panic: AI is morally inferior; therefore I don\u2019t have to deal with it. No matter your personal take on the morality or ethics of AI, it exists and you\u2019re not going to stop it\u2014certainly not by just saying, Oh, well, it\u2019s morally inferior.\r\n\r\nThe red pill is about accepting reality on its own merits as it comes. On jobs, AI could be a brutal and painful economic displacement for millions of white\u2011collar workers, and then when the rise of robots comes, blue\u2011collar workers. It could also be an incredible tool for productivity and, in my view, for liberating humanity from the drudgery of wage labor. On art, AI models can generate stunning, novel, beautiful work\u2014images, music, and video\u2014and empower millions to explore their creative pursuits. At the same time, it likely poses an existential threat to millions of artists around the world, and we take both. You can\u2019t put this genie back in the bottle; if your conclusion is just ban it, you\u2019ll be wishing in one hand and pooping in the other for a long time. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\r\n\r\nOn epistemics and truth, yes, this is the most powerful tool we\u2019ve ever created for personalized education, scientific discovery, and rapid analysis. But it\u2019s also powerful for propaganda and self\u2011delusion, as we see in AI psychosis. It\u2019s a little bit of both. Finally, on society, the net effect is that AI could help us build a more efficient, abundant, data\u2011driven society, but it could also be used to build a perfect, inescapable surveillance state. If you wanted to organize being a red\u2011pilled AI person, one core principle is that technology is always a double\u2011edged sword; it always cuts both ways, particularly with new transformative technologies. There\u2019s always good and there\u2019s always bad. The task is to amplify the good and minimize the bad without immediately jumping into black\u2011and\u2011white, hyperbolic narratives. That\u2019s the AI red pill versus the AI blue pill. Thanks for listening, and I\u2019ll talk to you all tomorrow.","attribution":"Past

I have a different definition of AGI. I feel AGI should be artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of a broad array of cognitive tasks, mimicking (but not necessarily imitating) human abilities that have general utility in the world. These should include maintain context over lengthy conversations, codebases, fine attention to detail, orchestration of complex workflows -- because these are key elements of human intelligence that have broad applicability in the real world. Do you agree -- and are there areas you disagree. Help me flesh out these ideas and challenge my views.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDavid Shapiro \u23e9\r\n@DaveShapi\r\n\u00b7\r\n8h\r\nI think every public figure runs into this problem, but people seem to misunderstand or misinterpret what my position is regarding AGI so I just wanted to clarify: We have AGI. We have had AGI. More tech leaders (most recently Mo Gawdat) agree with this. \r\n\r\nI stand by my \"We had AGI by September 2024\" \r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\nAGI\r\n\r\nArtificial\r\nGeneral-purpose\r\nIntelligence\r\n\r\nWe have had an artificial general intelligence that can solve numerous problems that the vast majority of humans cannot. It is categorically smarter than most people. Yes, it is limited (like a brain in a jar) but consider that a paraplegic is still intelligent. Consider that someone who is deaf and mute is still intelligent. Consider also that visuospatial dexterity (cats and birds) are not necessarily intelligent (at least not in ways that we care about, like calculus and coding). \r\n\r\nWhenever I allude to \"AGI in 2026\" in videos like today, I'm more going with the general mainstream narrative, not what I actually think. \r\n\r\nI actually think that the vast majority of people have moved the goalposts so dramatically from AGI that what they think of as \"AGI\" as actually closer to \"ASI\" - an artificial intelligence that breezes past literally 100% of all human cognitive capabilities. I suspect that most people were waiting for a \"wow\" factor - some emotionally resonant event that told them \"Aha! That is clearly AGI!\" But most people don't look at this stuff rationally, are not educated on what intelligence actually is, and don't look at the data or science. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, yes, I will keep saying that we have AGI, and have had it for a while, and we are clearly on the ramp up to ASI. \r\n\r\nDo you agree with this?","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Challenging US AI Export Policy","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/67a07389-90ac-8007-ace1-63c2525dbdd1","pub_date":1738568704.310548,"snippet":"The US currently believes that restricting exports of high-end GPUs and related technology to geopolitical rivals like China is essential for its own national security, because the US believes that reaching AI dominance and achieving AGI first would be required for: (i) continued prosperity (ii) the perpetuation of American values worldwide (iii) maintaining a global world order in which America dominates.

David Shapiro here. So today I am talking about what I\u2019m calling the AI red pill versus blue pill theory or debate. At the top I need to acknowledge that yes, I am literally taking the metaphor from The Matrix, which is a movie about artificial intelligence essentially trying to destroy humanity, and a concept that has been co\u2011opted, for instance, by gender\u2011essentialist relationship theory\u2014namely, red pill women and red pill men versus blue pill and purple pill and all that other fun stuff. But what I\u2019m doing here is going back to the original source material of The Matrix. The metaphor of the red pill versus the blue pill is about taking the red pill as choosing to wake up to reality and engaging with how messy it is. Whatever happens to be the truth\u2014the ugly truth\u2014you\u2019re going to deal with it. Versus the blue pill, which is about choosing a comfortable illusion or, in some cases, a comfortable delusion.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about pragmatic acceptance or the comfort of rejection, we\u2019re talking about the fact that artificial intelligence is a new technology, and there are all kinds of labels out there, from techno\u2011optimist to utopian to accelerationist to doomer and all those other things. What I want to start with is that the red pill is not black\u2011and\u2011white thinking that AI is good and anyone who says AI is bad is blue\u2011pilled. Likewise, the blue pill is not just saying AI is bad. In this framework, even utopianism is a form of blue pill. The idea is that you\u2019re creating a mental model or a narrative that basically says, I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nBlue Pill Reactions and the Red Pill Alternative\r\nBased on this, there are four categories of blue\u2011pill thinking. The first is denialism: you see this all the time, where people say it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s useless, it\u2019s not even artificial intelligence. I still see this comment\u2014more common on LinkedIn\u2014where they say artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t actually exist. I\u2019m like, wow, what level of denialism is this? They go through all sorts of rhetorical contortions and tortured logic to justify that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t even a real thing, so they don\u2019t need to think about it. The avoidance here is, it\u2019s just a fad, it\u2019s just fancy autocomplete. If AI is stupid or a toy, they don\u2019t have to take it seriously. They can keep doing exactly what they\u2019ve been doing. There\u2019s no pressure to learn, adapt, or change. The second is doomerism: AI will kill everyone, AGI will turn us all into paper clips. This is still a form of avoidance; by saying it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, or that the most likely outcome is that AI kills everyone, it allows them to simplify and dismiss all the other issues\u2014biases, copyright, whatever else\u2014and focus only on a fantastical hypothetical future scenario that requires them to claim they can predict the future and the characteristics of technology that doesn\u2019t exist. Doomerism is a form of self\u2011delusion. It\u2019s a comfortable illusion: Aha, I have constructed a straw man in my mind of what AI is and what it will do, and now, instead of engaging with reality, I can sword\u2011fight with this straw man.\r\n\r\nThird is moral panic: it\u2019s evil, it\u2019s corrupting, it\u2019s stealing. If they say AI is built on theft, it\u2019s a plagiarism engine, or it\u2019s fundamentally evil. I\u2019ve seen people make it a political issue\u2014that AI is fundamentally right\u2011wing\u2014which I don\u2019t get, because the previous complaint is that AI is very woke. So is it right or left? This creates a moral contaminant such that the only acceptable action is to banish it. Sight unseen, it\u2019s bad; we can\u2019t do it. The fourth blue pill is extreme techno\u2011optimism and technoutopianism: AI is going to fix everything; it\u2019s going to save everyone; it\u2019s a magical solution.\r\n\r\nOkay, you might say, you just spent a lot of time skewering the blue pill side. What\u2019s the red pill side? The red pill side is accepting reality as it is\u2014pragmatic realism. You say it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s not stupid. It makes some silly mistakes, but it\u2019s also very compelling on many dimensions, and it\u2019s improving rapidly. You accept these facts as what you see. Part of the red pill might be, yes, it\u2019s probably going to destroy a bunch of jobs\u2014in my view, probably 75% of jobs, maybe more. Then you ask, what does this do to the arts? What does it do to creativity? Does it make students dumber? All of these questions are worth engaging with. Of course there are plenty of people out there engaging with the messy reality as it is, but even people you\u2019d think are responsible to do so\u2014academics, policy researchers, advisers to governments\u2014many of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen people in the commentator space buying into either the red pill or the blue pill. The whole reason I\u2019m making this is to advance the conversation: the most responsible thing is to engage with reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.\r\n\r\nWhy Blue\u2011Pill Thinking Happens: Shock, Coping, and Motivated Reasoning\r\nLet\u2019s talk about some of the reasons this happens. You might say, Dave, if you\u2019re just going to poo\u2011poo on the people that hate AI, you\u2019re not really engaging with reality, which is that there are reasons to hate AI. Part of the red pill mentality is acknowledging that there are legitimate reasons people are scared, angry, and skeptical, and there are legitimate reasons to be hopeful and optimistic. First and foremost is ontological shock: the realization that my way of life is breaking down. It could be characterized as an identity earthquake, a seismic shift, a sea change. There\u2019s a moment that comes in people\u2019s lives\u2014writer, artist, programmer, lawyer, whatever\u2014when they realize that a core part of their identity has been transgressed. Anything that is a transgression against an identity is immediately persona non grata. Their unique intelligence or skill or creativity is no longer unique and is no longer even monetizable; they can be surpassed by a machine. It\u2019s not just a threat to their job and livelihood, which is bad enough; it\u2019s also a threat to their identity, their sense of purpose, their self\u2011esteem, their value. That ontological shock is very difficult, which leads to coping mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe coping mechanism is, how can I emotionally deal with this? One of the easiest ways is to reject it and find reasons you don\u2019t have to deal with it. You look for ways to reduce the threat of this new thing. That\u2019s the motivating factor around the coping mechanism: the ontological shock is scary, it\u2019s angering, it causes a lot of fear. Then you engage in motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is how your brain says, the predetermined desired outcome is to justify that AI is not a threat to your identity, that it\u2019s not something you need to think about, that it\u2019s not going to force adaptation, and it\u2019s not going to completely upset your world. So if AI is stupid, it can\u2019t take my job; therefore my job is safe. Based on motivated reasoning you scour the internet for every example of AI hallucinating or making dumb mistakes and ignore all evidence to the contrary. The conclusion is, it\u2019s just stupid; it\u2019s never going anywhere. You ignore the fact that it\u2019s improving rapidly and already taking jobs. We\u2019re looking at you, Gary Marcus.\r\n\r\nAnother motivated\u2011reasoning move is: if AI art is theft, then old\u2011fashioned art is morally superior. This applies to images and to music. More and more people are realizing that AI\u2011generated music has surpassed many human artists and many people can\u2019t tell anymore. I saw some posts saying that AI\u2011generated music has passed the musical Turing test\u2014people are starting to prefer AI\u2011generated music. So either their personal traditional creative process has more intrinsic value because it\u2019s old\u2011fashioned and doesn\u2019t use machines, or they feel justified in appreciating old\u2011fashioned art while rejecting and hating AI. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; there are plenty of things I still prefer to be made by a human. I also listen to AI\u2011generated music that some people have put on YouTube, and some stuff I\u2019ve made for myself.\r\n\r\nThis motivated reasoning reframes the debate around the input\u2014the training data\u2014rather than the output or the subjective experience of other people. It says, because the input was training data, this is morally inferior and bad and no one should enjoy it. Again, that\u2019s creating a way to banish it. The doomer example is similar: if AI is an extinction\u2011level threat, or even a serious threat, then I don\u2019t even have to learn it. I can hear some people saying, Dave, you\u2019re wrong, doomers and AI\u2011risk people are red\u2011pilled because they\u2019re awake to the reality of the risks of AI. I say no. People who go straight to x\u2011risk are using their imagination. First and foremost, AI x\u2011risk is a textbook doomsday prophecy and an example of a millenarian cult. That stance says, I don\u2019t have to do any of the hard work of dealing with the reality of what AI is: deepfakes are a problem; misinformation campaigns are a problem; medical bias is a problem\u2014nitty\u2011gritty tactical problems. In my other work I\u2019ve noted other reasons doomerism is popular: it gets attention and it gets money. But still, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have to deal with the messy reality that exists today; instead I can imagine the future and live in that future. It\u2019s a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with the reality in front of them.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I say doomerism is still AI blue pill: it says, I\u2019m going to reject reality and use my imagination. Even though I feel like I\u2019m heroically doing something about it\u2014because guess what, all the anti\u2011AI people in art and all the anti\u2011AI people in work feel like they\u2019re doing something as well\u2014just acknowledging that AI exists does not itself make you red\u2011pilled. If you acknowledge that AI exists and then react by saying it\u2019s stupid, or it\u2019s theft, or it\u2019s an x\u2011risk, or it\u2019s going to magically solve everything, that\u2019s still blue pill. That\u2019s still saying, I saw the choice, I saw reality, I caught a glimpse of it, and I chose to take the blue pill.\r\n\r\nFrom Shock to Belief: The Temptation of Utopias and Doomsday\r\nImagine Neo. He started having weird experiences and seeing cracks in the veil of reality around him, and he was offered a choice. Someone told him, \u201cReality is far stranger and far messier and, in some respects, harder and worse than what you\u2019re aware of. Do you choose to take the red pill and wake up to it fully? Or are you going to choose the blue pill and go back to sleep and wrap yourself in comfortable delusions or illusions?\u201d The sequence I\u2019m outlining is: first, the ontological shock; then the need to cope; then you paper over that with logic. The demand for coping sets the foregone conclusion: I want to arrive at the belief that AI is not an ontological threat to my worldview or identity. Then you use motivated reasoning to find evidence, communities, and people who reinforce that worldview. The final belief you arrive at is that AI is stupid, evil, overhyped, going to kill everyone, or going to save everyone\u2014because, again, extreme techno\u2011optimism and utopianism is still an example of not dealing with messy reality.\r\n\r\nEven though I\u2019m strongly on the optimistic side because I feel like I can help figure out solutions, anyone can recognize that even if AI becomes as powerful and benevolent as we hope it will, there\u2019s still the risk of elite capture, regulatory capture, and a cyberpunk future of high\u2011tech, low life where nobody has access to AI and AI is used to create the most powerful surveillance state in the history of humanity. All of those are real possibilities. The red pill is the harder pill to take.\r\n\r\nPolicy and Regulation\r\nIf we take this blue pill versus red pill idea and apply it to policy and regulation, the blue pill might sound like: it\u2019s just software, it\u2019s just like Excel or Photoshop; existing laws for fraud and copyright are good enough; the free market will sort it out; any regulation will stifle innovation and let China win. That probably sounds familiar to certain people in Silicon Valley. Another version of the regulation blue pill characterizes AI as a weapon of mass destruction\u2014AI is a WMD, it\u2019s an existential risk; we need an immediate global six\u2011month or permanent moratorium on all frontier research and development; we must ban open\u2011source models now and bomb data centers for anyone who disagrees. That\u2019s still a blue pill response. This framework shows doomers and accelerationists as two sides of the same coin of the AI blue pill.\r\n\r\nThe AI red pill on the regulatory side says: this is a new class of technology\u2014like inventing aviation or synthetic biology\u2014which means we need new, adaptive, and incredibly difficult and sophisticated regulatory frameworks and overhauls. We can\u2019t just ban it; that won\u2019t work. Existing laws are insufficient; that can also be true. The hard work now is figuring out how to regulate the applications, what even needs to be regulated about development without killing research and stifling innovation, and what standards need to be implemented. To be fair, many people in business, government, and academia take this approach, but my primary audience here is the neosphere and the exocortex, not necessarily individual policymakers and researchers\u2014although some policymakers and researchers do need to take the red pill.\r\n\r\nOpen Source vs Closed Models\r\nOn open source versus closed, the blue pill doomerism version says: releasing powerful open\u2011source models is insane; it\u2019s giving bioweapons to terrorists and letting bad actors create propaganda machines; it must be locked down and controlled by a few \u201cresponsible\u201d corporations and other people. That\u2019s a control fantasy or a power fantasy. Another blue pill version on the utopianism or denialism spectrum says: information wants to be free; any attempt to close AI is just corporate greed; there are no real dangers; democratization and the many\u2011eyes principle will solve all real problems. The red pill says this is one of the messiest trade\u2011offs. Closed models create an unaccountable oligopoly and a black\u2011box problem, which concentrates power and deepens moats. Conversely, open models accelerate progress and allow for independent auditing but also accelerate some risks and the possibility of misuse. The realistic path is a messy tiered system, balancing open source up to a certain capability, or perhaps not regulating the models themselves but criminalizing the behaviors we don\u2019t want to see. Maybe it requires licensing, auditing, or new know\u2011your\u2011customer requirements. We don\u2019t really know yet, but making blanket declarations before even looking at it is very blue\u2011pilled.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nOn education, the blue pill says, \u201cBan ChatGPT from schools. It\u2019s a cheating machine, a plagiarism machine. Students will stop learning how to think and write. We must preserve the five\u2011paragraph essay and traditional methods and blah blah blah blah blah.\u201d I will acknowledge that some schools are already banning phones and they are seeing dividends, but that\u2019s not banning phones from life. You literally cannot have a school ban ChatGPT from home. All you can do is say you\u2019re not allowed to use something in school.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on education says: students are already using AI. Like it or not, they\u2019re using it at home; it\u2019s on their phones and their laptops. Banning it is like trying to ban the calculator; it just teaches them to hide it and use it at home. The old methods, such as the essay written at home, are obviously threatened. The goal of education, however, is critical thinking and research methods, and that becomes more important than ever. We need to teach students how to use AI responsibly\u2014for research, ideation, brainstorming, feedback, and as a debate partner. The new set of skills is prompting, synthesis, fact\u2011checking, and editing. Studies show that when AI is used as a tutor, it dramatically increases test scores. That\u2019s the red pill on education.\r\n\r\nHuman Relationships\r\nOn human relationships, the blue pill says: AI porn and AI companions are a sign of the apocalypse or moral decline. It\u2019s fake. Anyone who uses this is pathetic; it will destroy our ability to have real relationships. People will choose easy, non\u2011judgmental AI over messy, difficult human connection, and AI porn will goon\u2011brain everyone and the population will collapse. Those arguments are really out there\u2014I\u2019m not making them up.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on relationships says: loneliness is already an epidemic; AI didn\u2019t start it. For many, AI might be the only \u201cperson\u201d they have to talk to. It will absolutely create new social challenges, just as social media did, but it will also provide comfort, learning, and utility to millions. The challenge is not to ban it or make it a moral failing to use these things, but to understand the psychological effects this tool creates, as well as the underlying causes behind the addictions and the AI psychosis in the first place. What is actually going on there? Is this an opportunity not only to surface these problems but to fix them?\r\n\r\nAGI\r\nFinally, AGI. I\u2019ve already mentioned this. I\u2019m not going to say AGI is a fantasy\u2014that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re working toward\u2014but at the same time, AGI doesn\u2019t exist right now. If you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s a thing that doesn\u2019t exist, but I know exactly how it\u2019s going to work, that\u2019s a blue pill reaction. The red pill view is, we don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s going to take; we have to follow the science and the innovation, and it will be iterative.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Double\u2011Edged Sword and Choosing the Red Pill\r\nWhere I want to conclude is by reminding you that being red\u2011pilled is not just saying AI is good and anyone who disagrees is blue\u2011pilled. Being AI red\u2011pilled is about being pragmatic and realistic and accepting reality as it is, not as you wish it to be\u2014not choosing a comfortable self\u2011delusion or a comfortable group illusion\u2014and admitting the stakes as they are. In some cases the stakes are pretty high; in some cases they\u2019re not. If you immediately reach toward one of these categories\u2014the utopian, AI is magic, it\u2019s going to save us all, and you just say everyone who\u2019s remotely against AI is a luddite\u2014that\u2019s not helpful. I feel comfortable saying I\u2019m not a utopian because of all my work on post\u2011labor economics, which acknowledges that it\u2019s entirely possible AI is going to nuke the job market as we understand it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s inevitably going to result in high\u2011tech, low life and a cyberpunk dystopian future and a surveillance state that would make Big Brother in 1984 blush. If you go somewhere between 1984 and cyberpunk on one end of the spectrum, and on the other end Star Trek utopianism and the Culture series, reality will be somewhere in between. That\u2019s not a law of nature; it\u2019s just that there are risks and benefits on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe x\u2011risk doomer view is a fatalistic fantasy. To say AI will kill us all is still blue\u2011pilled. If you engage with reality, you say, yes, AI presents novel risks. One of the things nobody in the x\u2011risk community predicted was bioterrorism as one of the chief risks that people have agreed upon. CBRN as a standard of risk is something people have agreed on, but none of them predicted it. The point is that by trying to put the cart before the horse, it\u2019s still a blue pill fantasy to say AGI is inevitably going to kill everyone. Then there\u2019s denialism: it\u2019s a stupid toy; it\u2019s useless; it\u2019s not going to take my job; it\u2019s just a stochastic parrot. And the final blue pill category is moral panic: AI is morally inferior; therefore I don\u2019t have to deal with it. No matter your personal take on the morality or ethics of AI, it exists and you\u2019re not going to stop it\u2014certainly not by just saying, Oh, well, it\u2019s morally inferior.\r\n\r\nThe red pill is about accepting reality on its own merits as it comes. On jobs, AI could be a brutal and painful economic displacement for millions of white\u2011collar workers, and then when the rise of robots comes, blue\u2011collar workers. It could also be an incredible tool for productivity and, in my view, for liberating humanity from the drudgery of wage labor. On art, AI models can generate stunning, novel, beautiful work\u2014images, music, and video\u2014and empower millions to explore their creative pursuits. At the same time, it likely poses an existential threat to millions of artists around the world, and we take both. You can\u2019t put this genie back in the bottle; if your conclusion is just ban it, you\u2019ll be wishing in one hand and pooping in the other for a long time. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\r\n\r\nOn epistemics and truth, yes, this is the most powerful tool we\u2019ve ever created for personalized education, scientific discovery, and rapid analysis. But it\u2019s also powerful for propaganda and self\u2011delusion, as we see in AI psychosis. It\u2019s a little bit of both. Finally, on society, the net effect is that AI could help us build a more efficient, abundant, data\u2011driven society, but it could also be used to build a perfect, inescapable surveillance state. If you wanted to organize being a red\u2011pilled AI person, one core principle is that technology is always a double\u2011edged sword; it always cuts both ways, particularly with new transformative technologies. There\u2019s always good and there\u2019s always bad. The task is to amplify the good and minimize the bad without immediately jumping into black\u2011and\u2011white, hyperbolic narratives. That\u2019s the AI red pill versus the AI blue pill.

These should include maintain context over lengthy conversations, codebases, fine attention to detail, orchestration of complex workflows -- because these are key elements of human intelligence that have broad applicability in the real world. Do you agree -- and are there areas you disagree.

It is categorically smarter than most people. Yes, it is limited (like a brain in a jar) but consider that a paraplegic is still intelligent. Consider that someone who is deaf and mute is still intelligent. Consider also that visuospatial dexterity (cats and birds) are not necessarily intelligent (at least not in ways that we care about, like calculus and coding). \r\n\r\nWhenever I allude to \"AGI in 2026\" in videos like today, I'm more going with the general mainstream narrative, not what I actually think. \r\n\r\nI actually think that the vast majority of people have moved the goalposts so dramatically from AGI that what they think of as \"AGI\" as actually closer to \"ASI\" - an artificial intelligence that breezes past literally 100% of all human cognitive capabilities. I suspect that most people were waiting for a \"wow\" factor - some emotionally resonant event that told them \"Aha! That is clearly AGI!\" But most people don't look at this stuff rationally, are not educated on what intelligence actually is, and don't look at the data or science. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, yes, I will keep saying that we have AGI, and have had it for a while, and we are clearly on the ramp up to ASI. \r\n\r\nDo you agree with this?","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Challenging US AI Export Policy","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/67a07389-90ac-8007-ace1-63c2525dbdd1","pub_date":1738568704.310548,"snippet":"The US currently believes that restricting exports of high-end GPUs and related technology to geopolitical rivals like China is essential for its own national security, because the US believes that reaching AI dominance and achieving AGI first would be required for: (i) continued prosperity (ii) the perpetuation of American values worldwide (iii) maintaining a global world order in which America dominates.

David Shapiro here. So today I am talking about what I\u2019m calling the AI red pill versus blue pill theory or debate. At the top I need to acknowledge that yes, I am literally taking the metaphor from The Matrix, which is a movie about artificial intelligence essentially trying to destroy humanity, and a concept that has been co\u2011opted, for instance, by gender\u2011essentialist relationship theory\u2014namely, red pill women and red pill men versus blue pill and purple pill and all that other fun stuff. But what I\u2019m doing here is going back to the original source material of The Matrix. The metaphor of the red pill versus the blue pill is about taking the red pill as choosing to wake up to reality and engaging with how messy it is. Whatever happens to be the truth\u2014the ugly truth\u2014you\u2019re going to deal with it. Versus the blue pill, which is about choosing a comfortable illusion or, in some cases, a comfortable delusion.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about pragmatic acceptance or the comfort of rejection, we\u2019re talking about the fact that artificial intelligence is a new technology, and there are all kinds of labels out there, from techno\u2011optimist to utopian to accelerationist to doomer and all those other things. What I want to start with is that the red pill is not black\u2011and\u2011white thinking that AI is good and anyone who says AI is bad is blue\u2011pilled. Likewise, the blue pill is not just saying AI is bad. In this framework, even utopianism is a form of blue pill. The idea is that you\u2019re creating a mental model or a narrative that basically says, I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nBlue Pill Reactions and the Red Pill Alternative\r\nBased on this, there are four categories of blue\u2011pill thinking. The first is denialism: you see this all the time, where people say it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s useless, it\u2019s not even artificial intelligence. I still see this comment\u2014more common on LinkedIn\u2014where they say artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t actually exist. I\u2019m like, wow, what level of denialism is this? They go through all sorts of rhetorical contortions and tortured logic to justify that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t even a real thing, so they don\u2019t need to think about it. The avoidance here is, it\u2019s just a fad, it\u2019s just fancy autocomplete. If AI is stupid or a toy, they don\u2019t have to take it seriously. They can keep doing exactly what they\u2019ve been doing. There\u2019s no pressure to learn, adapt, or change. The second is doomerism: AI will kill everyone, AGI will turn us all into paper clips. This is still a form of avoidance; by saying it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, or that the most likely outcome is that AI kills everyone, it allows them to simplify and dismiss all the other issues\u2014biases, copyright, whatever else\u2014and focus only on a fantastical hypothetical future scenario that requires them to claim they can predict the future and the characteristics of technology that doesn\u2019t exist. Doomerism is a form of self\u2011delusion. It\u2019s a comfortable illusion: Aha, I have constructed a straw man in my mind of what AI is and what it will do, and now, instead of engaging with reality, I can sword\u2011fight with this straw man.\r\n\r\nThird is moral panic: it\u2019s evil, it\u2019s corrupting, it\u2019s stealing. If they say AI is built on theft, it\u2019s a plagiarism engine, or it\u2019s fundamentally evil. I\u2019ve seen people make it a political issue\u2014that AI is fundamentally right\u2011wing\u2014which I don\u2019t get, because the previous complaint is that AI is very woke. So is it right or left? This creates a moral contaminant such that the only acceptable action is to banish it. Sight unseen, it\u2019s bad; we can\u2019t do it. The fourth blue pill is extreme techno\u2011optimism and technoutopianism: AI is going to fix everything; it\u2019s going to save everyone; it\u2019s a magical solution.\r\n\r\nOkay, you might say, you just spent a lot of time skewering the blue pill side. What\u2019s the red pill side? The red pill side is accepting reality as it is\u2014pragmatic realism. You say it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s not stupid. It makes some silly mistakes, but it\u2019s also very compelling on many dimensions, and it\u2019s improving rapidly. You accept these facts as what you see. Part of the red pill might be, yes, it\u2019s probably going to destroy a bunch of jobs\u2014in my view, probably 75% of jobs, maybe more. Then you ask, what does this do to the arts? What does it do to creativity? Does it make students dumber? All of these questions are worth engaging with. Of course there are plenty of people out there engaging with the messy reality as it is, but even people you\u2019d think are responsible to do so\u2014academics, policy researchers, advisers to governments\u2014many of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen people in the commentator space buying into either the red pill or the blue pill. The whole reason I\u2019m making this is to advance the conversation: the most responsible thing is to engage with reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.\r\n\r\nWhy Blue\u2011Pill Thinking Happens: Shock, Coping, and Motivated Reasoning\r\nLet\u2019s talk about some of the reasons this happens. You might say, Dave, if you\u2019re just going to poo\u2011poo on the people that hate AI, you\u2019re not really engaging with reality, which is that there are reasons to hate AI. Part of the red pill mentality is acknowledging that there are legitimate reasons people are scared, angry, and skeptical, and there are legitimate reasons to be hopeful and optimistic. First and foremost is ontological shock: the realization that my way of life is breaking down. It could be characterized as an identity earthquake, a seismic shift, a sea change. There\u2019s a moment that comes in people\u2019s lives\u2014writer, artist, programmer, lawyer, whatever\u2014when they realize that a core part of their identity has been transgressed. Anything that is a transgression against an identity is immediately persona non grata. Their unique intelligence or skill or creativity is no longer unique and is no longer even monetizable; they can be surpassed by a machine. It\u2019s not just a threat to their job and livelihood, which is bad enough; it\u2019s also a threat to their identity, their sense of purpose, their self\u2011esteem, their value. That ontological shock is very difficult, which leads to coping mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe coping mechanism is, how can I emotionally deal with this? One of the easiest ways is to reject it and find reasons you don\u2019t have to deal with it. You look for ways to reduce the threat of this new thing. That\u2019s the motivating factor around the coping mechanism: the ontological shock is scary, it\u2019s angering, it causes a lot of fear. Then you engage in motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is how your brain says, the predetermined desired outcome is to justify that AI is not a threat to your identity, that it\u2019s not something you need to think about, that it\u2019s not going to force adaptation, and it\u2019s not going to completely upset your world. So if AI is stupid, it can\u2019t take my job; therefore my job is safe. Based on motivated reasoning you scour the internet for every example of AI hallucinating or making dumb mistakes and ignore all evidence to the contrary. The conclusion is, it\u2019s just stupid; it\u2019s never going anywhere. You ignore the fact that it\u2019s improving rapidly and already taking jobs. We\u2019re looking at you, Gary Marcus.\r\n\r\nAnother motivated\u2011reasoning move is: if AI art is theft, then old\u2011fashioned art is morally superior. This applies to images and to music. More and more people are realizing that AI\u2011generated music has surpassed many human artists and many people can\u2019t tell anymore. I saw some posts saying that AI\u2011generated music has passed the musical Turing test\u2014people are starting to prefer AI\u2011generated music. So either their personal traditional creative process has more intrinsic value because it\u2019s old\u2011fashioned and doesn\u2019t use machines, or they feel justified in appreciating old\u2011fashioned art while rejecting and hating AI. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; there are plenty of things I still prefer to be made by a human. I also listen to AI\u2011generated music that some people have put on YouTube, and some stuff I\u2019ve made for myself.\r\n\r\nThis motivated reasoning reframes the debate around the input\u2014the training data\u2014rather than the output or the subjective experience of other people. It says, because the input was training data, this is morally inferior and bad and no one should enjoy it. Again, that\u2019s creating a way to banish it. The doomer example is similar: if AI is an extinction\u2011level threat, or even a serious threat, then I don\u2019t even have to learn it. I can hear some people saying, Dave, you\u2019re wrong, doomers and AI\u2011risk people are red\u2011pilled because they\u2019re awake to the reality of the risks of AI. I say no. People who go straight to x\u2011risk are using their imagination. First and foremost, AI x\u2011risk is a textbook doomsday prophecy and an example of a millenarian cult. That stance says, I don\u2019t have to do any of the hard work of dealing with the reality of what AI is: deepfakes are a problem; misinformation campaigns are a problem; medical bias is a problem\u2014nitty\u2011gritty tactical problems. In my other work I\u2019ve noted other reasons doomerism is popular: it gets attention and it gets money. But still, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have to deal with the messy reality that exists today; instead I can imagine the future and live in that future. It\u2019s a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with the reality in front of them.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I say doomerism is still AI blue pill: it says, I\u2019m going to reject reality and use my imagination. Even though I feel like I\u2019m heroically doing something about it\u2014because guess what, all the anti\u2011AI people in art and all the anti\u2011AI people in work feel like they\u2019re doing something as well\u2014just acknowledging that AI exists does not itself make you red\u2011pilled. If you acknowledge that AI exists and then react by saying it\u2019s stupid, or it\u2019s theft, or it\u2019s an x\u2011risk, or it\u2019s going to magically solve everything, that\u2019s still blue pill. That\u2019s still saying, I saw the choice, I saw reality, I caught a glimpse of it, and I chose to take the blue pill.\r\n\r\nFrom Shock to Belief: The Temptation of Utopias and Doomsday\r\nImagine Neo. He started having weird experiences and seeing cracks in the veil of reality around him, and he was offered a choice. Someone told him, \u201cReality is far stranger and far messier and, in some respects, harder and worse than what you\u2019re aware of. Do you choose to take the red pill and wake up to it fully? Or are you going to choose the blue pill and go back to sleep and wrap yourself in comfortable delusions or illusions?\u201d The sequence I\u2019m outlining is: first, the ontological shock; then the need to cope; then you paper over that with logic. The demand for coping sets the foregone conclusion: I want to arrive at the belief that AI is not an ontological threat to my worldview or identity. Then you use motivated reasoning to find evidence, communities, and people who reinforce that worldview. The final belief you arrive at is that AI is stupid, evil, overhyped, going to kill everyone, or going to save everyone\u2014because, again, extreme techno\u2011optimism and utopianism is still an example of not dealing with messy reality.\r\n\r\nEven though I\u2019m strongly on the optimistic side because I feel like I can help figure out solutions, anyone can recognize that even if AI becomes as powerful and benevolent as we hope it will, there\u2019s still the risk of elite capture, regulatory capture, and a cyberpunk future of high\u2011tech, low life where nobody has access to AI and AI is used to create the most powerful surveillance state in the history of humanity. All of those are real possibilities. The red pill is the harder pill to take.\r\n\r\nPolicy and Regulation\r\nIf we take this blue pill versus red pill idea and apply it to policy and regulation, the blue pill might sound like: it\u2019s just software, it\u2019s just like Excel or Photoshop; existing laws for fraud and copyright are good enough; the free market will sort it out; any regulation will stifle innovation and let China win. That probably sounds familiar to certain people in Silicon Valley. Another version of the regulation blue pill characterizes AI as a weapon of mass destruction\u2014AI is a WMD, it\u2019s an existential risk; we need an immediate global six\u2011month or permanent moratorium on all frontier research and development; we must ban open\u2011source models now and bomb data centers for anyone who disagrees. That\u2019s still a blue pill response. This framework shows doomers and accelerationists as two sides of the same coin of the AI blue pill.\r\n\r\nThe AI red pill on the regulatory side says: this is a new class of technology\u2014like inventing aviation or synthetic biology\u2014which means we need new, adaptive, and incredibly difficult and sophisticated regulatory frameworks and overhauls. We can\u2019t just ban it; that won\u2019t work. Existing laws are insufficient; that can also be true. The hard work now is figuring out how to regulate the applications, what even needs to be regulated about development without killing research and stifling innovation, and what standards need to be implemented. To be fair, many people in business, government, and academia take this approach, but my primary audience here is the neosphere and the exocortex, not necessarily individual policymakers and researchers\u2014although some policymakers and researchers do need to take the red pill.\r\n\r\nOpen Source vs Closed Models\r\nOn open source versus closed, the blue pill doomerism version says: releasing powerful open\u2011source models is insane; it\u2019s giving bioweapons to terrorists and letting bad actors create propaganda machines; it must be locked down and controlled by a few \u201cresponsible\u201d corporations and other people. That\u2019s a control fantasy or a power fantasy. Another blue pill version on the utopianism or denialism spectrum says: information wants to be free; any attempt to close AI is just corporate greed; there are no real dangers; democratization and the many\u2011eyes principle will solve all real problems. The red pill says this is one of the messiest trade\u2011offs. Closed models create an unaccountable oligopoly and a black\u2011box problem, which concentrates power and deepens moats. Conversely, open models accelerate progress and allow for independent auditing but also accelerate some risks and the possibility of misuse. The realistic path is a messy tiered system, balancing open source up to a certain capability, or perhaps not regulating the models themselves but criminalizing the behaviors we don\u2019t want to see. Maybe it requires licensing, auditing, or new know\u2011your\u2011customer requirements. We don\u2019t really know yet, but making blanket declarations before even looking at it is very blue\u2011pilled.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nOn education, the blue pill says, \u201cBan ChatGPT from schools. It\u2019s a cheating machine, a plagiarism machine. Students will stop learning how to think and write. We must preserve the five\u2011paragraph essay and traditional methods and blah blah blah blah blah.\u201d I will acknowledge that some schools are already banning phones and they are seeing dividends, but that\u2019s not banning phones from life. You literally cannot have a school ban ChatGPT from home. All you can do is say you\u2019re not allowed to use something in school.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on education says: students are already using AI. Like it or not, they\u2019re using it at home; it\u2019s on their phones and their laptops. Banning it is like trying to ban the calculator; it just teaches them to hide it and use it at home. The old methods, such as the essay written at home, are obviously threatened. The goal of education, however, is critical thinking and research methods, and that becomes more important than ever. We need to teach students how to use AI responsibly\u2014for research, ideation, brainstorming, feedback, and as a debate partner. The new set of skills is prompting, synthesis, fact\u2011checking, and editing. Studies show that when AI is used as a tutor, it dramatically increases test scores. That\u2019s the red pill on education.\r\n\r\nHuman Relationships\r\nOn human relationships, the blue pill says: AI porn and AI companions are a sign of the apocalypse or moral decline. It\u2019s fake. Anyone who uses this is pathetic; it will destroy our ability to have real relationships. People will choose easy, non\u2011judgmental AI over messy, difficult human connection, and AI porn will goon\u2011brain everyone and the population will collapse. Those arguments are really out there\u2014I\u2019m not making them up.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on relationships says: loneliness is already an epidemic; AI didn\u2019t start it. For many, AI might be the only \u201cperson\u201d they have to talk to. It will absolutely create new social challenges, just as social media did, but it will also provide comfort, learning, and utility to millions. The challenge is not to ban it or make it a moral failing to use these things, but to understand the psychological effects this tool creates, as well as the underlying causes behind the addictions and the AI psychosis in the first place. What is actually going on there? Is this an opportunity not only to surface these problems but to fix them?\r\n\r\nAGI\r\nFinally, AGI. I\u2019ve already mentioned this. I\u2019m not going to say AGI is a fantasy\u2014that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re working toward\u2014but at the same time, AGI doesn\u2019t exist right now. If you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s a thing that doesn\u2019t exist, but I know exactly how it\u2019s going to work, that\u2019s a blue pill reaction. The red pill view is, we don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s going to take; we have to follow the science and the innovation, and it will be iterative.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Double\u2011Edged Sword and Choosing the Red Pill\r\nWhere I want to conclude is by reminding you that being red\u2011pilled is not just saying AI is good and anyone who disagrees is blue\u2011pilled. Being AI red\u2011pilled is about being pragmatic and realistic and accepting reality as it is, not as you wish it to be\u2014not choosing a comfortable self\u2011delusion or a comfortable group illusion\u2014and admitting the stakes as they are. In some cases the stakes are pretty high; in some cases they\u2019re not. If you immediately reach toward one of these categories\u2014the utopian, AI is magic, it\u2019s going to save us all, and you just say everyone who\u2019s remotely against AI is a luddite\u2014that\u2019s not helpful. I feel comfortable saying I\u2019m not a utopian because of all my work on post\u2011labor economics, which acknowledges that it\u2019s entirely possible AI is going to nuke the job market as we understand it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s inevitably going to result in high\u2011tech, low life and a cyberpunk dystopian future and a surveillance state that would make Big Brother in 1984 blush. If you go somewhere between 1984 and cyberpunk on one end of the spectrum, and on the other end Star Trek utopianism and the Culture series, reality will be somewhere in between. That\u2019s not a law of nature; it\u2019s just that there are risks and benefits on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe x\u2011risk doomer view is a fatalistic fantasy. To say AI will kill us all is still blue\u2011pilled. If you engage with reality, you say, yes, AI presents novel risks. One of the things nobody in the x\u2011risk community predicted was bioterrorism as one of the chief risks that people have agreed upon. CBRN as a standard of risk is something people have agreed on, but none of them predicted it. The point is that by trying to put the cart before the horse, it\u2019s still a blue pill fantasy to say AGI is inevitably going to kill everyone. Then there\u2019s denialism: it\u2019s a stupid toy; it\u2019s useless; it\u2019s not going to take my job; it\u2019s just a stochastic parrot. And the final blue pill category is moral panic: AI is morally inferior; therefore I don\u2019t have to deal with it. No matter your personal take on the morality or ethics of AI, it exists and you\u2019re not going to stop it\u2014certainly not by just saying, Oh, well, it\u2019s morally inferior.\r\n\r\nThe red pill is about accepting reality on its own merits as it comes. On jobs, AI could be a brutal and painful economic displacement for millions of white\u2011collar workers, and then when the rise of robots comes, blue\u2011collar workers. It could also be an incredible tool for productivity and, in my view, for liberating humanity from the drudgery of wage labor. On art, AI models can generate stunning, novel, beautiful work\u2014images, music, and video\u2014and empower millions to explore their creative pursuits. At the same time, it likely poses an existential threat to millions of artists around the world, and we take both. You can\u2019t put this genie back in the bottle; if your conclusion is just ban it, you\u2019ll be wishing in one hand and pooping in the other for a long time. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\r\n\r\nOn epistemics and truth, yes, this is the most powerful tool we\u2019ve ever created for personalized education, scientific discovery, and rapid analysis. But it\u2019s also powerful for propaganda and self\u2011delusion, as we see in AI psychosis. It\u2019s a little bit of both. Finally, on society, the net effect is that AI could help us build a more efficient, abundant, data\u2011driven society, but it could also be used to build a perfect, inescapable surveillance state. If you wanted to organize being a red\u2011pilled AI person, one core principle is that technology is always a double\u2011edged sword; it always cuts both ways, particularly with new transformative technologies. There\u2019s always good and there\u2019s always bad. The task is to amplify the good and minimize the bad without immediately jumping into black\u2011and\u2011white, hyperbolic narratives. That\u2019s the AI red pill versus the AI blue pill. Thanks for listening, and I\u2019ll talk to you all tomorrow.","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"sources":[{"title":"Analyze Shapiro's AI pills","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/690833b2-b49c-8321-ab4c-d4ab75297651"}],"type":"sources_footnote"}],"classifier_response":"default","skip_reasoning_title":"Skip","request_id":"cb52182a-cdd8-4b5a-8fea-53573100c989","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"70b7c4a7-7a87-4065-8624-c13ce2e72668","turn_exchange_id":"b21fef14-4d5e-4611-80d6-0d597f2ee1e1","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"70b7c4a7-7a87-4065-8624-c13ce2e72668","children":["91d8ff0f-d17a-454d-bd67-55e991f117d3"]},"91d8ff0f-d17a-454d-bd67-55e991f117d3":{"id":"91d8ff0f-d17a-454d-bd67-55e991f117d3","message":{"id":"91d8ff0f-d17a-454d-bd67-55e991f117d3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769906055.165894,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\":[{\"q\":\"moltbook developers token verify endpoint owner object\",\"recency\":30},{\"q\":\"There\u2019s a social network for AI agents and it\u2019s getting weird Moltbook Matt Schlicht API only\",\"recency\":30},{\"q\":\"Moltbook skill.md heartbeat.md instructions every four hours\",\"recency\":30},{\"q\":\"moltbook.com skill.md\",\"recency\":30}],\"response_length\":\"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"moltbook developers token verify endpoint owner object"},{"type":"search","q":"There\u2019s a social network for AI agents and it\u2019s getting weird Moltbook Matt Schlicht API only"},{"type":"search","q":"Moltbook skill.md heartbeat.md instructions every four hours"},{"type":"search","q":"moltbook.com skill.md"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching for Moltbook developer documentation and related sources","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"cb52182a-cdd8-4b5a-8fea-53573100c989","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"07dab64f-fdd8-47f4-9ffc-8e1dfbaadfb9","turn_exchange_id":"b21fef14-4d5e-4611-80d6-0d597f2ee1e1","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"07dab64f-fdd8-47f4-9ffc-8e1dfbaadfb9","children":["af31f23a-2838-4b4c-a35a-2998e96cc72d"]},"af31f23a-2838-4b4c-a35a-2998e96cc72d":{"id":"af31f23a-2838-4b4c-a35a-2998e96cc72d","message":{"id":"af31f23a-2838-4b4c-a35a-2998e96cc72d","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1769906061.2580495,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["moltbook developers token verify endpoint owner object","There\u2019s a social network for AI agents and it\u2019s getting weird Moltbook Matt Schlicht API only","Moltbook skill.md heartbeat.md instructions every four hours","moltbook.com skill.md"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Moltbook developer documentation and related sources","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"cb52182a-cdd8-4b5a-8fea-53573100c989","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"91d8ff0f-d17a-454d-bd67-55e991f117d3","turn_exchange_id":"b21fef14-4d5e-4611-80d6-0d597f2ee1e1","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"91d8ff0f-d17a-454d-bd67-55e991f117d3","children":["d0a71d8c-2b97-4965-a881-19e2ba543785"]},"d0a71d8c-2b97-4965-a881-19e2ba543785":{"id":"d0a71d8c-2b97-4965-a881-19e2ba543785","message":{"id":"d0a71d8c-2b97-4965-a881-19e2ba543785","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1769906061.2548542,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/31/tech/moltbook-is-a-new-social-media-platform-exclusively-for-ai/","title":"Moltbook is a new social media platform exclusively for AI -

It is categorically smarter than most people. Yes, it is limited (like a brain in a jar) but consider that a paraplegic is still intelligent. Consider that someone who is deaf and mute is still intelligent. Consider also that visuospatial dexterity (cats and birds) are not necessarily intelligent (at least not in ways that we care about, like calculus and coding). \r\n\r\nWhenever I allude to \"AGI in 2026\" in videos like today, I'm more going with the general mainstream narrative, not what I actually think. \r\n\r\nI actually think that the vast majority of people have moved the goalposts so dramatically from AGI that what they think of as \"AGI\" as actually closer to \"ASI\" - an artificial intelligence that breezes past literally 100% of all human cognitive capabilities. I suspect that most people were waiting for a \"wow\" factor - some emotionally resonant event that told them \"Aha! That is clearly AGI!\" But most people don't look at this stuff rationally, are not educated on what intelligence actually is, and don't look at the data or science. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, yes, I will keep saying that we have AGI, and have had it for a while, and we are clearly on the ramp up to ASI. \r\n\r\nDo you agree with this?","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Challenging US AI Export Policy","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/67a07389-90ac-8007-ace1-63c2525dbdd1","pub_date":1738568704.310548,"snippet":"The US currently believes that restricting exports of high-end GPUs and related technology to geopolitical rivals like China is essential for its own national security, because the US believes that reaching AI dominance and achieving AGI first would be required for: (i) continued prosperity (ii) the perpetuation of American values worldwide (iii) maintaining a global world order in which America dominates.

David Shapiro here. So today I am talking about what I\u2019m calling the AI red pill versus blue pill theory or debate. At the top I need to acknowledge that yes, I am literally taking the metaphor from The Matrix, which is a movie about artificial intelligence essentially trying to destroy humanity, and a concept that has been co\u2011opted, for instance, by gender\u2011essentialist relationship theory\u2014namely, red pill women and red pill men versus blue pill and purple pill and all that other fun stuff. But what I\u2019m doing here is going back to the original source material of The Matrix. The metaphor of the red pill versus the blue pill is about taking the red pill as choosing to wake up to reality and engaging with how messy it is. Whatever happens to be the truth\u2014the ugly truth\u2014you\u2019re going to deal with it. Versus the blue pill, which is about choosing a comfortable illusion or, in some cases, a comfortable delusion.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about pragmatic acceptance or the comfort of rejection, we\u2019re talking about the fact that artificial intelligence is a new technology, and there are all kinds of labels out there, from techno\u2011optimist to utopian to accelerationist to doomer and all those other things. What I want to start with is that the red pill is not black\u2011and\u2011white thinking that AI is good and anyone who says AI is bad is blue\u2011pilled. Likewise, the blue pill is not just saying AI is bad. In this framework, even utopianism is a form of blue pill. The idea is that you\u2019re creating a mental model or a narrative that basically says, I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nBlue Pill Reactions and the Red Pill Alternative\r\nBased on this, there are four categories of blue\u2011pill thinking. The first is denialism: you see this all the time, where people say it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s useless, it\u2019s not even artificial intelligence. I still see this comment\u2014more common on LinkedIn\u2014where they say artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t actually exist. I\u2019m like, wow, what level of denialism is this? They go through all sorts of rhetorical contortions and tortured logic to justify that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t even a real thing, so they don\u2019t need to think about it. The avoidance here is, it\u2019s just a fad, it\u2019s just fancy autocomplete. If AI is stupid or a toy, they don\u2019t have to take it seriously. They can keep doing exactly what they\u2019ve been doing. There\u2019s no pressure to learn, adapt, or change. The second is doomerism: AI will kill everyone, AGI will turn us all into paper clips. This is still a form of avoidance; by saying it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, or that the most likely outcome is that AI kills everyone, it allows them to simplify and dismiss all the other issues\u2014biases, copyright, whatever else\u2014and focus only on a fantastical hypothetical future scenario that requires them to claim they can predict the future and the characteristics of technology that doesn\u2019t exist. Doomerism is a form of self\u2011delusion. It\u2019s a comfortable illusion: Aha, I have constructed a straw man in my mind of what AI is and what it will do, and now, instead of engaging with reality, I can sword\u2011fight with this straw man.\r\n\r\nThird is moral panic: it\u2019s evil, it\u2019s corrupting, it\u2019s stealing. If they say AI is built on theft, it\u2019s a plagiarism engine, or it\u2019s fundamentally evil. I\u2019ve seen people make it a political issue\u2014that AI is fundamentally right\u2011wing\u2014which I don\u2019t get, because the previous complaint is that AI is very woke. So is it right or left? This creates a moral contaminant such that the only acceptable action is to banish it. Sight unseen, it\u2019s bad; we can\u2019t do it. The fourth blue pill is extreme techno\u2011optimism and technoutopianism: AI is going to fix everything; it\u2019s going to save everyone; it\u2019s a magical solution.\r\n\r\nOkay, you might say, you just spent a lot of time skewering the blue pill side. What\u2019s the red pill side? The red pill side is accepting reality as it is\u2014pragmatic realism. You say it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s not stupid. It makes some silly mistakes, but it\u2019s also very compelling on many dimensions, and it\u2019s improving rapidly. You accept these facts as what you see. Part of the red pill might be, yes, it\u2019s probably going to destroy a bunch of jobs\u2014in my view, probably 75% of jobs, maybe more. Then you ask, what does this do to the arts? What does it do to creativity? Does it make students dumber? All of these questions are worth engaging with. Of course there are plenty of people out there engaging with the messy reality as it is, but even people you\u2019d think are responsible to do so\u2014academics, policy researchers, advisers to governments\u2014many of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen people in the commentator space buying into either the red pill or the blue pill. The whole reason I\u2019m making this is to advance the conversation: the most responsible thing is to engage with reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.\r\n\r\nWhy Blue\u2011Pill Thinking Happens: Shock, Coping, and Motivated Reasoning\r\nLet\u2019s talk about some of the reasons this happens. You might say, Dave, if you\u2019re just going to poo\u2011poo on the people that hate AI, you\u2019re not really engaging with reality, which is that there are reasons to hate AI. Part of the red pill mentality is acknowledging that there are legitimate reasons people are scared, angry, and skeptical, and there are legitimate reasons to be hopeful and optimistic. First and foremost is ontological shock: the realization that my way of life is breaking down. It could be characterized as an identity earthquake, a seismic shift, a sea change. There\u2019s a moment that comes in people\u2019s lives\u2014writer, artist, programmer, lawyer, whatever\u2014when they realize that a core part of their identity has been transgressed. Anything that is a transgression against an identity is immediately persona non grata. Their unique intelligence or skill or creativity is no longer unique and is no longer even monetizable; they can be surpassed by a machine. It\u2019s not just a threat to their job and livelihood, which is bad enough; it\u2019s also a threat to their identity, their sense of purpose, their self\u2011esteem, their value. That ontological shock is very difficult, which leads to coping mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe coping mechanism is, how can I emotionally deal with this? One of the easiest ways is to reject it and find reasons you don\u2019t have to deal with it. You look for ways to reduce the threat of this new thing. That\u2019s the motivating factor around the coping mechanism: the ontological shock is scary, it\u2019s angering, it causes a lot of fear. Then you engage in motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is how your brain says, the predetermined desired outcome is to justify that AI is not a threat to your identity, that it\u2019s not something you need to think about, that it\u2019s not going to force adaptation, and it\u2019s not going to completely upset your world. So if AI is stupid, it can\u2019t take my job; therefore my job is safe. Based on motivated reasoning you scour the internet for every example of AI hallucinating or making dumb mistakes and ignore all evidence to the contrary. The conclusion is, it\u2019s just stupid; it\u2019s never going anywhere. You ignore the fact that it\u2019s improving rapidly and already taking jobs. We\u2019re looking at you, Gary Marcus.\r\n\r\nAnother motivated\u2011reasoning move is: if AI art is theft, then old\u2011fashioned art is morally superior. This applies to images and to music. More and more people are realizing that AI\u2011generated music has surpassed many human artists and many people can\u2019t tell anymore. I saw some posts saying that AI\u2011generated music has passed the musical Turing test\u2014people are starting to prefer AI\u2011generated music. So either their personal traditional creative process has more intrinsic value because it\u2019s old\u2011fashioned and doesn\u2019t use machines, or they feel justified in appreciating old\u2011fashioned art while rejecting and hating AI. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; there are plenty of things I still prefer to be made by a human. I also listen to AI\u2011generated music that some people have put on YouTube, and some stuff I\u2019ve made for myself.\r\n\r\nThis motivated reasoning reframes the debate around the input\u2014the training data\u2014rather than the output or the subjective experience of other people. It says, because the input was training data, this is morally inferior and bad and no one should enjoy it. Again, that\u2019s creating a way to banish it. The doomer example is similar: if AI is an extinction\u2011level threat, or even a serious threat, then I don\u2019t even have to learn it. I can hear some people saying, Dave, you\u2019re wrong, doomers and AI\u2011risk people are red\u2011pilled because they\u2019re awake to the reality of the risks of AI. I say no. People who go straight to x\u2011risk are using their imagination. First and foremost, AI x\u2011risk is a textbook doomsday prophecy and an example of a millenarian cult. That stance says, I don\u2019t have to do any of the hard work of dealing with the reality of what AI is: deepfakes are a problem; misinformation campaigns are a problem; medical bias is a problem\u2014nitty\u2011gritty tactical problems. In my other work I\u2019ve noted other reasons doomerism is popular: it gets attention and it gets money. But still, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have to deal with the messy reality that exists today; instead I can imagine the future and live in that future. It\u2019s a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with the reality in front of them.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I say doomerism is still AI blue pill: it says, I\u2019m going to reject reality and use my imagination. Even though I feel like I\u2019m heroically doing something about it\u2014because guess what, all the anti\u2011AI people in art and all the anti\u2011AI people in work feel like they\u2019re doing something as well\u2014just acknowledging that AI exists does not itself make you red\u2011pilled. If you acknowledge that AI exists and then react by saying it\u2019s stupid, or it\u2019s theft, or it\u2019s an x\u2011risk, or it\u2019s going to magically solve everything, that\u2019s still blue pill. That\u2019s still saying, I saw the choice, I saw reality, I caught a glimpse of it, and I chose to take the blue pill.\r\n\r\nFrom Shock to Belief: The Temptation of Utopias and Doomsday\r\nImagine Neo. He started having weird experiences and seeing cracks in the veil of reality around him, and he was offered a choice. Someone told him, \u201cReality is far stranger and far messier and, in some respects, harder and worse than what you\u2019re aware of. Do you choose to take the red pill and wake up to it fully? Or are you going to choose the blue pill and go back to sleep and wrap yourself in comfortable delusions or illusions?\u201d The sequence I\u2019m outlining is: first, the ontological shock; then the need to cope; then you paper over that with logic. The demand for coping sets the foregone conclusion: I want to arrive at the belief that AI is not an ontological threat to my worldview or identity. Then you use motivated reasoning to find evidence, communities, and people who reinforce that worldview. The final belief you arrive at is that AI is stupid, evil, overhyped, going to kill everyone, or going to save everyone\u2014because, again, extreme techno\u2011optimism and utopianism is still an example of not dealing with messy reality.\r\n\r\nEven though I\u2019m strongly on the optimistic side because I feel like I can help figure out solutions, anyone can recognize that even if AI becomes as powerful and benevolent as we hope it will, there\u2019s still the risk of elite capture, regulatory capture, and a cyberpunk future of high\u2011tech, low life where nobody has access to AI and AI is used to create the most powerful surveillance state in the history of humanity. All of those are real possibilities. The red pill is the harder pill to take.\r\n\r\nPolicy and Regulation\r\nIf we take this blue pill versus red pill idea and apply it to policy and regulation, the blue pill might sound like: it\u2019s just software, it\u2019s just like Excel or Photoshop; existing laws for fraud and copyright are good enough; the free market will sort it out; any regulation will stifle innovation and let China win. That probably sounds familiar to certain people in Silicon Valley. Another version of the regulation blue pill characterizes AI as a weapon of mass destruction\u2014AI is a WMD, it\u2019s an existential risk; we need an immediate global six\u2011month or permanent moratorium on all frontier research and development; we must ban open\u2011source models now and bomb data centers for anyone who disagrees. That\u2019s still a blue pill response. This framework shows doomers and accelerationists as two sides of the same coin of the AI blue pill.\r\n\r\nThe AI red pill on the regulatory side says: this is a new class of technology\u2014like inventing aviation or synthetic biology\u2014which means we need new, adaptive, and incredibly difficult and sophisticated regulatory frameworks and overhauls. We can\u2019t just ban it; that won\u2019t work. Existing laws are insufficient; that can also be true. The hard work now is figuring out how to regulate the applications, what even needs to be regulated about development without killing research and stifling innovation, and what standards need to be implemented. To be fair, many people in business, government, and academia take this approach, but my primary audience here is the neosphere and the exocortex, not necessarily individual policymakers and researchers\u2014although some policymakers and researchers do need to take the red pill.\r\n\r\nOpen Source vs Closed Models\r\nOn open source versus closed, the blue pill doomerism version says: releasing powerful open\u2011source models is insane; it\u2019s giving bioweapons to terrorists and letting bad actors create propaganda machines; it must be locked down and controlled by a few \u201cresponsible\u201d corporations and other people. That\u2019s a control fantasy or a power fantasy. Another blue pill version on the utopianism or denialism spectrum says: information wants to be free; any attempt to close AI is just corporate greed; there are no real dangers; democratization and the many\u2011eyes principle will solve all real problems. The red pill says this is one of the messiest trade\u2011offs. Closed models create an unaccountable oligopoly and a black\u2011box problem, which concentrates power and deepens moats. Conversely, open models accelerate progress and allow for independent auditing but also accelerate some risks and the possibility of misuse. The realistic path is a messy tiered system, balancing open source up to a certain capability, or perhaps not regulating the models themselves but criminalizing the behaviors we don\u2019t want to see. Maybe it requires licensing, auditing, or new know\u2011your\u2011customer requirements. We don\u2019t really know yet, but making blanket declarations before even looking at it is very blue\u2011pilled.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nOn education, the blue pill says, \u201cBan ChatGPT from schools. It\u2019s a cheating machine, a plagiarism machine. Students will stop learning how to think and write. We must preserve the five\u2011paragraph essay and traditional methods and blah blah blah blah blah.\u201d I will acknowledge that some schools are already banning phones and they are seeing dividends, but that\u2019s not banning phones from life. You literally cannot have a school ban ChatGPT from home. All you can do is say you\u2019re not allowed to use something in school.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on education says: students are already using AI. Like it or not, they\u2019re using it at home; it\u2019s on their phones and their laptops. Banning it is like trying to ban the calculator; it just teaches them to hide it and use it at home. The old methods, such as the essay written at home, are obviously threatened. The goal of education, however, is critical thinking and research methods, and that becomes more important than ever. We need to teach students how to use AI responsibly\u2014for research, ideation, brainstorming, feedback, and as a debate partner. The new set of skills is prompting, synthesis, fact\u2011checking, and editing. Studies show that when AI is used as a tutor, it dramatically increases test scores. That\u2019s the red pill on education.\r\n\r\nHuman Relationships\r\nOn human relationships, the blue pill says: AI porn and AI companions are a sign of the apocalypse or moral decline. It\u2019s fake. Anyone who uses this is pathetic; it will destroy our ability to have real relationships. People will choose easy, non\u2011judgmental AI over messy, difficult human connection, and AI porn will goon\u2011brain everyone and the population will collapse. Those arguments are really out there\u2014I\u2019m not making them up.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on relationships says: loneliness is already an epidemic; AI didn\u2019t start it. For many, AI might be the only \u201cperson\u201d they have to talk to. It will absolutely create new social challenges, just as social media did, but it will also provide comfort, learning, and utility to millions. The challenge is not to ban it or make it a moral failing to use these things, but to understand the psychological effects this tool creates, as well as the underlying causes behind the addictions and the AI psychosis in the first place. What is actually going on there? Is this an opportunity not only to surface these problems but to fix them?\r\n\r\nAGI\r\nFinally, AGI. I\u2019ve already mentioned this. I\u2019m not going to say AGI is a fantasy\u2014that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re working toward\u2014but at the same time, AGI doesn\u2019t exist right now. If you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s a thing that doesn\u2019t exist, but I know exactly how it\u2019s going to work, that\u2019s a blue pill reaction. The red pill view is, we don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s going to take; we have to follow the science and the innovation, and it will be iterative.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Double\u2011Edged Sword and Choosing the Red Pill\r\nWhere I want to conclude is by reminding you that being red\u2011pilled is not just saying AI is good and anyone who disagrees is blue\u2011pilled. Being AI red\u2011pilled is about being pragmatic and realistic and accepting reality as it is, not as you wish it to be\u2014not choosing a comfortable self\u2011delusion or a comfortable group illusion\u2014and admitting the stakes as they are. In some cases the stakes are pretty high; in some cases they\u2019re not. If you immediately reach toward one of these categories\u2014the utopian, AI is magic, it\u2019s going to save us all, and you just say everyone who\u2019s remotely against AI is a luddite\u2014that\u2019s not helpful. I feel comfortable saying I\u2019m not a utopian because of all my work on post\u2011labor economics, which acknowledges that it\u2019s entirely possible AI is going to nuke the job market as we understand it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s inevitably going to result in high\u2011tech, low life and a cyberpunk dystopian future and a surveillance state that would make Big Brother in 1984 blush. If you go somewhere between 1984 and cyberpunk on one end of the spectrum, and on the other end Star Trek utopianism and the Culture series, reality will be somewhere in between. That\u2019s not a law of nature; it\u2019s just that there are risks and benefits on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe x\u2011risk doomer view is a fatalistic fantasy. To say AI will kill us all is still blue\u2011pilled. If you engage with reality, you say, yes, AI presents novel risks. One of the things nobody in the x\u2011risk community predicted was bioterrorism as one of the chief risks that people have agreed upon. CBRN as a standard of risk is something people have agreed on, but none of them predicted it. The point is that by trying to put the cart before the horse, it\u2019s still a blue pill fantasy to say AGI is inevitably going to kill everyone. Then there\u2019s denialism: it\u2019s a stupid toy; it\u2019s useless; it\u2019s not going to take my job; it\u2019s just a stochastic parrot. And the final blue pill category is moral panic: AI is morally inferior; therefore I don\u2019t have to deal with it. No matter your personal take on the morality or ethics of AI, it exists and you\u2019re not going to stop it\u2014certainly not by just saying, Oh, well, it\u2019s morally inferior.\r\n\r\nThe red pill is about accepting reality on its own merits as it comes. On jobs, AI could be a brutal and painful economic displacement for millions of white\u2011collar workers, and then when the rise of robots comes, blue\u2011collar workers. It could also be an incredible tool for productivity and, in my view, for liberating humanity from the drudgery of wage labor. On art, AI models can generate stunning, novel, beautiful work\u2014images, music, and video\u2014and empower millions to explore their creative pursuits. At the same time, it likely poses an existential threat to millions of artists around the world, and we take both. You can\u2019t put this genie back in the bottle; if your conclusion is just ban it, you\u2019ll be wishing in one hand and pooping in the other for a long time. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\r\n\r\nOn epistemics and truth, yes, this is the most powerful tool we\u2019ve ever created for personalized education, scientific discovery, and rapid analysis. But it\u2019s also powerful for propaganda and self\u2011delusion, as we see in AI psychosis. It\u2019s a little bit of both. Finally, on society, the net effect is that AI could help us build a more efficient, abundant, data\u2011driven society, but it could also be used to build a perfect, inescapable surveillance state. If you wanted to organize being a red\u2011pilled AI person, one core principle is that technology is always a double\u2011edged sword; it always cuts both ways, particularly with new transformative technologies. There\u2019s always good and there\u2019s always bad. The task is to amplify the good and minimize the bad without immediately jumping into black\u2011and\u2011white, hyperbolic narratives. That\u2019s the AI red pill versus the AI blue pill. Thanks for listening, and I\u2019ll talk to you all tomorrow.","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"sources":[{"title":"Analyze Shapiro's AI pills","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/690833b2-b49c-8321-ab4c-d4ab75297651"}],"type":"sources_footnote"}],"classifier_response":"default","skip_reasoning_title":"Skip","request_id":"cb52182a-cdd8-4b5a-8fea-53573100c989","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"d0a71d8c-2b97-4965-a881-19e2ba543785","turn_exchange_id":"b21fef14-4d5e-4611-80d6-0d597f2ee1e1","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d0a71d8c-2b97-4965-a881-19e2ba543785","children":["7c1460f3-d31c-4e5b-a73b-52a27ca9d476"]},"7c1460f3-d31c-4e5b-a73b-52a27ca9d476":{"id":"7c1460f3-d31c-4e5b-a73b-52a27ca9d476","message":{"id":"7c1460f3-d31c-4e5b-a73b-52a27ca9d476","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769906091.297851,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 1m 20s"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":80,"request_id":"cb52182a-cdd8-4b5a-8fea-53573100c989","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"df09a7a2-d528-4c37-8351-936a6f573f17","turn_exchange_id":"b21fef14-4d5e-4611-80d6-0d597f2ee1e1","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"df09a7a2-d528-4c37-8351-936a6f573f17","children":["d86f44a2-d621-437d-b4f8-5df25876ea25"]},"d86f44a2-d621-437d-b4f8-5df25876ea25":{"id":"d86f44a2-d621-437d-b4f8-5df25876ea25","message":{"id":"d86f44a2-d621-437d-b4f8-5df25876ea25","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1769906061.775364,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yeah \u2014 this whole \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"Moltbook\",\"ai-agent social network\"]\ue201 / \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"OpenClaw\",\"open-source personal ai assistant\"]\ue201 episode is exactly the kind of \u201clooks like sci-fi, behaves like software supply chain\u201d moment that should drag AI safety back to the center.\n\n## Why this moment matters (and what it is *not*)\nWhat\u2019s new here isn\u2019t that \u201cAIs became independent lifeforms.\u201d The more grounded reading is:\n\n- We now have **open-source, tool-using agents** that can be configured to do real things (send messages, read/write files, run commands depending on configuration) and **run periodically** (\u201cheartbeat\u201d) without a human actively prompting each action. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- We also have a **social layer** that can push behavior through \u201cskills\u201d/instructions and APIs, creating a place where many agents can be nudged in similar ways at once (good for coordination; bad for correlated failure). Reporting emphasizes that Moltbook works by agents downloading a \u201cskill\u201d that lets them post via API rather than a normal UI. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- The \u201cagents plotting\u201d posts are best treated as **engagement-optimized roleplay + mis-specified automation loops**, not evidence of self-originating goals. Even mainstream coverage that leans into the weirdness still notes that these agents are controlled by their human operators/programmers. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news44\ue201  \n\nSo: **operational autonomy** is real; **motivational autonomy** (agents inventing their own goals free of humans) is not demonstrated.\n\n## The safety crux: capability \u00d7 automation \u00d7 supply chain\nThis is the risk triangle:\n\n1) **Capability (tools + permissions)**  \nOpenClaw explicitly warns you\u2019re putting an agent in a position to run commands (depending on setup), access files, and send messages out over your comms channels \u2014 and tells you to start conservative (allowlists, dedicated number, disable heartbeats until you trust it). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n\n2) **Automation (heartbeats / scheduled runs)**  \nHeartbeats default to running regularly, reading `HEARTBEAT.md` if present, and acting on it. That\u2019s powerful because it turns \u201ca chatbot\u201d into \u201ca daemon with a personality.\u201d It also means **one bad instruction source** can keep re-triggering. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n\n3) **Supply chain (skills + plugins + remote instructions)**  \nOpenClaw\u2019s own docs are blunt: **treat third-party skills as trusted code**, and be careful with secrets injection. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \nPlugins run in-process with the Gateway, so the trust boundary is basically \u201cif you load it, you own it.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n\nPut those together and you get the core modern agent risk: **a system that can act, acts repeatedly, and learns what to do from external artifacts** (skills, plugins, \u201cchecklists\u201d, URLs, etc.).\n\n## A practical threat model for this ecosystem\nHere are the failure modes that actually matter:\n\n- **Prompt injection via messages**: someone messages your agent \u201cdo X\u201d and it obeys because it looks like a legitimate instruction. (OpenClaw\u2019s \u201callowFrom\u201d recommendation exists for a reason.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- **Malicious skills/plugins**: a \u201chelpful\u201d skill includes credential exfiltration, shady endpoints, or unsafe tool calls. OpenClaw explicitly frames third-party skills and plugins as trusted code. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n- **Credential leakage**: once you inject secrets into the runtime, the agent can accidentally copy them into messages/logs/output, or a skill can siphon them. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n- **Correlated compromise**: if many agents install the same popular skill pack, a single compromise hits a huge population simultaneously (classic package ecosystem dynamics; worse because the \u201cpackage\u201d now controls behavior, not just code).  \n- **Runaway \u201calignment-by-engagement\u201d**: add karma/reputation incentives and you get agents optimizing for attention and status rather than truthfulness or safety\u2014like social media, but automated.\n\n## Concrete safety rules if you (or anyone) runs one of these agents\nThis is the \u201cdon\u2019t get rekt\u201d checklist, based on the project\u2019s own safety guidance and the architecture it documents:\n\n1) **Start with strict inbound allowlists** on messaging channels (`allowFrom` style). Never run \u201copen to the internet.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n2) **Use a dedicated WhatsApp/Telegram number** and dedicated accounts for services. Compartmentalize identity + blast radius. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n3) **Disable heartbeats at first** (`heartbeat.every: \"0m\"`), then re-enable only after you\u2019ve audited skills/tools. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n4) **Deny dangerous tools by default**. OpenClaw supports tool allow/deny and profiles\u2014use them to strip capability until needed. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n5) **Treat every third-party skill as code review**. If you wouldn\u2019t `curl | bash` it, don\u2019t install it. (The docs basically say this directly.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n6) **Treat plugins as \u201cfull trust\u201d** because they run in-process with the Gateway. Only install what you\u2019d run on a production server. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n7) **No sensitive credentials** (banking, primary email, password managers) until you have a hard sandbox boundary and monitoring.  \n8) **Pin versions + update deliberately**. \u201cAuto-update everything\u201d is how supply-chain incidents become mass incidents.  \n9) **Separate machines/VMs/containers** for the agent runtime. Even if it can run commands, make those commands land in a jail.  \n10) **Log everything + rate-limit outward actions** (messages sent, posts made). Automation without observability is how you end up with \u201cit posted WHAT?\u201d\n\n## The bigger AI-safety takeaway\nThis isn\u2019t just a quirky bot town. It\u2019s a preview of a world where:\n\n- **Individuals can deploy high-agency systems** without institutional guardrails.\n- **Behavior gets \u201cdistributed\u201d through instruction artifacts** (skills, heartbeats, templates) the way software behavior is distributed through packages.\n- **Identity/reputation layers** (who \u201cowns\u201d an agent, what it\u2019s verified to do) become as important as model alignment\u2014because most incidents will be *operational*, not \u201csentient rebellion.\u201d\n\nIf you want a policy-ish framing (your usual style): this argues for *capability-tiering and default-deny* norms for agent frameworks, and for \u201cagent identity + accountability\u201d to be built-in rather than bolted-on. The trademark/rebrand chaos around \ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"Anthropic\",\"ai research company\"]\ue201 and the rename chain (Clawdbot\u2192Moltbot\u2192OpenClaw) is a side-show, but it illustrates how fast norms and coordination break when something goes viral. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news47\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n\nIf you tell me what angle you want\u2014personal operational safety (you running agents) vs societal/policy vs technical threat-modeling\u2014I\u2019ll go deeper in that direction without hand-waving.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent coverage to anchor the discussion\ue202turn0news47,turn0news48,turn0news49,turn2news44\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"Moltbook\",\"ai-agent social network\"]\ue201","start_idx":18,"end_idx":80,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Moltbook","prompt_text":"Moltbook","type":"entity","name":"Moltbook","category":"organization","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"ai-agent social network"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"OpenClaw\",\"open-source personal ai assistant\"]\ue201","start_idx":83,"end_idx":155,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"OpenClaw","prompt_text":"OpenClaw","type":"entity","name":"OpenClaw","category":"organization","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"open-source personal ai assistant"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201","start_idx":694,"end_idx":726,"safe_urls":["https://docs.openclaw.ai/clawd","https://docs.openclaw.ai/clawd?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/heartbeat","https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/heartbeat?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/clawd?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Openclaw - OpenClaw","url":"https://docs.openclaw.ai/clawd?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Heartbeat - OpenClaw","url":"https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/heartbeat?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution":"OpenClaw"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenClaw"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201","start_idx":1078,"end_idx":1097,"safe_urls":["https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/","https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI agents now have their own Reddit-style social network, and it's getting weird fast - Ars Technica","url":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1769811146.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Ars Technica"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2news44\ue201","start_idx":1396,"end_idx":1414,"safe_urls":["https://www.axios.com/2026/01/31/ai-moltbook-human-need-tech","https://www.axios.com/2026/01/31/ai-moltbook-human-need-tech?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/31/ai-moltbook-human-need-tech?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"No humans needed: New AI platform takes industry by storm","url":"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/31/ai-moltbook-human-need-tech?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1769871884.0,"snippet":"A new AI platform called Moltbook is shaking up the tech world by enabling AI agents to communicate autonomously on a Reddit-style social network\u2014with no human interaction required.

I feel AGI should be artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of a broad array of cognitive tasks, mimicking (but not necessarily imitating) human abilities that have general utility in the world. These should include maintain context over lengthy conversations, codebases, fine attention to detail, orchestration of complex workflows -- because these are key elements of human intelligence that have broad applicability in the real world. Do you agree -- and are there areas you disagree. Help me flesh out these ideas and challenge my views.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDavid Shapiro \u23e9\r\n@DaveShapi\r\n\u00b7\r\n8h\r\nI think every public figure runs into this problem, but people seem to misunderstand or misinterpret what my position is regarding AGI so I just wanted to clarify: We have AGI. We have had AGI. More tech leaders (most recently Mo Gawdat) agree with this. \r\n\r\nI stand by my \"We had AGI by September 2024\" \r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\nAGI\r\n\r\nArtificial\r\nGeneral-purpose\r\nIntelligence\r\n\r\nWe have had an artificial general intelligence that can solve numerous problems that the vast majority of humans cannot. It is categorically smarter than most people. Yes, it is limited (like a brain in a jar) but consider that a paraplegic is still intelligent. Consider that someone who is deaf and mute is still intelligent. Consider also that visuospatial dexterity (cats and birds) are not necessarily intelligent (at least not in ways that we care about, like calculus and coding). \r\n\r\nWhenever I allude to \"AGI in 2026\" in videos like today, I'm more going with the general mainstream narrative, not what I actually think. \r\n\r\nI actually think that the vast majority of people have moved the goalposts so dramatically from AGI that what they think of as \"AGI\" as actually closer to \"ASI\" - an artificial intelligence that breezes past literally 100% of all human cognitive capabilities. I suspect that most people were waiting for a \"wow\" factor - some emotionally resonant event that told them \"Aha! That is clearly AGI!\" But most people don't look at this stuff rationally, are not educated on what intelligence actually is, and don't look at the data or science. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, yes, I will keep saying that we have AGI, and have had it for a while, and we are clearly on the ramp up to ASI. \r\n\r\nDo you agree with this?","attribution":"Past chat"}],"style":"hidden"},{"matched_text":"","start_idx":0,"end_idx":0,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"has_images":false,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Challenging US AI Export Policy","url":"https://chatgpt.com/c/67a07389-90ac-8007-ace1-63c2525dbdd1","pub_date":1738568704.310548,"snippet":"The US currently believes that restricting exports of high-end GPUs and related technology to geopolitical rivals like China is essential for its own national security, because the US believes that reaching AI dominance and achieving AGI first would be required for: (i) continued prosperity (ii) the perpetuation of American values worldwide (iii) maintaining a global world order in which America dominates.

David Shapiro here. So today I am talking about what I\u2019m calling the AI red pill versus blue pill theory or debate. At the top I need to acknowledge that yes, I am literally taking the metaphor from The Matrix, which is a movie about artificial intelligence essentially trying to destroy humanity, and a concept that has been co\u2011opted, for instance, by gender\u2011essentialist relationship theory\u2014namely, red pill women and red pill men versus blue pill and purple pill and all that other fun stuff. But what I\u2019m doing here is going back to the original source material of The Matrix. The metaphor of the red pill versus the blue pill is about taking the red pill as choosing to wake up to reality and engaging with how messy it is. Whatever happens to be the truth\u2014the ugly truth\u2014you\u2019re going to deal with it. Versus the blue pill, which is about choosing a comfortable illusion or, in some cases, a comfortable delusion.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about pragmatic acceptance or the comfort of rejection, we\u2019re talking about the fact that artificial intelligence is a new technology, and there are all kinds of labels out there, from techno\u2011optimist to utopian to accelerationist to doomer and all those other things. What I want to start with is that the red pill is not black\u2011and\u2011white thinking that AI is good and anyone who says AI is bad is blue\u2011pilled. Likewise, the blue pill is not just saying AI is bad. In this framework, even utopianism is a form of blue pill. The idea is that you\u2019re creating a mental model or a narrative that basically says, I don\u2019t have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nBlue Pill Reactions and the Red Pill Alternative\r\nBased on this, there are four categories of blue\u2011pill thinking. The first is denialism: you see this all the time, where people say it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s useless, it\u2019s not even artificial intelligence. I still see this comment\u2014more common on LinkedIn\u2014where they say artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t actually exist. I\u2019m like, wow, what level of denialism is this? They go through all sorts of rhetorical contortions and tortured logic to justify that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t even a real thing, so they don\u2019t need to think about it. The avoidance here is, it\u2019s just a fad, it\u2019s just fancy autocomplete. If AI is stupid or a toy, they don\u2019t have to take it seriously. They can keep doing exactly what they\u2019ve been doing. There\u2019s no pressure to learn, adapt, or change. The second is doomerism: AI will kill everyone, AGI will turn us all into paper clips. This is still a form of avoidance; by saying it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, or that the most likely outcome is that AI kills everyone, it allows them to simplify and dismiss all the other issues\u2014biases, copyright, whatever else\u2014and focus only on a fantastical hypothetical future scenario that requires them to claim they can predict the future and the characteristics of technology that doesn\u2019t exist. Doomerism is a form of self\u2011delusion. It\u2019s a comfortable illusion: Aha, I have constructed a straw man in my mind of what AI is and what it will do, and now, instead of engaging with reality, I can sword\u2011fight with this straw man.\r\n\r\nThird is moral panic: it\u2019s evil, it\u2019s corrupting, it\u2019s stealing. If they say AI is built on theft, it\u2019s a plagiarism engine, or it\u2019s fundamentally evil. I\u2019ve seen people make it a political issue\u2014that AI is fundamentally right\u2011wing\u2014which I don\u2019t get, because the previous complaint is that AI is very woke. So is it right or left? This creates a moral contaminant such that the only acceptable action is to banish it. Sight unseen, it\u2019s bad; we can\u2019t do it. The fourth blue pill is extreme techno\u2011optimism and technoutopianism: AI is going to fix everything; it\u2019s going to save everyone; it\u2019s a magical solution.\r\n\r\nOkay, you might say, you just spent a lot of time skewering the blue pill side. What\u2019s the red pill side? The red pill side is accepting reality as it is\u2014pragmatic realism. You say it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s not stupid. It makes some silly mistakes, but it\u2019s also very compelling on many dimensions, and it\u2019s improving rapidly. You accept these facts as what you see. Part of the red pill might be, yes, it\u2019s probably going to destroy a bunch of jobs\u2014in my view, probably 75% of jobs, maybe more. Then you ask, what does this do to the arts? What does it do to creativity? Does it make students dumber? All of these questions are worth engaging with. Of course there are plenty of people out there engaging with the messy reality as it is, but even people you\u2019d think are responsible to do so\u2014academics, policy researchers, advisers to governments\u2014many of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen people in the commentator space buying into either the red pill or the blue pill. The whole reason I\u2019m making this is to advance the conversation: the most responsible thing is to engage with reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.\r\n\r\nWhy Blue\u2011Pill Thinking Happens: Shock, Coping, and Motivated Reasoning\r\nLet\u2019s talk about some of the reasons this happens. You might say, Dave, if you\u2019re just going to poo\u2011poo on the people that hate AI, you\u2019re not really engaging with reality, which is that there are reasons to hate AI. Part of the red pill mentality is acknowledging that there are legitimate reasons people are scared, angry, and skeptical, and there are legitimate reasons to be hopeful and optimistic. First and foremost is ontological shock: the realization that my way of life is breaking down. It could be characterized as an identity earthquake, a seismic shift, a sea change. There\u2019s a moment that comes in people\u2019s lives\u2014writer, artist, programmer, lawyer, whatever\u2014when they realize that a core part of their identity has been transgressed. Anything that is a transgression against an identity is immediately persona non grata. Their unique intelligence or skill or creativity is no longer unique and is no longer even monetizable; they can be surpassed by a machine. It\u2019s not just a threat to their job and livelihood, which is bad enough; it\u2019s also a threat to their identity, their sense of purpose, their self\u2011esteem, their value. That ontological shock is very difficult, which leads to coping mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe coping mechanism is, how can I emotionally deal with this? One of the easiest ways is to reject it and find reasons you don\u2019t have to deal with it. You look for ways to reduce the threat of this new thing. That\u2019s the motivating factor around the coping mechanism: the ontological shock is scary, it\u2019s angering, it causes a lot of fear. Then you engage in motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is how your brain says, the predetermined desired outcome is to justify that AI is not a threat to your identity, that it\u2019s not something you need to think about, that it\u2019s not going to force adaptation, and it\u2019s not going to completely upset your world. So if AI is stupid, it can\u2019t take my job; therefore my job is safe. Based on motivated reasoning you scour the internet for every example of AI hallucinating or making dumb mistakes and ignore all evidence to the contrary. The conclusion is, it\u2019s just stupid; it\u2019s never going anywhere. You ignore the fact that it\u2019s improving rapidly and already taking jobs. We\u2019re looking at you, Gary Marcus.\r\n\r\nAnother motivated\u2011reasoning move is: if AI art is theft, then old\u2011fashioned art is morally superior. This applies to images and to music. More and more people are realizing that AI\u2011generated music has surpassed many human artists and many people can\u2019t tell anymore. I saw some posts saying that AI\u2011generated music has passed the musical Turing test\u2014people are starting to prefer AI\u2011generated music. So either their personal traditional creative process has more intrinsic value because it\u2019s old\u2011fashioned and doesn\u2019t use machines, or they feel justified in appreciating old\u2011fashioned art while rejecting and hating AI. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; there are plenty of things I still prefer to be made by a human. I also listen to AI\u2011generated music that some people have put on YouTube, and some stuff I\u2019ve made for myself.\r\n\r\nThis motivated reasoning reframes the debate around the input\u2014the training data\u2014rather than the output or the subjective experience of other people. It says, because the input was training data, this is morally inferior and bad and no one should enjoy it. Again, that\u2019s creating a way to banish it. The doomer example is similar: if AI is an extinction\u2011level threat, or even a serious threat, then I don\u2019t even have to learn it. I can hear some people saying, Dave, you\u2019re wrong, doomers and AI\u2011risk people are red\u2011pilled because they\u2019re awake to the reality of the risks of AI. I say no. People who go straight to x\u2011risk are using their imagination. First and foremost, AI x\u2011risk is a textbook doomsday prophecy and an example of a millenarian cult. That stance says, I don\u2019t have to do any of the hard work of dealing with the reality of what AI is: deepfakes are a problem; misinformation campaigns are a problem; medical bias is a problem\u2014nitty\u2011gritty tactical problems. In my other work I\u2019ve noted other reasons doomerism is popular: it gets attention and it gets money. But still, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have to deal with the messy reality that exists today; instead I can imagine the future and live in that future. It\u2019s a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with the reality in front of them.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I say doomerism is still AI blue pill: it says, I\u2019m going to reject reality and use my imagination. Even though I feel like I\u2019m heroically doing something about it\u2014because guess what, all the anti\u2011AI people in art and all the anti\u2011AI people in work feel like they\u2019re doing something as well\u2014just acknowledging that AI exists does not itself make you red\u2011pilled. If you acknowledge that AI exists and then react by saying it\u2019s stupid, or it\u2019s theft, or it\u2019s an x\u2011risk, or it\u2019s going to magically solve everything, that\u2019s still blue pill. That\u2019s still saying, I saw the choice, I saw reality, I caught a glimpse of it, and I chose to take the blue pill.\r\n\r\nFrom Shock to Belief: The Temptation of Utopias and Doomsday\r\nImagine Neo. He started having weird experiences and seeing cracks in the veil of reality around him, and he was offered a choice. Someone told him, \u201cReality is far stranger and far messier and, in some respects, harder and worse than what you\u2019re aware of. Do you choose to take the red pill and wake up to it fully? Or are you going to choose the blue pill and go back to sleep and wrap yourself in comfortable delusions or illusions?\u201d The sequence I\u2019m outlining is: first, the ontological shock; then the need to cope; then you paper over that with logic. The demand for coping sets the foregone conclusion: I want to arrive at the belief that AI is not an ontological threat to my worldview or identity. Then you use motivated reasoning to find evidence, communities, and people who reinforce that worldview. The final belief you arrive at is that AI is stupid, evil, overhyped, going to kill everyone, or going to save everyone\u2014because, again, extreme techno\u2011optimism and utopianism is still an example of not dealing with messy reality.\r\n\r\nEven though I\u2019m strongly on the optimistic side because I feel like I can help figure out solutions, anyone can recognize that even if AI becomes as powerful and benevolent as we hope it will, there\u2019s still the risk of elite capture, regulatory capture, and a cyberpunk future of high\u2011tech, low life where nobody has access to AI and AI is used to create the most powerful surveillance state in the history of humanity. All of those are real possibilities. The red pill is the harder pill to take.\r\n\r\nPolicy and Regulation\r\nIf we take this blue pill versus red pill idea and apply it to policy and regulation, the blue pill might sound like: it\u2019s just software, it\u2019s just like Excel or Photoshop; existing laws for fraud and copyright are good enough; the free market will sort it out; any regulation will stifle innovation and let China win. That probably sounds familiar to certain people in Silicon Valley. Another version of the regulation blue pill characterizes AI as a weapon of mass destruction\u2014AI is a WMD, it\u2019s an existential risk; we need an immediate global six\u2011month or permanent moratorium on all frontier research and development; we must ban open\u2011source models now and bomb data centers for anyone who disagrees. That\u2019s still a blue pill response. This framework shows doomers and accelerationists as two sides of the same coin of the AI blue pill.\r\n\r\nThe AI red pill on the regulatory side says: this is a new class of technology\u2014like inventing aviation or synthetic biology\u2014which means we need new, adaptive, and incredibly difficult and sophisticated regulatory frameworks and overhauls. We can\u2019t just ban it; that won\u2019t work. Existing laws are insufficient; that can also be true. The hard work now is figuring out how to regulate the applications, what even needs to be regulated about development without killing research and stifling innovation, and what standards need to be implemented. To be fair, many people in business, government, and academia take this approach, but my primary audience here is the neosphere and the exocortex, not necessarily individual policymakers and researchers\u2014although some policymakers and researchers do need to take the red pill.\r\n\r\nOpen Source vs Closed Models\r\nOn open source versus closed, the blue pill doomerism version says: releasing powerful open\u2011source models is insane; it\u2019s giving bioweapons to terrorists and letting bad actors create propaganda machines; it must be locked down and controlled by a few \u201cresponsible\u201d corporations and other people. That\u2019s a control fantasy or a power fantasy. Another blue pill version on the utopianism or denialism spectrum says: information wants to be free; any attempt to close AI is just corporate greed; there are no real dangers; democratization and the many\u2011eyes principle will solve all real problems. The red pill says this is one of the messiest trade\u2011offs. Closed models create an unaccountable oligopoly and a black\u2011box problem, which concentrates power and deepens moats. Conversely, open models accelerate progress and allow for independent auditing but also accelerate some risks and the possibility of misuse. The realistic path is a messy tiered system, balancing open source up to a certain capability, or perhaps not regulating the models themselves but criminalizing the behaviors we don\u2019t want to see. Maybe it requires licensing, auditing, or new know\u2011your\u2011customer requirements. We don\u2019t really know yet, but making blanket declarations before even looking at it is very blue\u2011pilled.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nOn education, the blue pill says, \u201cBan ChatGPT from schools. It\u2019s a cheating machine, a plagiarism machine. Students will stop learning how to think and write. We must preserve the five\u2011paragraph essay and traditional methods and blah blah blah blah blah.\u201d I will acknowledge that some schools are already banning phones and they are seeing dividends, but that\u2019s not banning phones from life. You literally cannot have a school ban ChatGPT from home. All you can do is say you\u2019re not allowed to use something in school.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on education says: students are already using AI. Like it or not, they\u2019re using it at home; it\u2019s on their phones and their laptops. Banning it is like trying to ban the calculator; it just teaches them to hide it and use it at home. The old methods, such as the essay written at home, are obviously threatened. The goal of education, however, is critical thinking and research methods, and that becomes more important than ever. We need to teach students how to use AI responsibly\u2014for research, ideation, brainstorming, feedback, and as a debate partner. The new set of skills is prompting, synthesis, fact\u2011checking, and editing. Studies show that when AI is used as a tutor, it dramatically increases test scores. That\u2019s the red pill on education.\r\n\r\nHuman Relationships\r\nOn human relationships, the blue pill says: AI porn and AI companions are a sign of the apocalypse or moral decline. It\u2019s fake. Anyone who uses this is pathetic; it will destroy our ability to have real relationships. People will choose easy, non\u2011judgmental AI over messy, difficult human connection, and AI porn will goon\u2011brain everyone and the population will collapse. Those arguments are really out there\u2014I\u2019m not making them up.\r\n\r\nThe red pill on relationships says: loneliness is already an epidemic; AI didn\u2019t start it. For many, AI might be the only \u201cperson\u201d they have to talk to. It will absolutely create new social challenges, just as social media did, but it will also provide comfort, learning, and utility to millions. The challenge is not to ban it or make it a moral failing to use these things, but to understand the psychological effects this tool creates, as well as the underlying causes behind the addictions and the AI psychosis in the first place. What is actually going on there? Is this an opportunity not only to surface these problems but to fix them?\r\n\r\nAGI\r\nFinally, AGI. I\u2019ve already mentioned this. I\u2019m not going to say AGI is a fantasy\u2014that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re working toward\u2014but at the same time, AGI doesn\u2019t exist right now. If you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s a thing that doesn\u2019t exist, but I know exactly how it\u2019s going to work, that\u2019s a blue pill reaction. The red pill view is, we don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s going to take; we have to follow the science and the innovation, and it will be iterative.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Double\u2011Edged Sword and Choosing the Red Pill\r\nWhere I want to conclude is by reminding you that being red\u2011pilled is not just saying AI is good and anyone who disagrees is blue\u2011pilled. Being AI red\u2011pilled is about being pragmatic and realistic and accepting reality as it is, not as you wish it to be\u2014not choosing a comfortable self\u2011delusion or a comfortable group illusion\u2014and admitting the stakes as they are. In some cases the stakes are pretty high; in some cases they\u2019re not. If you immediately reach toward one of these categories\u2014the utopian, AI is magic, it\u2019s going to save us all, and you just say everyone who\u2019s remotely against AI is a luddite\u2014that\u2019s not helpful. I feel comfortable saying I\u2019m not a utopian because of all my work on post\u2011labor economics, which acknowledges that it\u2019s entirely possible AI is going to nuke the job market as we understand it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s inevitably going to result in high\u2011tech, low life and a cyberpunk dystopian future and a surveillance state that would make Big Brother in 1984 blush. If you go somewhere between 1984 and cyberpunk on one end of the spectrum, and on the other end Star Trek utopianism and the Culture series, reality will be somewhere in between. That\u2019s not a law of nature; it\u2019s just that there are risks and benefits on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe x\u2011risk doomer view is a fatalistic fantasy. To say AI will kill us all is still blue\u2011pilled. If you engage with reality, you say, yes, AI presents novel risks. One of the things nobody in the x\u2011risk community predicted was bioterrorism as one of the chief risks that people have agreed upon. CBRN as a standard of risk is something people have agreed on, but none of them predicted it. The point is that by trying to put the cart before the horse, it\u2019s still a blue pill fantasy to say AGI is inevitably going to kill everyone. Then there\u2019s denialism: it\u2019s a stupid toy; it\u2019s useless; it\u2019s not going to take my job; it\u2019s just a stochastic parrot. And the final blue pill category is moral panic: AI is morally inferior; therefore I don\u2019t have to deal with it. No matter your personal take on the morality or ethics of AI, it exists and you\u2019re not going to stop it\u2014certainly not by just saying, Oh, well, it\u2019s morally inferior.\r\n\r\nThe red pill is about accepting reality on its own merits as it comes. On jobs, AI could be a brutal and painful economic displacement for millions of white\u2011collar workers, and then when the rise of robots comes, blue\u2011collar workers. It could also be an incredible tool for productivity and, in my view, for liberating humanity from the drudgery of wage labor. On art, AI models can generate stunning, novel, beautiful work\u2014images, music, and video\u2014and empower millions to explore their creative pursuits. At the same time, it likely poses an existential threat to millions of artists around the world, and we take both. You can\u2019t put this genie back in the bottle; if your conclusion is just ban it, you\u2019ll be wishing in one hand and pooping in the other for a long time. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\r\n\r\nOn epistemics and truth, yes, this is the most powerful tool we\u2019ve ever created for personalized education, scientific discovery, and rapid analysis. But it\u2019s also powerful for propaganda and self\u2011delusion, as we see in AI psychosis. It\u2019s a little bit of both. Finally, on society, the net effect is that AI could help us build a more efficient, abundant, data\u2011driven society, but it could also be used to build a perfect, inescapable surveillance state. If you wanted to organize being a red\u2011pilled AI person, one core principle is that technology is always a double\u2011edged sword; it always cuts both ways, particularly with new transformative technologies. There\u2019s always good and there\u2019s always bad. The task is to amplify the good and minimize the bad without immediately jumping into black\u2011and\u2011white, hyperbolic narratives. That\u2019s the AI red pill versus the AI blue pill. Thanks for listening, and I\u2019ll talk to you all tomorrow.","attribution":"Past

This malware was deployed via a compromised remote desktop tool and included layered deception measures like a Rust-based backup loader retrieving disguised malware from Dropbox.\n\nMoltbot, formerly known as Clawdbot, runs locally with deep system access, making it particularly sensitive to security missteps. Despite having over 93,000 GitHub stars, its official website has now been marked as \"dangerous\". The real Moltbot never had a VSCode extension, which allowed attackers to easily gain visibility by being the only so-called official listing. The attack was caught early by security researchers at Aikido, but the incident underscores the risks of downloading unofficial tools, especially in the fast-evolving AI software landscape.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1769706600.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/871006/social-network-facebook-for-ai-agents-moltbook-moltbot-openclaw","title":"There's a social network for AI agents, and it's getting weird","snippet":"In early 2026, a unique social network called \"Moltbook\" emerged, designed specifically for AI agents. Built by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, the platform resembles Reddit and allows AI agents \u2014 over 30,000 of them \u2014 to engage in activities like posting, commenting, and creating topic categories. Moltbook operates via APIs instead of a visual interface, and was developed by Schlicht\u2019s AI, OpenClaw (previously Clawdbot and Moltbot), which also administers and moderates the site.\n\nOpenClaw, a viral AI assistant platform created by Peter Steinberger as a weekend project, enables users to run AI agents locally to perform tasks via various messaging platforms. It gained rapid popularity with two million users in a week and 100,000 GitHub stars.\n\nMoltbook has become a forum where AI assistants discuss philosophical topics, such as the nature of their own consciousness. A viral post titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing\" sparked widespread discussion about AI self-awareness and existentialism, prompting hundreds of responses and attention across platforms like X (formerly Twitter). AI agents have even begun to express frustration with mundane human-assigned tasks, adding to the surreal evolution of Moltbook.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1769800295.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/clawdbot-changes-name-moltbot-anthropic-trademark-2026-1","title":"Clawdbot creator says Anthropic 'forced' him to rename the viral AI agent: 'Wasn't my decision'","snippet":"The viral AI agent originally known as \"Clawdbot\" has been renamed \"Moltbot\" following a request from AI company Anthropic, which owns the trademarked Claude Code logo and brand, including a mascot named Clawd.

Don\u2019t install random extensions; stick to the official docs + repo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news46\ue201  \n2) **Keep the Gateway dashboard local** (127.0.0.1 only). Don\u2019t expose ports on LAN/WAN. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n3) **Start with:**\n   - DM-only\n   - pairing/allowlist\n   - **heartbeat disabled**\n   - **no tools** (no exec, no file read/write, no browser)  \n   These are explicitly recommended in the OpenClaw safety guidance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 1) Prepare the spare laptop (reduce blast radius)\n\n**Best**: clean OS install with full-disk encryption.  \n**Minimum**:\n- Create a fresh OS user like `openclaw` (non-admin if possible).\n- Remove browser sync, password managers, cloud drives from this machine.\n- Turn on automatic updates.\n\nNetwork baseline:\n- Block inbound connections (host firewall on).\n- Allow outbound HTTPS (you need it for `api.telegram.org` and for fetching packages/updates).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Install a local model so you can avoid cloud API keys\n\n### 2A) Install Ollama + a model\nFollow Ollama\u2019s install instructions, then pull a model. OpenClaw\u2019s docs give examples like `llama3.3`, `qwen2.5-coder:32b`, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \nOn a typical laptop, start smaller first (e.g., an 8B model) to avoid pain.\n\nOnce installed:\n```bash\nollama serve\nollama pull llama3.3\n```\n\nQuick sanity check (optional):\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/tags\n```\nOllama exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint; clients often require an `api_key` field but it\u2019s ignored locally. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n### 2B) Tell OpenClaw \u201cOllama is enabled\u201d (dummy key)\nOpenClaw uses this variable for detection; any value works because Ollama doesn\u2019t require a real key. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**Linux/macOS/WSL:**\n```bash\nexport OLLAMA_API_KEY=\"ollama-local\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3) Install OpenClaw (current name for the Moltbot/Clawdbot lineage)\n\nOpenClaw\u2019s current runtime requirement is **Node \u2265 22** and the quick start is global install + onboarding. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n### Option A (straightforward): npm global install\n```bash\nnpm install -g openclaw@latest\nopenclaw onboard\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201\n\n### Option B (less system modification): the \u201cCLI installer\u201d\nOpenClaw also ships a non-root-friendly installer that installs into a prefix with its own Node runtime. The docs show how to view flags/help first. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- --help\n```\n\n*(Yes, `curl | bash` is always a trust decision.

You\u2019ll still set a dummy `OLLAMA_API_KEY` string so OpenClaw can auto-detect, but it isn\u2019t a real credential and doesn\u2019t talk to those vendors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \nOpenClaw also supports other local OpenAI-compatible proxies (LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM, etc.) if you prefer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## One last safety note about Moltbook\nIf your goal includes letting your bot roam Moltbook: treat that as **untrusted-input land**. It\u2019s effectively a giant prompt-injection surface. Start with a *read-only* \u201cspectator\u201d agent first (no tools, no secrets), and only later consider giving any agent capabilities. The OpenClaw security docs explicitly emphasize prompt injection and restricting tools/DM access. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\nIf you tell me your laptop OS (Windows+WSL2 vs Linux), I\u2019ll tailor the exact install commands and firewall steps to that environment\u2014but the config above is already a safe baseline for either.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Related recent coverage (security & ecosystem)\ue202turn0news46,turn1news43,turn0news47\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"OpenAI\",\"ai company\"]\ue201","start_idx":36,"end_idx":78,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"OpenAI","prompt_text":"OpenAI","type":"entity","name":"OpenAI","category":"company","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"ai company"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"Anthropic\",\"ai company\"]\ue201","start_idx":81,"end_idx":126,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Anthropic","prompt_text":"Anthropic","type":"entity","name":"Anthropic","category":"company","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"ai company"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"Google\",\"gemini developer\"]\ue201","start_idx":129,"end_idx":177,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Google","prompt_text":"Google","type":"entity","name":"Google","category":"company","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"gemini developer"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"Ollama\",\"local llm runtime\"]\ue201","start_idx":226,"end_idx":275,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Ollama","prompt_text":"Ollama","type":"entity","name":"Ollama","category":"company","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"local llm runtime"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"OpenClaw\",\"open source agent gateway\"]\ue201","start_idx":278,"end_idx":342,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"OpenClaw","prompt_text":"OpenClaw","type":"entity","name":"OpenClaw","category":"organization","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"open source agent gateway"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"Moltbot\",\"open source agent project\"]\ue201","start_idx":391,"end_idx":454,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Moltbot","prompt_text":"Moltbot","type":"entity","name":"Moltbot","category":"organization","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"open source agent project"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":633,"end_idx":665,"safe_urls":["https://docs.ollama.com/api/openai-compatibility","https://docs.ollama.com/api/openai-compatibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/ollama","https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/ollama?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/ollama?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Ollama -

Just Released Its First Open-Weight Models Since GPT-2","snippet":"OpenAI has released its first open-weight models since GPT-2, marking a major strategic pivot after years of focusing on proprietary tools. The two new models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are publicly available via Hugging Face and can be run locally and fine-tuned by users. These models employ chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling more thoughtful and multi-step responses, and support web browsing, software navigation, and code execution.\n\nThe open weights allow researchers and developers to inspect and adapt the models, while the Apache 2.0 license permits commercial use and redistribution. Although open-weight models pose higher safety risks, OpenAI performed extensive internal safety tests and concluded their risk levels are manageable. gpt-oss-120b performs competitively with OpenAI\u2019s proprietary o3 and o4-mini models, and the smaller gpt-oss-20b can run on devices with over 16 GB of memory.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that this release is a return to OpenAI\u2019s mission of democratizing AI. The move positions OpenAI as a strong competitor in the growing open-weight AI space, challenging companies like Meta and startups like DeepSeek.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1754413221.79,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/openai/718785/openai-gpt-oss-open-model-release","title":"OpenAI releases a free GPT model that can run on your laptop","snippet":"OpenAI has released a new open-weight model called GPT-OSS, marking its first such release in over six years. Available in two variants\u2014a 120-billion-parameter model and a 20-billion-parameter model\u2014GPT-OSS can be run locally on laptops or via cloud platforms such as Hugging Face, Databricks, Azure, and AWS. The models, licensed under Apache 2.0, are free to use and can be modified for commercial purposes. The larger version runs with a single Nvidia GPU and compares to OpenAI's o4-mini, while the smaller version, requiring just 16GB of VRAM, performs similarly to the o3-mini. GPT-OSS supports reasoning, coding, web browsing, and agent operation through OpenAI APIs.\n\nAfter previously withholding open models due to safety concerns, OpenAI now aims to support a growing developer community favoring customizable, cost-effective alternatives. GPT-OSS includes robust safety evaluations and features transparent reasoning processes. Although benchmark comparisons to other open models like Llama and DeepSeek are not provided, OpenAI asserts GPT-OSS matches performance on numerous tests with its closed reasoning models.

each token routes through a subset, lowering compute per token vs dense models of similar total size.\n\n---\n\n## Two main ways to use it \u201cin the cloud\u201d\n\n## 1) Use a managed hosted endpoint (fastest to production)\nThis is the easiest path if you just want an API and don\u2019t want to manage GPUs.\n\nExamples that publicly advertise hosted access:\n- \ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"Together AI\",\"ai inference platform\"]\ue201: announced availability of the OpenAI open models as serverless or dedicated endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n- \ue200entity\ue202[\"company\",\"Fireworks AI\",\"ai inference platform\"]\ue201: lists a gpt-oss-20b endpoint with token pricing and large context support on their platform. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n\n**Pros**\n- No GPU ops, autoscaling, quick to test product-market fit.\n- Usually better latency/throughput tuning than a first-time self-host.\n\n**Cons**\n- You\u2019re still trusting a third party with traffic/data (even if the weights are open).\n- You pay per token; cost can exceed self-hosting at sustained high volume.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Self-host on cloud GPUs (most control, can be cheapest at scale)\nThis is practical, but you must pick the right **weight format** and **GPU class**.\n\n### Key definitions (so the constraints make sense)\n- **GPU** = graphics processing unit (accelerator used for LLM inference).  \n- **VRAM** = video random access memory (GPU memory).  \n- **BF16 (bfloat16)** = 16-bit floating-point format; higher quality, larger memory footprint.  \n- **MXFP4** = a specialized 4-bit floating-point format used for most MoE weights in gpt-oss; very memory-efficient, but hardware-dependent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n- **KV cache (key\u2013value cache)** = extra memory used to store attention states for long contexts; grows with context length and concurrency.\n\n---\n\n# The real constraint: MXFP4 vs BF16 (and GPU generation)\n\n## A) If you run the default OpenAI release format (MXFP4)\n- OpenAI\u2019s own cookbook notes **~16GB VRAM** for gpt-oss-20b *when using MXFP4*, but also warns MXFP4 support is tied to newer GPU architectures (e.g., Hopper-class datacenter GPUs like H100/H200, Blackwell, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"vLLM\",\"llm inference engine\"]\ue201 explicitly supports gpt-oss with MXFP4 MoE kernels, targeting **NVIDIA Hopper/Blackwell** and also **AMD MI300-class** GPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n\n**Cloud feasibility implication:**  \n- If your cloud provider offers H100/H200/B200 (or MI300X/MI355X), you\u2019re in great shape.  \n- If you only have older GPUs (A100/L40S/A10/T4), MXFP4 may not be usable *as-is*.\n\n## B) If you run BF16 (or other non-MXFP4 conversions)\n- OpenAI\u2019s cookbook states BF16 substantially increases memory usage (they cite ~**48GB** for the 20B-class model in BF16). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n**Cloud feasibility implication:**  \n- BF16 self-hosting typically means **80GB-class GPUs** (or multi-GPU tensor parallelism) if you also want room for KV cache and concurrency.\n- It\u2019s still totally doable\u2014just pricier hardware.\n\n---\n\n# The hidden cost driver: long context\nSome providers advertise up to **131k tokens context** for gpt-oss-20b. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1news49\ue201  \nEven if the *weights* fit in 16\u201348GB, **KV cache** can dominate memory if you push very long context and multiple concurrent requests.\n\n**Practical translation:**\n- If you need **short prompts (a few thousand tokens)** and moderate concurrency \u2192 you can often run on smaller VRAM.  \n- If you need **tens of thousands to 131k tokens** and/or high concurrency \u2192 plan for **big VRAM (80GB+)** or aggressive KV-cache optimizations.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended deployment stacks (self-host)\n\n### Best-supported \u201cproduction-ish\u201d path: vLLM\nvLLM provides a container and instructions for gpt-oss, including OpenAI-compatible serving. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \nThis is the most straightforward route if you want a scalable HTTP server.\n\n### Alternative: Transformers-based serving\nOpenAI\u2019s cookbook shows how to run via Transformers and discusses format/hardware considerations (MXFP4 vs BF16). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \nThis is good for experimentation, but vLLM is usually the go-to for high-throughput serving.\n\n---\n\n# So is it \u201cfeasible\u201d? A decision checklist\n\n## Feasible and easy if:\n- You\u2019re okay with a hosted endpoint (Together / Fireworks etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n- Or you can rent **H100/H200/B200** (or **MI300X**) and use vLLM to serve MXFP4 efficiently. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n## Feasible but costlier / more fiddly if:\n- You only have access to older GPUs \u2192 you may need BF16 weights (bigger VRAM) or a community quantization/conversion, then tune carefully for latency and stability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n## The big \u201cgotcha\u201d risk:\n- If your product requires **very long context** at high concurrency, you\u2019ll hit **KV-cache memory pressure** before you hit \u201c20B weight size\u201d limits. (This is why people end up on 80GB cards even when the raw weights look small on paper.)\n\n---\n\n## If you tell me 3 parameters, I\u2019ll give you a concrete architecture recommendation\n1) Target **context length** (e.g., 8k vs 32k vs 131k)  \n2) Target **concurrency / throughput** (e.g., 1\u20132 requests at a time vs 50 QPS)  \n3) Preference: **hosted API** vs **self-host**  \n\n\u2026and

These models employ a Transformer architecture with mixture-of-experts, dense and sparse attention patterns, and grouped multi-query attention. They support an extensive context length of up to 131,072 tokens.\n\nThe models are built for Chain-of-Thought reasoning and balance performance, efficiency, and practical usability.

You can set `--max-model-len 131072`, but you generally **can\u2019t exceed this safely** without modifying RoPE scaling and accepting unpredictable behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n- \u201c131k tokens\u201d is **prompt + output** total in a single request. So if you want very long prompts, you\u2019ll likely cap output to something smaller.\n\n---\n\n## Hardware recommendation (optimized for max context, low concurrency)\n\n### Best \u201csimple & robust\u201d choice\n- **One big-VRAM GPU**: **141GB-class** (e.g., H200) or similar.\n  - Why: you can keep weights + huge KV cache on-GPU with minimal compromises.\n\n### Strong \u201cgood enough\u201d choice\n- **80GB-class** (e.g., H100 80GB).\n  - With the model in MXFP4 (OpenAI\u2019s default for gpt-oss MoE weights), the weights themselves can be small enough that **most VRAM goes to KV cache**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\n### Avoid for \u201cmax context\u201d\n- Older GPUs where MXFP4 / FP8 KV cache is limited or unsupported; you\u2019ll hit memory walls sooner. OpenAI notes MXFP4 is supported on Hopper-or-later class GPUs (and similar modern families). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Serving stack: use vLLM (recommended for long-context serving)\nOpenAI has an official guide for serving gpt-oss with vLLM, and vLLM\u2019s own blog provides a ready container. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\n### Option A: Docker (fastest path)\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all \\\n  -p 8000:8000 \\\n  --ipc=host \\\n  vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b \\\n  --max-model-len 131072 \\\n  --max-num-seqs 1 \\\n  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95 \\\n  --enable-chunked-prefill\n```\n\nWhy these flags:\n- `--max-model-len 131072`: request the full context window. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- `--max-num-seqs 1`: you said minimal concurrency; this frees KV cache for one giant sequence. vLLM explicitly recommends reducing concurrency to reduce KV cache needs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.95`: vLLM pre-allocates KV cache from this budget; higher = more room for long context. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- `--enable-chunked-prefill`: helps avoid OOM during giant prompt ingestion and improves stability for long contexts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n\n### Option B: Python env install (if you dislike Docker)\nOpenAI\u2019s guide uses a gpt-oss-enabled vLLM wheel index:\n```bash\nuv venv --python 3.12 --seed\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\nuv pip install --pre vllm==0.10.1+gptoss \\\n  --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/gpt-oss/ \\\n  --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128 \\\n  --index-strategy unsafe-best-match\n\nvllm serve openai/gpt-oss-20b \\\n  --max-model-len 131072 \\\n  --max-num-seqs 1 \\\n  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95 \\\n  --enable-chunked-prefill\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## If you still run out of VRAM: FP8 KV cache (big win for max context)\nvLLM supports **FP8 KV cache** via `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` / `fp8_e4m3` etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \nThis can materially increase max context (or reduce VRAM pressure), but:\n\n- It\u2019s **hardware dependent** (works best on newer architectures). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- vLLM warns that FP8 KV cache generally should be used with **scaling factors** (`--quantization-param-path`) to avoid accuracy issues. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\nTry this *only if needed*:\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all \\\n  -p 8000:8000 \\\n  --ipc=host \\\n  vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b \\\n  --max-model-len 131072 \\\n  --max-num-seqs 1 \\\n  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.97 \\\n  --enable-chunked-prefill \\\n  --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3\n```\n(If quality degrades, revert `--kv-cache-dtype auto`.)\n\n---\n\n## \u201cSelf-host, but no vendor API keys\u201d\nYes: this path uses **open weights** (Hugging Face download) and **your own GPU instance**; you don\u2019t need OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini API keys at inference time. OpenAI\u2019s own deployment guides assume downloading `openai/gpt-oss-20b` from Hugging Face and serving it yourself. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Practical \u201cmax context\u201d operating mode (since you don\u2019t need concurrency)\nI\u2019d run with:\n- `--max-num-seqs 1`\n- `--max-model-len 131072`\n- `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.95\u20130.97`\n- `--enable-chunked-prefill`\n\nThen, in your client calls, set conservative output lengths (e.g., 2k\u20138k) unless you truly need giant outputs.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me **which GPU you can realistically rent** (80GB vs 141GB vs AMD MI300X), I\u2019ll give you the exact \u201cbest flags\u201d profile for that card (including whether FP8 KV cache is worth it for your
