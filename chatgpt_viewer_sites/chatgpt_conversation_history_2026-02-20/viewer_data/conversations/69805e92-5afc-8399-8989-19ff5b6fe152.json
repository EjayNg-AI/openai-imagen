Think of the negative sign in the power as a \u201cticket\u201d that \nwill bring the term to the other side when it is being \u201cused up\u201d.  \nExample 1: 3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u22122\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f5\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u22120.5\n4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e4\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u22122.5=3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f5\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc502.5\n4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e4\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f2\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc500.5  \nExample 2: 3\u22122\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f7\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\u22122=3\u22122\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e7\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\u22122\n1=\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e7\n32\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f2 \n \nSimilarly, if a term does not have a negative power and needs to move \nto the other side, then it will gain a \u201cticket\u201d when it moves to the other side.  \n \nExample 3: \n1\n2=2\u22121\n1=2\u22121 \nExample 4: 5\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc653=5\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\u22123\n1=5\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\u22123 \nFraction Power  \n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f  8:  \u221a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f1\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b  \n        \u221a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b=(\u221a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a=\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b  \n \n*Useful Tip for those who have difficulty remembering:  \nThe \ufffd(    )\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b is read as \u201croot n\u201d.
