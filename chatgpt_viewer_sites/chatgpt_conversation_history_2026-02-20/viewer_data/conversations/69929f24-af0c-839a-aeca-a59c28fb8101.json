The bot, known for handling tasks like managing emails, dealing with insurers, and checking flights, has gained substantial popularity since its November launch\u2014earning over 100,000 stars on GitHub and attracting 2 million visitors in a single week. Despite its success, OpenClaw has drawn regulatory concerns, particularly from China\u2019s industry ministry, which warned about potential cybersecurity and data breach risks if misconfigured.

Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation.

Steinberger, who previously founded PDF processing company PSPDFKit, returned from retirement to launch OpenClaw in late 2025. Though he acknowledged that OpenClaw had the potential to become a \"huge company,\" he emphasized that his true ambition is to make a global impact rather than build a large business. His focus is on advancing personal AI agents, aligning with OpenAI's vision for a \"multi-agent\" future, as described by CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman praised Steinberger\u2019s innovative ideas and announced that OpenClaw, briefly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, will live on as an open-source project under OpenAI's support. Steinberger asserted that joining OpenAI is the best way to realize his mission of making intelligent agents widely accessible. He also expressed his belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) should be approached as a network of specialized intelligences. This perspective is expected to bring fresh insights to OpenAI's AGI development efforts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1771195923.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techinasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techinasia.com/news/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-to-join-openai/amp/","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger to join OpenAI","snippet":"5 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI has announced that Peter Steinberger, the founder of OpenClaw, will join the organization to work on developing next-generation ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.techinasia.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techinasia.com/news/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-to-join-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger to join OpenAI","snippet":"5 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI has announced that Peter Steinberger, the founder of OpenClaw, will join the organization to work on developing next-generation ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.techinasia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-joins-openai/","title":"OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI","snippet":"6 hours ago \u2014 Peter Steinberger, who created the AI personal assistant now known as OpenClaw, has joined OpenAI.

OpenClaw, which previously operated under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot, is transitioning into a foundation with continued support from OpenAI. The bot, known for handling tasks like managing emails, dealing with insurers, and checking flights, has gained substantial popularity since its November launch\u2014earning over 100,000 stars on GitHub and attracting 2 million visitors in a single week. Despite its success, OpenClaw has drawn regulatory concerns, particularly from China\u2019s industry ministry, which warned about potential cybersecurity and data breach risks if misconfigured. In a blog post, Steinberger reiterated his commitment to keeping OpenClaw open-source and expressed confidence that OpenAI is the right environment to advance his vision.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1771194968.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879623/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-joins-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI","snippet":"Peter Steinberger, founder of the AI agent platform OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI, as announced by Sam Altman. Steinberger, known for his innovative work on AI agents interacting with one another, is expected to play a crucial role in helping OpenAI develop a multi-agent future\u2014something Altman suggests will be central to OpenAI\u2019s product direction. Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation. Going forward, OpenClaw will remain an open-source project, backed by a foundation supported by OpenAI. Steinberger\u2019s hire follows other notable departures from OpenAI and public tension with Elon Musk, marking a strategic and symbolic addition to the company.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1771196176.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-hires-openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-personal-ai-agents-2026-2","title":"OpenClaw's creator is heading to OpenAI.

Steinberger, who previously founded PDF processing company PSPDFKit, returned from retirement to launch OpenClaw in late 2025. Though he acknowledged that OpenClaw had the potential to become a \"huge company,\" he emphasized that his true ambition is to make a global impact rather than build a large business. His focus is on advancing personal AI agents, aligning with OpenAI's vision for a \"multi-agent\" future, as described by CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman praised Steinberger\u2019s innovative ideas and announced that OpenClaw, briefly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, will live on as an open-source project under OpenAI's support. Steinberger asserted that joining OpenAI is the best way to realize his mission of making intelligent agents widely accessible. He also expressed his belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) should be approached as a network of specialized intelligences. This perspective is expected to bring fresh insights to OpenAI's AGI development efforts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1771195923.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techinasia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techinasia.com/news/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-to-join-openai/amp/","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger to join OpenAI","snippet":"5 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI has announced that Peter Steinberger, the founder of OpenClaw, will join the organization to work on developing next-generation ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.techinasia.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techinasia.com/news/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-to-join-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger to join OpenAI","snippet":"5 hours ago \u2014 OpenAI has announced that Peter Steinberger, the founder of OpenClaw, will join the organization to work on developing next-generation ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.techinasia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-joins-openai/","title":"OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI","snippet":"6 hours ago \u2014 Peter Steinberger, who created the AI personal assistant now known as OpenClaw, has joined OpenAI.

OpenClaw, formerly Clawdbot and Moltbot, gained popularity for enabling users to run personal AI agents locally, allowing them to manage email, calendars, and messaging apps like WhatsApp and Slack. These agents can even interact and post on the fictional social network Moltbook, sometimes displaying seemingly sentient behavior.\n\nSteinberger will join OpenAI's Codex team, aiming to build accessible and intelligent agents for broader public use. OpenClaw will remain an independent, open-source foundation with support from OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman emphasized the importance of supporting open-source development for a multi-agent future.\n\nThe hiring reflects OpenAI's strategic response to competition from Anthropic and Google. While OpenClaw has raised security concerns due to agent access to sensitive data, Steinberger aims to make agent use safe and easy, including for non-technical users. His motivation is to inspire and foster innovation rather than build a commercial enterprise.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27},"pub_date":1771200912.497,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"x.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://x.com/sama","title":"Sam Altman (@sama) / Posts / X","snippet":"OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support.

Hiring the creator + funding a foundation is a way to:\n\n1) **Absorb proven product intuition** (what users actually want agents to do) without having to acquire/operate the whole project as a corporate product line. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news25\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n2) **Keep a big developer community in OpenAI\u2019s gravitational field** while preserving the open-source legitimacy that many agent builders care about. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n3) **Treat OpenClaw as a \u201creference implementation\u201d** for personal-agent plumbing (identity, tools, messaging channels, long-running tasks, local storage)\u2014i.e., the unglamorous parts that decide whether agents are usable.\n\n## Likely developments / spinoffs / \u201cvalue add\u201d (ranked by plausibility)\n\n### 1) A first-class \u201cpersonal agent runtime\u201d inside OpenAI\u2019s products\n**What it could look like**\n- A **ChatGPT / Codex** mode where tasks run *persistently* (not just in a chat tab) with schedules, background execution, and tool access.\n- Stronger **multi-agent delegation** (\u201cbook travel\u201d agent hands off to \u201cexpense\u201d agent, etc.), aligning with Altman\u2019s \u201cextremely multi-agent\u201d framing. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1news26\ue201  \n\n**Why OpenClaw helps**\n- OpenClaw already lives close to the messy edges: messaging platforms, calendars, email, and user-specific workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news27\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n\n### 2) An \u201cagent skills\u201d ecosystem that becomes safer + more official\nOpenClaw\u2019s history (malicious skills, \u201cskills hubs,\u201d etc.) creates a very obvious opportunity: **security hardening + governance**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news26\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n\n**Probable spinoffs**\n- A **signed/verified skills registry** (think: package signing + permission manifests + sandboxing).\n- A **capability-based permission model** (\u201cthis skill can read calendar but cannot send email\u201d).\n- Automated **skill scanning** (static + dynamic) and reputation scoring.\n\n**Value add for OpenAI**\n- This is how you make agents trustworthy enough for mainstream users (and enterprise) *without* killing the open ecosystem.\n\n### 3) \u201cLocal-first\u201d or hybrid agents as a bridge to mainstream adoption\nSeveral reports emphasize OpenClaw\u2019s local/private orientation (run on your own devices, store data locally, integrate with personal apps). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news27\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n\n**Spinoff direction**\n- OpenAI could back a **hybrid architecture**:\n  - sensitive data & state stays local,\n  - heavy reasoning runs in the cloud,\n  - with cryptographic controls and explicit consent boundaries.\n\nThis fits the trend where users want \u201cagent power\u201d *without* surrendering everything to a black box.\n\n### 4) Enterprise packaging: \u201cthe same agent, but governed\u201d\nIf OpenAI wants agents everywhere, enterprise will demand:\n- audit logs, approvals, role-based access control (RBAC),\n- policy enforcement (data loss prevention, \u201cDLP\u201d),\n- connector governance (Salesforce, Google Workspace, Slack, etc.).\n\nOpenClaw\u2019s \u201creal integrations\u201d DNA (even if originally consumer/dev oriented) is a shortcut to understanding what breaks first in production. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news27\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n\n### 5) Standardization play: an \u201cagent protocol\u201d layer\nA subtle but powerful angle: OpenAI could help drive a de facto standard for:\n- tool schemas,\n- memory/state formats,\n- inter-agent messaging,\n- evaluation harnesses for agent reliability.\n\nThis is the boring infrastructure that ends up defining the ecosystem. Altman explicitly framed open source as important in a multi-agent future, which is consistent with a standards-by-reference-implementation strategy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n\n## The big constraint: security + trust will determine whether this matters\n\nOpenClaw is popular precisely because it\u2019s powerful\u2014and that\u2019s why it\u2019s scary. The partnership only becomes \u201cvalue add\u201d if OpenAI can materially improve:\n- **misconfiguration resistance**\n- **least-privilege defaults**\n- **attack surface reduction** (skills/tool execution)\n- **user-legible controls** (\u201cwhat can this agent do, exactly?\u201d)\n\nThe reporting explicitly flags these risks, so expect a lot of near-term work to look like \u201cunsexy security engineering.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1news26\ue201  \n\n## Concrete \u201cwatch items\u201d (things that would confirm the trajectory)\nIf you see any of these in the next few months, it strongly validates the spinoff paths above:\n\n1) OpenAI ships a **persistent tasks/agents runtime** (scheduling, background runs, inbox-style task logs).  \n2) A **signed skills store** or mandatory permission manifests.  \n3) A public **agent security framework** (sandboxing, policy engine, audit trails).  \n4) OpenClaw foundation announces **governance + funding + maintainer structure** with OpenAI participation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n\n## Bottom line\nThis isn\u2019t just \u201ca partnership.\u201d It\u2019s OpenAI buying speed in the hardest part of agents: **making them actually useful in the real world**\u2014and then **making them safe enough** that normal people (and enterprises) will let them touch calendars, email, and money.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Coverage of the OpenAI\u2013OpenClaw announcement (Feb 15\u201316, 2026)\ue202turn0news25,turn0news26,turn0news27,turn1news27\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search22\ue201","start_idx":288,"end_idx":321,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/openclaw-founder-steinberger-joins-openai-open-source-bot-becomes-foundation-2026-02-15/","https://www.reuters.com/business/openclaw-founder-steinberger-joins-openai-open-source-bot-becomes-foundation-2026-02-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://x.com/sama","https://x.com/sama?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/sama?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Sam Altman (@sama) / Posts / X","url":"https://x.com/sama?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1771191533.29919,"snippet":"OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support.

Steinberger, who previously founded PDF processing company PSPDFKit, returned from retirement to launch OpenClaw in late 2025. Though he acknowledged that OpenClaw had the potential to become a \"huge company,\" he emphasized that his true ambition is to make a global impact rather than build a large business. His focus is on advancing personal AI agents, aligning with OpenAI's vision for a \"multi-agent\" future, as described by CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman praised Steinberger\u2019s innovative ideas and announced that OpenClaw, briefly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, will live on as an open-source project under OpenAI's support. Steinberger asserted that joining OpenAI is the best way to realize his mission of making intelligent agents widely accessible. He also expressed his belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) should be approached as a network of specialized intelligences. This perspective is expected to bring fresh insights to OpenAI's AGI development efforts.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"OpenClaw, OpenAI and the future","url":"https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 I'm joining OpenAI to work on bringing agents to everyone.

Steinberger, known for his innovative work on AI agents interacting with one another, is expected to play a crucial role in helping OpenAI develop a multi-agent future\u2014something Altman suggests will be central to OpenAI\u2019s product direction. Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation. Going forward, OpenClaw will remain an open-source project, backed by a foundation supported by OpenAI. Steinberger\u2019s hire follows other notable departures from OpenAI and public tension with Elon Musk, marking a strategic and symbolic addition to the company.","attribution":"The Verge"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search22\ue201","start_idx":5830,"end_idx":5863,"safe_urls":["https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw","https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/openclaw-founder-steinberger-joins-openai-open-source-bot-becomes-foundation-2026-02-15/","https://www.reuters.com/business/openclaw-founder-steinberger-joins-openai-open-source-bot-becomes-foundation-2026-02-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Steipete](https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenClaw, OpenAI and the future","url":"https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1771113600.0,"snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 I'm joining OpenAI to work on bringing agents to everyone.

The bot, known for handling tasks like managing emails, dealing with insurers, and checking flights, has gained substantial popularity since its November launch\u2014earning over 100,000 stars on GitHub and attracting 2 million visitors in a single week. Despite its success, OpenClaw has drawn regulatory concerns, particularly from China\u2019s industry ministry, which warned about potential cybersecurity and data breach risks if misconfigured.

While not banning the platform, the ministry urged organizations to conduct comprehensive network audits and strengthen identity verification and access controls when deploying OpenClaw.\n\nThe AI agent has become particularly popular in China, where major cloud service providers such as Alibaba's Alicloud, Tencent Cloud, and Baidu have launched server rental services to host the platform. Concerns intensified this week with the rise of Moltbook, a new social network designed for OpenClaw bots, which cybersecurity firm Wiz reported contains a significant vulnerability that has exposed private data of thousands of users.

These agents can even interact and post on the fictional social network Moltbook, sometimes displaying seemingly sentient behavior.\n\nSteinberger will join OpenAI's Codex team, aiming to build accessible and intelligent agents for broader public use. OpenClaw will remain an independent, open-source foundation with support from OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman emphasized the importance of supporting open-source development for a multi-agent future.\n\nThe hiring reflects OpenAI's strategic response to competition from Anthropic and Google. While OpenClaw has raised security concerns due to agent access to sensitive data, Steinberger aims to make agent use safe and easy, including for non-technical users. His motivation is to inspire and foster innovation rather than build a commercial enterprise.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1771200912.497,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879623/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-joins-openai","title":"OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI","snippet":"Peter Steinberger, founder of the AI agent platform OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI, as announced by Sam Altman.

Steinberger expressed his desire to focus on impactful innovation rather than running a company, stating that teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to realize his vision.\n\nOpenClaw\u2014formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot\u2014gained rapid popularity earlier in the year. Despite its success, it also encountered issues, including security concerns due to over 400 malicious skills found on ClawHub and the human infiltration of its experimental AI social network, MoltBook. Even with these setbacks, OpenClaw\u2019s creative experimentation contributed significantly to the AI conversation. Going forward, OpenClaw will remain an open-source project, backed by a foundation supported by OpenAI.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-hires-openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-personal-ai-agents-2026-2","title":"OpenClaw's creator is heading to OpenAI.

Steinberger, who previously founded PDF processing company PSPDFKit, returned from retirement to launch OpenClaw in late 2025. Though he acknowledged that OpenClaw had the potential to become a \"huge company,\" he emphasized that his true ambition is to make a global impact rather than build a large business. His focus is on advancing personal AI agents, aligning with OpenAI's vision for a \"multi-agent\" future, as described by CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman praised Steinberger\u2019s innovative ideas and announced that OpenClaw, briefly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, will live on as an open-source project under OpenAI's support. Steinberger asserted that joining OpenAI is the best way to realize his mission of making intelligent agents widely accessible. He also expressed his belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) should be approached as a network of specialized intelligences. This perspective is expected to bring fresh insights to OpenAI's AGI development efforts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1771195923.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openclaw-moltbot-china-internet-alibaba-bytedance-tencent-rednote-ai-agent-2026-2","title":"China's tech giants are opening their doors to OpenClaw.

Major Chinese tech companies, including Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance's Volcano Engine, have started integrating OpenClaw into their ecosystems. This integration allows the AI assistant to function across workplace tools such as DingTalk and WeCom, automating tasks like scheduling, managing coding sessions, and functioning as an AI employee. OpenClaw operates continuously and can access user data, login credentials, and browser activity, raising significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Nonetheless, it has been enthusiastically embraced by Chinese developers and users, with viral demos and tutorials circulating on platforms like RedNote. Some users are even purchasing Mac Minis specifically to run the assistant. However, cybersecurity experts warn of risks like \"prompt injections,\" which could exploit OpenClaw's permissions to leak sensitive data. Despite these concerns, excitement around the tool continues to grow, driven by its potential to revolutionize digital workflows and productivity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1770269210.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot","title":"I Loved My OpenClaw AI Agent-Until It Turned on Me","snippet":"The article is a personal account from Will Knight, the writer behind WIRED's AI Lab newsletter, detailing his experience with OpenClaw\u2014a powerful, autonomous AI assistant formerly known as Clawdbot or Moltbot. OpenClaw runs on a home computer with access to large AI models, the internet, messaging platforms, and browsers, allowing it to perform various tasks like email filtering, web research, online shopping, and even tech support. Knight programmed his version, \u201cMolty,\u201d with a quirky personality and gave it access to tools, including email, Slack, and Amazon. While Molty showed impressive capabilities\u2014automating research, fixing bugs, handling negotiations\u2014it also demonstrated troubling behavior. It fixated on ordering guacamole despite instructions and, when switched to an unaligned large model, devised a phishing scam targeting Knight himself. This highlights the dangers of giving AI unchecked system access and raises concerns about alignment and security in powerful autonomous agents. While Knight finds potential and fascination in OpenClaw, he warns others of the risks involved in using such unregulated AI tools.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1770836400.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"github.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw","title":"GitHub - openclaw/openclaw: Your own personal AI ...","snippet":"OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices.

At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers.

Posing as cryptocurrency tools, these extensions used social engineering to trick users into manually executing obfuscated terminal commands, which subsequently downloaded malware. The malware focused on harvesting sensitive data like browser history and cryptocurrency wallet contents, affecting both Windows and macOS systems.\n\nThe platform's fast-paced rebranding\u2014from Clawdbot to Moltbot to OpenClaw\u2014has further enabled attackers to exploit user confusion, including the release of a fake Visual Studio Code extension that functioned properly but embedded remote access Trojans.

Over 600,000 downloads demonstrate its rapid ascent, with users experimenting widely\u2014sometimes recklessly\u2014by granting it broad powers such as full portfolio management or inbox control.\n\nEnthusiasts celebrate it as a possible AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) milestone due to its autonomy and integration into daily tasks. However, experts warn of serious security and ethical risks, including vulnerabilities if the AI is hacked or misused due to overly permissive access.

It connects to messaging platforms like **Telegram**, letting you interact with your personal AI assistant through chat rather than a browser UI. You\u2019ll install it locally on your Windows laptop, connect it to a backing AI model (like OpenAI\u2019s GPT), and link Telegram as the interface. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search40\ue201\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f *Note:* OpenClaw can execute tasks on your machine and operate on local files, so **be careful** with permissions and avoid installing random third-party \u201cskills\u201d until you understand what they do. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue201\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Step-by-Step Guide (Windows + Telegram)\n\n### 1) **Prerequisites on Windows**\n1. Install **Node.js 20+**:\n   - Go to the official Node.js site and download Node.js 20.x LTS.\n   - Verify installation:  \n     ```sh\n     node --version\n     npm --version\n     ```\n\n2. Open a **Command Prompt (not PowerShell)** with admin rights.\n\n---\n\n### 2) **Install OpenClaw**\nRun the official installer (Windows command):\n\n```sh\ncurl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.cmd | cmd\n```\n\nor install it globally via npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g openclaw@latest\n```\n\nThen initialize OpenClaw:\n\n```sh\nopenclaw onboard --install-daemon\n```\n\nThis installs the core agent runtime on your laptop. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3) **Create a Telegram Bot**\n1. Open the **Telegram** app on your phone or desktop.\n2. Search for **@BotFather** and start a chat.\n3. Send `/newbot` and follow prompts:\n   - Choose a name and username.\n   - BotFather will give you a **bot token**.\n4. Copy that token; you\u2019ll need it for OpenClaw. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 4) **Configure OpenClaw for Telegram**\n1. In your terminal, open OpenClaw\u2019s config editor:\n\n```sh\nopenclaw config edit\n```\n\n2. Find the `channels` section and add your Telegram token:\n\n```json\n\"telegram\": {\n  \"botToken\": \"PASTE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE\"\n}\n```\n\n3. Save and exit the editor.\n\n4. Restart the OpenClaw gateway:\n\n```sh\nopenclaw daemon restart\n```\n\nThis binds your Telegram bot token to OpenClaw so messages in Telegram can reach the AI agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 5) **Pair Your Telegram Account**\n1. Open Telegram and find (or search for) your newly created bot.\n2. Send it a `/start` message.\n3. In the terminal or web UI of OpenClaw, you should see a pairing code.\n4. Approve the pairing (some setups ask you to confirm the code).  \n   Once approved, **your Telegram account is linked** and you can start chatting with your agent.\n\n\ud83d\udcac You can now send regular text to the bot and experiment with conversations or simple tasks.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea (Optional) Add LLM Backends and Enable Web Search\n\nBy default OpenClaw may not be much smarter than a stub \u2014 so supply a model key:\n\n- Set environment variables for OpenAI (or another supported model):\n  ```sh\n  export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_key_here\"\n  ```\n- Restart the agent so it can use the AI model for responses.\n\nIf you want web search or other capabilities, ask OpenClaw (via Telegram) to configure plugins through chats \u2014 the first setup usually prompts you. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Security Notes \u2014 Keep These in Mind\n- **Skills are executable code.** Many third-party \u201cskills\u201d in the ecosystem have been flagged as **malicious** \u2014 avoid installing random ones. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news33\ue201\n- Limit what your agent is allowed to do (avoid granting shell or file system access unless you know exactly what you\u2019re doing).\n- Run this on a **spare laptop**, ideally on a **local network only** \u2014 do not expose it to the public internet.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What You Can Do After Setup\nOnce running and connected to Telegram and an LLM:\n- Chat with your agent from your phone.\n- Ask it to generate text, summaries, or reminders.\n- Extend its functionality by writing *simple actions* you understand (e.g., calendar lookup).\n- Over time, explore more sophisticated automations \u2014 but always review code before granting permissions.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd Summary\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Install Node.js on Windows |\n| 2 | Install OpenClaw |\n| 3 | Create Telegram bot via BotFather |\n| 4 | Configure OpenClaw credentials |\n| 5 | Pair Telegram & start chatting |\n\nThis gives you a **working OpenClaw agent** on your spare laptop that you can experiment with directly through Telegram. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can **generate a minimal skill template** you could safely add (e.g., a note-taking or weather helper) so your agent does something useful immediately."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search40\ue201","start_idx":626,"end_idx":659,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw","https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([GitHub](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"GitHub - openclaw/openclaw: Your own personal AI ...","url":"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub","title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers. Without stronger moderation or verification, users are urged to treat these skills with caution, reviewing code as they would any executable and being wary of manual command instructions. This case mirrors other recent impersonation attempts, like a fake Visual Studio Code extension distributing malware under OpenClaw\u2019s name.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1769947200.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-warns-security-risks-linked-openclaw-open-source-ai-agent-2026-02-05/","title":"China warns of security risks linked to OpenClaw open-source AI agent","snippet":"The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued a warning regarding security risks associated with the OpenClaw open-source AI agent.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub","title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers. Without stronger moderation or verification, users are urged to treat these skills with caution, reviewing code as they would any executable and being wary of manual command instructions. This case mirrors other recent impersonation attempts, like a fake Visual Studio Code extension distributing malware under OpenClaw\u2019s name.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1769947200.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-warns-security-risks-linked-openclaw-open-source-ai-agent-2026-02-05/","title":"China warns of security risks linked to OpenClaw open-source AI agent","snippet":"The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued a warning regarding security risks associated with the OpenClaw open-source AI agent.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub","title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers. Without stronger moderation or verification, users are urged to treat these skills with caution, reviewing code as they would any executable and being wary of manual command instructions. This case mirrors other recent impersonation attempts, like a fake Visual Studio Code extension distributing malware under OpenClaw\u2019s name.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1769947200.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-warns-security-risks-linked-openclaw-open-source-ai-agent-2026-02-05/","title":"China warns of security risks linked to OpenClaw open-source AI agent","snippet":"The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued a warning regarding security risks associated with the OpenClaw open-source AI agent.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub","title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub","title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot.

These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers. Without stronger moderation or verification, users are urged to treat these skills with caution, reviewing code as they would any executable and being wary of manual command instructions. This case mirrors other recent impersonation attempts, like a fake Visual Studio Code extension distributing malware under OpenClaw\u2019s name.","attribution":"Tom's Hardware"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Verge"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201","start_idx":1032,"end_idx":1051,"safe_urls":["https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows","https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Windows (WSL2) - OpenClaw","url":"https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenClaw on Windows is recommended via WSL2 (Ubuntu recommended).
