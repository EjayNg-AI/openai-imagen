The summit saw participation from ASEAN nations and partners including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, and others. Key themes included regional peace, lawful resolutions in the South China Sea, and economic cooperation. Anwar and other leaders stressed the need for engagement, especially regarding North Korea and Myanmar, with calls for the implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus for Myanmar.\n\nThe summit also highlighted renewed U.S. trade efforts, with President Trump securing economic agreements in Southeast Asia and celebrating a ceasefire expansion in Cambodia-Thailand. Canada announced accelerated free trade talks with ASEAN, seeking economic resilience amid rising U.S. tariffs. ASEAN and key partners, including China, finalized discussions under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), aiming to enhance regional economic integration despite its relatively loose provisions. Celebrations included a birthday for Brazil's President Lula, symbolizing lighter moments amid serious diplomacy.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1761558874.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.scmp.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3328974/malaysias-anwar-casts-doubts-about-gaza-ceasefire-deal-history-shows-otherwise","title":"Malaysia's Anwar casts doubts about Gaza ceasefire deal","snippet":"Oct 14, 2025 \u2014 Anwar said this was because Malaysia had not given its full support for Trump's peace plan, unlike the other nations invited to the summit.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1760437817.0,"attribution":"www.scmp.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/how-anwar-ibrahim-is-making-malaysia-a-global-diplomatic-powerhouse","title":"How Anwar Ibrahim Is Making Malaysia a Global ...","snippet":"2 hours ago \u2014 There have been frequent protests against the war in Gaza and he faced pressure from Malaysia's Muslim-majority population to rescind his ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.bloomberg.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.populismstudies.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.populismstudies.org/anwar-ibrahims-civilisational-populism-the-gaza-war-and-malaysia/","title":"Anwar Ibrahim's Civilisational Populism: The Gaza War ...","snippet":"Oct 9, 2025 \u2014 This paper examines how Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's tenth prime minister, employs civilisational populism in shaping his foreign policy rhetoric, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.populismstudies.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/PBIPS/posts/malaysia-led-by-prime-minister-anwar-ibrahim-has-announced-that-it-is-prepared-t/1157552586566439/","title":"Palestine International Broadcast","snippet":"Malaysia, led by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, has announced that it is prepared to contribute peacekeepers to Gaza under a United Nations (UN) ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.facebook.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.csis.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.csis.org/analysis/anwar-ibrahims-gaza-stance-tests-malaysia-united-states-relations","title":"Anwar Ibrahim's Gaza Stance Tests Malaysia-United States ...","snippet":"Jun 28, 2024 \u2014 Anwar's unflinching support for the Palestinian group has raised eyebrows in Washington, where concerns about terrorism financing and the Israel ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.csis.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thevibes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thevibes.com/articles/news/114654/pm-must-reveal-what-he-told-trump-about-gaza-during-45-minute-car-ride","title":"PM must reveal what he told Trump about Gaza during \u201c45- ...","snippet":"20 hours ago \u2014 Anwar had pledged to raise the Gaza issue with Trump during a recent meeting between ABIM and the prime minister.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":1761553800.0,"attribution":"www.thevibes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"jps.populismstudies.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://jps.populismstudies.org/articles/anwar-ibrahim-s-civilisational-populism-the-gaza-war-and-malaysia","title":"Anwar Ibrahim's Civilisational Populism: The Gaza War ...","snippet":"We argue that Anwar Ibrahim, the tenth prime minister of Malaysia, has been involved with civilisational rhetoric for the purpose of gaining support.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"jps.populismstudies.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/malaysia-says-forced-displacement-palestinians-would-be-ethnic-cleansing-2025-02-06/","title":"Malaysia says forced displacement of Palestinians would be ethnic cleansing","snippet":"Malaysia has strongly condemned any proposal for the forced displacement of Palestinians, equating such actions to ethnic cleansing and violations of international law.

The flotilla, consisting of over 40 vessels carrying around 500 activists\u2014including prominent figures like Greta Thunberg and various parliamentarians\u2014came within 70 nautical miles of Gaza before being stopped. However, one ship, Mikeno, was believed to have breached the blockade and reached Gaza\u2019s territorial waters.\n\nIsrael stated that the intercepted vessels were attempting to enter a combat zone and insisted that aid could be delivered through official channels. All detained activists, including notable Europeans and several Irish, Polish, and Australian citizens, are being processed for deportation. Activists claimed the operation involved violence and aggression, which Israel denied. Protests erupted globally\u2014in Italy, Belgium, Germany, and across Latin America\u2014condemning the interception as illegal under international law.\n\nGovernments from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, including Spain, Italy, Turkey, Brazil, and Malaysia, criticized Israel's actions and demanded the protection and release of their nationals. Despite the interception, organisers declared the mission would persist in seeking to break the blockade and deliver aid to Gaza.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":11},"pub_date":1759413204.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/7022591/anwar-ibrahim-malaysia-prime-minister-interview-profile-balancing-act/","title":"What Does Anwar Ibrahim Stand for?

Internationally, he attempts to balance relationships, condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine while maintaining economic engagement with Russia, and supporting Palestine against Israeli actions. Domestically, he strives for a mature democracy respecting human rights, but navigates sensitive issues like LGBTQ rights cautiously due to political pressures.

However, the U.S.'s stance on the Gaza conflict has strained relations, sparking significant backlash in Malaysia, a key player in the semiconductor industry. This has led to boycotts of American brands such as Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, with instances of vandalism reported.

I have tried to be as objective and comprehensive as possible, and I will note where things remain opaque.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Pressures on Anwar / Malaysian leadership  \n### Domestic political pressure  \n- Malaysia is a majority-Muslim country where public sentiment is strongly pro-Palestinian. According to commentary, widespread anger over Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza\u2014for example perceived civilian casualties and humanitarian access issues\u2014has produced domestic public pressure on the government to take a robust stance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- Civil society and Islamist parties (e.g., \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\", \"Pan-Islamic Party (PAS)\", 0]\ue201) expect the government to act strongly in support of Palestine. One recent academic paper argues that Anwar uses \u201ccivilisational populism\u201d rhetoric (defender of Muslims globally) in part to meet these expectations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- There has been pressure from activists and NGOs for full support of the Palestinian cause, including condemnation of Israel, refusal to recognise or support Israeli actions, banning Israeli-flagged ships, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- For example: The leadership is being asked to reveal what was conveyed to US President \ue200entity\ue202[\"people\",\"Donald Trump\",0]\ue201 during a car-ride conversation about Gaza\u2014some groups consider the message too vague. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n\n### International / diplomatic pressure  \n- The Malaysian government faces diplomatic tension with allies (notably the \ue200entity\ue202[\"place\",\"United States\",0]\ue201) who are concerned about Malaysia\u2019s strong support for the Palestinian cause, and particularly its links/relations with the political wing of \ue200entity\ue202[\"organization\",\"Hamas\",0]\ue201. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- Malaysia\u2019s foreign policy stance (e.g., refusing to declare Hamas as a terrorist organisation, or engaging with Hamas\u2019s political wing) has raised eyebrows in Washington regarding \u201cterrorism financing\u201d concerns. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- Malaysia\u2019s economic/diplomatic balancing: While taking a strong moral stance on Gaza/Palestine, it must also maintain relationships with Western powers (for investments, technology, trade) and manage relations with other major powers (China, Russia). This creates pressure to avoid fully alienating any major partner. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news19\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n### Policy and governance constraints  \n- The government\u2019s ability to take more forceful measures (e.g., sanctions, fully banning Israeli trade, deploying Malaysian peacekeepers, or recognising Palestinian statehood beyond current) is limited by economic, diplomatic, and security-policy considerations.  \n- Some domestic critics argue that Anwar\u2019s responses are too moderate or vague, given the expectations from civil society and activism. For example, a Malaysian NGO raised dissatisfaction with the details (or lack thereof) of what Anwar told Trump about Gaza. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n- The need to maintain domestic political coalition stability also constrains the scope of action: Anwar leads a coalition government with diverse interests and must manage internal expectations (Islamist parties vs more moderate/liberal partners) and thus manage rhetorical as well as policy gestures.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Anwar has responded  \nHere is a summary of his key responses and strategy.\n\n### Public statements and diplomatic posture  \n- Anwar has publicly condemned Israeli actions in Gaza, calling forced displacement of Palestinians \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and a violation of international law. For example, Malaysia\u2019s foreign ministry under his government said so in February 2025. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news10\ue201  \n- He has criticised what he sees as the \u201cselective application\u201d of international law by Western nations: contrasting their condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with their perceived silence or permissiveness towards Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue202turn0news12\ue201  \n- He has asserted Malaysia will maintain relations with the political wing of Hamas (not the military wing) and refused to recognise US demands to sever ties or designate Hamas fully as terrorist under Malaysian policy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- He has banned Israeli-flagged ships from docking at Malaysian ports (December 2023) as part of Malaysia\u2019s support for Palestine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- At the regional and international level, Malaysia has emphasised multilateralism, dialogue over coercion, and peaceful resolution. For instance, at the East Asia Summit in October 2025 he said Asia-Pacific leaders must choose dialogue and cooperation amid global conflicts including Gaza. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news9\ue201  \n\n### Humanitarian and symbolic gestures  \n- Malaysia under Anwar has sent humanitarian aid to Gaza via NGOs. (E.g., shipments via Malaysian NGO networks) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n- He has leveraged the Palestinian cause as part of Malaysia\u2019s foreign-policy identity, aligning with Malaysia\u2019s long-standing support for Palestinian statehood and rights. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n### Balancing economic/diplomatic interests  \n- While taking moral and diplomatic positions, Anwar has emphasised that Malaysia will not push too far in ways that imperil foreign investment, trade (especially US technology firms) or other strategic partnerships. For example: In a 2024 Time profile, he remarked: \u201cDifference on Gaza is one thing \u2026 but we continue aggressively to engage with US companies.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201  \n- He has attempted to thread the needle between moral leadership for the Palestinian cause and maintaining constructive global relationships: e.g., not fully aligning with every Western position, but not isolating Malaysia from the West either.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key tensions and unresolved issues  \n- Despite strong rhetoric, critics argue Anwar has sometimes been vague about concrete commitments: e.g., what exactly was communicated to Trump, or how Malaysia will transform statements into enforceable policy beyond symbolic acts. (See NGO dissatisfaction with the \u201ccar-ride\u201d conversation with Trump). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n- Malaysia\u2019s engagement with the political wing of Hamas continues to raise questions internationally about how Malaysia delineates between political and military wings\u2014and whether Malaysia might face sanctions or scrutiny for links to groups designated by others as terrorist. (Discussion in CSIS commentary). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- The push-and-pull between domestic expectations (strong pro-Palestinian stance) and pragmatic foreign-policy/economic considerations remains delicate: too hard a stance could alienate Western partners or investment; too soft could disappoint domestic supporters.  \n- The effectiveness of Malaysia\u2019s actions (bans, statements, humanitarian assistance) in influencing the conflict itself is limited; critics say more concrete, internationally-coordinated diplomacy is needed.  \n- There is a credibility question: If Malaysia continues to condemn Israeli actions but does not attach significant policy or diplomatic cost to them, some observers may see a gap between rhetoric and substance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Assessment: Forward-looking considerations  \nGiven your interest in nuanced geopolitical/macro analysis, a few forward-looking points:\n\n- **Soft power & identity politics**: Anwar is using the Palestinian issue as part of Malaysia\u2019s identity and soft-power credentials in the Muslim world and global South. This carries domestic political value and international positioning. But it also constrains flexibility: if Malaysia is seen as a \u201cdefender of Palestine,\u201d retreating or moderating positions may cost political capital at home.  \n- **Economic-diplomatic balancing act**: Malaysia is a player in global supply chains (semiconductors etc.). Any major tilt (for example, broad sanctions on Israel or U.S. firms) could undermine economic interests. Thus, Anwar\u2019s cautious balancing approach is rational, though it may frustrate activist constituencies.  \n- **Regional leadership angle**: Malaysia under Anwar may try to position itself as a regional voice meditating in conflicts (e.g., ASEAN, Middle-East). Its stance on Gaza gives moral leverage, though translating that into concrete influence will be challenging.  \n- **Constraints of influence**: While statements and bans are symbolic, the Iran/Israel/Gaza theatre is dominated by very powerful actors. Malaysia\u2019s capacity to shape outcomes is limited, so its strategy appears more about moral positioning, diplomacy, and supporting humanitarian access rather than military or direct mediation.  \n- **Risk of diplomatic friction**: As noted, U.S.\u2013Malaysia ties are under strain because of the Gaza stance. If Malaysia\u2019s position leads to sanctions risks, investment diversion, or technology access issues, this could create domestic economic pressure.  \n- **Domestic coalition fragility**: Malaysia\u2019s political coalition remains somewhat fragile. If Anwar is seen as failing to deliver strongly on the Palestinian issue, Islamist coalition partners or opposition groups may amplify criticism, potentially destabilising his government.  \n- **Potential for escalation or policy shift**: If the Gaza conflict evolves (e.g., significant escalation, new peace process, or cease-fire deal) Malaysia may face new decision-points: whether to recognise Palestinian statehood unilaterally, deploy Malaysian peacekeepers, or take tougher sanctions. Anwar\u2019s prior responses suggest he will move cautiously, seeking multilateral frameworks rather than unilateral leaps.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary  \nIn short:  \n- The Malaysian political leadership (especially Anwar) faces **domestic pressure** (from Islamist parties, pro-Palestinian public opinion) and **international pressure** (from Western allies over Malaysia\u2019s stance vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas and Israel) regarding the Gaza conflict.  \n- Anwar\u2019s response is to adopt a public, moral-diplomatic stance in support of Palestine (condemning forced displacement, banning Israeli-flagged ships, maintaining links with Hamas\u2019s political wing), while simultaneously keeping Malaysia\u2019s economic and strategic ties to the West intact and avoiding positions that could jeopardise Malaysia\u2019s broader interests.  \n- The balancing act remains delicate and poses risks: either side (too strong a tilt vs too weak a stance) carries political cost. Anwar appears to favour a middle path: remain vocal, maintain symbolic actions, but avoid major structural foreign-policy shifts that could harm Malaysia\u2019s economic/pragmatic interests.  \n- The key unresolved question is whether Malaysia\u2019s actions will translate into meaningful influence on the ground in Gaza (or in the diplomacy around it), or whether they remain primarily symbolic.  \n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent news on Malaysia & Gaza/Israel stance\ue202turn0news10,turn0news12,turn0news9\ue201  \n\nIf you like, I can pull together **data** on Malaysia\u2019s aid to Gaza (volumes, shipments), internal polling on the issue, and compare Malaysia\u2019s position with other ASEAN states (e.g., Indonesia, Singapore) to see how Anwar\u2019s stance is distinctive.

Ibrahim ascended to Malaysia's prime ministership, U.S. relations with Malaysia appeared promising due to his democratic leanings and familiarity with Washington.

This has led to boycotts of American brands such as Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, with instances of vandalism reported. Anwar has criticized U.S. actions regarding Gaza and has simultaneously bolstered ties with China, praising China's respectful leadership and emphasizing unity on foreign policy matters, including support for Palestine.

The wounded will be treated at a medical facility on Galang Island, a previously uninhabited island near Sumatra that once hosted a refugee camp for Vietnamese asylum seekers. The plan, confirmed by presidential spokesperson Hasan Nasbi, includes temporary accommodation for the patients' families, and anticipates returning the patients to Gaza post-recovery, although logistics for their return remain unclear.\n\nThis initiative comes amidst reports \u2014 denied by Indonesia \u2014 suggesting coordination with Israel and the US to permanently relocate Palestinians. The offer has stirred controversy domestically, with religious leaders and organizations cautioning against potential hidden motives, warning it could aid long-term displacement and Israeli occupation. Critics, including top Muslim clerics, advocate for medical support to be delivered within Gaza instead.\n\nIndonesia, a Muslim-majority nation and supporter of a two-state solution, continues to reject the notion of forced displacement. Galang Island, hosting a COVID-19 treatment hospital since 2020, has historical precedent as a humanitarian site.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1754622777.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/34095ff70dd333ad1c328e515d9a0426","title":"Indonesia offers to temporarily shelter wounded and orphaned Palestinians from Gaza","snippet":"Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced that Indonesia will provide temporary shelter to Palestinian orphans and individuals injured in the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.

Israel celebrated Independence Day more subduedly owing to the ongoing war. The conflict, which began with a Hamas attack on October 7, resulted in significant casualties and destruction, including 35,000 Palestinian deaths and severe damage to infrastructure and aid facilities. The U.N. calls for an immediate cease-fire and reopening of aid routes, criticizing both Israeli military actions and Hamas for exacerbating the crisis. In Rafah, Israeli operations have led to hospital closures and severe humanitarian challenges. The White House raised concerns about Israel facing a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign. Concurrently, diplomatic efforts and condemnations unfold internationally, including Qatar and Egypt's mediation efforts and legal actions against Israel at the International Court of Justice.

Malaysia, a consistent supporter of the Palestinian cause, underscores its commitment to a two-state solution as the means to achieve lasting peace and stability. Additionally, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim maintains good relations with the political wing of Hamas, although not the military wing.

The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR) conducted the survey in early September, finding that 57% of Gazans opposed the decision, a significant shift from a previous poll in June where the same percentage supported it. The poll also highlighted a decrease in support for the attack in the West Bank, although a majority of 64% still deemed it correct. Since the attack, which resulted in 1,200 Israeli fatalities and 250 abductions, Israel's military response has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry. Despite dwindling support for the October 7 attack, Hamas remains more popular than President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction in both regions.

Now, he is working to enhance Malaysia\u2019s global standing and economic ties, particularly with China, despite traditional US relationships. Anwar is focused on healing political and social divisions in Malaysia and tackling corruption, but faces substantial challenges including a conservative shift, Islamist influences, inflation caused by global conflict, limited parliamentary support, and his own controversial past. Internationally, he attempts to balance relationships, condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine while maintaining economic engagement with Russia, and supporting Palestine against Israeli actions. Domestically, he strives for a mature democracy respecting human rights, but navigates sensitive issues like LGBTQ rights cautiously due to political pressures. Anwar\u2019s legacy will depend on his ability to manage these complexities and deliver economic progress without alienating crucial support bases.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1726729200.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69004c7da6348321ad773c5d151c6b8a","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Merdeka Center polls on Gaza, Israel","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6eae94e8-9680-4a80-9524-a293994ca93b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"1dab3ba1-e20c-4132-8cc1-efd43479a5e1","turn_exchange_id":"201e2dc2-806f-410e-86ff-4591e9ecb164","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1dab3ba1-e20c-4132-8cc1-efd43479a5e1","children":["111adcd5-ee12-49de-af5a-3eff723350af"]},"111adcd5-ee12-49de-af5a-3eff723350af":{"id":"111adcd5-ee12-49de-af5a-3eff723350af","message":{"id":"111adcd5-ee12-49de-af5a-3eff723350af","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761627269.222857,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into Singapore's stance","content":"I need to find out Singapore's position on the conflict.

In a parliamentary statement, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan criticized Israeli politicians for supporting annexation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and condemned ongoing settlement expansion such as the E1 project, asserting that it fragments Palestinian territories and undermines the viability of a two-state solution.\n\nSingapore\u2019s stance aligns with a broader international trend of opposition to Israeli settlements, widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Balakrishnan emphasized that Singapore's recognition of Palestinian statehood is inevitable, but dependent on conditions like the emergence of a capable Palestinian government that acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to exist and renounces terrorism. Despite close diplomatic and military ties with Israel since 1965, Singapore supported U.N. resolutions in 2024 favoring Palestinian statehood. The country is advocating for a peaceful, negotiated two-state solution ensuring security and dignity for both peoples. Details of the sanctions are expected to be released later.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1758546968.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/07/israel-gaza-war-security-cabinet-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-middle-east-latest-news","title":"Hostages' families protest against Gaza plan - as it happened","snippet":"Amid escalating tensions and humanitarian crises, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed plans for full military control of Gaza, prompting protests across Israel, especially from families of hostages still held by Hamas. The proposed military offensive, which Netanyahu claims aims to defeat Hamas and ensure security without establishing lasting governance, has received backlash domestically and abroad. Hostage families, kibbutzim leaders, and Israeli military officials voiced concern that expanded operations could endanger the remaining captives' lives.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior Hamas official warned that any foreign force governing Gaza under Israeli direction would be treated as occupying forces. Jordan and other Arab states echoed opposition to Netanyahu's plan, affirming that only Palestinian institutions should govern Gaza.\n\nOn the humanitarian side, the situation in Gaza worsens, with UN agencies reporting record levels of child malnutrition. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res called for the closure of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, alleging deadly violence at aid distribution points. Amid the crisis, only 1.5% of Gaza\u2019s cropland remains accessible, and aid deliveries remain below international agreements.\n\nInternational criticism continues, including a call from 200+ writers for a total boycott of Israel, and Human Rights Watch urged an arms embargo over civilian deaths. US and EU responses remain cautious, with growing calls for diplomatic pressure.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1754611234.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69004c7da6348321ad773c5d151c6b8a","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Singapore's stance on Gaza and Israel","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6eae94e8-9680-4a80-9524-a293994ca93b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"52f51e11-05e8-4090-be6d-e6feb43a8d9d","turn_exchange_id":"201e2dc2-806f-410e-86ff-4591e9ecb164","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"52f51e11-05e8-4090-be6d-e6feb43a8d9d","children":["28db0377-d169-46b2-b286-56ed6def9dd9"]},"28db0377-d169-46b2-b286-56ed6def9dd9":{"id":"28db0377-d169-46b2-b286-56ed6def9dd9","message":{"id":"28db0377-d169-46b2-b286-56ed6def9dd9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761627274.70237,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking up Malaysia\u2019s stance","content":"I need to figure out Malaysia\u2019s position on several points: whether they\u2019ve facilitated shipments through the government or NGOs, the situation with the flotilla, the ban on Israeli ships in December 2023, and any sanctions they may have imposed.

as it happened","snippet":"On October 2, 2025, Israel intercepted the majority of the Global Sumud Flotilla, a civilian-led mission aiming to deliver aid and challenge the naval blockade of Gaza. The flotilla, consisting of over 40 vessels carrying around 500 activists\u2014including prominent figures like Greta Thunberg and various parliamentarians\u2014came within 70 nautical miles of Gaza before being stopped. However, one ship, Mikeno, was believed to have breached the blockade and reached Gaza\u2019s territorial waters.\n\nIsrael stated that the intercepted vessels were attempting to enter a combat zone and insisted that aid could be delivered through official channels. All detained activists, including notable Europeans and several Irish, Polish, and Australian citizens, are being processed for deportation. Activists claimed the operation involved violence and aggression, which Israel denied. Protests erupted globally\u2014in Italy, Belgium, Germany, and across Latin America\u2014condemning the interception as illegal under international law.\n\nGovernments from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, including Spain, Italy, Turkey, Brazil, and Malaysia, criticized Israel's actions and demanded the protection and release of their nationals. Despite the interception, organisers declared the mission would persist in seeking to break the blockade and deliver aid to Gaza.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1759413204.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-intercepts-last-boat-gaza-flotilla-organisers-say-2025-10-03/","title":"Israeli military intercepts final aid boat as new flotilla sails to Gaza","snippet":"On October 3, 2025, the Israeli military intercepted the final vessel, the Marinette, of the Global Sumud Flotilla headed to Gaza, after previously detaining around 450 activists, including Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg. The Marinette was stopped approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza, with all passengers detained and taken to Ashdod port in Israel. Organizers condemned the move, claiming all 42 humanitarian aid boats in the flotilla were illegally intercepted. A second flotilla of 11 vessels, carrying medics and journalists, was reportedly en route to Gaza.\n\nFootage from Marinette showed activists spotting an approaching warship before being boarded. Israel reiterated its position that the flotilla violated a lawful naval blockade and offered to deliver aid via official channels. Four Italian parliamentarians among the detainees were deported, with others undergoing the process. Meanwhile, widespread protests in support of the flotilla occurred across Europe and cities such as Karachi, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City.\n\nIn a controversial statement, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir labeled the activists as \"terrorists.\" Cyprus confirmed one flotilla boat docked with medics and reporters on board. This interception comes as international criticism mounts over Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive in Gaza, which, according to Palestinian health officials, has resulted in over 66,000 deaths since the October 2023 Hamas attack.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1759509847.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69004c7da6348321ad773c5d151c6b8a","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Malaysia shipment restrictions, aid, and flotilla details","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6eae94e8-9680-4a80-9524-a293994ca93b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"04a4ab3d-fddf-4a6f-8612-604ad4f9d8fe","turn_exchange_id":"201e2dc2-806f-410e-86ff-4591e9ecb164","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"04a4ab3d-fddf-4a6f-8612-604ad4f9d8fe","children":["f7691257-7b00-488d-a4a3-8a4b1649a8ba"]},"f7691257-7b00-488d-a4a3-8a4b1649a8ba":{"id":"f7691257-7b00-488d-a4a3-8a4b1649a8ba","message":{"id":"f7691257-7b00-488d-a4a3-8a4b1649a8ba","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761627281.929178,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Checking Malaysia\u2019s aid shipments","content":"I need to verify the claim that Malaysia sent 2,400 tonnes of aid to Gaza, which I\u2019ve seen from sources like FB and The Star citing Bernama.

resume funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to support civilians in Gaza. In a speech at the Australian National University, Anwar criticized the West for its inconsistent responses to international conflicts, highlighting the differing reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the suffering in Gaza. He commended countries, including Australia, for calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid. Anwar reiterated the historical plight of Palestinians since the Nakba and called for an end to the killings of innocents. Despite allegations against some UNRWA staff, Anwar stressed the importance of continuing support for the agency.

High-salience domestic opinion underwrites the stance. |\n| **Indonesia** | **Hospital ship** deployment (Jan 2024); repeated **aid airdrops** with Jordan (e.g., **~18t** airdropped Aug 2025); **field hospital/medical task forces** to Rafah; **proposal to treat ~1,000\u20132,000 wounded/orphans** on **Galang Island** temporarily. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0news52\ue202turn0news51\ue201 | Strong pro-Palestinian rhetoric; no formal ties with Israel; cautious to avoid permanent displacement optics in the Galang plan; vocal at multilateral fora. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news51\ue201 | **Big-ticket humanitarian ops** (air/sea/medical). Less use of **economic tools** like Malaysia\u2019s port bans; **no Hamas engagement** akin to Malaysia\u2019s political-wing ties. |\n| **Singapore** | Government + public **humanitarian aid \u2265S$24m** across **10 tranches** by **Sep 22, 2025**; SRC has run logistics via Egypt/ICRC. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search8\ue201 | **Balance+law stance**: condemned Hamas\u2019 Oct 7 attack; affirmed Israel\u2019s self-defence **subject to international law**; increasingly **critical of Israel\u2019s Gaza conduct**; **announced targeted sanctions on Israeli settler leaders** (Sep 22, 2025); said recognition of Palestine is **\u201cinevitable\u201d under the right conditions**; welcomed a US-backed ceasefire plan urging Hamas to accept. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news20\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search7\ue201 | **Most legal-institutional** posture (sanctions, conditions for recognition).

The Marinette was stopped approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza, with all passengers detained and taken to Ashdod port in Israel. Organizers condemned the move, claiming all 42 humanitarian aid boats in the flotilla were illegally intercepted. A second flotilla of 11 vessels, carrying medics and journalists, was reportedly en route to Gaza.\n\nFootage from Marinette showed activists spotting an approaching warship before being boarded. Israel reiterated its position that the flotilla violated a lawful naval blockade and offered to deliver aid via official channels. Four Italian parliamentarians among the detainees were deported, with others undergoing the process. Meanwhile, widespread protests in support of the flotilla occurred across Europe and cities such as Karachi, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City.\n\nIn a controversial statement, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir labeled the activists as \"terrorists.\" Cyprus confirmed one flotilla boat docked with medics and reporters on board.

Israeli military intercepted the final vessel, the Marinette, of the Global Sumud Flotilla headed to Gaza, after previously detaining around 450 activists, including Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg. The Marinette was stopped approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza, with all passengers detained and taken to Ashdod port in Israel. Organizers condemned the move, claiming all 42 humanitarian aid boats in the flotilla were illegally intercepted. A second flotilla of 11 vessels, carrying medics and journalists, was reportedly en route to Gaza.\n\nFootage from Marinette showed activists spotting an approaching warship before being boarded. Israel reiterated its position that the flotilla violated a lawful naval blockade and offered to deliver aid via official channels. Four Italian parliamentarians among the detainees were deported, with others undergoing the process. Meanwhile, widespread protests in support of the flotilla occurred across Europe and cities such as Karachi, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City.\n\nIn a controversial statement, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir labeled the activists as \"terrorists.\" Cyprus confirmed one flotilla boat docked with medics and reporters on board. This interception comes as international criticism mounts over Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive in Gaza, which, according to Palestinian health officials, has resulted in over 66,000 deaths since the October 2023 Hamas attack.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Malaysia bans Israel-flagged ships from its ports in ...","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/malaysia-bans-israeli-affiliated-and-israel-bound-ships-from-its-ports?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dec 20, 2023 \u2014 \u201cThe Malaysian government decided to block and disallow the Israeli-based shipping company ZIM from docking at any Malaysian port,\u201d Anwar said.","attribution":"Al Jazeera"},{"title":"Malaysia Bans Israeli-Based ZIM From Anchoring in Its ...","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-20/malaysia-bans-israeli-based-zim-from-anchoring-in-nation-s-ports?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dec 19, 2023 \u2014 Malaysia said it will block Israel-based ZIM Integrated Shipping Services from anchoring at any of the Southeast Asian nation's ports.","attribution":"Bloomberg"},{"title":"Malaysia bans Israeli-flagged ships from using its ports in ...","url":"https://www.timesofisrael.com/malaysia-bans-israeli-flagged-ships-from-using-its-ports-in-response-to-gaza-war/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dec 20, 2023 \u2014 \u201cThe Malaysian government decided to block and disallow the Israeli-based shipping company ZIM from docking at any Malaysian port,\u201d Anwar said.","attribution":"The Times of Israel"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"CNA"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search17\ue201","start_idx":8000,"end_idx":8047,"safe_urls":["https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/IndonesiacontinuesaidairdropsintoGazaincooperationwithJordan/07d962750eaa41ed9a9d1d2d1a1648d9/video?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-19/indonesia-airdropped-aid-for-palestinians-gaza-independence-day/105671926?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2025/08/15/indonesia-sends-fourth-health-task-force-to-besieged-gaza.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Jakarta Post](https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2025/08/15/indonesia-sends-fourth-health-task-force-to-besieged-gaza.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Indonesia sends fourth health task force to besieged Gaza","url":"https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2025/08/15/indonesia-sends-fourth-health-task-force-to-besieged-gaza.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Aug 15, 2025 \u2014 The fourth batch will be stationed at a field hospital in the Palestinian border town of Rafah, in addition to the Emirati floating hospital.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Indonesia airdropped aid for Palestinians in Gaza, but ...","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-19/indonesia-airdropped-aid-for-palestinians-gaza-independence-day/105671926?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Aug 19, 2025 \u2014 Indonesia has airdropped 18 tonnes of aid into Gaza after being given special permission by Israel.

In a parliamentary statement, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan criticized Israeli politicians for supporting annexation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and condemned ongoing settlement expansion such as the E1 project, asserting that it fragments Palestinian territories and undermines the viability of a two-state solution.\n\nSingapore\u2019s stance aligns with a broader international trend of opposition to Israeli settlements, widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Balakrishnan emphasized that Singapore's recognition of Palestinian statehood is inevitable, but dependent on conditions like the emergence of a capable Palestinian government that acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to exist and renounces terrorism. Despite close diplomatic and military ties with Israel since 1965, Singapore supported U.N. resolutions in 2024 favoring Palestinian statehood. The country is advocating for a peaceful, negotiated two-state solution ensuring security and dignity for both peoples. Details of the sanctions are expected to be released later.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Singapore welcomes Trump's Gaza peace plan, calls on ...","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-welcomes-trumps-gaza-peace-plan-to-end-conflict-supports-immediate-ceasefire-mfa?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In a statement on Sept 30, an MFA spokesperson said: \u201cWe call on Hamas to accept the proposal in order to end the war in Gaza. \u201cSingapore supports an immediate ...","attribution":"The Straits Times"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Home"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search8\ue201","start_idx":8230,"end_idx":8262,"safe_urls":["https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/some-southeast-asians-are-turning-against-america-over-gaza-it-likely-wont-last/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.iseas.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-State-of-SEA-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-State-of-SEA-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The State of Southeast Asia: 2024 Survey Report","url":"https://www.iseas.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-State-of-SEA-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1711945895.0,"snippet":"Apr 2, 2024 \u2014 Israel's attack on Gaza had gone too far.
