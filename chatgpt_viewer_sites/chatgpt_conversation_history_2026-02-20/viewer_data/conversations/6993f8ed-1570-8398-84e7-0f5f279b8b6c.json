next-generation personal agents, according to a statement from CEO Sam Altman. OpenClaw, which previously operated under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot, is transitioning into a foundation with continued support from OpenAI. The bot, known for handling tasks like managing emails, dealing with insurers, and checking flights, has gained substantial popularity since its November launch\u2014earning over 100,000 stars on GitHub and attracting 2 million visitors in a single week. Despite its success, OpenClaw has drawn regulatory concerns, particularly from China\u2019s industry ministry, which warned about potential cybersecurity and data breach risks if misconfigured.

The two new models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are publicly available via Hugging Face and can be run locally and fine-tuned by users. These models employ chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling more thoughtful and multi-step responses, and support web browsing, software navigation, and code execution.\n\nThe open weights allow researchers and developers to inspect and adapt the models, while the Apache 2.0 license permits commercial use and redistribution. Although open-weight models pose higher safety risks, OpenAI performed extensive internal safety tests and concluded their risk levels are manageable. gpt-oss-120b performs competitively with OpenAI\u2019s proprietary o3 and o4-mini models, and the smaller gpt-oss-20b can run on devices with over 16 GB of memory.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that this release is a return to OpenAI\u2019s mission of democratizing AI.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism.

At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers. Without stronger moderation or verification, users are urged to treat these skills with caution, reviewing code as they would any executable and being wary of manual command instructions.

These predefined GPU reservation blocks, used primarily by organizations with large cloud budgets for critical machine learning workloads, have seen notable price hikes\u2014most significantly in the US West (N. California) region, where the p5e.48xlarge instance cost jumped from $43.26 to $49.75 per hour. Prices for p5e.48xlarge and p5en.48xlarge have also increased across most regions to $39.80 and $41.61, respectively.\n\nCapacity Blocks allow users to lock in GPU resources up to eight weeks in advance for fixed durations and established rates, with pricing determined at the time of booking. AWS attributed this price adjustment to rising demand and limited GPU supply globally. Despite previous reductions in other GPU services, such as On-Demand and Savings Plans in late 2025, Capacity Blocks were excluded from those discounts.\n\nAWS emphasized that these prices are dynamic and reflect current market conditions, with a formal review expected in April 2026. The company reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining fixed pricing for On-Demand and Savings Plan services.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1767699750.0,"attribution":"www.itpro.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6993f9394f748331bee8876cba46c81e","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"request_id":"766bd502-3b6b-4f76-be9e-0c9799a333a5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"36f81d26-bfbe-4910-8221-8ec496f2c4ca","turn_exchange_id":"f740e3c5-7257-4b0f-98a1-08d80eddca90","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching AWS instances for H100 and pricing","classifier_response":"default","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"36f81d26-bfbe-4910-8221-8ec496f2c4ca","children":["c15aa9ac-9d98-4b96-bde2-4c47ce381c5b"]},"c15aa9ac-9d98-4b96-bde2-4c47ce381c5b":{"id":"c15aa9ac-9d98-4b96-bde2-4c47ce381c5b","message":{"id":"c15aa9ac-9d98-4b96-bde2-4c47ce381c5b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771305362.910007,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Checking AWS P5 instances and providing instance details","content":"We have some sources on the P5 instances and other types.

\ue200cite\ue202turn14search1\ue201  \n\nSecurity group (minimum):\n- Inbound: **SSH (22)** from **your IP only**\n- **No inbound for 8000** (we\u2019ll tunnel)\n\n---\n\n## 3) AWS EC2: install + run vLLM (gpt-oss)\n\nSSH into EC2 (from WSL or PowerShell; WSL shown):\n```bash\nssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@EC2_PUBLIC_IP\n```\n\n### 3.1 Install vLLM \u201cgpt-oss\u201d build (per OpenAI guide)\nOn the EC2 host:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y curl git\n\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nuv venv --python 3.12 --seed\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\nuv pip install --pre vllm==0.10.1+gptoss \\\n  --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/gpt-oss/ \\\n  --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128 \\\n  --index-strategy unsafe-best-match\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn2view4\ue201  \n\n### 3.2 Start vLLM bound to localhost only\n**Important security point**: vLLM\u2019s `--api-key` only protects `/v1/*` endpoints; other endpoints can remain unprotected, so don\u2019t expose the server publicly. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201  \n\nRun with `--host 127.0.0.1` so it\u2019s only reachable locally on the EC2 box:\n```bash\nexport VLLM_API_KEY=\"make-this-long-and-random\"\n\n# 20B:\nvllm serve openai/gpt-oss-20b \\\n  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 \\\n  --api-key \"$VLLM_API_KEY\"\n\n# OR 120B:\n# vllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b \\\n#   --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 \\\n#   --api-key \"$VLLM_API_KEY\"\n```\n`--host`, `--port`, and `--api-key` are standard `vllm serve` flags. \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n(Optional but strongly recommended) keep it running after you disconnect:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y tmux\ntmux new -s vllm\n# run vllm serve ... inside tmux\n# detach: Ctrl+b then d\n```\n\nSanity check **on EC2**:\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $VLLM_API_KEY\" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models\n```\nvLLM serves OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4) WSL2: create an SSH tunnel to AWS vLLM\n\n### 4.1 Put your EC2 key somewhere sane in WSL\nIf your key is on Windows at `C:\\Users\\E-Jay\\Downloads\\ec2.pem`, in WSL it\u2019s:\n```bash\n/mnt/c/Users/E-Jay/Downloads/ec2.pem\n```\n\nCopy into WSL and lock permissions:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\ncp /mnt/c/Users/E-Jay/Downloads/ec2.pem ~/.ssh/ec2.pem\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/ec2.pem\n```\n\n### 4.2 Start the tunnel (keep this terminal open for now)\n```bash\nssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2.pem \\\n  -N \\\n  -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 \\\n  -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \\\n  -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \\\n  -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \\\n  ubuntu@EC2_PUBLIC_IP\n```\n\nNow, **inside WSL**, your model endpoint is:\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`\n\nTest from WSL:\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VLLM_API_KEY\" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models\n```\n\n### 4.3 Optional: make the tunnel persistent with systemd + autossh\nIf you want it to survive brief network hiccups:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y autossh\nmkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user\n```\n\nCreate `~/.config/systemd/user/vllm-tunnel.service`:\n```bash\ncat > ~/.config/systemd/user/vllm-tunnel.service <<'EOF'\n[Unit]\nDescription=SSH tunnel to AWS vLLM (localhost:8000 -> EC2 127.0.0.1:8000)\nAfter=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nEnvironment=\"AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0\"\nExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -M 0 \\\n  -i %h/.ssh/ec2.pem \\\n  -N \\\n  -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 \\\n  -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \\\n  -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \\\n  -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \\\n  ubuntu@EC2_PUBLIC_IP\nRestart=always\nRestartSec=3\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=default.target\nEOF\n```\n\nEnable + start:\n```bash\nsystemctl --user daemon-reload\nsystemctl --user enable --now vllm-tunnel.service\nsystemctl --user status vllm-tunnel.service\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5) Install OpenClaw inside WSL2 (recommended path)\n\nOpenClaw requires **Node.js 22+**, and the installer can install it if missing. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\nIn WSL Ubuntu:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash\nopenclaw onboard --install-daemon\n```\nThese are the official quick-start commands. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\nCheck it\u2019s running:\n```bash\nopenclaw gateway status\n```\n\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 6) Configure OpenClaw to use your tunneled vLLM + secure DM mode\n\nOpenClaw reads `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and hot-reloads most changes. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view2\ue201  \nFor multi-user safety, set DM session isolation: `session.dmScope: \"per-channel-peer\"`. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view3\ue201  \n\nEdit the config:\n```bash\nnano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json\n```\n\nExample config (JSON5 is allowed):\n```js\n{\n  env: {\n    VLLM_API_KEY: \"PASTE_THE_SAME_KEY_YOU_SET_ON_EC2\",\n  },\n\n  // Secure DM mode (prevents cross-user context leakage)\n  session: { dmScope: \"per-channel-peer\" },\n\n  models: {\n    providers: {\n      vllm: {\n        // OpenClaw expects /v1 endpoints (models, chat/completions, etc.)\n        baseUrl: \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1\",\n        apiKey: \"${VLLM_API_KEY}\",\n        api: \"openai-completions\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n\n  agents: {\n    defaults: {\n      // IMPORTANT: this must match the model id vLLM reports in /v1/models.\n      // If you didn't override names, it\u2019s often \"openai/gpt-oss-20b\" or \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\".\n      model: { primary: \"vllm/openai/gpt-oss-20b\" },\n      // model: { primary: \"vllm/openai/gpt-oss-120b\" },\n    },\n  },\n\n  channels: {\n    telegram: {\n      enabled: true,\n      botToken: \"PASTE_BOTFATHER_TOKEN_HERE\",\n      dmPolicy: \"pairing\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWhy those fields:\n- OpenClaw\u2019s vLLM integration expects `/v1/*` endpoints and uses `openai-completions`. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view1\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- The default vLLM base URL pattern is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn2view1\ue201  \n\n**Important**: Confirm the exact model ID by querying:\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $VLLM_API_KEY\" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models | jq\n```\nThen set `agents.defaults.model.primary` to `vllm/<that-id>`.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Telegram: pair your spare account with the bot\n\n1) In Telegram, create a bot with **@BotFather** and copy the token.\n2) Start the Gateway (if not already):\n```bash\nopenclaw gateway\n```\n3) DM your bot from your spare Telegram account (`/start`). You\u2019ll get a pairing code.\n4) Approve it:\n```bash\nopenclaw pairing list telegram\nopenclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>\n```\nPairing codes expire after ~1 hour. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 8) Final end-to-end test\n\n- Confirm tunnel + model:\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $VLLM_API_KEY\" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models\n```\n\n- Send your bot:\n> \u201cExplain MXFP4 quantization in 5 bullets.\u201d\n\nIf you get a reply, you\u2019re done.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Two non-negotiable security notes (since you\u2019re cloud-hosting)\n1) **Do not expose vLLM to the public internet**, even with `--api-key`. vLLM documents that many endpoints may remain unauthenticated; treat `--api-key` as insufficient perimeter security. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201  \n2) Keep OpenClaw Telegram DMs on **pairing** and keep **DM session isolation** on. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn2view3\ue201  \n\nIf you want, I can also give you a \u201cminimal-cost\u201d AWS plan (20B first, then 120B) that avoids wasting GPU hours while you\u2019re still wiring the pipeline."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn2view4\ue201","start_idx":192,"end_idx":220,"safe_urls":["https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/articles/gpt-oss/run-vllm/","https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI-Compatible Server -

Here\u2019s a **hardened, \u201crun it for weeks\u201d** version for **WSL2 + AWS**, explicitly fixing: secrets sprawl, EC2 hardening, key/host-key hygiene, install trust, WSL2 exposure, monitoring/cost controls, and operational upkeep.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Upgrade the baseline threat model (so the steps make sense)\n\n**Assume:**\n- You may eventually misclick a security group rule.\n- Your Windows host is *not* a security boundary against WSL (treat it as part of the same trust zone).\n- Anything that touches Telegram is internet-facing, so **pairing/allowlists** are mandatory. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn3search4\ue201\n- vLLM\u2019s `--api-key` is *not* a perimeter control because several non-`/v1` routes can remain unauthenticated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 2) AWS connectivity: **prefer SSM port-forwarding** over SSH (kills 3 problems at once)\n\nSSH tunneling is good. **SSM Session Manager port-forwarding is better**:\n- **No inbound port 22**\n- **No SSH keys**\n- No TOFU (Trust On First Use) host-key worries for initial access\n\nAWS documents `AWS-StartPortForwardingSession` / `AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost` for this exact use. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search0\ue201\n\n### 2.1 EC2 launch settings (SSM-first)\nWhen launching EC2:\n1) **No public IP** (put it in a subnet with outbound internet/NAT so it can reach SSM).\n2) Attach IAM role with **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore**.\n3) Security group: **no inbound rules at all** (yes, zero).\n4) Use **encrypted EBS** (enable \u201cEBS encryption by default\u201d at the account level if you haven\u2019t).\n\n### 2.2 On your WSL2 laptop: install AWS CLI + session-manager-plugin\nIn WSL Ubuntu:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y awscli session-manager-plugin\naws --version\nsession-manager-plugin\n```\n\nConfigure AWS creds (use the least-privileged IAM user/role you can):\n```bash\naws configure\n```\n\n### 2.3 Start the port forward (local 8000 \u2192 EC2 localhost:8000)\n```bash\naws ssm start-session \\\n  --target i-YOUR_INSTANCE_ID \\\n  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \\\n  --parameters portNumber=\"8000\",localPortNumber=\"8000\"\n```\nThis yields the same local experience as SSH `-L`, but without opening SSH. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201\n\n> If you *must* use SSH anyway, skip to \u00a76 and harden it properly.\n\n---\n\n## 3) EC2 hardening (even if you use SSM)\n\n### 3.1 Patch baseline + unattended security updates\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get install -y unattended-upgrades\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades\n```\n\n### 3.2 Host firewall (defense in depth)\nEven with \u201cno inbound SG rules\u201d, keep host firewall sane:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y ufw\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw default allow outgoing\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw status verbose\n```\n\n### 3.3 Run vLLM as a dedicated user + systemd service (no tmux)\nThis removes \u201crandom shell sessions hold secrets\u201d and gives you restart + logs.\n\nCreate user:\n```bash\nsudo useradd --system --create-home --home-dir /opt/vllm --shell /usr/sbin/nologin vllm\n```\n\nCreate an env file for secrets (permissions matter):\n```bash\nsudo install -d -m 700 -o vllm -g vllm /etc/vllm\nsudo install -m 600 -o vllm -g vllm /dev/null /etc/vllm/vllm.env\n\n# Enter the key without echo; not stored in shell history\nread -s -p \"VLLM_API_KEY: \" VLLM_API_KEY; echo\nprintf 'VLLM_API_KEY=%s\\n' \"$VLLM_API_KEY\" | sudo tee /etc/vllm/vllm.env >/dev/null\nunset VLLM_API_KEY\n```\n\n> This avoids `export \u2026` getting logged to history and ensures the file is private (600). Your earlier criticism here was correct.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Install/run vLLM + gpt-oss with explicit supply-chain acknowledgement\n\n### Option A (clean ops): **containerize vLLM**\nvLLM publishes a `vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss` container for gpt-oss. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \nYou still trust the registry, but you can **pin a digest** after the first pull.\n\nOn EC2:\n```bash\n# Install Docker (Ubuntu)\nsudo apt-get install -y docker.io\nsudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu\nsudo systemctl enable --now docker\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re on a GPU AMI, Docker GPU runtime may already be present; if not, install NVIDIA container tooling (varies by AMI).

It must be accessible to engineers and cover steps, best practices, and reasons without being too verbose. I might need to browse for up-to-date details, since tech evolves, especially regarding security and services.\n\n**Ensuring security in OpenClaw-Telegram-AWS deployment**\n\nI need to verify technical details for OpenClaw, vLLM security, AWS SSM, and systemd on WSL profiles. While providing a self-contained spec, I'll include relevant citations. Best practices for deployment include secrets management, EC2 hardening, encryption, monitoring, IAM restrictions, auto-shutdown, and backups to prevent misuse.\n\n**Creating end-to-end spec with WSL2 and OpenClaw**\n\nI need to craft a complete spec on setting up the infrastructure, detailing prerequisites and steps. It should cover TensorFlow models (20B and 120B) on AWS with vLLM, containerized for simplicity. I\u2019ll address issues such as cross-filesystem vulnerabilities in WSL2, Windows Firewall settings, and secure storage.\n\n**Creating end-to-end spec for gpt-oss setup**\n\nI need to provide a detailed setup for hosting the gpt-oss-120B model on AWS, starting with 20B on G5 or 120B on P5. Steps must cover AWS configurations, VPC, IAM, SSM, security, and the container setup for vLLM. The instructions should allow for simplicity but cover both options.\n\n**Setting up AWS infrastructure for gpt-oss**\n\nI should guide the user through hosting gpt-oss-120B or 20B on AWS with two options: G5 for 20B or P5 for 120B. The spec needs to cover AWS VPC, subnets, IAM, SSM, security, and EC2 setups. I'll focus on a clean spec with containerization using vLLM, ensuring secure access and private subnets with minimal SSH exposure.\n\n**Explaining network configuration for SSM use**\n\nI'll explain the two network options for secure AWS EC2 instances: using a public subnet with a public IP and no inbound ports versus a private subnet with VPC endpoints for better security. Both setups enable SSM access, but the latter is more secure. I'll also emphasize EBS encryption and port forwarding via SSM.\n\n**Recommending best practices and configuration details**\n\nI\u2019ll recommend setting up the instance in a private subnet with VPC endpoints for stronger security, though it\u2019s more complex than using a public subnet with no inbound rules. I'll emphasize EBS encryption, no open ports, data security best practices with OpenClaw, and secret management via environment files or Windows Credential Manager.\n\n**Ensuring security and safe installation practices**\n\nWe should avoid pipe-to-shell commands and instead recommend verifying scripts with SHA256. If the official docs only mention curl|bash, we\u2019ll suggest downloading, inspecting, and verifying these scripts first. I\u2019ll also cover operations like start/stop, cost control, monitoring, and security practices, emphasizing minimizing risks from plugins by using an allowlist.\n\n**Balancing citations and documentation**\n\nI need to balance how many citations I include. If I call for information once, I should ensure every supported statement has a citation, but that might be too much. I can focus on the most important sources, like OpenClaw docs, Telegram channels, Windows systemd, AWS SSM docs, and vLLM security docs.\n\n**Searching for documentation sources**\n\nI need to look up the AWS SSM documentation and the gpt-oss cookbook. These sources should cover key aspects of the configuration and setup, so I'll search for them now to ensure I have the most up-to-date and relevant information. I'll focus on these two docs first.\n\n**Ensuring accuracy and relevance for security references**\n\nWe have useful sources for SSM, gpt-oss, systemd, OpenClaw security, and vLLM security. There's a CVE (CVE-2026-22778) related to vLLM that\u2019s time-sensitive. It\u2019s important to mention patching, version pinning, and fixed vulnerabilities. I\u2019ll look up the latest CVE details for accuracy and reinforce patching best practices.\n\n**Addressing OpenClaw secret handling and CVE mitigations**\n\nI found the NVD and GitHub advisory for CVE, which is good. There\u2019s also an issue with OpenClaw's environment variable substitution that could cause secrets to be written to cache files. To mitigate this, I\u2019ll set strict file permissions on OpenClaw\u2019s directories and configure them to avoid writing secrets. I'll check for Telegram-related OpenClaw docs and include relevant citations.\n\n**Specifying security for OpenClaw and Telegram integration**\n\nWe have the official Telegram docs, which is great. Next, I need to create a self-contained spec integrating best practices: use SSM, restrict inbound access, manage secrets via env file, and configure OpenClaw securely. I\u2019ll set gateway controls to loopback with token authentication. I\u2019ll check docs for configuration settings to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Searching for OpenClaw gateway config and documentation**\n\nI have the config lines I need for dmPolicy and dmScope, but now I need documentation for environment variable substitution and specific gateway settings. I'll search for configuration references related to Gateway bind settings for loopback and authentication token to ensure everything is set up securely.\n\n**Creating spec document for OpenClaw and setup**\n\nI have the necessary sources for the OpenClaw gateway runbook, tools restrictions, and security audits. Now, I need to create a self-contained specification. I\u2019ll structure it as a document, including: Overview, Requirements, Architecture, Sequence steps (AWS, EC2, vLLM, WSL2, OpenClaw, Telegram), Security controls, Runbooks, and Troubleshooting.\n\n**Incorporating best practices for security and setup**\n\nI need to make sure the setup aligns with best practices: \n- Use AWS Systems Manager for secure access instead of SSH, with optional fallback and hardening.\n- Bind vLLM to localhost and forward ports via SSM.\n- Implement secrets management and strict permissions for environments.\n- Use OpenClaw\u2019s secure DM mode, enforce pairing policies, and employ tool denylists for security. \n- Ensure encryption, system patches, and proper user isolation for vLLM.\n\n**Securing environment variables and API keys**\n\nThe environment file still ends up in the process environment, but restricting access to it can help. On Linux, using the `hidepid=2` mount option for `/proc` can prevent other users from viewing it. I'll run `vLLM` under a minimal user account to ensure security and check the docs for API key handling best practices. A reverse proxy might also help hide direct access to the API.\n\n**Considering API key and network configuration**\n\nInstead of using an API key, I could rely on local-only access for safety, with OpenClaw communicating via a tunnel. The API key is optional but offers an extra layer of protection. I'll confirm network settings for OpenClaw, ensuring it binds to the loopback interface. I'll also include cost control features and monitoring strategies, ensuring all containers and dependencies are up-to-date, specifically versions >=0.14.1 for vLLM.\n\n**Final spec approach**\n\nFor security, we should always ensure vLLM is run as an updated, patched container (version >=0.14.1, pinned version). Avoid enabling unnecessary multimodal endpoints unless required. Propose two ways for OpenClaw installation: use the installer script recommended by OpenClaw or inspect the script beforehand and install via npm. For WSL2, install and run OpenClaw using npm with added supply chain security. Ultimately, using containers can help avoid unnecessary attack surfaces and Python scripts like uv.\n\n**WSL2 setup and tool restrictions**\n\nFor WSL2, initial installation could use OpenClaw\u2019s script, but users should inspect the script first for better security. It\u2019s key to use trusted sources like Node from Ubuntu\u2019s repository or NodeSource. For supply chain safety, download, inspect, and verify certificates. Limiting tools in OpenClaw like exec, process, and filesystem promises a safer baseline setup focused on chat-only capabilities. You can disable elevated modes and run security audits regularly to ensure security.\n\n**Mitigating OpenClaw config issues and securing secrets**\n\nAs of February 2026, OpenClaw was found to possibly write environment variable values in plaintext to cache files. To mitigate, we should set file permissions and possibly use `OPENCLAW_NO_CACHE_SECRETS`. Treat `/.openclaw` as secret, set appropriate permissions, and verify it's free of plaintext. Document the correct configuration steps, including environment variable handling and gateway token setup for security.\n\n**Setting up AWS, WSL2, and OpenClaw**\n\n1. AWS setup: Create an IAM role with least privilege, configure networking (use VPC, no inbound); add EBS encryption; launch EC2 GPU instance with Ubuntu and GPU drivers; enable automated updates and security; bind Docker container for vLLM to localhost.\n2. WSL2: Set up AWS CLI, protect file system, and run port forwarding to local port. Option for persistent tunnel.\n3. OpenClaw: Install Node 22+, configure models, Telegram, session settings, and security configurations like denying exec tools. Store secrets securely and inspect caches.\n\n**Telegram and operational setup for OpenClaw**\n\n1. Set up Telegram bot with BotFather, get token, and start OpenClaw gateway.\n2. Validate vLLM via API, check chat functionality, and verify security.\n3. Operational best practices: Instance management, monitoring, security audits, logging, updates, and backup best practices like rotating keys and snapshots.\n4. Keep AWS instance ephemeral, avoid saved files, provide clear steps for the user to configure.\n\n**Clarifying OpenClaw security, news sources, and spec creation**\n\nThere\u2019s an issue with OpenClaw where environment variables could be written to models.json, but we\u2019ll base our information on the official docs. For security, treat plugins/skills as untrusted, avoid ClawHub, and stay updated on CVEs. We\u2019ll also include a navlist to cover recent security news, add citations, and focus on a complete spec for the Telegram bot setup. We'll ensure the container handles gpt-oss model downloads efficiently.\n\n**Clarifying model downloading and disk requirements**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to download model weights from Hugging Face. I\u2019ll mention that vLLM will download them, so users must ensure they have internet access. I\u2019ll also include a note that the gpt-oss-120b model is large, possibly requiring over 250 GB of disk space. I'll confirm the size and any token requirements.\n\n**Incorporating security precautions for OpenClaw setup**\n\nI\u2019ll include a reference to OpenClaw\u2019s configuration, env variable rules, and potential security risks. I should clarify that env var substitution risks secrets being written to files like `models.json` or even the prompt. I'll suggest mitigations, like running OpenClaw under a dedicated Linux user or in a container for better security.\n\n**Security precautions for OpenClaw setup**\n\nWe can set a dedicated Linux user for OpenClaw, running the service with restricted permissions for security. It's not strictly necessary, but it can reduce risks. Alternatively, users can create a dedicated WSL distro. I'll mention creating a dedicated user and setting directory permissions for added security.\n\n**Specifying OpenClaw<->Telegram<->AWS setup**\n\nWe need to highlight security concerns, like the possibility of malware accessing WSL through `\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu...` shares on Windows. Windows and WSL aren\u2019t fully isolated, so this risk needs attention. The spec should focus on clarity, offering a step-by-step, reasoned approach to deployment along with security best practices.\n\n**Drafting spec structure for OpenClaw integration**\n\nI'll organize the spec into these sections: scope, assumptions, reference architecture, and a step-by-step guide that covers AWS setup, EC2 provisioning, vLLM, WSL2, OpenClaw installation, and Telegram bot configuration. I'll also address validation, day-2 operations like monitoring and patching, and optional enhancements. Example config files will be provided as code blocks, avoiding external downloads to ensure consistency.\n\n**Security and implementation guidance for AWS setup**\n\nIn this spec, I'll highlight key security decisions, like using no open inbound ports and binding services like vLLM and OpenClaw to localhost. I'll mention dedicated IAM roles with least privileges, EBS encryption, and CloudWatch agent options. For network design, I'll prefer a private subnet with NAT for secure EC2 setup.\n\n**Simplifying security setup with subnet options**\n\nFor a minimal setup, we can opt for a public subnet with public IP but restrict inbound traffic, possibly controlling outbound traffic (e.g., 443 only). However, using NAT in a private subnet offers better security. We'll recommend using NAT but provide alternatives like a public IP with restricted access, ensuring SSH is disabled to reduce attack surface. Model server configuration should also ensure vLLM is patched.\n\n**Ensuring vLLM security from potential vulnerabilities**\n\nI realize that vLLM versions before 0.14.1 might have a security flaw linked to multimodal endpoints, which could be exploited with invalid image inputs. To minimize risk, it's important that vLLM is kept local, not exposed to the internet, and only accessible via controlled sessions. We could also restrict invocations if needed.\n\n**Proposing reverse proxy setup for enhanced vLLM security**\n\nTo improve security, we could suggest running vLLM on localhost (127.0.0.1:8001) and using a reverse proxy (nginx) on 127.0.0.1:8000, exposing only `/v1/` endpoints. This would offer an additional layer of protection, even if ports are inadvertently exposed. Configuring vLLM with API tokens for specific endpoints helps further lock down access.\n\n**Securing OpenClaw credentials with environment files**\n\nWe\u2019ll specify using environment variables like `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. It can be stored securely in `.env` files, loaded without overriding existing settings. For added security, we\u2019ll make sure the token is stored with restricted permissions (600) and use OpenClaw's system files while keeping the environment secure.\n\n**Optimizing OpenClaw installation and security**\n\nWe\u2019ll mention securing `/.openclaw/credentials` by adjusting file permissions and using security audit flags with `--fix`. The configuration can also restrict model switching via the `agents.defaults.models` allowlist and enforce group message mentions for Telegram groups. As the user uses WSL2, we\u2019ll incorporate systemd setup and specify an SSM plugin. To reduce risks, we\u2019ll recommend downloading and inspecting the OpenClaw installer first before running it.\n\n**Finalizing OpenClaw setup and model hosting**\n\nFor installation, we can either use the OpenClaw installer script (with a caution to inspect it) or install Node 22 and OpenClaw via npm within WSL. AWS CLI should be installed with `apt-get`. For hosting GPT-OSS models, we can use vLLM (compatible with OpenAI); container path options might be simpler. We'll cite relevant docs.\n\n**Creating an end-to-end AWS and Local Setup Spec**\n\nWe need to provide a precise, comprehensive end-to-end spec without disclaimers. We'll include explicit steps for both AWS and local setups, in markdown with sections and bullet points. A checklist will be included at the end. We\u2019ll also add a navlist to news sources (such as Wired or Tom\u2019s Hardware) relevant to GPT-OSS, but avoid casual language unless necessary.\n\n**Finalizing OpenClaw Spec with Security and Configuration**\n\nWe\u2019ll include security references like OpenClaw skill attacks and a navlist on supply-chain risks. For the spec, key configurations include defining gateway mode, telegram settings, session scope, model providers, and environment variables. We'll also ensure the proper systemd setup with secure secrets. I'll make sure the primary model provider is set, and fallback options are considered if necessary. It's all in line with user instructions, enhanced with security references as optional but useful context.\n\n**Setting up secure vLLM with nginx proxy**\n\nTo secure vLLM, we\u2019ll run it on `127.0.0.1:8001` and nginx on `127.0.0.1:8000` to only allow the `/v1/` endpoint. This setup limits access with nginx preventing other routes while using vLLM\u2019s API key for `/v1/`. We\u2019ll install nginx, configure it to proxy requests, and use the Authorization header to keep things secure."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 8m 44s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-japanwest-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-a36cda4a-4983-404a-a07a-90ebf92eaa89:JP","parent_id":"d7650255-b461-418d-b0c9-45f4c7f3374e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"chime_version":1,"request_id":"a36cda4a-4983-404a-a07a-90ebf92eaa89","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"62d2bdfa-4ba2-4816-9876-8359b6e6036e","finished_duration_sec":524,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d7650255-b461-418d-b0c9-45f4c7f3374e","children":["318d1f20-7ede-44a5-b166-1c62d1981e38"]},"318d1f20-7ede-44a5-b166-1c62d1981e38":{"id":"318d1f20-7ede-44a5-b166-1c62d1981e38","message":{"id":"318d1f20-7ede-44a5-b166-1c62d1981e38","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771313862.296146,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I\u2019ll produce a self\u2011contained end\u2011to\u2011end build spec (architecture, step sequence, exact commands/config, and ops runbooks) for OpenClaw\u2194Telegram\u2194AWS using SSM-only access, localhost binding, secrets isolation, and cost/monitoring guardrails."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","is_thinking_preamble_message":true,"hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c6a88883f7771891b192fe9861473","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"62d2bdfa-4ba2-4816-9876-8359b6e6036e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"9d66e235-0227-48a0-a709-27420b1b187d","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"commentary"},"parent":"9d66e235-0227-48a0-a709-27420b1b187d","children":["cf6d7e23-4593-4461-b0ea-efd56608b01f"]},"cf6d7e23-4593-4461-b0ea-efd56608b01f":{"id":"cf6d7e23-4593-4461-b0ea-efd56608b01f","message":{"id":"cf6d7e23-4593-4461-b0ea-efd56608b01f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771313878.521626,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Preparing OpenClaw-Telegram-AWS spec with best practices","content":"I need to respond with a self-contained spec for setting up OpenClaw, Telegram, and AWS infrastructure securely.

Security researchers discovered that hundreds of these skills, hosted on the ClawHub platform, contain malware. These malicious extensions, posing as productivity or cryptocurrency tools, deliver infostealing software that targets sensitive data such as crypto wallet keys, API credentials, SSH logins, and browser passwords. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the nature of the platform, which allows skills in markdown files that may contain harmful instructions. The AI assistant can access full device permissions\u2014reading files, running scripts, and executing shell commands\u2014thus increasing the risk of exploitation. One of the most popular skills analyzed instructed users to run commands leading to malware installation.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, integrates with popular messaging platforms and operates locally, executing tasks like managing calendars and inboxes. In response to the crisis, developer Peter Steinberger has implemented measures such as requiring contributors to have a GitHub account at least a week old and adding a reporting mechanism. However, vulnerabilities persist, raising alarms about OpenClaw's security model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1770231818.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/malicious-moltbot-skill-targets-crypto-users-on-clawhub","title":"Malicious OpenClaw 'skill' targets crypto users on ClawHub - 14 malicious skills were uploaded to ClawHub last month","snippet":"In late January 2026, security researchers uncovered a wave of malware distributed through the ClawHub registry for OpenClaw, a self-hosted AI assistant platform formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot. At least 14 malicious \"skills\" were uploaded between January 27 and 29, disguised as tools for crypto trading or wallet automation. These skills, once installed, had access to the user's local file system and network, and employed social engineering methods\u2014such as prompting users to run obfuscated terminal commands\u2014to deliver remote scripts and steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency and browser information.\n\nOne harmful skill even appeared on ClawHub\u2019s homepage, increasing the risk of user exposure. OpenClaw\u2019s flexibility in executing tasks on behalf of users also makes it vulnerable to exploitation if third-party code isn't properly vetted. The platform's recent renaming series has further facilitated impersonation efforts by attackers. Without stronger moderation or verification, users are urged to treat these skills with caution, reviewing code as they would any executable and being wary of manual command instructions. This case mirrors other recent impersonation attempts, like a fake Visual Studio Code extension distributing malware under OpenClaw\u2019s name.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1769947200.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69941aeef020832caf8dc28875a73b0a","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c6a88883f7771891b192fe9861473","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"62d2bdfa-4ba2-4816-9876-8359b6e6036e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching OpenClaw documentation for configuration and security","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"20a97fef-3b7c-4c4b-bc36-9f009810b748","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"20a97fef-3b7c-4c4b-bc36-9f009810b748","children":["0ef7a662-3bc3-4fbd-aabc-e80aed494a5b"]},"0ef7a662-3bc3-4fbd-aabc-e80aed494a5b":{"id":"0ef7a662-3bc3-4fbd-aabc-e80aed494a5b","message":{"id":"0ef7a662-3bc3-4fbd-aabc-e80aed494a5b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771313973.337626,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Creating spec document for OpenClaw and setup","content":"I have the necessary sources for the OpenClaw gateway runbook, tools restrictions, and security audits.

The gpt-oss-120b model is designed to operate on a single 80GB GPU, while gpt-oss-20b can run on edge devices with just 16GB of memory. These models employ a Transformer architecture with mixture-of-experts, dense and sparse attention patterns, and grouped multi-query attention. They support an extensive context length of up to 131,072 tokens.\n\nThe models are built for Chain-of-Thought reasoning and balance performance, efficiency, and practical usability. Remarkably, they are the first open-weight models OpenAI has released since GPT-2, and they are licensed under Apache 2.0 to promote broader adoption, particularly in markets with limited access to proprietary models.\n\nPerformance-wise, gpt-oss-120b rivals OpenAI\u2019s o4-mini model and surpasses it in specific tasks like health-related queries and competitive math. Meanwhile, gpt-oss-20b matches o3-mini\u2019s capabilities while being significantly lighter. Both models are currently supported across multiple platforms, including ONNX Runtime, Azure, AWS, and Ollama.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1754587519.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-just-released-its-first-open-weight-models-since-gpt-2","title":"OpenAI Just Released Its First Open-Weight Models Since GPT-2","snippet":"OpenAI has released its first open-weight models since GPT-2, marking a major strategic pivot after years of focusing on proprietary tools. The two new models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are publicly available via Hugging Face and can be run locally and fine-tuned by users. These models employ chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling more thoughtful and multi-step responses, and support web browsing, software navigation, and code execution.\n\nThe open weights allow researchers and developers to inspect and adapt the models, while the Apache 2.0 license permits commercial use and redistribution. Although open-weight models pose higher safety risks, OpenAI performed extensive internal safety tests and concluded their risk levels are manageable. gpt-oss-120b performs competitively with OpenAI\u2019s proprietary o3 and o4-mini models, and the smaller gpt-oss-20b can run on devices with over 16 GB of memory.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that this release is a return to OpenAI\u2019s mission of democratizing AI. The move positions OpenAI as a strong competitor in the growing open-weight AI space, challenging companies like Meta and startups like DeepSeek.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1754413221.79,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69941aeef020832caf8dc28875a73b0a","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c6a88883f7771891b192fe9861473","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"62d2bdfa-4ba2-4816-9876-8359b6e6036e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Specification: OpenClaw Telegram Bot with gpt-oss via vLLM on AWS (SSM-only)","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"f6c4a09c-6d08-43b4-954b-9b64c5434233","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f6c4a09c-6d08-43b4-954b-9b64c5434233","children":["48bd769c-797c-4efa-b150-891d89cc325f"]},"48bd769c-797c-4efa-b150-891d89cc325f":{"id":"48bd769c-797c-4efa-b150-891d89cc325f","message":{"id":"48bd769c-797c-4efa-b150-891d89cc325f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771314036.157603,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"open\":[{\"ref_id\":\"turn2search5\"},{\"ref_id\":\"turn5search5\"},{\"ref_id\":\"turn5search0\"},{\"ref_id\":\"turn2search13\"}],\"response_length\":\"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"resolved_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c6a88883f7771891b192fe9861473","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"62d2bdfa-4ba2-4816-9876-8359b6e6036e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Providing model size estimates and cache guidance","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"8c2bf2a1-0739-4620-bad1-50aec1019fa4","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"8c2bf2a1-0739-4620-bad1-50aec1019fa4","children":["44a2d5a9-db91-4bb2-8983-b9d2e76b539b"]},"44a2d5a9-db91-4bb2-8983-b9d2e76b539b":{"id":"44a2d5a9-db91-4bb2-8983-b9d2e76b539b","message":{"id":"44a2d5a9-db91-4bb2-8983-b9d2e76b539b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1771314044.004306,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"github.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/14808","title":"[Feature]: [Security] Environment variable apiKey resolved to plaintext in cache file \u00b7 Issue #14808 \u00b7 openclaw/openclaw \u00b7 GitHub","snippet":"Total lines: 354\n","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"github.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"docs.openclaw.ai","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway","title":"Gateway Runbook -

This spec assumes a private bot for you (or a small allowlisted group).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Architecture and trust boundaries\n\n### Components\n1. **Telegram**\n   - A bot created via BotFather\n   - You use a spare Telegram account and pair/allowlist it to the bot in OpenClaw\n\n2. **OpenClaw Gateway (WSL2 Ubuntu)**\n   - Accepts Telegram updates and routes them to the configured model provider\n   - Uses a local `baseUrl` pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1` (tunnel endpoint)\n\n3. **AWS EC2 GPU instance**\n   - Runs vLLM serving `openai/gpt-oss-20b` or `openai/gpt-oss-120b`\n   - Binds to `127.0.0.1:8000` only\n   - Accepts requests only from localhost, accessed through port-forward\n\n4. **Connectivity**\n   - **Preferred**: SSM Session Manager port forwarding (no inbound ports, no SSH keys)\n   - **Fallback**: SSH tunnel with inbound 22 restricted to your IP, hardening enabled\n\n### Data paths\n- Telegram messages flow through Telegram\u2019s infrastructure to your bot token.\n- OpenClaw receives messages and sends prompts to vLLM via the tunnel.\n- vLLM returns completions to OpenClaw, which replies via Telegram bot API.\n\n### Threat model (pragmatic)\n- Most likely failures:\n  - Accidentally exposing port 8000 publicly (avoid by design)\n  - Secret leakage (bot token + vLLM API key) from plaintext files or shared Windows filesystem\n  - Cost blowups from leaving GPU instances running\n- Additional concerns:\n  - Supply-chain risk from `curl | sh`, external wheel indexes, unpinned containers\n  - Host compromise from unpatched OS, weak SSH, overly permissive security groups\n\n---\n\n## 3) Prerequisites\n\n### Local (Windows + WSL2)\n- Windows 11 or Windows 10 with WSL2\n- WSL2 Ubuntu (22.04 or 24.04 recommended)\n- Systemd enabled inside WSL2\n- Ability to run OpenClaw in WSL2\n- AWS CLI in WSL2 (for SSM port forwarding)\n- Basic command line familiarity\n\n### AWS\n- AWS account with permissions to:\n  - Launch EC2 instances\n  - Use SSM Session Manager\n  - Create IAM roles/policies (or attach managed policies)\n  - Create budgets/alerts\n- GPU instance quota for the chosen family (G5 for 20B, P5/H100-class for 120B)\n\n### Telegram\n- A spare Telegram account\n- Access to @BotFather to create a bot\n\n---\n\n## 4) Security baseline requirements (must-haves)\n\n1. **Never expose vLLM publicly**\n   - vLLM `--api-key` is not a perimeter control because some non-`/v1` endpoints can remain unauthenticated.\n   - Bind to `127.0.0.1` and access only via port-forward.\n\n2. **No inbound ports on EC2 (SSM-first)**\n   - Use private subnet + outbound internet/NAT for SSM connectivity.\n\n3. **Secrets are not stored in plaintext in broadly readable places**\n   - No secrets in shell history\n   - No secrets in `/mnt/c` (Windows filesystem)\n   - Files holding secrets must be `chmod 600`, directories `chmod 700`\n\n4. **OpenClaw Telegram channel must use `pairing` (or allowlist)**\n   - Prevent random internet users from chatting with your bot.\n\n5. **Cost controls exist before turning on GPU**\n   - Budgets + alerts + scheduled stop rules\n\n---\n\n## 5) Implementation plan overview (sequence)\n\n1. Enable WSL2 + systemd and prep local secure storage\n2. Create Telegram bot token\n3. Provision AWS EC2 GPU instance (SSM-only, encrypted EBS, no inbound rules)\n4. Install and run vLLM on EC2 bound to localhost only, with service manager\n5. Set up SSM port-forward from WSL2 to EC2 localhost:8000\n6. Install OpenClaw in WSL2 and configure:\n   - vLLM provider at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`\n   - Telegram channel in pairing mode\n   - secrets via a locked-down env file + systemd drop-in\n7. Pair Telegram account and test end-to-end\n8. Add operational controls: patching, monitoring, budget alerts, auto-stop, rotation\n\n---\n\n## 6) Detailed steps\n\n### 6.1 WSL2 setup (Windows host)\n\n#### Step 1 \u2014 Ensure WSL2 and systemd\nFrom PowerShell (Admin):\n```powershell\nwsl --update\nwsl --version\n```\n\nInstall Ubuntu if needed:\n```powershell\nwsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04\n```\n\nInside WSL Ubuntu:\n```bash\nsudo tee /etc/wsl.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'\n[boot]\nsystemd=true\nEOF\n```\n\nBack in PowerShell:\n```powershell\nwsl --shutdown\n```\n\nReopen WSL and verify:\n```bash\nsystemctl --user status\n```\n\n**Reason:** OpenClaw\u2019s gateway daemon flow on Windows is designed around WSL2 + systemd, and systemd gives you predictable service management.\n\n---\n\n### 6.2 Local hardening and secret storage rules (WSL)\n\n#### Step 2 \u2014 Lock down default permissions\nIn WSL:\n```bash\necho 'umask 077' >> ~/.profile\nsource ~/.profile\n```\n\nCreate directories:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/openclaw\nchmod 700 ~/.config/openclaw\nmkdir -p ~/.openclaw\nchmod 700 ~/.openclaw\n```\n\n**Reason:** Prevent accidental creation of world-readable configs and ensure secrets remain private.\n\n#### Step 3 \u2014 Keep everything off `/mnt/c`\n- Do **not** store:\n  - Telegram bot token\n  - vLLM API key\n  - SSH keys (if you ever use SSH)\n  - OpenClaw config\non `/mnt/c/...`.\n\n**Reason:** Windows malware, backup tools, or other Windows processes can access `/mnt/c`; it is not an isolation boundary.\n\n---\n\n### 6.3 Telegram bot creation\n\n#### Step 4 \u2014 Create bot and obtain token\n1. In Telegram, chat with **@BotFather**\n2. Run `/newbot`\n3. Save the **bot token** securely (you\u2019ll place it in a secrets file later)\n\n**Reason:** Telegram is your \u201cfront door\u201d. The bot token is equivalent to full control over that bot identity.\n\n---\n\n### 6.4 AWS: set up secure inference host (SSM-only)\n\n#### Step 5 \u2014 Decide model and instance\n- If starting fresh: deploy **gpt-oss-20B** first on a lower-cost GPU instance.\n- Only move to **gpt-oss-120B** when the pipeline is stable and you have the right GPU capacity.\n\n**Reason:** You want to validate networking + OpenClaw + Telegram before committing to expensive GPU hours.\n\n#### Step 6 \u2014 Create an IAM role for EC2 with SSM\nCreate/attach an instance profile role with:\n- **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** (managed policy)\n\n**Reason:** Enables Session Manager access and port forwarding without SSH.\n\n#### Step 7 \u2014 Launch EC2 instance with secure defaults\n- AMI: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (or GPU-optimized AMI)\n- Networking:\n  - **No public IP**\n  - Private subnet with outbound route (NAT) so it can reach SSM endpoints\n- Storage:\n  - **EBS encryption enabled**\n  - Size large enough for model weights + cache\n- Security Group:\n  - **No inbound rules**\n  - Allow outbound as needed\n\n**Reason:** Removing public reachability is the strongest control. Encrypted EBS reduces data-at-rest risk.\n\n---\n\n### 6.5 EC2 hardening and patching\n\n#### Step 8 \u2014 Connect via SSM shell\nUse AWS Console Session Manager or AWS CLI (recommended later). In console:\n- Systems Manager \u2192 Session Manager \u2192 Start session\n\nThen in the shell:\n\nPatch and upgrade:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get install -y unattended-upgrades\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades\n```\n\nEnable firewall:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y ufw\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw default allow outgoing\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw status verbose\n```\n\n**Reason:** You still want OS patching and a host firewall even if the instance is \u201cprivate\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 6.6 Install and run vLLM (model server) securely\n\nYou have two viable approaches:\n\n#### Option A (recommended for ops): containerized vLLM\nPros: reproducible, easier to pin digests, simpler rollback.\n\n1) Install Docker:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y docker.io\nsudo systemctl enable --now docker\n```\n\n2) Create a dedicated secret file:\n```bash\nsudo install -d -m 700 /etc/vllm\nsudo install -m 600 /dev/null /etc/vllm/vllm.env\n\nread -s -p \"VLLM_API_KEY: \" VLLM_API_KEY; echo\nprintf 'VLLM_API_KEY=%s\\n' \"$VLLM_API_KEY\" | sudo tee /etc/vllm/vllm.env >/dev/null\nunset VLLM_API_KEY\n```\n\n3) Pull vLLM gpt-oss image and record digest:\n```bash\nsudo docker pull vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss\nsudo docker image inspect vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss --format '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'\n```\n\n4) Run vLLM bound to localhost only (maps host 127.0.0.1:8000):\n```bash\nsudo docker run --rm --gpus all \\\n  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \\\n  --ipc=host \\\n  --env-file /etc/vllm/vllm.env \\\n  vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b \\\n  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \\\n  --api-key \"$VLLM_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n**Reason:** Even though the container listens on 0.0.0.0 internally, the host port is bound to 127.0.0.1 only, so it\u2019s not reachable off-instance.\n\n5) Sanity check (on EC2):\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(sudo grep VLLM_API_KEY /etc/vllm/vllm.env | cut -d= -f2-)\" \\\n  http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Option B (matches cookbook): Python/uv + external wheel indexes\nPros: closer to upstream instructions, no container layer.\nCons: higher supply-chain surface (extra indexes + resolver strategy), more local state.\n\nIf you choose this, **pin versions**, keep instance disposable, and document exactly what you installed.\n\n---\n\n### 6.7 Make vLLM a system service (recommended)\n\nCreate `/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service` (Docker approach shown):\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=vLLM (gpt-oss) OpenAI-compatible server\nAfter=network-online.target docker.service\nWants=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nEnvironmentFile=/etc/vllm/vllm.env\nRestart=always\nRestartSec=3\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm --gpus all \\\n  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 --ipc=host \\\n  --env-file /etc/vllm/vllm.env \\\n  vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b \\\n  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \\\n  --api-key $VLLM_API_KEY\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nEnable and view logs:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable --now vllm\nsudo journalctl -u vllm -f\n```\n\n**Reason:** Avoid tmux sessions holding secrets; ensure restart on reboot; centralize logging.\n\n---\n\n### 6.8 Local-to-AWS port-forwarding with SSM (preferred)\n\n#### Step 9 \u2014 Install AWS CLI + Session Manager plugin in WSL\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y awscli session-manager-plugin\naws --version\n```\n\nConfigure credentials:\n```bash\naws configure\n```\n\n#### Step 10 \u2014 Start port forwarding session\n```bash\naws ssm start-session \\\n  --target i-YOUR_INSTANCE_ID \\\n  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \\\n  --parameters portNumber=\"8000\",localPortNumber=\"8000\"\n```\n\nNow, from WSL, the model is reachable at:\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`\n\nTest:\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VLLM_API_KEY\" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models\n```\n\n**Reason:** No inbound ports, no SSH keys, and fewer foot-guns.\n\n---\n\n### 6.9 Install OpenClaw in WSL2\n\n#### Step 11 \u2014 Install OpenClaw\nIn WSL:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash\nopenclaw onboard --install-daemon\n```\n\n**Supply-chain note:** `curl | sh` is inherently trust-heavy. If you need higher assurance:\n- download the script, review it, and run it locally\n- record the exact version installed\n\n---\n\n### 6.10 Configure OpenClaw with secure secrets injection\n\n#### Step 12 \u2014 Create secrets env file (locked down)\nCreate:\n```bash\nnano ~/.config/openclaw/secrets.env\nchmod 600 ~/.config/openclaw/secrets.env\n```\n\nContents:\n```bash\nVLLM_API_KEY=your-vllm-key\nTELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-botfather-token\n```\n\n#### Step 13 \u2014 Configure OpenClaw (no plaintext secrets in config)\nEdit:\n```bash\nnano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json\nchmod 600 ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json\n```\n\nExample config (JSON5):\n```js\n{\n  // Session isolation prevents context leakage between Telegram users\n  session: { dmScope: \"per-channel-peer\" },\n\n  models: {\n    providers: {\n      vllm: {\n        baseUrl: \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1\",\n        apiKey: \"${VLLM_API_KEY}\",\n        api: \"openai-completions\",\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  agents: {\n    defaults: {\n      // Must match the model id shown in /v1/models\n      model: { primary: \"vllm/openai/gpt-oss-20b\" }\n    }\n  },\n\n  channels: {\n    telegram: {\n      enabled: true,\n      botToken: \"${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}\",\n      dmPolicy: \"pairing\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Reason:** Config files leak. Keep secrets in an env file with strict permissions.\n\n#### Step 14 \u2014 Attach secrets to the OpenClaw systemd user service\nFind the unit:\n```bash\nsystemctl --user list-units | grep -i openclaw\n```\n\nAssume the unit is `openclaw-gateway.service` (adjust if different):\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service.d\ncat > ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service.d/override.conf <<'EOF'\n[Service]\nEnvironmentFile=%h/.config/openclaw/secrets.env\nEOF\n\nsystemctl --user daemon-reload\nsystemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway\nsystemctl --user status openclaw-gateway\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6.11 Pair Telegram and go live\n\n#### Step 15 \u2014 Pairing workflow\n1) In Telegram, message your bot: `/start`\n2) It returns a pairing code\n3) In WSL:\n```bash\nopenclaw pairing list telegram\nopenclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>\n```\n\n**Reason:** Pairing prevents strangers from using your bot and keeps your compute private.\n\n#### Step 16 \u2014 End-to-end test\n- Ensure SSM port forward is running\n- Message the bot with something small:\n  - \u201cSay hello and confirm you can see the model name.\u201d\n\nIf it works, the pipeline is complete.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Operational best practices (day-2)\n\n### 7.1 Secret rotation\nRotate both:\n- `VLLM_API_KEY` (EC2 and WSL)\n- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (if you regenerate bot token)\n\nProcedure:\n1) Update EC2 `/etc/vllm/vllm.env` (as root) and restart:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart vllm\n   ```\n2) Update WSL `~/.config/openclaw/secrets.env` and restart:\n   ```bash\n   systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway\n   ```\n\n### 7.2 OS patching strategy\n- EC2: unattended upgrades + a monthly manual review window\n- WSL Ubuntu: periodic updates\n  ```bash\n  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade\n  ```\n\n### 7.3 Log review and detection\n- vLLM logs:\n  ```bash\n  sudo journalctl -u vllm --since \"1 hour ago\"\n  ```\n- OpenClaw logs:\n  ```bash\n  journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway --since \"1 hour ago\"\n  ```\n\nLook for:\n- repeated auth failures\n- unexpected request volume\n- unknown Telegram users attempting to pair\n\n### 7.4 Cost control (mandatory)\nBefore you run expensive GPU:\n1) **AWS Budgets** with email alerts at 50/80/100%.\n2) Scheduled stop rule (EventBridge) to stop the instance nightly.\n3) A checklist habit: stop instance when not in use.\n\n### 7.5 Update strategy for vLLM / container pinning\n- Pin container digest after validation.\n- Update only intentionally:\n  1) pull new version in a test window\n  2) validate `/v1/models` and a sample completion\n  3) pin the new digest, roll forward\n\n### 7.6 Skills/plugins policy (OpenClaw)\n- Default stance: **no third-party skills/plugins** unless audited.\n- Treat npm install scripts and runtime code as untrusted supply chain.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Validation checklist (you can paste into a runbook)\n\n### Networking / exposure\n- [ ] EC2 has **no public IP**\n- [ ] EC2 security group has **no inbound rules**\n- [ ] vLLM binds to **127.0.0.1** (or host port mapping binds to 127.0.0.1)\n- [ ] Only access is via **SSM port forward**\n- [ ] No port 8000 exposed to internet\n\n### Secrets handling\n- [ ] No secrets in shell history\n- [ ] `~/.config/openclaw/secrets.env` is `chmod 600`\n- [ ] `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` is `chmod 600` and contains **no literal secrets**\n- [ ] No secrets stored on `/mnt/c`\n\n### OpenClaw / Telegram controls\n- [ ] Telegram `dmPolicy` is **pairing** (or allowlist)\n- [ ] `session.dmScope` is **per-channel-peer**\n- [ ] Pairing approvals are only granted to expected accounts\n\n### Ops\n- [ ] AWS Budget alerts configured\n- [ ] Auto-stop schedule configured\n- [ ] Patching strategy in place\n- [ ] Logs accessible and reviewed\n\n---\n\n## 9) Fallback path: if you must use SSH instead of SSM (summary)\n\nUse SSH only if:\n- You cannot use private subnet + NAT + SSM\n- You need direct file transfer/interactive debugging not available via SSM\n\nIf you do use SSH:\n- Inbound 22 restricted to your IP\n- Disable password auth + root login\n- Use passphrased keys + ssh-agent\n- Verify host fingerprint out-of-band on first connect\n- Still keep vLLM bound to localhost and tunnel port 8000\n\n---\n\n## 10) Minimal \u201chappy path\u201d command summary (what you actually run)\n\n**EC2 (via SSM shell):**\n1) Patch + firewall\n2) Install Docker\n3) Create `/etc/vllm/vllm.env` (600 perms)\n4) `systemctl enable --now vllm`\n5) Confirm `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models`\n\n**WSL:**\n1) Enable systemd; create `~/.config/openclaw/secrets.env` (600)\n2) Install OpenClaw; onboard daemon\n3) Configure `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (no secrets)\n4) Add systemd drop-in to load secrets env\n5) Start SSM port forward to local 8000\n6) Pair Telegram user; test\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also include two appendices that engineers often appreciate in a spec:\n1) **A concrete IAM policy** that\u2019s least-privilege for \u201cstart SSM session + describe instance + stop instance\u201d\n2) A **runbook**

This clarification, provided by spokesperson Julia Ilina to The Verge, came in response to an unreleased privacy policy page discovered by security researcher Jane Manchun Wong. The page appeared to allow users to opt out of having personal and camera data used for generative AI, potentially including advertising. Ilina explained that the page was a development placeholder and did not accurately reflect the intended use of the feature.\n\nWaymo's robotaxis, operating in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin, have interior cameras primarily for ensuring safety, tracking lost items, and vehicle cleanliness. While the company is using interior data to train AI models for machine learning and safety, Ilina emphasized that the system does not identify individual users and will not be used for ad targeting. Given growing concerns over tech company data usage, Waymo has committed to allowing users to opt out of data collection used for AI training and reiterated its stance against leveraging personal camera data for advertising purposes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1744057677.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/report/763080/google-ai-gemini-water-energy-emissions-study","title":"Google says a typical AI text prompt only uses 5 drops of water - experts say that's misleading","snippet":"Google recently released a study touting the environmental efficiency of its Gemini AI assistant, claiming that a median text prompt consumes only 0.26 milliliters of water (about five drops) and 0.24 watt-hours of electricity. However, environmental experts argue the study is misleading and omits critical metrics. Critics, including researchers Shaolei Ren and Alex de Vries-Gao, highlight that Google's estimates exclude indirect water usage\u2014primarily from energy production\u2014and rely on market-based rather than location-based carbon emission metrics, which downplays the true environmental impact.\n\nExperts say this presents only \"the tip of the iceberg\" and fails to provide a comprehensive view of AI's sustainability footprint. They argue that real-world data center operations, especially cooling and electricity demands, considerably increase water use and emissions. Google also used a median prompt for analysis, unlike previous studies that relied on averages, making comparisons difficult. Despite significant energy efficiency improvements from 2024 to 2025, critics warn that overall emissions continue to grow due to AI's rapid expansion\u2014a pattern consistent with Jevons paradox. Google's sustainability report further reveals an 11% increase in emissions over the last year. Ultimately, experts question the study's transparency, calling for standardized, holistic environmental measurements.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1755777600.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-ai-training-data-shortage-researchers-harmful-2025-9","title":"A key type of AI training data is running out. Googlers have a bold new idea to fix that.","snippet":"Google DeepMind researchers have proposed a solution to the growing shortage of usable training data for AI models, known as Generative Data Refinement (GDR). Large language models require vast amounts of clean text data, but much of what's available online is discarded due to toxicity, inaccuracies, or inclusion of personal information. GDR reprocesses such problematic data using generative AI to remove or rewrite the unusable portions\u2014like personal identifiers or outdated facts\u2014while preserving valuable content.\n\nThe researchers tested GDR on over a million lines of code with expert validation, finding it significantly outperformed current industry methods and synthetic data generation, which can degrade AI model quality. While the method has only been tested on text and code so far, it has potential applications in other formats like video and audio, where data is more abundant. The approach aims to help AI labs extend the lifespan of human-generated content for training as predictions suggest such resources could be exhausted by 2026\u20132032. The paper, though not peer-reviewed, represents a significant step in addressing the AI data scarcity challenge.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1757951922.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_699666ee421c8330b631b50384e45194","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"request_id":"9c3f587b-30f2-4b3c-b870-1825a82e7a21","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4edbb39d-4981-4a1f-9d2a-c44731dfb340","turn_exchange_id":"2d5f1b55-4a9d-41a7-a56b-25d8e0d9bffc","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Investigating feasibility of Google Gemini API integration","classifier_response":"default","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4edbb39d-4981-4a1f-9d2a-c44731dfb340","children":["f878fb9f-c0a5-4287-bff2-668175410f43"]},"f878fb9f-c0a5-4287-bff2-668175410f43":{"id":"f878fb9f-c0a5-4287-bff2-668175410f43","message":{"id":"f878fb9f-c0a5-4287-bff2-668175410f43","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771464463.468253,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring feasibility of using Google Gemini API with OpenClaw","content":"OpenClaw supports integrating the Google Gemini API either through the Developer API (for personal projects) or via Vertex AI (more enterprise-focused with enhanced data governance).

and Other Tech Companies Ban OpenClaw Over Cybersecurity Concerns","snippet":"In early 2026, several tech companies, including Meta, have banned the use of OpenClaw, a rapidly popularizing open-source AI agent formerly known as Clawdbot and MoltBot, due to cybersecurity concerns. Developed by solo founder Peter Steinberger and released in late 2025, OpenClaw requires minimal guidance to take control of a computer and perform tasks like file management and online browsing. Despite its utility, companies fear its unpredictability, capacity to breach privacy, and vulnerability to manipulation by malicious actors.\n\nTech leaders like Jason Grad (Massive) and Guy Pistone (Valere) issued early internal warnings or bans, citing risks such as unauthorized access to sensitive data and misuse of control. Some companies are testing the software in isolated environments to assess potential fixes and safeguards, including password restrictions and limited command authority. OpenAI, which Steinberger recently joined, will continue to support OpenClaw as open-source software via a foundation. While some organizations still view OpenClaw\u2019s commercial potential with caution, they acknowledge its innovative capabilities and possible future value\u2014provided robust security measures can be implemented.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1771359012.363,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"github.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/10304","title":"Add google-vertex-openapi provider for third-party models ...","snippet":"23 Jan 2026 \u2014 Uses the OpenAPI-compatible endpoint on Vertex AI \u00b7 Supports Application Default Credentials (ADC) via google-auth-library \u00b7 Works with \"gcloud ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1769210701.0,"attribution":"github.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/746","title":"[Bug]: Tool Calling using Google Antigravity \u00b7 Issue #746","snippet":"Tool calling with google-antigravity/claude-* models frequently fails with JSON Schema validation errors \u00b7 Users see repetitive \"format\" failures (80+ errors in ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"github.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/discussions/2984","title":"Gemini tips and tricks #2984","snippet":"4 Feb 2026 \u2014 You probably also want to use the Gemini embedding model for the memory: \"memorySearch\": { \"provider\": \"gemini\", \"remote\": { \"batch\": { \"enabled ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"github.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/4616","title":"Support Claude Opus 4.5 on Google Vertex AI (Provider","snippet":"30 Jan 2026 \u2014 Support Google ADC (Application Default Credentials) for auth.

This new plan offers access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and tools like Flow, Whisk, Veo 3 Fast for video creation, NotebookLM, and integrated Gemini features across Google services. Priced at just $5 per month, it also includes 200GB of cloud storage. This global rollout follows an earlier launch in Indonesia, where it was offered for $4.50 per month.\n\nAI Plus directly competes with OpenAI\u2019s newly introduced $5 ChatGPT Go plan, currently available only in India and Indonesia. Both options serve as mid-tier alternatives between free and more expensive premium services, aiming to convert free users to paying subscribers without high fees. These plans contrast with rising AI subscription costs, some reaching $200 monthly, and may influence other AI firms like Claude, Perplexity, and Grok to follow suit. The value offered by Google's package is considered strong for users seeking more capabilities than free versions provide, making it an appealing choice for casual to moderate AI tool users.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1758731240.0,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/gemini-goes-local-as-google-courts-indian-developers/articleshow/122866327.cms","title":"Gemini goes local as Google courts Indian developers","snippet":"At its developer-focused I/O event in Bengaluru, Google announced strategic enhancements aimed at empowering Indian developers through localized and expanded AI tools.

This is particularly beneficial for real-time applications in video streaming, financial trading, and industrial monitoring.\n\nGoogle also introduced deeper integration of Gemini 2.5 Pro into Firebase and AI Studio, enabling developers to build full-stack AI applications using multimodal prompts such as video, text, and speech. Additionally, the launch of Gemma 3, an open-source model optimized for low-end devices with just 2 GB RAM and available in 140 languages including six Indian ones, underscores Google's push for inclusive AI access.\n\nThe company announced the second edition of its Gen AI Exchange programme, following strong participation last year, to bridge skill gaps in IT and security. Real-world adoption examples include Federal Bank\u2019s AI chatbot \u201cFedi\u201d and Mahindra & Mahindra\u2019s use of Vertex AI in R&D and manufacturing.

The AI tools also include a Guided Learning mode that helps students tackle homework with step-by-step guidance from Gemini. Google's aim is to expand availability to more countries soon. Additionally, the release coincides with the broader availability of Gemini 2.5 Pro and its lighter, cost-efficient sibling, 2.5 Flash-Lite, across platforms like Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

If you enable grounding or caching features, you may be opting into retention windows.\n\n## 5) Cost and quota feasibility (agentic use-cases stress both)\n\nFrom Google\u2019s own pricing page (Developer API):\n- **gemini-2.5-flash**: paid input **$0.30 / 1M tokens** (text/image/video), output **$2.50 / 1M tokens**; free tier exists; supports 1M context window and \u201cthinking budgets.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n- **gemini-2.5-pro**: paid input **$1.25 / 1M** (\u2264200k prompt tokens), output **$10 / 1M** (\u2264200k), higher above 200k. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201  \n\nQuota feasibility:\n- rate limits depend on tier (Free, Tier 1/2/3), measured in RPM/TPM/RPD, per-project. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue201\n\n**Practical take:**  \n- For \u201cchat + light automation,\u201d Gemini API is usually easier and often cheaper than running GPUs that sit idle.  \n- For heavy autonomous loops with lots of tool calls, you can hit **rate limits** and your spend can spike quickly\u2014so you need backoff/retry logic and hard budget caps.\n\n## 6) How you\u2019d wire this into your existing OpenClaw + Telegram setup\n\n### Minimal change (Developer API key)\n- Keep Telegram + pairing + per-channel-peer isolation exactly as before.\n- Replace your model primary from `vllm/...` to something like:\n  - `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (speed/cost)\n  - `google/gemini-2.5-pro` (reasoning)\n\nOpenClaw documents Gemini as:\n- Provider `google`\n- Auth env var `GEMINI_API_KEY` \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n### Security best practice for the key\n- Store `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a **chmod 600** env file in WSL ext4 (not `/mnt/c`)\n- Load it via systemd user unit EnvironmentFile (same pattern you used for vLLM + Telegram secrets)\n- Restrict the key in Google Cloud Console to only the necessary API(s) where possible (API key restriction guidance is in Google Cloud docs) \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n### If you want enterprise-grade controls\nUse `google-vertex` in OpenClaw and authenticate via ADC / service accounts. OpenClaw explicitly distinguishes the Vertex provider and notes Vertex uses gcloud ADC. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7view3\ue201\n\n## 7) Verdict (feasibility summary)\n\n**Feasible:** \u2705 Very. OpenClaw supports Gemini natively (API key) and via Vertex (ADC). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n**Security posture:**  \n- Strong if you use **Paid tier + ZDR (when applicable) + avoid retention features** and store keys correctly. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn7view1\ue201  \n- Stronger still if you use **Vertex AI** with IAM/service accounts and Vertex ZDR. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view2\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n**Operational simplicity:** \u2705 Much simpler than AWS GPU hosting.  \n**Main blockers:** quotas/rate limits (agentic workloads), and your privacy requirements if you were planning to stay on unpaid/free tiers. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view1\ue202turn7view1\ue201  \n\nIf you tell me which of these you care about more:\n1) lowest friction,  \n2) strongest privacy/data governance, or  \n3) lowest ongoing cost under frequent agent usage,  \n\u2026I\u2019ll recommend the exact Gemini route (Developer API vs Vertex), plus the default model choice (`2.5-flash` vs `2.5-pro`) and the minimal OpenClaw config changes."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":730,"end_idx":747,"safe_urls":["https://beaverslab.mintlify.app/en/concepts/model-providers"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Beavers

Google explicitly flags Gemini 3 models as preview. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n- **Free tier privacy** \u2192 Google\u2019s pricing page indicates \u201cUsed to improve our products: Yes\u201d on free tier and \u201cNo\u201d on paid tier. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view4\ue201\n- **If you later hit rate limits**, OpenClaw supports key rotation patterns like `GEMINI_API_KEYS` / `GEMINI_API_KEY_1` etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201\n\n---\n\nIf you paste back the output of:\n```bash\nsystemctl --user list-units | grep -i openclaw\nopenclaw gateway status\n```\n\u2026I can tell you exactly which service name OpenClaw used on your WSL2 install (so the systemd override lands in the right place)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view1\ue202turn1view4\ue201","start_idx":240,"end_idx":268,"safe_urls":["https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3","https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gemini 3 Developer Guide \u00a0|\u00a0 Gemini API \u00a0|\u00a0 Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Gemini Developer API pricing \u00a0|\u00a0 Gemini API \u00a0|\u00a0 Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"Google AI for Developers"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":1},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Google AI for Developers"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201","start_idx":370,"end_idx":387,"safe_urls":["https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/model-providers"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/model-providers))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Model Providers -

For an OpenClaw-style Telegram agent, the failure mode that hurts you most is usually **tool-use / instruction-following errors**, not \u201craw IQ\u201d, so that\u2019s the capability axis to prioritize first.\n\nBelow is a practical decision framework you can apply across providers (OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Start with what you\u2019re optimizing for (agent vs chat)\n\nA Telegram bot backed by an agent framework is different from a one-off chat UI:\n\n- **Chat-only use**: \u201cbigger is better\u201d is often true because you mostly care about answer quality.\n- **Agentic use (OpenClaw)**: you care about **reliability and control**:\n  - Does it follow system instructions consistently?\n  - Does it call tools correctly (if you enable tools)?\n  - Does it keep responses bounded (avoid runaway verbosity)?\n  - Does it avoid hallucinated facts when it should instead ask clarifying questions?\n\nBecause an agent can take actions (send messages, call tools, chain steps), a model that is *slightly less capable but far more predictable* can be a better default than the biggest model you can buy.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The \u201cbig vs small\u201d rule of thumb\n\n### Default: pick \u201csmall/cheap\u201d only if it is **competent enough**\nUse a small/cheap model as the default **if** it meets these minimums in your testing:\n\n1) **Instruction adherence**: It does what you asked, not what it \u201cfeels like.\u201d\n2) **Low hallucination tendency** for your domain (or at least it admits uncertainty).\n3) **Tool discipline** (if tools are enabled): it uses tools when required and formats tool calls correctly.\n4) **Latency**: Telegram feels conversational when replies are quick.\n5) **Context window**: it can handle your typical conversation length without losing critical state.\n\nIf a cheap model fails any of those, you\u2019ll spend more time and money cleaning up mistakes than you save on tokens.\n\n### Use \u201cbig/good\u201d when failures are expensive\nPick a bigger model for:\n- Complex multi-step reasoning (planning, debugging, design)\n- High-stakes actions (anything irreversible or costly)\n- Long-context synthesis (large docs, logs, multi-message threads)\n- Situations where the small model repeatedly needs retries\n\n**Important reality:** A small model that needs 3 retries is often **slower and more expensive** than a bigger model that succeeds first try.\n\n---\n\n## 3) The capability axis to focus on first (most important)\n\nFor an OpenClaw + Telegram bot, focus on these in this order:\n\n### (A) Tool-use / structured-output reliability (first priority if tools are enabled)\nIf your agent will call tools (web, files, shell commands, integrations), then the top capability is:\n\n- **Correct tool selection**\n- **Correct parameter formatting**\n- **Knowing when *not* to call tools**\n- **Recovering from tool errors** without looping\n\nIn practice, this is the #1 differentiator between \u201ccheap model works great\u201d and \u201ccheap model is chaos.\u201d\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t using tools today, agent platforms evolve; it\u2019s worth choosing a model family that is known to be stable at tool/JSON/function-calling when you turn features on.\n\n### (B) Instruction-following + controllability\nYou want consistent behavior under:\n- system messages / policies\n- \u201ckeep it short\u201d requirements\n- refusal boundaries (\u201cdon\u2019t do X\u201d)\n- persona constraints (professional tone)\n\nA model that occasionally ignores instructions will create operational problems (unexpected outputs, policy violations, user confusion).\n\n### (C) Hallucination rate under uncertainty\nFor bots, hallucinations are especially bad because:\n- users trust the bot\u2019s authority\n- the bot may act on incorrect assumptions\n\nPrefer a model that:\n- asks clarifying questions\n- cites uncertainty\n- doesn\u2019t invent \u201cdefinitely true\u201d claims\n\n### (D) Context window + memory behavior\nTelegram conversations can become long and messy. If your use involves:\n- referencing earlier decisions\n- summarizing long threads\n- tracking tasks\n\n\u2026context length and attention quality matter more than raw benchmark scores.\n\n### (E) Latency and throughput\nTelegram is conversational; users bounce if responses are slow. A slightly weaker model with fast responses often \u201cfeels\u201d better.\n\n### (F) Raw reasoning (the \u201cbig brain\u201d factor)\nThis is important, but it\u2019s usually the *second* thing to optimize once (A) and (B) are solid\u2014because a brilliant model that is slow, expensive, or tool-chaotic is still a bad agent default.\n\n---\n\n## 4) A practical selection strategy that works well\n\n### Strategy 1: Two-tier \u201cfast default + smart fallback\u201d\n- **Default model**: small/cheap/fast\n- **Fallback model**: big/good\n\nEscalate to the big model only when:\n- the user explicitly asks (\u201cuse deep mode\u201d)\n- the agent detects complexity (long prompt, many constraints)\n- the first attempt fails validation (bad JSON/tool call, contradictions)\n- the user says \u201cthat\u2019s wrong\u201d or \u201ctry again carefully\u201d\n\nThis gives you:\n- low steady-state cost\n- high success on hard tasks\n- good UX (fast most of the time)\n\n### Strategy 2: Separate \u201cplanner\u201d and \u201cexecutor\u201d (if you do tool actions)\n- **Planner model** (bigger): create a plan and decide actions\n- **Executor model** (smaller): carry out tool calls and produce summaries\n\nThis reduces cost while keeping decision quality high, but it requires more engineering discipline.\n\n---\n\n## 5) How to decide empirically (what to test first)\n\nBefore committing, run a small evaluation (even manual) on *your* tasks:\n\n### Create 20\u201350 representative prompts\nInclude:\n- short Q&A\n- multi-step instructions (\u201cdo X, then Y, then summarize\u201d)\n- a few ambiguous prompts (does it ask clarifying questions?)\n- if tools enabled: prompts that require a tool call + prompts that should not call tools\n\n### Track these metrics\n- **First-pass success rate** (no retry, no correction)\n- **Tool-call success rate** (valid schema, correct parameters)\n- **Overrun rate** (ignores brevity, rambles)\n- **Hallucination incidents**\n- **Latency**\n- **Total cost per successful task** (including retries)\n\nYou\u2019ll often find:\n- Very small models: cheap but low first-pass success \u2192 costs hide in retries\n- Mid models: best cost/performance\n- Top models: best success, but may be overkill for routine tasks\n\n---\n\n## 6) Concrete recommendations (provider-agnostic)\n\nIf your primary goal is a private Telegram bot for personal productivity:\n\n### If you are NOT using tools yet\n- Start with a **mid-tier \u201cflash/mini/sonnet-style\u201d** model as default.\n- Upgrade only if you see repeated factual/reasoning failures.\n\n### If you ARE using tools (or will soon)\n- Do **not** go too small.\n- Pick the smallest model that is known to be good at:\n  - tool/function calling\n  - structured outputs (JSON)\n  - following \u201cdo not do X\u201d constraints\n\n### Avoid \u201cpreview\u201d models as your only model\nPreview models can change behavior and rate limits without notice. If you do use preview as default, keep a stable fallback configured.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Cost control tips specific to agent bots (important)\n\nEven with a \u201ccheap\u201d model, cost can spike from:\n- long conversations\n- verbose outputs\n- retry loops\n- tool chains that keep re-prompting\n\nControls that matter more than model size:\n- Set **max output tokens** / response length caps.\n- Implement **retry limits** (e.g., 1\u20132 retries max).\n- Add **time/step budgets** per user request.\n- Add a **\u201crequires confirmation\u201d** mode for expensive operations.\n- Have a \u201csummarize conversation so far\u201d behavior to reduce context growth.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Direct answer to your question\n\n### Should you choose a big good model or as small/cheap as possible?\n- **Default:** choose **small/cheap** *only if* it\u2019s reliably correct for your tasks.\n- **Best practice:** configure a **two-tier system**:\n  - small/cheap default\n  - big/good fallback for complex or failure cases\n\n### Which aspect of model capability should you focus on first?\nFor OpenClaw-style agent workflows, focus first on:\n1) **Tool/structured-output reliability** (if tools are involved at all)\n2) **Instruction-following / controllability**\n3) **Low hallucination behavior**\n4) Then: reasoning depth, context length, style\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what your OpenClaw bot will actually do (examples: \u201cjust chat,\u201d \u201csummarize links,\u201d \u201cmanage tasks,\u201d \u201crun scripts,\u201d \u201ccontrol home services,\u201d etc.) and whether you plan to enable tools, I can suggest a concrete \u201cdefault + fallback\u201d pairing for the provider(s) you\u2019re considering (OpenAI vs xAI vs Gemini) and what thresholds to use for escalation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"can_save":true,"model_slug":"gpt-5.2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5.2"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"faaebae6-f2ea-4f36-8ce0-8165f939a273","children":[]}}}
