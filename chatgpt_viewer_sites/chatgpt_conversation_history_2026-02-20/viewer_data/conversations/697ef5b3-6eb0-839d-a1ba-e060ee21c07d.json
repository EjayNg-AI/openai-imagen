Find the probability \r\nof taking out two blue balls.\r\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35) = 4\r\n7\r\n\u00d7\r\n4\r\n7 = 16\r\n49\r\nThe probability of drawing the second blue ball \ufffd\r\n4\r\n7\r\n\ufffd is same as the first blue ball \ufffd\r\n4\r\n7\r\n\ufffd. \r\nThe probability of the second event is unaffected by the first event.

All rights reserved 21\r\n[L89] Part 3: Evaluating Probability (with or w/o diagrams)\r\n[L90] Mutually Exclusive Events\r\n[L91] Two outcomes/events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time.\r\n[L92] For example, when we throw a dice, the outcome of obtaining a \u201c1\u201d and the outcome of obtaining \r\n[L93] a \u201c6\u201d are mutually exclusive because we cannot obtain both \"1\" and \"6\" at the same time.\r\n[L94] Independent VS Dependent Events\r\n[L95] Independent events are best illustrated in events where the object is replaced after picking.\r\n[L96] Because the object is replaced, the probability of picking a second object will not be affected by \r\n[L97] the first pick.\r\n[L98] Dependent events are best illustrated in events where the object is not replaced after picking.\r\n[L99] As the object is not replaced, the probability of picking a second object will be affected by what \r\n[L100] was picked in the first pick.\r\n[L101] Hence, for dependent events (i.e. events without replacement), we have to account and adjust for \r\n[L102] the object removed in the first pick before multiplying the probabilities.\r\n[L103] Example of independent events\r\n[L104] Two balls are randomly taken out, with replacement, from a bag of 3 red and 4 blue balls.

Find the probability \r\n[L105] of taking out two blue balls.\r\n[L106] \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35) = 4\r\n[L107] 7\r\n[L108] \u00d7\r\n[L109] 4\r\n[L110] 7 = 16\r\n[L111] 49\r\n[L112] The probability of drawing the second blue ball \ufffd\r\n[L113] 4\r\n[L114] 7\r\n[L115] \ufffd is same as the first blue ball \ufffd\r\n[L116] 4\r\n[L117] 7\r\n[L118] \ufffd. \r\n[L119] The probability of the second event is unaffected by the first event.
