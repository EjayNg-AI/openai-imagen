If your goal is **high-fidelity transcription** (publishing-quality) from messy documents, you\u2019ll spend time on preprocessing + postprocessing, and sometimes a different OCR system will be less work.\n\n---\n\n## (ii) Extracting math\n\n### Bottom line: unreliable for real math\nTesseract is **not designed** to recognize mathematical expressions as *structured math*. It outputs primarily **plain text**, and math needs either:\n- **LaTeX** (e.g., `\\int_0^1 x^2 dx`)\n- **MathML** (Mathematical Markup Language)\n- or another representation that preserves 2D layout.\n\nTesseract does not natively \u201cunderstand\u201d equation structure. Even if it reads some symbols correctly, it usually fails at representing:\n- superscripts/subscripts correctly (`x^2`, `x_i`)\n- fractions (`(a+b)/c` vs stacked fraction)\n- radicals, integrals, summations with bounds\n- matrices/alignment\n- multi-line derivations\n\n### When it can be \u201cokay\u201d\nIt can be *somewhat usable* for **very simple inline math** that is basically one-dimensional, like:\n- `x + y = 3`\n- `sin(x)`\n- `a/b` (typed inline, not stacked)\n\nEven then, symbol confusion is common:\n- `\u00d7` vs `x` vs `*`\n- `\u2212` (minus) vs `\u2013` (en dash) vs `\u2014` (em dash)\n- `.` vs `\u00b7` (dot product)\n- `\u2208` vs `\u03f5` vs `e`\n- Greek letters (`\u03bd` vs `v`, `\u03c1` vs `p`)\n- `1` vs `l`, `0` vs `O`\n- `\u03a3` vs `E` (in some fonts)\n\n### Why math is hard (and why Tesseract struggles)\nMath OCR needs two layers:\n1. **Symbol recognition** (what character is this?)\n2. **Structural analysis** (how are symbols arranged in 2D?)\n\nTesseract mainly targets (1) and only weakly approximates (2). For math, (2) is the core of the problem.\n\n### Practical take\nIf you care about correctness, **don\u2019t rely on Tesseract for math** beyond the simplest expressions. For extraction of equations into LaTeX/MathML, you usually want a dedicated **math OCR** system (or a model trained for \u201cimage-to-LaTeX\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## What people often do in practice (best workflow)\nIf your documents contain both text and math:\n\n1. **Detect layout / regions**\n   - Separate \u201cnormal text blocks\u201d from \u201cequation blocks\u201d.\n2. **Run Tesseract on text blocks**\n   - Good ROI: fast and decent accuracy.\n3. **Run a math OCR model on equation blocks**\n   - Produces LaTeX/MathML with much higher fidelity than Tesseract can.\n4. **Postprocess**\n   - Spellcheck for text; parser/validator checks for LaTeX.\n\nThis hybrid approach is usually far more reliable than trying to force one tool to do everything.\n\n---\n\n## Rule-of-thumb reliability summary\n- **Printed text, clean scans:** generally **strong**\n- **Printed text, messy scans / complex layout:** **mixed**\n- **Handwriting:** generally **weak**\n- **Math notation (anything beyond trivial inline):** generally **weak to unusable** if you need correct structure\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your setting (PDF scans vs phone photos, printed vs handwritten, and whether you need *LaTeX output* or just \u201creadable text\u201d), I can recommend a concrete pipeline (including preprocessing choices and which OCR engine to use for the math parts)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"wfr_019c41eaafa9713f808bfd5f44973f9f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","is_async_task_result_message":true,"async_task_id":"promode_6989b4e8514c81918f2488926472fe85","async_task_title":"","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_original_message_id":"f8db13bd-9355-49cf-891d-5b436cacca4a","async_completion_id":"promode_6989b4e8514c81918f2488926472fe85","async_completion_message":"Your overview on the reliability of Tesseract for extracting text and math is ready.

I'll check the content, which includes text, formulas, diagrams, and graphs, then run some tests with pytesseract to simulate OCR. However, since file downloads are off-limits, I'll avoid saving additional files.\n\n**Demonstrating Tesseract OCR reliability on exam pages**\n\nI'll be cautious since OCR is resource-intensive, but we can sample a few pages for demonstration. Since the exam text is in images, not embedded, Tesseract will need to process those. I'll focus on pages with various content, like math expressions or diagrams, to assess OCR reliability for different types of content.\n\n**Running Tesseract on rendered pages to assess OCR quality**\n\nTesseract will give us output, which we can evaluate. We don\u2019t have ground truth, but we can manually compare results. The text should be readable, though math expressions might be misrecognized. I'll render the pages as images and run Tesseract using appropriate settings to check the OCR results.\n\n**Checking for pytesseract and tesseract binary**\n\nFirst, I need to check if pytesseract and the tesseract binary are available. This is important before running any OCR tests, as these tools will be necessary to process the exam pages. I'll do a quick check to make sure everything is in place.\n\n**Checking for pytesseract library**\n\nSince tesseract is available, the next step is to check whether the pytesseract library is installed. This will help ensure I can interface with tesseract for OCR tasks. If pytesseract isn\u2019t available, I\u2019ll need to consider installing it before proceeding.\n\n**Checking for fitz (PyMuPDF) installation**\n\nNow that I\u2019ve got tesseract set up, I need to render the PDF pages as images. I\u2019ll use PyMuPDF (fitz) for this \u2014 but first, I should check if it's installed. If it's not, I\u2019ll figure out an alternative. Time to see if it\u2019s available!\n\n**Rendering PDF pages to PNG using fitz**\n\nSince fitz is available, I can use it to render the PDF pages as PNG images at 300 DPI. This should give a clear output for the OCR process. Time to proceed with rendering the pages and setting up the OCR test!\n\n**Rendering selected pages for OCR test**\n\nI'll render pages 2 (index 1), 4 (index 3), 6 (index 5), and 7 (index 6). I'll create a function to streamline the rendering process, ensuring the chosen pages are ready for OCR testing. Let's go ahead and implement this function.\n\n**Running OCR on rendered images**\n\nNow I'll run pytesseract OCR on the rendered images, starting with the default settings. I'll use the necessary configuration for later, but for now, let's start simple and assess the results. Once it's done, we can adjust for any issues or improvements.\n\n**Optimizing OCR speed with cropping and lower DPI**\n\nOCR at 300 DPI is slow, so I\u2019ll optimize by cropping specific regions or lowering the DPI to 200 or 150. I\u2019ll work with a smaller subset of pages and crop the question areas. For reliability, I\u2019ll use a timeout of 30 seconds in pytesseract to prevent potential hangs. Let's reinitialize the document and render page 1 at 200 DPI.\n\n**Inspecting image by saving it locally**\n\nI need to check the cropping coordinates, and I\u2019m considering using the image-rendering tool for this. But since we can't display it to the user, I'll use Python to save the image locally instead. I\u2019ll save it as \"tmp.png\" and then open it to inspect. Just an internal check.\n\n**Cropping and running OCR**\n\nOkay, I see that page 2 looks clear. Instead of OCRing the whole page (too slow), I'll crop multiple regions for more manageable analysis. First, I'll crop the top part with Question 1 and fraction, and then for Question 2, I'll focus on the narrative text. I'll add a timeout of 20 seconds to Tesseract.\n\n**Running OCR on cropped regions**\n\nOkay, I\u2019m going to proceed with OCR on the cropped regions now. This will help me analyze only the specific parts of the page that are needed, ensuring better accuracy and efficiency. Let's run the OCR now and see how well it detects the text in these areas.\n\n**Analyzing OCR results and planning next steps**\n\nOkay, the OCR did well with the narrative text, although there were some misrecognitions, like \"Claden caid\" instead of parts of a mathematical expression. It struggled with math, especially with exponents and fractions, interpreting \"7.6^3\" incorrectly. I'll check page 4 with algebraic expressions and render it at 200 DPI before continuing.\n\n**Preparing to OCR page 4\u2019s relevant sections**\n\nPage 4 contains a math expression and a fraction, along with a graph. I'm planning to crop the top part where the math expression \"Simplify (2x + y) -2(x-2y)\" and the fraction appear, as well as the bottom part with the graph's text. Then, I\u2019ll run OCR to see how well it captures this content.\n\n**Evaluating OCR performance with math expressions**\n\nThe OCR did okay with simple math expressions, but it struggled with fractions and exponents, misrecognizing a minus sign as an em dash and garbling the fraction as \"2x x \u2014+-.\" The chart text looks fine, though. For more complex math, it seems incomplete. I\u2019ll test page 7, which contains geometry and an equation, to see how it handles these types of content.\n\n**Cropping and OCR of text and equation**\n\nI\u2019m going to crop out the text paragraph and the equation separately. After that, I'll run OCR on them to see how accurately it captures both the text and the math equation. This will help determine how well the OCR handles more complex structures like equations.\n\n**Inspecting equation crop**\n\nIt seems like the crop for the equation might be too low. The equation is closer to the bottom than expected, possibly starting near x=150. I\u2019ll check the crop and adjust it to ensure it includes the full equation. I'll open the crop to inspect it further.\n\n**Adjusting crop for equation**\n\nLooks like the crop I used is blank because the equation was placed higher than I expected. The equation seems to be around y=1350, just below the horizontal line. I'll crop a larger bottom region, from y=1100 to y=1700, to capture the equation properly.\n\n**OCRing bottom crop**\n\nI'm going ahead with performing the OCR on the bottom crop now. This should capture the equation and any related content that wasn't included before. Hopefully, this will get the details right this time! Let\u2019s see what it picks up.\n\n**Testing OCR with different settings**\n\nThe OCR output gave \"2xt1\" instead of \"2x+1\" and messed up the fraction. Maybe trying different OCR settings like psm 6, 7, or 11 would help. I\u2019ll also try binarization with grayscale and thresholding. I'll crop the equation region and test these adjustments. Let's see how it goes!\n\n**Trying OCR with different settings**\n\nI'm going to try OCR using various Page Segmentation Modes (psm). This might help with getting a clearer output, especially for the equation area. Let\u2019s see which setting works best for recognizing the text and structure. I\u2019ll give it a go and check the results!\n\n**Trying preprocessing adjustments**\n\nThe output isn\u2019t quite right, so I\u2019m going to preprocess the image. I'll start by converting it to grayscale, apply a threshold, and then enlarge it. To make sure I capture more detail, I\u2019ll upscale the image by 2x and see if that improves the result. Let\u2019s try this.\n\n**Starting OCR on preprocessed image**\n\nAlright, now that I\u2019ve preprocessed the image\u2014grayscale, thresholded, and enlarged\u2014it\u2019s time to run OCR on it. Let\u2019s see if these adjustments improve the accuracy of the text recognition. I\u2019ll give it a try and check the output.\n\n**Evaluating OCR results and testing more pages**\n\nTesseract still struggles with certain math symbols, like the plus sign, fraction, and equals symbol in this case. It correctly identified \"2x+1\" but missed things like denominators. I'll try adjusting settings\u2014maybe using gray with more contrast, or testing a different psm. I\u2019ll move on to other sections like page 5.\n\n**OCR testing on formulas**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the formulas now. Since the previous attempts weren't perfect, I\u2019ll see if a more targeted approach can improve the output, especially for complex elements like fractions or square roots. Let\u2019s analyze the results more carefully to identify any adjustments needed to capture these formulas accurately.\n\n**Evaluating OCR results for math formulas**\n\nThe OCR had issues with mathematical characters: it mistook \"b\" as \"6,\" misread the fraction formula, and didn't capture the superscript or sqrt symbol properly\u2014showing \"V\" instead. It works for text but struggles with math. I'll provide evidence from test results to show that Tesseract isn't reliable for this type of task.\n\n**Providing OCR guidelines and recommendations**\n\nInstead of creating downloadable files, we can provide users with code to run OCR themselves. We can discuss expected error rates\u2014text OCR might be 95-99% accurate for clean prints, while math is more error-prone. Accuracy depends on character or semantic level. We'll also mention a math-specific pipeline using LaTeX OCR and rule-based conversions for better results.\n\n**Evaluating OCR performance for math and text**\n\nIt looks like the user expects an evaluation of Tesseract for extracting both text and math from an exam paper. Tesseract works fairly well with text, but struggles with math, needing additional modeling or manual correction. For example, a fraction like \"7.6^3/(6.14-0.15^2)\" is misinterpreted.\n\n**Providing OCR improvement suggestions and alternatives**\n\nTo improve OCR accuracy, we can recommend scanning at 300 DPI, preprocessing methods like deskewing, binarizing, removing noise, and tuning settings. While Tesseract works well for text, math detection remains challenging. For math, we suggest alternatives like Mathpix, InftyReader, or LaTeX-OCR.\n\n**Clarifying OCR accuracy and citing evidence**\n\nWe can\u2019t generate download files but will show code blocks for user to apply. We should cite specific pages from the document (e.g., page 2). I ran Tesseract using the default English model at 200 DPI, and errors like \"300\" to \"200\" in OCR output suggest about 80-90% word accuracy.\n\n**Evaluating OCR for scan accuracy and math recognition**\n\nFor this scanned exam, text is generally good but does have numerical errors (e.g., \"300\" to \"200\"). For math, the OCR results are poor. For text, Tesseract works well; for math, use dedicated math OCR like Mathpix. Improve with 300 DPI, grayscale, and correct psm settings."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 22m 13s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-7ca505d3-0266-43b3-826f-1cca684e1449:IN","parent_id":"b18ea3f2-e00a-4296-8426-933d2eeb6846","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_6989ba44525081919c3fac86692844b7","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"6989ba44-53ec-839b-aa45-78350a554ab8","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T10:43:16.804340Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"b18ea3f2-e00a-4296-8426-933d2eeb6846","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"7ca505d3-0266-43b3-826f-1cca684e1449","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"89a79baa-ad34-41d4-bb59-30cbc44e2b4d","finished_duration_sec":1333,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b18ea3f2-e00a-4296-8426-933d2eeb6846","children":["7590c3b0-e356-4712-901c-8af2cd3ac4dd"]},"7590c3b0-e356-4712-901c-8af2cd3ac4dd":{"id":"7590c3b0-e356-4712-901c-8af2cd3ac4dd","message":{"id":"7590c3b0-e356-4712-901c-8af2cd3ac4dd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770635130.299092,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["On **this PDF** (a scanned Sec 1 math exam paper with lots of short numeric tokens, stacked fractions, radicals, and diagrams), **Tesseract is \u201cpretty good\u201d for the English sentences, and genuinely unreliable for the math**\u2014and diagrams can make it slow or messy unless you crop them out. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n## What happens on your example\n\n### 1) Plain text (English instructions/questions)\nFor the *sentence-like* parts, Tesseract generally does fine here (the font is clean, contrast is OK, spacing is regular).\n\nExample from page 2: the paragraph about *Bel buying orange concentrate* is transcribed mostly correctly, with typical minor issues (random capitalization, occasional punctuation/spacing noise). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n**But** even inside \u201cplain text\u201d, the moment you have **small numbers or symbols**, errors pop up:\n- `1 : 4` was misread as `| : 4` (digit **1** \u2192 vertical bar).\n- Brackets/marks like `[1]` sometimes come out as `{1]`, etc.\n\nSo: **fine for search / rough transcription**, not \u201ctrust it blindly\u201d if you need exact numeric fidelity.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Math expressions\nThis file is a great stress test for Tesseract\u2019s weaknesses. Your pages include exactly the structures Tesseract struggles with: **stacked fractions**, **superscripts**, and **radicals**.\n\nConcrete failures I observed:\n\n- **Stacked fraction + exponents (page 2, Q1)**  \n  The printed expression is a clean fraction with superscripts. Tesseract repeatedly **dropped or mangled the numerator and the exponents**, outputting something closer to:\n  - numerator missing / garbled\n  - exponent `3` misread as a degree symbol `\u00b0`\n  - denominator partly lost (e.g., reads `6.14\u20140.15` and misses the `^2`)  \n  This is not a \u201csmall typo\u201d problem: it changes the math completely. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n- **Algebraic simplification with fractions (page 4, Q4b)**  \n  For something as simple as `2x/3 + x/4`, Tesseract did not preserve fraction structure and produced scrambled symbols (e.g., it doesn\u2019t reliably output a linearized form like `(2x)/3 + x/4`). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n- **Radical + exponent (page 5, Q6b)**  \n  `a = \u221a(b\u00b2 \u2212 4c)` came out like `a=Vb'\u2014-4c`:\n  - `\u221a` \u2192 `V` (common)\n  - `\u00b2` \u2192 `'` or dropped\n  - minus signs become various dash characters  \n  Again: not usable as math without heavy cleanup. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n- **Even variable names can flip (page 5, Q6 text)**  \n  In \u201cFind a when **b = \u221210** and c = 9\u2026\u201d, Tesseract read **b** as **6** in my run (`6 = -10`). That is catastrophic if you\u2019re building datasets or auto-solving. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n**Blunt conclusion:** on this kind of worksheet, **Tesseract will silently introduce wrong mathematics**. If \u201ccorrect math\u201d matters, you can\u2019t treat its output as reliable.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Diagrams / graphs\nPages with dense graphics (notably the coordinate grid on page 6) are a separate issue:\n\n- Running OCR on the **entire page including the grid** can become **very slow** or even time out, because the page is packed with high-frequency line patterns that confuse segmentation. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n- If you **crop out the grid** and OCR only the question text region, it becomes fast and accurate again.\n\nSo for diagram-heavy pages, the first step isn\u2019t \u201cbetter OCR\u201d\u2014it\u2019s **layout detection / cropping**.\n\n---\n\n## Practical reliability ratings for this exact document type\nIf you\u2019re deciding \u201ccan I just use Tesseract end-to-end?\u201d:\n\n- **English text blocks:** \u2705 generally reliable (with small, fixable noise)\n- **Short numeric tokens inside text (ratios, marks, small numbers):** \u26a0\ufe0f mixed (needs validation rules)\n- **Math notation (fractions, exponents, radicals):** \u274c unreliable (structure and symbols break)\n- **Diagram understanding (graphs/geometry figures):** \u274c OCR is the wrong tool; at best you extract nearby labels\n\n---\n\n## What to do instead (if you need correct math)\nIf your goal is to extract questions in a machine-usable way:\n\n1. **Segment the page**\n   - text blocks vs equation blocks vs figures (graphs/geometry)\n2. **Tesseract for text blocks only**\n3. **Math OCR for equation blocks**\n   - something explicitly designed for image\u2192LaTeX / MathML (Mathematical Markup Language)\n4. **Keep diagrams as images** (or do separate CV extraction if you really need coordinates/geometry)\n\nAnd add **sanity checks**:\n- If a line contains \u201cb = \u2026\u201d, reject outputs where `b` becomes `6`.\n- Normalize dash characters to ASCII `-`.\n- Require that expressions parse (e.g., SymPy) if you\u2019re converting to symbolic form.\n\n---\n\n## Minimal Python snippet to reproduce the behavior\n(Shows why cropping matters, and why math breaks.)\n\n```python\nimport fitz  # PyMuPDF\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport pytesseract\nimport io\n\npdf_path = \"2023-bs-sa2.pdf\"\ndoc = fitz.open(pdf_path)\n\ndef render(page_index, dpi=300):\n    page = doc.load_page(page_index)\n    zoom = dpi / 72\n    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(zoom, zoom), alpha=False)\n    return Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes(\"png\")))\n\n# Page 2 (index 1): math + text\nimg = render(1, dpi=300)\nprint(pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config=\"--oem 3 --psm 6\"))\n\n# Page 6 (index 5): grid page -> crop out the graph for speed/accuracy\nimg6 = render(5, dpi=150)\ntext_region = img6.crop((0, 820, img6.width, img6.height))  # bottom text only\nprint(pytesseract.image_to_string(text_region, config=\"--oem 3 --psm 6\"))\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what you actually need as output (plain text for search? clean question bank? LaTeX for equations? something a solver can ingest?), I can suggest a concrete pipeline and validation strategy tailored to this exact exam-paper layout.

packages for converting PNG to LaTeX**\n\nI'll recommend optimal packages for converting cropped PNG images containing math into LaTeX. Key tools include Mathpix for high accuracy (paid API), Im2LaTeX models, and pix2tex for printed formulas. Open-source alternatives like TrOCR and LaTeX-OCR are also worth considering. InftyReader is another option but it's old.\n\n**Clarifying image-to-LaTeX process and tools**\n\nFor offline open-source options, pix2tex and LaTeX-OCR are solid choices. Nougat by Meta works well for overall document extraction, but may not be ideal for cropped equations in PNG. If PDFs are unscanned, using pdfminer is preferred. Since the user deals with PNGs, I\u2019ll focus on image-to-LaTeX tools.\n\n**Clarifying citation format and packages**\n\nFor citing the PDF, I\u2019ll refer to it directly, adhering to the instructions to mention it as a reference. Since the task is about \"optimal packages,\" I\u2019ll interpret this as referring to Python packages for the image-to-LaTeX pipeline. I\u2019ll also ensure to provide any necessary page number references.\n\n**Proposing a pipeline for image-to-LaTeX conversion**\n\nFor the optimal package pipeline, I suggest: use PyMuPDF for rendering PDFs, OpenCV for segmentation and preprocessing, and pytorch/transformers for model inference such as pix2tex or LaTeX-OCR. Postprocess with sympy parsing or latex2sympy for validation. Cropping the equation region carefully is key to reduce noise.\n\n**Recommending optimal packages for image-to-LaTeX conversion**\n\nTo convert images to LaTeX, I recommend:  \n- Commercial: Mathpix API for the best accuracy.  \n- Open-source: pix2tex, LaTeX-OCR, and im2markup.  \nFor pre-processing: OpenCV, Pillow, scikit-image.  \nFor PDF-to-image: PyMuPDF or pdf2image.  \nFor LaTeX cleaning: latex2sympy and sympy for validation.  \n\nI\u2019d suggest tight cropping around the equations to avoid lines interfering with recognition, especially for scanned exam papers.\n\n**Verifying the best OCR packages for LaTeX conversion**\n\nWhile some packages like pix2tex, Nougat, and Mathpix have been good, SOTA is constantly evolving. Since the user may expect the most accurate and current options, I\u2019ll run a search to verify which packages are still leading. This will help provide solid recommendations with up-to-date sources.\n\n**Recommending optimal packages for LaTeX rendering**\n\nThe user\u2019s focus is on cropping images containing math formulas, possibly with text, and converting those into LaTeX. For the highest accuracy, I would recommend Mathpix API (paid) for mixed text and math, or for open-source options, pix2tex works well for math-only and, if mixed content, Pix2Text, Texify, or Nougat.\n\n**Recommending packages and pre-processing steps for math OCR**\n\nThe user wants a combination of packages for cropping and LaTeX conversion. I\u2019d recommend using OpenCV for preprocessing, along with pix2tex for math-to-LaTeX. If working with mixed text and math, consider Texify, Pix2Text, or Nougat. Crucial details include ensuring high-resolution cropping (300-400dpi) and excluding dotted lines during preprocessing.\n\n**Proposing packages for efficient math OCR pipeline**\n\nI suggest these packages for the user\u2019s workflow:\n\n- Use `pymupdf` or `pdf2image` for converting PDFs to images.\n- For preprocessing, apply `opencv-python`.\n- To convert formula images to LaTeX, try `pix2tex`.\n- Use `pix2text` for mixed text and equations (outputs Markdown with LaTeX).\n- If total-page recognition is needed for both inline math and text, consider `texify` or `nougat`.\n\n**Recommending LaTeX rendering for formulas and equations**\n\nFor \"LaTeX rendering,\" the user may only need formulas, but they might want both text and equations. Here are my recommendations:\n\n- Paid: Mathpix v3, best for LaTeX output.\n- Offline: Use pix2tex for formulas, Pix2Text or Texify for full snippets including text and equations.\n\nWe should clarify that none are 100% perfect and manual verification is required. I will provide a comparison and explanations in bullet points for clarity.\n\n**Pre-processing advice for formula OCR models**\n\nFor optimal OCR results, consider these settings:\n\n- **Cropping**: Ensure enough whitespace around the formula, but avoid excessive margins.\n- **Background**: Use a white background with black text, or invert if needed.\n- **Size**: Rescale to an appropriate x-height for better recognition.\n\nHelpful code snippets and usage references are available in repositories like pix2tex. I'll check the GitHub page for detailed instructions.\n\n**Exploring pix2tex Python usage**\n\nI found the installation lines for pix2tex, but we need to focus on the Python API usage. We should look further for \"LatexOCR\" under the relevant section to ensure we get the proper code to implement it. I'll open the additional lines to make sure we understand the usage.\n\n**Switching from Texify to Surya**\n\nI found the Python usage snippet for pix2tex and the installation instructions for pix2text, but I noticed Texify is deprecated and replaced by Surya. That's key! We should recommend Surya instead of Texify. I'll check the Surya project details by clicking the relevant link to gather more information.\n\n**Checking Surya for LaTeX OCR support**\n\nSurya supports LaTeX OCR and works with both images and PDFs, installed via `pip install surya-ocr`. I'll confirm if it includes the `surya_latex_ocr` CLI. To verify this, I'll check the Surya README for any mention of `surya_latex_ocr` to ensure everything is in place.\n\n**Looking into TexTeller for potential alternative**\n\nSurya seems like a strong choice since it matches the user's needs with cropped images for equations. However, I should also check TexTeller, a newer open-source model. It might offer better accuracy but could be less stable. I\u2019ll open the TexTeller repo to check for details and updates.\n\n**Evaluating best options for LaTeX OCR**\n\nThere are other models like Texo and RapidLaTeXOCR, but we should focus on top options. For accuracy, Mathpix is commercial and highly recommended. For open-source, Surya\u2019s surya_latex_ocr and pix2tex are good for local use\u2014though Surya needs cropped images. Surya\u2019s GPL license may require a commercial license for use, while pix2tex has an MIT license.\n\n**Summarizing LaTeX OCR tools with key details**\n\nLaTeX-OCR is MIT licensed, which we should note. Pix2tex works best with smaller images and has a preprocessing step. Surya\u2019s surya_latex_ocr requires images cropped to equations. Pix2Text is an open-source Mathpix alternative, supporting full PDFs. Mathpix v3 processes images to LaTeX, while Nougat parses entire PDFs but is designed for full-page processing.\n\n**Discussing optimal LaTeX OCR solutions**\n\nThe \"most optimal\" solution depends on your needs\u2014accuracy, speed, cost, and privacy. Surya is more advanced but has heavier licensing and may be slower. Pix2tex handles block formulas well, while Surya works best for pre-cropped equations and PDF inputs. For a paid option, Mathpix API offers top accuracy.\n\n**Recommending LaTeX OCR solutions for different scenarios**\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of packages based on your needs:\n\n- Most accurate with minimal setup: Mathpix API.\n- Best local/open-source for cropped equations: Surya (surya-ocr) or Pix2tex.\n- For mixed text and inline math: Pix2Text or Surya\u2019s full OCR.\n- Fastest deployment option: RapidLaTeXOCR (ONNX version of Pix2tex).\n\nFor Surya and Pix2tex, I'll explain how to integrate with minimal code, such as CLI or Python API calls.\n\n**Answer breakdown and guidance for choosing the right package**\n\nSurya offers Python integration with its `TexifyPredictor` for LaTeX OCR and a CLI. Since the user is cropping equation blocks, this is directly compatible with Surya\u2019s expectations. It's important to crop only the formula, excluding unnecessary text to prevent errors.\n\nFor local, open-source OCR, I\u2019d recommend `surya-ocr` for general document OCR with LaTeX support. Of course, the \"most optimal\" choice depends on whether the user has GPU access, requires offline capability, or needs open-source licensing.\n\n**Recommended packages for OCR tasks**\n\nSurya is great for general OCR with LaTeX support and has both a CLI and Python integration. For pure equation recognition, `pix2tex` is easy to use, MIT-licensed, and reduces hallucination by resizing small images. For mixed content (text and equations), `pix2text` automatically handles layout, but if you\u2019re cropping equations, it may not be necessary.\n\nFor top-tier accuracy, Mathpix Convert API is the best service. Additionally, `nougat` works well for full pages but may struggle with small cropped equations. According to Texify's readme, it can hallucinate more with small, cropped images.\n\n**Disclaimers and formula validation tips**\n\nAll models can produce LaTeX that doesn't compile, so it's important to run it through a LaTeX compiler or use KaTeX/MathJax for validation. You can use tools like `sympy.parsing.latex` or `latex2sympy2`, though they support limited LaTeX. For formula-only images, both `pix2tex` and `surya_latex_ocr` should work well, but ensure pre-processing for clarity (binary text, remove lines).\n\n**Sample code and licensing clarification**\n\nThey requested \"packages\" instead of focusing on preprocessing, so I can provide a minimal pipeline. I'll avoid casual language and maintain a professional tone. I'll define abbreviations like DPI (dots per inch), GPU (graphics processing unit), and OCR (optical character recognition). Regarding licensing, Surya's code is GPL-3.0, and Pix2Text uses the MIT license.\n\n**Citing packages and equations**\n\nTo address the user's needs with cropped equation images, I recommend:\n\n1. **Surya (surya-ocr)**: Best for LaTeX OCR with cropped equation images. It includes `TexifyPredictor` and has automatic cropping options.\n2. **pix2tex**: Works well for block equations with easy-to-use Python snippets and automatic resizing.\n3. **Pix2Text**: Good for text+math images; handles layout analysis and outputs in Markdown.\n4. **Mathpix Convert API**: Best for high accuracy at a cost. Handles printed/handwritten LaTeX.\n\nAdditionally, I'll mention licensing details and clarify the limited use of Nougat.\n\n**Sharing code for LaTeX OCR models**\n\nFor using **pix2tex**, install with `pip install \"pix2tex[gui]\"`. Example:\n\n```python\nimport pix2tex\npredictor = pix2tex.Predictor()\nlatex_out = predictor(image)\n```\n\nFor **Surya**: install `pip install surya-ocr` and use:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom surya.texify import TexifyPredictor\npredictor = TexifyPredictor()\nout = predictor([image])\nprint(out)\n```\n\nTo process via CLI: `surya_latex_ocr /path/to/crops`.\n\nMake sure to pre-process images (e.g., crop, binarize). Add validation using KaTeX, MathJax, or **SymPy**."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 13m 28s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-a767c7ef-7b23-4d05-96a4-8cf3664987f1:IN","parent_id":"aa6945cd-2ba7-46bd-80ef-82512242bef6","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_6989c0d8b318819197c720f5af384f43","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"6989c0d8-b75c-839b-9b00-f0f424446cd6","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T11:11:21.188956Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"aa6945cd-2ba7-46bd-80ef-82512242bef6","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"a767c7ef-7b23-4d05-96a4-8cf3664987f1","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"c66d6ec0-395d-4177-8f53-307f853dcd31","finished_duration_sec":808,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aa6945cd-2ba7-46bd-80ef-82512242bef6","children":["87bd4d74-62d5-456f-9f19-2114232986bf"]},"87bd4d74-62d5-456f-9f19-2114232986bf":{"id":"87bd4d74-62d5-456f-9f19-2114232986bf","message":{"id":"87bd4d74-62d5-456f-9f19-2114232986bf","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770636290.211566,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If your pipeline is:\n\n1) **crop out diagrams/graphs** (so the image mostly contains text + equations), then  \n2) **feed cropped PNGs** to a model to get **LaTeX source**,\n\nthen \u201cmost optimal\u201d depends on **what\u2019s inside each crop** (pure equation vs mixed text+math) and on constraints (offline vs cloud, cost, speed).\n\nBelow are the best practical choices for *your exam-paper style pages* (fractions, superscripts, radicals;

We need to suggest tools that can convert images of matrices to LaTeX style, like \\begin{pmatrix} for matrices and \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc|c} for augmented matrices. Pix2tex could be a good option, as it's trained on LaTeX formula images.\n\n**Evaluating matrix recognition tools**\n\nFor recognizing matrices and math symbols, I\u2019m considering tools like Mathpix for multi-line matrices, InftyReader for offline commercial use, or \"pix2tex\" for formula detection. Open-source options like \"TrOCR\" and \"LaTeX-OCR\" might help too. I think I\u2019ll look up the latest tools to see if something new could work better for the user.\n\n**Verifying optimal packages for current recommendations**\n\nThe user asked for recommendations on the \"most optimal packages,\" which could imply the need for updated info. Since this is related to software, updates might exist since August 2025. To make sure I give the most up-to-date advice, I\u2019ll likely check the latest info to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Verifying package recommendations with up-to-date info**\n\nEven though we have file attachments, the policy requires searching for anything after the knowledge cutoff (August 2025). Since new models could impact recommendations, we should check for updates on tools like Pix2tex or Mathpix. I\u2019ll use the web tool, making sure to include citations and file references.\n\n**Explaining the best approach for matrix rendering**\n\nThe user might expect a single package for rendering matrices and tables into LaTeX, but these tasks can be tricky\u2014matrices are like tables, and OCR often struggles with column counts and alignment. A more reliable approach would involve detecting matrix regions, binarizing, segmenting, and using OCR for each cell. We can recommend: Mathpix for end-to-end solutions, Pix2tex for mixed content, and \"layoutparser\" with OCR tools for tables and matrices.\n\n**Analyzing LaTeX challenges for row operations and symbols**\n\nThe a1.pdf file contains row operation notations and underlined pivot entries. These underlines and symbols like arrows can be tricky to convert to LaTeX accurately. I\u2019ll investigate the pages, especially page 9, to see how to best encode them, likely using commands like `\\underline{}` and `\\to` for arrows, using some image processing for better precision.\n\n**Rendering pages for inspection**\n\nI\u2019ll render pages 8 or 9 from the PDF, where the RREF forms appear, to inspect the content more closely. By loading the pages and creating images, I can better analyze how to handle row operations and special symbols like underlines and arrows for LaTeX rendering.\n\n**Saving and opening page for review**\n\nI\u2019ll save the image of page 9 as a PNG for easier inspection. Then, I\u2019ll open it to quickly examine it in the analysis. This will help me review the visual aspects, like underlines and row operations, and decide how best to handle them in LaTeX.\n\n**Recognizing matrices and special characters**\n\nWe need to recognize matrices, arrays, and symbols like underlined pivot points and vertical bars. The approach could be:\n\n1. Use image-to-LaTeX models like pix2tex or Mathpix, which handle matrices well but may struggle with large arrays and certain details like underlines.\n   \n2. For better reliability, segment the structure explicitly using methods like table extraction, cell-level OCR, and handling augmented matrices with OpenCV. This ensures more accuracy.\n\n**Optimized OCR for complex math expressions**\n\nFor OCR of cells, I\u2019ll use math-specific OCR for fractions, like pix2tex, and standard OCR for simple numbers or variables. The ideal solution combines OpenCV, PaddleOCR or Tesseract for digits, and pix2tex for complicated symbols. For validation, tools like SymPy or a LaTeX parser could help, and I could format output with pylatexenc. Also, I should inspect page 15 for pivot point diagrams containing symbols like circles and stars.\n\n**Recognizing special matrix symbols for LaTeX rendering**\n\nThe matrix includes symbols like \u2297 (circled times), asterisks, ellipsis, and vertical/horizontal lines for pivot points and nonzero elements. These need to be recognized and properly rendered in LaTeX (e.g., `\\otimes`, `*`, `\\cdots`). While end-to-end OCR might struggle with diagrams, the user's crop suggestion should simplify this. They're aiming for LaTeX representations like `\\begin{pmatrix} \\otimes & * & \\cdots \\\\ 0 & ... \\end{pmatrix}` for matrices with special entries.\n\n**Handling matrix structure and special symbols for LaTeX**\n\nMath symbols like `\\otimes` can be recognized by tools like Mathpix or pix2tex, though structure (like augmented matrices, underlines, and bars) is a bigger challenge. For high-fidelity recognition, Mathpix or InftyReader work best. In open-source, combining formula models with custom segmentation is effective, but large matrices may still struggle. Scanned high-quality math typesetting benefits most from segmentation. They can't use OCR for this PDF since it's image-only.\n\n**Exploring PDF-to-LaTeX tools for matrix recognition**\n\nThere are tools like Mathpix\u2019s PDF-to-LaTeX or LaTeXML for converting PDFs, but the user plans to crop images for PNG output. Since I\u2019m not running tests, I won\u2019t create downloadable files but will provide code blocks. I\u2019ll also confirm the packages (like pix2tex) and gather relevant citations using web.run.\n\n**Exploring OCR packages and LaTeX output**\n\nThe user asked about OCR packages, and I\u2019m considering options like InftyReader for offline math OCR, which handles matrices. I need to gather more information about its ability to output LaTeX, and check for any commercial and open-source alternatives. I\u2019ll need to cite appropriate web sources for this.\n\n**Recommending optimal OCR packages for math**\n\nThe user needs a solution for clean math with matrices and special symbols. I can suggest a few options: cloud-based Mathpix, commercial offline InftyReader, and open-source Pix2Tex or PaddleOCR with table structure recognition. Each has pros and cons. Important: segmentation may be most relevant, especially for matrix structures.\n\n**Handling OCR for multi-line arrays and matrices**\n\nOCR models sometimes output code like `\\begin{array}{...}` instead of `bmatrix`. For detecting matrix structures, it may be better to use tools like PaddleOCR for table recognition to extract layout and then apply formula recognition to each cell. Pix2Text might also handle matrices, but Mathpix is the best for high fidelity.\n\n**Addressing formatting nuances in math OCR**\n\nThe user mentioned \"clean math like this\" referring to a specific PDF, which includes augmented matrices with vertical bars, underlined entries, and RREF diagrams. These features require OCR tools that can handle special characters, such as underlines and ellipses. For row echelon form, symbols like \u2297 or * can be tricky, and text OCR might be needed for formulas. I should note the difference between matrix and array environments in LaTeX.\n\n**Handling matrix formatting and special symbols in OCR**\n\nFor augmented matrices, postprocessing is needed to ensure proper LaTeX formatting for column alignment and special symbols (like `\u2297`). OCR tools might misinterpret certain symbols, so it's essential to validate output and adjust formatting. Mathpix and LaTeX-OCR are strong options. The user seems to focus on handling matrices, arrays, and symbols like in REF/RREF forms.\n\n**Creating a pipeline for math OCR of matrices/arrays**\n\nFor matrices and arrays, generic image-to-LaTeX tools can struggle compared to simpler formulas. Recommended options include:\n\n- **Mathpix API**: Best accuracy for complex content but paid.\n- **InftyReader**: Offline, good for STEM but lower accuracy.\n- **Pix2Text (P2T)**: Free and solid for tables in Markdown with LaTeX.\n- **PaddleOCR**: Processes tables with formula recognition.\n\nSuggested pipeline: crop and classify regions, use table structure for matrices, OCR formulas, and validate LaTeX output.\n\n**Recommending packages for LaTeX rendering from cropped images**\n\nTo convert PNG images to LaTeX with minimal effort: Try **Mathpix** for optimal accuracy or **Pix2Text** as an open-source alternative. For offline/unpaid options, expect some errors, especially with matrices. Keep in mind that **REF** and **RREF** involve augmented matrices. Also, note that perfect LaTeX for matrices often requires postprocessing.\n\n**Summarizing optimal solutions for LaTeX rendering of matrices/arrays**\n\nMathematical OCR can be tricky for matrices/arrays since they are essentially tables; Naive formula OCR can disrupt the column structure. Here's a breakdown of options:\n\n1. **Cloud-based:** Mathpix excels with mixed content \u2014 recommended for matrices.\n2. **Offline commercial:** InftyReader works best with high DPI scans.\n3. **Open-source:** Pix2Text handles both tables and formulas with LaTeX conversion.\n4. **Formula-only:** Pix2tex and RapidLaTeXOCR are great for individual formulas, but struggle with larger matrices."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 16m 42s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-centralindia-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-a3d48b77-7c23-44a2-a2e3-4efd0bbc8e19:IN","parent_id":"cafe6820-3a70-4898-9fe6-f30d2eb37392","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_6989c64b49fc8191bf0522c139375ea7","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"6989c64b-4afc-839e-b7ab-70e7cd8f9e24","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T11:34:35.756266Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"cafe6820-3a70-4898-9fe6-f30d2eb37392","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"a3d48b77-7c23-44a2-a2e3-4efd0bbc8e19","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"2afe0a04-952f-4ead-9f68-9ce4ad8ed96b","finished_duration_sec":1002,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cafe6820-3a70-4898-9fe6-f30d2eb37392","children":["2b3b584d-bee7-46b0-8e87-c2506e8ef703"]},"2b3b584d-bee7-46b0-8e87-c2506e8ef703":{"id":"2b3b584d-bee7-46b0-8e87-c2506e8ef703","message":{"id":"2b3b584d-bee7-46b0-8e87-c2506e8ef703","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770637878.306215,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Matrices/arrays are where \u201cimage \u2192 LaTeX\u201d pipelines stop being plug\u2011and\u2011play.

PaddleOCR\u2019s table structure recognition module explicitly outputs HTML or LaTeX structure for tables. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \nAnd PaddleX/PaddleOCR also has a \u201cformula recognition\u201d module that outputs LaTeX/MathML for formulas. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search19\ue201\n\n### Why this beats end-to-end LaTeX OCR for matrices\nBecause **the hardest part of matrices is structure**, not symbol recognition. Once you know \u201cthis is a 3\u00d74 augmented matrix with a bar after col 3,\u201d turning per-cell tokens into:\n\n```tex\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\na_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & b_{1}\\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & b_{2}\\\\\na_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & b_{3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n```\n\nis almost mechanical.\n\n### Handling \u201cspecial characters\u201d in your REF/RREF pages\nFrom what appears in your PDF:\n- **Augmented bar `|`**: best treated as *structure* (array column spec `ccc|c`), not as a glyph you hope OCR gets right. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n- **Underlined pivot entries**: don\u2019t expect general OCR to preserve underline styling. If you truly need it, detect underlines with image processing and wrap those entries with `\\underline{\u2026}` during reconstruction.\n- **Symbols like `\u2297`, `\u22ef`, `*` inside matrices**: these are recognizable as math tokens (`\\otimes`, `\\cdots`, `*`) but end-to-end engines may confuse them; cell-level OCR improves your ability to sanity-check/override. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## My recommendation (based on your \u201cREF/RREF + special symbols + clean scans\u201d requirement)\n\nIf you want the **highest probability of correct LaTeX without building a bunch of custom logic**:\n- **Mathpix** for the OCR-to-LaTeX step. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\nIf you want **open-source** and can accept occasional fixes:\n- Start with **Pix2Text** as your baseline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- Use **pix2tex / RapidLaTeXOCR** only for crops that are clearly single-formula (no big arrays). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\nIf you want **correct matrices as a system requirement** (especially augmented matrices + pivot annotations):\n- Build the **structure+cell OCR pipeline** using:\n  - **PaddleOCR table structure recognition** for rows/cols, \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n  - plus a formula recognizer for each cell (PaddleX formula module, pix2tex, or even simple OCR if entries are just integers). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search19\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Two \u201cgotchas\u201d that matter more than the model for matrices\n1) **Crop with padding.** Tight crops clip parentheses/brackets/bars and destroy structure.\n2) **Normalize resolution.** For matrices, bumping to ~300\u2013600 DPI equivalent (or resizing up before inference) often helps because the model must separate closely spaced columns.\n\nIf you tell me which output you want for matrices:\n- `pmatrix/bmatrix` (no bars),\n- `array` with `|` (augmented),\n- and whether you *must* preserve pivot underlines,\n\nI can give you a concrete \u201cminimal moving parts\u201d Python stack (2\u20134 packages) and a reconstruction strategy that won\u2019t silently produce malformed LaTeX."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201","start_idx":751,"end_idx":772,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"2023-bs-sa2.pdf","id":"file_0000000076487208affbe9c7b29ff503","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"drug_file_reference":null,"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"f46969d8-f7e1-419b-9d4a-798f7fed5f16","file_index":1,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":1236,"end_idx":1283,"safe_urls":["https://docs.mathpix.com/","https://docs.mathpix.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://mathpix.com/convert","https://mathpix.com/convert?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://mathpix.com/docs/convert/endpoints","https://mathpix.com/docs/convert/endpoints?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/docs/convert/endpoints?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Convert API User Guide: All API endpoints","url":"https://mathpix.com/docs/convert/endpoints?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Go to v3/text developer docs ...
