\nForever yours, and you are mine.  \n\nAnd I shall love what you hold dear,  \nWish for the smiles you revere.  \nYour hand I grasp with faltering pace,  \nPlease lead me on to tomorrow's grace.  \n\nIf you have borne my bitter pain,  \nI'll live to be your joy again.  \nWith fearless heart, I'll forge ahead,  \nThrough vibrant days where dreams are fed.  \n\nYou are the river of time that flows,  \nThe sky where stars and embers glow.  \nI am the one who lifts my eyes,  \nAnd sings your name beneath these skies.  \n\nYou are my source, where I belong,  \nMy heart's safe harbor, steady and strong.  \nAll roads in life, both lost and known,  \nWill lead me back to you alone.  \n\nAnd I shall love what you hold dear,  \nWish for the smiles you revere.  \nYour hand I grasp with

where dreams are fed.  \n\nMountains stand still, the world moves on,  \nYet you still gaze at a brighter dawn.  \nThe children sleep in dreams so deep,  \nLike the love you sowed for them to keep.  \n\nAnd I shall dream the dreams you dreamed,  \nWish for the world where love redeems.  \nWalk on the path you once did tread,  \nFor such a love, my soul is fed.  \n\nAnd I shall see what you\u2019ve not seen,  \nWrite the poems of what you mean.  \nThe moon above, the thoughts I send,  \nWill keep you near, my timeless friend.  \n\nTogether we vow, with lives so clear,  \nLike your young face, unmarked by fear.
