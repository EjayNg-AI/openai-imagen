Additionally, China Southern reversed plans to replace older Boeing 787s, further underscoring shifting dynamics.\n\nBoeing, currently recovering from previous financial and reputational setbacks, views China as a crucial market.

These measures, driven by national security concerns regarding China's potential use of AI chips for supercomputing and military applications, extend prior restrictions by including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips. Chinese firms such as ByteDance and Alibaba had already placed $16 billion in orders for the H20 chips. The escalating trade tensions, part of President Trump's renewed tariff and export control policies, have led to sharp drops in semiconductor stock prices. Although Nvidia and AMD plan to apply for export licenses, approvals remain uncertain. Meanwhile, Trump has proposed using trade policies to promote domestic chip manufacturing, with Nvidia announcing a $500 billion investment in U.S.-based supercomputers over four years.

New Chinese export licensing restrictions on seven strategic rare earth elements\u2014samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium\u2014are expected to disrupt supply chains vital to the production of key US military systems such as F-35 jets, submarines, and smart weaponry. Analysts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and Chatham House warn that this could severely damage the US defense sector and compromise broader re-industrialization goals. China, which mines 70% and processes 90% of global rare earths, has indicated it could further leverage its dominance as a strategic tool in the geopolitical rivalry. Previous Chinese restrictions in similar disputes, such as with Japan in 2012, revealed the potential for rare earth prices to surge. The US has sought alternatives, including supplies from Ukraine and Greenland, but these efforts have faced challenges. Experts emphasize that America's dependence on Chinese rare earths has been a longstanding vulnerability, compounded by the environmental downsides of domestic production, which have kept U.S. output minimal or nonexistent.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2_fallback"},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1838,"end_idx":1839,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[],"status":"error","error":"Error running attribution","style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"\ue203","start_idx":1872,"end_idx":1873,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"The U.S. EV industry faces challenges due to its dependence on China for critical raw materials and components.","start_idx":1873,"end_idx":1984,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"The U.S. EV industry faces challenges due to its dependence on China for critical raw materials and components.","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"1839-1","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":1984,"end_idx":1985,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue203","start_idx":1986,"end_idx":1987,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"China's recent export restrictions exacerbate these supply chain issues.","start_idx":1987,"end_idx":2059,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"China's recent export restrictions exacerbate these supply chain issues.","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"1839-2","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"\ue204","start_idx":2059,"end_idx":2060,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news22\ue201","start_idx":2061,"end_idx":2079,"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":"([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-generate-6fd73550-1923-11f0-9c29-e3c2d5453208?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","type":"grouped_webpages_model_predicted_fallback","items":[{"title":"\u26a0\ufe0f New EV peril","url":"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-generate-6fd73550-1923-11f0-9c29-e3c2d5453208?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1744720836.0,"snippet":"The escalating U.S.-China trade war poses a critical threat to America's electric vehicle (EV) industry due to the U.S.'s dependence on China for vital raw materials, components, and refining technologies. While the Biden administration has invested in a domestic supply chain, it remains underdeveloped. China's recent export restrictions on critical minerals such as rare earth elements and graphite, essential for EV production, exacerbate supply chain challenges and risk stalling the U.S. transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles. Additionally, the AI industry faces scrutiny over its opaque and potentially high carbon footprint, with major tech companies withholding energy usage data. Trade tensions are also curbing global oil demand growth, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) slashing its 2025 forecast by 30%. Meanwhile, tech firms like Microsoft and Google are investing in carbon removal and geothermal projects to meet ambitious climate targets.

This move marks a shift from traditional trade policy to geopolitical strategy, echoing Cold War-era containment practices. Countries like Vietnam and Thailand, which facilitate Chinese exports, are under scrutiny, while broader demands may include restrictions on cheap Chinese imports. This hardline approach threatens the UK with a dilemma: align with US trade demands or risk punitive tariffs, potentially damaging crucial sectors like automotive and pharmaceuticals. Despite America's economic importance, the UK government under Labour has prioritized growth and sought closer ties with China, particularly in green energy. While a trade deal with the US is near, British leaders, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, are cautious about sacrificing post-Brexit economic sovereignty. The situation underscores growing tension between longstanding US alliances and emerging economic partnerships, revealing that the current \"special relationship\" offers few tangible benefits amid Washington\u2019s protectionist stance.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":2386,"end_idx":2387,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"US may soon force allies to take sides in trade war with China","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-may-soon-force-allies-to-take-sides-in-trade-war-with-china-0jwgw0xg6?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1744835100.0,"snippet":"The Trump administration is so erratic in its policy announcements that simply knowing if it really means what it says presents a considerable challenge.
