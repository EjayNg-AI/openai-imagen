is DBS\u2019 **current** (publicly stated) process and requirements for a **Singapore sole proprietorship** opening a business/corporate account (typically via **DBS SME Banking**, e.g. the DBS Business Multi-Currency Account). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n## 1) Procedure (what you actually do)\n1) **Pick the account variant**\n- If your business is **< 3 years old**: DBS markets the **DBS Business Multi-Currency Account \u2013 Starter Bundle** (S$10 monthly account fee; no monthly service charge). \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n- If your business is **\u2265 3 years old**: DBS markets the **DBS Business Multi-Currency Account** (annual account fee + monthly service charge unless you keep the required average balance). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n2) **Prepare key details**\n- DBS says to have your **UEN (Unique Entity Number)** and the **contact details of all account users** ready (e.g., authorised signers and DBS IDEAL users). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n3) **Apply online**\n- DBS\u2019 flow is: get ready \u2192 complete the online application \u2192 DBS emails your account access info after successful application. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n- If you can\u2019t find your entity during the \u201cACRA Details\u201d step, DBS suggests trying your name without suffixes; for newly registered entities, DBS notes it can take **2 working days** for details to be retrievable via ACRA search. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n4) **If you\u2019re not eligible for \u201cinstant opening\u201d**\n- DBS says Singapore-incorporated entities fully owned by Singapore citizens/PRs **may not need** to submit documents, but **some businesses will be asked for additional documents** per DBS\u2019 checklist (and DBS will contact you). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2) Documentation you may be asked for (sole proprietor)\nFrom DBS\u2019 **Account Opening Checklist** for *Sole Proprietor* (documents to bring if a visit is required): \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\n- **Original ID** (NRIC / Passport + FIN where applicable) of:\n  - the **sole proprietor**, and  \n  - all **authorised signatories**, **DBS IDEAL** approvers/admins, and any **power of attorney (POA)** holders. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **FATCA & CRS form** (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act / Common Reporting Standard) \u2014 to be signed by the **sole proprietor**. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **Proof of residential address** for relevant persons (examples listed by DBS include NRIC / utility bill / bank statement / government correspondence; DBS\u2019 examples specify **dated within last 3 months**). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue208  \n- **Proof of principal place of business** (only if different from the registered business address). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **Certified true copy** of a **resolution/minutes** for the **sole proprietor** (authorising account opening / mandates). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **Who must show up (if a visit is required):** DBS states the **sole proprietor must be present** with original ID. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\nDBS also states: **documents must be in English** and it **may request additional documents** depending on the setup. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 3) Minimum deposit, minimum balance, and common fees (DBS-stated)\n### DBS Business Multi-Currency Account (standard; typically \u2265 3 years in business)\nDBS states (on its SME pages):\n- **Minimum initial deposit:** **S$1,000** \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n- **Minimum average balance (to avoid fall-below/service charge):** **S$10,000** \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n- **Fall-below / monthly service charge:** **S$40** (waived if the average daily balance is at least S$10,000 or equivalent). \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n- **Account service / account fee:** **S$50 per year** (DBS presents this as an annual fee on its pages). \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\n**Important nuance for multi-currency:** DBS\u2019 pricing guide notes the minimum average daily balance for multi-currency accounts is determined based on **aggregated balances across all wallets** in the account. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view2\ue201  \n\n### DBS Business Multi-Currency Account \u2013 Starter Bundle (typically < 3 years in business)\nDBS states:\n- **Account fee:** **S$10 monthly**  \n- **Monthly service charge:** **S$0** \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \nDBS also flags higher **over-the-counter** charges for Starter Bundle (see below). \ue200cite\ue202turn12view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\n### Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions\nDBS states:\n- Standard Business Multi-Currency Account: **S$20 per OTC transaction** \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n- Starter Bundle: **S$40 per OTC transaction** \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n\n### Early account closure fee\nDBS pricing guide lists an **Account Closure Fee** of **S$50** if the account is closed **within 6 months** from date of opening. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 4) Other rules/regulatory points worth knowing\n- **Tax self-certification is not optional:** DBS explicitly requires the **FATCA & CRS** form for account opening checks (this is part of bank compliance). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- **Deposit Insurance (Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation):** SGD deposits are insured **up to S$100,000 per depositor per Scheme member bank**; foreign currency deposits are not insured. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search2\ue202turn10search10\ue201  \n  - SDIC also states that if you are a **sole proprietor**, insured deposits in your personal name are **aggregated** with insured deposits in the name of your **sole proprietorship** (for coverage calculation). \ue200cite\ue202turn10search4\ue201  \n- **If there are foreign beneficial owners / \u201cforeign beneficiaries\u201d:** DBS indicates a different application route and that additional documents may be required. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you tell me **(a)** how long your sole prop has been registered (<3 years vs \u22653 years) and **(b)** whether any owners/signers are **non-Singaporean/PR**, I can point you to the most fitting DBS account variant and the *most likely* documentation path (instant vs checklist)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn8view0\ue201","start_idx":229,"end_idx":257,"safe_urls":["https://www.dbs.com.sg/documents/276102/282858/account-opening-checklist.pdf/03c3e6fe-7bd1-bbeb-c1c3-67250c470a6b?t=1646793530425","https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/day-to-day/accounts/dbs-business-multi-currency-account"],"refs":[],"alt":"([DBS

for non-Starter, SGD cheque fees shown are **S$0.75 per cheque** (Starter has higher clearing fees). \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n\n## 2) Procedure (practical steps)\n1) **Get your basics ready**: your **UEN** and your **contact details** (mobile/email). DBS explicitly says to have UEN + contact details of account users on hand. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n2) **Apply online**: DBS positions this as a fully online application for eligible SG entities; you can save a draft and complete later. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n3) **Expect \u201cno-document\u201d onboarding most of the time \u2014 but be ready**: DBS says **Singapore-owned** entities **may not need to submit documents**, but **some businesses will be asked for additional documents per the checklist** (and DBS will contact you). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n4) **Timing if you want \u201cinstant\u201d setup**: DBS states that for **online account opening**, your business account and DBS IDEAL access are opened **instantly** for submissions between **6am\u201311pm**. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n5) **Fund and maintain balances**: transfer in the **initial deposit (usual S$1,000)** and decide whether you\u2019ll keep **\u2265 S$10,000 average daily balance** to avoid the **S$40/month** service charge. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n\n## 3) Documents you should prepare (even if online opening doesn\u2019t ask)\nDBS\u2019 **Sole Proprietor** checklist (for cases where a visit / documents are required) includes: \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- **Original NRIC** (you, as sole proprietor) \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- **FATCA & CRS self-certification** \u2014 **signed by the sole proprietor** \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- **Proof of residential address** (examples given; **dated within last 3 months**) \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- **Proof of principal place of business** **if different** from registered address \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- **Certified true copy of resolution / minutes (sole proprietor)** authorising account opening/mandate \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- **If a visit is needed:** DBS states the **sole proprietor must be present** with original ID. \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n\n## 4) Other rules / \u201cgotchas\u201d worth knowing\n- **Deposit insurance (Singapore):** SDIC insures **Singapore-dollar deposits up to S$100,000 per depositor per scheme member bank**; and **if you are a sole proprietor, deposits in your own name are aggregated with deposits in the sole proprietorship name** (for insurance calculation). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search4\ue201  \n- **Single-person control risk:** DBS publishes a **Risk Disclosure Statement for the Application of Single Control** (relevant when only one person can approve/admin changes). \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue201  \n  - DBS also explicitly recommends having **at least two DBS IDEAL administrators** for safer change approval (you may choose to ignore this because you operate solo, but understand it increases operational/fraud risk). \ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue201  \n- **Cash handling charges can kick in at branches:** cash acceptance machines are **waived**, but DBS lists thresholds and fees for branch deposits / cash deposit bags etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n- **PayNow pricing can be promotional/time-bounded:** DBS\u2019 pricing guide shows an \u201coutward PayNow lookup waived till 31 Dec 2025\u201d note\u2014so in **2026** you should treat PayNow lookups/fees as \u201cverify at point of application / latest guide\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue202turn12view0\ue201  \n- **Important reality check (legal):** a \u201cbusiness account\u201d helps accounting and professionalism, but it **does not give you limited liability** as a sole proprietor (your personal liability position is unchanged).\n\n## Quick \u201cdo this now\u201d checklist\n- \u2705 UEN + registered business details (ACRA)  \n- \u2705 NRIC + address proof (\u22643 months)  \n- \u2705 Be ready to sign **FATCA/CRS** + a **sole proprietor resolution/minutes** \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n- \u2705 Plan funding: **S$1,000 initial**; decide whether you\u2019ll park **S$10,000 ADB** to avoid the **S$40/month** charge \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- \u2705 Apply online during **6am\u201311pm** if you want the best chance of \u201cinstant\u201d setup \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\nIf you tell me whether you **need cheques** (some landlords still insist) and whether you expect **regular cash deposits**, I can point out which fees in DBS\u2019 pricing guide are most likely to hit you and how to structure deposits/transfers to minimise them."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201","start_idx":206,"end_idx":223,"safe_urls":["https://www.dbs.com.sg/sme/day-to-day/accounts/dbs-business-multi-currency-account"],"refs":[],"alt":"([DBS

It includes submission options: an online link shown on the form, **mail-in**, or **visit any POSB/DBS branch with your NRIC/Passport for verification**. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- The same form also states you should provide a **copy of a government-issued document** to support your tax residence info (e.g., identity card/passport/tax authority document). \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\n## 2) Can your residential address differ from the address on your NRIC?\n**DBS: yes, as long as your proof-of-address matches what you put on the application.**\n\nDBS\u2019 document guidance accepts **telecommunication bills** (and other documents) as proof of residential address, and says:\n- **Name and address should match your application form**, and  \n- the document must be **dated within 3 months**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search12\ue201  \n\nDBS\u2019 business account opening checklist similarly lists acceptable proofs (e.g., utility/phone bill, bank statement, government correspondence) **dated within last 3 months**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\n**But you should treat this as a KYC risk if your NRIC address is stale.**  \nSingapore rules require NRIC holders to **report a change of address within 28 days**. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search5\ue201 If you haven\u2019t updated it, do it\u2014banks can (and sometimes do) stall applications when core IDs don\u2019t align.\n\nIf you want the cleanest path: update your NRIC address via ICA\u2019s e-service (Singpass \u2192 submit \u2192 PIN mailer to new address \u2192 address sticker mailed). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n## 3) Your principal place of business is your current home (not your NRIC address)\nDBS\u2019 checklist requires **\u201cOriginal Proof of Principal Place of Business\u201d if it differs from the business registered address**, and defines principal place of business as where \u201cmind and management\u201d / senior management is located. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nSo if you operate from your current home:\n- Put that **current home address** as your \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d (if DBS asks), and  \n- be ready with **original proof** for that address (DBS doesn\u2019t hard-list the exact document types here, but it commonly aligns with the same class of documents they accept for address proof). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nAlso: if ACRA\u2019s records for you/your business still reflect old addresses, that mismatch can trigger extra questions. ACRA states changes (including **residential address** for business owners/authorised reps) must be updated in BizFile **within 14 days**, and late filing may attract a penalty. \ue200cite\ue202turn9search5\ue201\n\n## 4) How to get a \u201ccertified true copy\u201d of your sole proprietor resolution/minutes\n### Step 1 \u2014 Create the resolution/minutes (you draft it yourself)\nUse something like this (copy/paste and edit):\n\n```text\nSOLE PROPRIETOR\u2019S WRITTEN RESOLUTION\n(Authorising DBS Bank Account Opening and Mandate)\n\nBusiness Name: [YOUR REGISTERED BUSINESS NAME]\nUEN: [YOUR UEN]\nDate: [DD MMM YYYY]\n\nI, [FULL NAME], NRIC [SXXXXXXX], being the sole proprietor of the above business, RESOLVE THAT:\n\n1. Account Opening\n   The Business is authorised to open and maintain account(s) with DBS Bank Ltd (\u201cDBS\u201d),\n   including (as applicable) a DBS Business Multi-Currency Account and any related services.\n\n2. Authorised Signatory / Mandate\n   I, [FULL NAME], am appointed as the sole authorised signatory for the account(s).\n   The signing mandate shall be: \u201cAny 1 signatory to sign\u201d (i.e., myself only).\n\n3. Operating Authority\n   DBS is authorised to act on all instructions, applications, and documents in relation to the\n   account(s) when signed by me in accordance with the above mandate, including (as applicable)\n   internet banking/DBS IDEAL set-up, account maintenance requests, and payment instructions.\n\nSigned:\n\n_____________________________\n[YOUR FULL NAME]\nSole Proprietor\nNRIC: [SXXXXXXX]\nDate: [DD MMM YYYY]\n```\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 \u201cCertified True Copy\u201d: easiest is to let DBS do it\nDBS\u2019 checklist explains the rule:\n\n- **Bring the original**, or  \n- if you\u2019re submitting a copy, it must be **certified true** by an external certifier (e.g., **solicitor/lawyer/notary public/professional accountant/auditor/chartered secretary** in a FATF member country) **or by DBS bank staff**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n\nIt also specifies what the certification must include (this is what the certifier / bank staff should write/stamp):\n- the words **\u201cCertified True Copy\u201d**\n- certifier **name + signature**\n- **occupation/title**\n- **firm/company**\n- **date**\n- **country of practice**\n- **professional registration/ID number** (where applicable). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201\n\nSo the practical move is: **bring the original resolution/minutes to DBS**, and ask DBS staff to certify the photocopy after sighting the original.
