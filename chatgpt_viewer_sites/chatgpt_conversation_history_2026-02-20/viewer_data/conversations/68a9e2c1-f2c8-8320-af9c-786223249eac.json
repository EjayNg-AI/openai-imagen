Now, I've seen this question come up in a few different cases, but I decided to really take a look at it. To put everything in context with relation to artificial intelligence and robotics, acceleration is the default policy. Let me explain why. There are two primary reasons.\n\nFirst, geopolitics. The competition between America and China primarily is a huge economic and political driver. It's basically been accepted that whoever controls AI, or whoever wins the AI race, wins geopolitics for the foreseeable future\u2014basically for the next several decades, if not the century. That might be a little bit hyperbolic; we should expect another paradigm shift between now and a century from now, namely space flight. That might be the next big paradigm shift. The second factor that is basically making acceleration the default is demographics. This is a more hidden worry. If you look at a global map, basically every continent except for Africa is below population replacement level in terms of total fertility rate. Many nations already have the explicit policy of, we need to figure out how to take care of our elders, and let's do it with robots. Japan has been doing elder-care robots for a long time. But it's not just, how do you take care of the elders? It's, how do you keep the economy going? How do you keep the military going? So at a national level, basically every nation on the planet is concerned about demographic decline or demographic collapse. Therefore, acceleration is the default.\n\nLet me connect the dots, just in case it's not entirely obvious. When I say acceleration is the default, what I mean is that at a national level, all of these nations\u2014namely America, China, Japan, Korea, the places that are high-tech but also suffering from population decline or demographic decline\u2014are going to engage in political expediency. America is still growing, but that's mostly due to an influx of immigrants. Anyways, that means you're going to see political expediency, meaning that the government is going to take the side of businesses and acceleration and deregulation, because to follow the EU, which is to overregulate everything and really slow down innovation and investment, that's going to be really bad in the long run. It's bad in the short term because America is very pro-business, but it's bad in the long run because then you end up further and further behind. And in the case where you're basically in a race condition with aging, you cannot afford to really slow down because this is a decades-long thing, and it's a decades-long train wreck, basically. So you're going to get a lot of policies that favor acceleration in its various formats.\n\n### Avoiding an FTX-like Setback\n\nSo you might say, well, if we have these two gigantic forces that ensure that acceleration is the default policy, why would we need to accelerate faster? Isn't that irresponsible? And I will say yes. In fact, the things that could slow down AI and robots are irresponsible use. Let's talk about a couple of examples. Number one, we have a really good example of technology going sideways relatively recently, and it threw a big bucket of cold water on everything, and that is the FTX collapse. If you look at the stock prices of various blockchain and crypto companies and blockchain and crypto ETFs, many of them have not recovered to their pre-FTX levels. In a video that I made around that time, someone asked me, \"What does this mean?\" and I said, the well has been poisoned. It turns out that was a correct inference or interpretation of the events. If you don't remember, basically Sam Bankman-Fried, who ran FTX\u2014huge fraud, huge fraudster\u2014he's presently in prison for what he did, lost literally billions and billions of dollars' worth of crypto, and it was the most inept kind of way. It was a hot mess. That threw a bucket of cold water on investment dollars into crypto and blockchain, got the attention of regulators and everyone else, and when you have that much negative press, that entire industry has been set back literally years, and it has not yet fully recovered. So we need to avoid an FTX-like collapse for AI and robotics.\n\nOne thing that I want to point out is that AI has survived a lot of controversies already: education\u2014people like, what do we do about tests, what do we do about students using AI\u2014and even within education it's divided. A lot of educators are like, use the AI; this is the best technology that has come out to help education, whereas some are like, but what about tests\u2014who cares. Copyright lawsuits, artist revolts and strikes, AI \"psychosis,\" election interference\u2014AI has already survived a lot of controversies. So then you might ask the question, what are the controversies that might be an FTX-like event for artificial intelligence? I came up with two examples that I think would be big enough. Number one, jobs. We'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, but if jobs start going away, that is the quickest way to become the most unpopular technology in the history of mankind. Why? The way that I characterize it is that, particularly we Americans, we have Stockholm syndrome with our work. Don't take my job from me. Now, I need to clarify here that I believe we will get to a post-labor society where you don't need a job to make money. And I understand that in the meantime you need your job to make ends meet, because if you don't have a job\u2014I'm working too; I'm just working at home, in front of my camera at 7:00 in the morning\u2014you need a job to make ends meet; otherwise you end up homeless and hungry and that sort of thing. So I get it. I get that that's the way the world works right now. I don't think it's the way the world will always work. However, not everyone agrees with me and not everyone is on the same page. So what a lot of people see is CEOs and politicians and whoever else saying, we're going to lay off 10,000 people, or 11% of our workforce, and it's going to be AI. And even though the mainstream news is not really covering it, I repost it every time I see it, particularly over on Twitter. It's like, look, someone said the quiet part out loud. Jobs are going away due to AI. It's being automated away. And by the way, AI is just an automation technology; there are many other automation technologies. So if you take a bigger view and look at all automation technologies, the trend is really accelerating. That's one thing that could really sour the population on AI. And I think that maybe the 2028 presidential election or the 2030 midterms\u2014by then we'll probably really be feeling the bite of artificial intelligence and job layoffs. So those elections could be a total referendum on what our relationship with artificial intelligence should be.\n\nAnother thing that could really poison the well of artificial intelligence and automation is homegrown terrorists. What I mean is people using AI to create chemical weapons or bioweapons. Bio x-risk is one of the things that I actually agree with a lot of the doomers about: hey, these tools really dramatically lower the threshold of making chemical weapons and biological weapons. Now, I have looked into it, and a lot of the things that you need are very expensive equipment or very highly controlled reagents. One of the things is, just because the information is out there doesn't mean that it's automatically an information hazard. And this is me kind of tamping it down, saying, look, I'm not the only person that's looked into this. A lot of the sensitive equipment and a lot of the sensitive materials you need to be licensed for, and they are also very expensive and very tightly controlled already because the government, with all of its infinite wisdom, said, hey\u2014they go to law enforcement, they go to the FBI, CIA, they say, hey\u2014or actually those intelligence agencies often do this on their own\u2014they say, what if you had the recipe for this? How easy could it be to build an explosive device or chemical device or biological device? And they try it out in their own kitchen so they know how difficult it is. Anyways, AI might lower the threshold even further. So if either of those two things happens\u2014if we have a surge in unemployment, a surge in layoffs, and/or if there is a homegrown terrorist event where AI was a significant contributor to some catastrophic loss of life\u2014then people would rightly be very concerned about artificial intelligence and would vote against it, and we would end up with a very strong anti-AI sentiment, already stronger than what we've got. Right now there are pro-AI and anti-AI people, and it's more or less equal in the grand scheme of things, I think. When you look at internet debates now, polls show something else, where 60% of Americans are worried about AI and 70% hate AI and 80% think that robots are bad, whatever. But expressed-values polls are not a good way of getting revealed preferences, which is, someone might say, this is my value, but then what they do with their money or their votes can be very different. This is why it's almost impossible to predict elections.\n\n### Political Pendulum and Conclusion\n\nAnyways, speaking of elections, this is not a left versus right thing. Now, one thing that amuses me greatly about my audience is sometimes you people are like, \"Why are you so anti-Trump? Why are you so anti-liberal?\" The reason that you can't nail me down is because I don't like either side. Now, I'm not saying that I'm anti-political or I'm libertarian or anarchist. I just look at the system and say it's kind of messed up. So whichever team you\u2014excuse me. It's allergy season. So if I sound a little scratchy, that's why. It's raging here in North Carolina. Anyways, whichever side you go to bat for, great. You know what? I can see both sides have some points. Both sides have some things that are severely wrong with them. We don't need to relitigate that. It's been done plenty of times on every other podcast, on every other channel, etc., etc.\n\nNow, I do want to point out two very specific Achilles' heels on both sides of the political spectrum here in America. First, the GOP, the Republicans: their deregulation scheme that they're doing right now could come back to bite them in the butt. Here's what I mean by that. Right now the Trump administration has rescinded Biden's executive order on artificial intelligence. They've said explicitly, we're not going to regulate anything. Just go, go, go, go. What happens, though, is that means everything goes a little too far. The pendulum swings really far one direction, and then for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. So what happens if that pendulum swings so far that it gets deregulated to the point that there are copyright issues, there are labor strikes, whatever else happens; job layoffs start to accelerate. Then the population sours on it and the pendulum swings back the other way. So then what's the DNC going to do if this happens in 2028 or 2030? The Democrats are going to overregulate. And the biggest complaint I have about the Democrats, not to make it too political, is that they tend to engage in what is called performative legislation. They pass bills that feel good but are usually counterproductive. Two examples immediately come to mind. Number one, New York City banned the sale of dogs in pet stores, and ostensibly the reason was to cut down on puppy mills, but this is kind of an out-of-sight, out-of-mind thing. New York City is like, we're not going to sell dogs anymore, whether or not they're legitimate. And so what happens? All the legitimate businesses shut down, and now puppy mills are the only producers of dogs. That's one example. Another example is rent control. Rent control never works. Rent control reduces supply. If you want to look at areas or states where rents are going down, look at Texas. One of the reasons that rents are going down in Texas is because they're building like crazy. And if you have rent control, then nobody's incentivized to build. Nobody's even incentivized to maintain their buildings. Rent control is bad for everyone. But the Democrats love this kind of performative legislation. So what are they going to do? They're probably going to pass the same kind of, basically rent control for AI\u2014feel-good, warm-and-fuzzy legislation that actually just hurts everyone.\n\nWhat I'm here to say is that it doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum you're on. The government can mangle this either way. Both sides can mess it up. And therefore, while acceleration is the default, we can still snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. All right, that's my rant for the day. Thanks for watching.

But **one catastrophic event** (safety or labor) can still trigger synchronized policy shocks and capital pullback.\n\n**Concrete safeguards that actually speed adoption by de-risking it:**\n- **Pre-incident governance:** standardized *model cards*, evals against red-team suites, third-party audit trails (SOC-like), and incident reporting with safe-harbor protections.  \n- **Capability gating:** tiered controls by *compute + capability* (release gates, high-risk use approvals, dual-use reviews), with independent sign-off for bio/chemical domains.  \n- **Supply-chain hygiene:** provenance and content authenticity (e.g., C2PA), watermarking where workable, and robust data-governance pipelines to lower IP/privacy exposure.  \n- **Consumer-grade product safety:** clear disclaimers, fallback behaviors, and kill-switches for integrations (especially automation agents).  \n- **Separation of duties:** for agentic systems that can spend money, send messages, or control actuators, require multi-party authorization or hardware tokens.\n\nThese measures are not \u201cslowdowns\u201d; they are **trust accelerators**\u2014they reduce downside variance that scares boards, insurers, and regulators.\n\n## 3) Managing the labor shock (the most plausible poison-the-well risk)\n\nExpect **visible displacement** in clerical, customer support, basic programming/ops, and some creative pipelines well before equivalent job creation is obvious. If the public reads this as \u201cAI took my job,\u201d the policy reaction will be punitive.\n\n**Mitigations that scale and are defensible across parties:**\n- **Wage- and job-loss insurance** (portable, experience-rated), plus **rapid re-employment services** integrated with LLM tools.  \n- **Automation disclosure & impact assessments** for large firms (not a blanket ban): notify affected workers, offer reskilling stipends, and publish productivity metrics.  \n- **Shared-upside schemes:** profit-sharing or \u201cautomation dividends\u201d tied to measured productivity gains; tax credits contingent on worker participation.  \n- **Sectoral pacts** (healthcare, logistics, public sector) that set phased deployment targets with quality and safety KPIs, not headcount cuts alone.\n\nThese are cheaper\u2014and more politically robust\u2014than broad moratoria that stall competitiveness.\n\n## 4) Political whiplash: how to damp it\n\nWhiplash is likely if incidents outpace visible benefits. To reduce amplitude:\n- **Sunset + review clauses** in AI bills; pre-agreed metrics to renew/retire rules.  \n- **Regulatory sandboxes** with *graduated* scale limits; publish outcomes to build evidence.  \n- **Independent safety board** (multi-stakeholder) that issues nonbinding advisories quickly\u2014faster than courts, less blunt than statutes.  \n- **Cross-jurisdictional harmonization** on a few basics (incident reporting, eval disclosures, content provenance), leaving room for competition elsewhere.\n\n## 5) Scenarios & signposts (2025\u20132032)\n\n- **Baseline glide (most likely):** No mass-casualty misuse; steady adoption; rolling layoffs but offset by growth roles; regulation becomes sector-specific.  \n  *Watch:* insurer stances on AI liability, state AG actions, union settlements that incorporate AI clauses.  \n- **Shock-and-regulate:** A high-profile failure (safety or catastrophic deepfake) triggers emergency rules; open-ended liability chills enterprise pilots.  \n  *Watch:* congressional hearings after a major incident; insurer exclusions; abrupt vendor procurement freezes.  \n- **Capacity-constrained stall:** energy/compute/siting delays cap capability growth; policy risk remains secondary.  \n  *Watch:* grid interconnect queues, transformer and cooling lead times, HBM/advanced-packaging bottlenecks.  \n\n## 6) What would *actually* accelerate safely\n\nFor companies:\n- **Make safety a ship-blocker** with board-level accountability and publish a minimal **risk dashboard** (eval coverage, incidents, red-team residuals).  \n- **Quantify ROI** credibly\u2014tie deployments to measurable quality or cycle-time improvements; avoid \u201cheadcount first\u201d optics.  \n- **Human-in-the-loop by default** for actions with legal/financial/physical effect; phase out only with evidence.\n\nFor governments:\n- **Compute-tiered oversight** (not capability-blind bans), **incident safe harbors**, and **procurement that rewards audited systems**.  \n- **Labor cushions** (insurance + re-employment) funded partly by productivity gains, not payroll taxes alone.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\nThe thesis is broadly right: **macro forces point to continued acceleration**. The outcome hinges less on rhetorical politics and more on whether the ecosystem **contains tail risks** (labor and safety). If industry and policymakers jointly **lower downside variance**\u2014with credible evals, incident governance, and labor cushions\u2014acceleration not only persists; it **compounds**. If not, a single bad break can produce multi-year drag via regulatory whiplash and lost trust."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"973bc1953aa6ce4e-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"3c626ed5-148f-4f8b-b1fb-427517022a0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"3c626ed5-148f-4f8b-b1fb-427517022a0c","children":[]}}}
