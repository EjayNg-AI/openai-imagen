This scenario is especially prevalent among people who identify as **asexual** or fall along the asexual spectrum, but it can also apply more broadly.\n\nHere's a clear breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Romantic vs. Sexual Attraction**\n- **Romantic attraction** refers to the desire for emotional intimacy, companionship, affection, and closeness.\n- **Sexual attraction** specifically involves sexual desire or interest in engaging in sexual activities.\n- It is widely recognized that romantic and sexual attractions are distinct phenomena. One can exist without the other.\n\n### 2. **Aromantic vs. Asexual**\n- An **asexual** person does not experience sexual attraction but can still experience strong romantic attraction.  \n  - Example: An asexual individual may desire a deep, committed relationship involving emotional intimacy, shared experiences, and affection, but without a sexual component.\n- Conversely, an **aromantic** person experiences little to no romantic attraction, regardless of their sexual attraction status.\n- Someone could also be both aromantic and asexual, experiencing neither form of attraction.\n\n### 3. **Having a Romantic Concept Without Sexual Experience**\n- Individuals, especially younger ones or those who simply haven\u2019t had sexual experiences, commonly imagine or desire romantic relationships based purely on emotional and social cues from friendships, literature, media, or observing relationships around them.\n- Romantic concepts can evolve independently of personal sexual experience because romance and intimacy often center around emotional bonding, closeness, trust, and affection, none of which inherently require sexual interaction.\n\n### 4. **Real-World Scenarios**\n- Many individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, first develop romantic interests without having engaged in or even felt significant desire for sexuality.\n- Historically and culturally, various communities\u2014such as certain religious groups\u2014actively separate romantic and sexual experiences, promoting the idea that romantic bonds are valuable even in complete absence of sexual experience or desire.\n\n### 5. **Psychological and Social Perspectives**\n- From a psychological standpoint, the brain systems underlying attachment (emotional bonding), romantic love, and sexual attraction can operate independently, which scientifically supports why someone could envision romance without sexuality.\n- Social conditioning or personal belief systems can further reinforce a separation between romantic and sexual aspects of relationships.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nIt is entirely realistic and psychologically valid to have a nuanced concept of romantic involvement or deep emotional relationships, even in the total absence of sexual attraction, experience, or desire. This differentiation is widely recognized and accepted within both psychological research and social discussions about sexuality and relationships."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"3998ab81-4c5f-46d3-bdd1-9f740ba1dc76","request_id":"944a24046981410a-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3998ab81-4c5f-46d3-bdd1-9f740ba1dc76","children":["a9b7f7ef-f61f-4197-b889-ec9549ed8598"]},"a9b7f7ef-f61f-4197-b889-ec9549ed8598":{"id":"a9b7f7ef-f61f-4197-b889-ec9549ed8598","message":{"id":"a9b7f7ef-f61f-4197-b889-ec9549ed8598","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748062329.295,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["in adults what then distinguishes an asexual romantic commitment from a mere deep friendship?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"944a2e988ccd410a-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2ab3792b-980e-4f5e-8e29-3f6a0c80f2dc","children":["17fb41f5-bd3c-4482-a22e-6cc7102bc29f"]},"17fb41f5-bd3c-4482-a22e-6cc7102bc29f":{"id":"17fb41f5-bd3c-4482-a22e-6cc7102bc29f","message":{"id":"17fb41f5-bd3c-4482-a22e-6cc7102bc29f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748062330.029891,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The distinction between an **asexual romantic commitment** and a **deep friendship** in adults lies primarily in the intent, emotional depth, relationship dynamics, expectations, and social recognition of the relationship. While boundaries can sometimes be blurred, several aspects typically differentiate the two:\n\n### 1. **Emotional Intensity and Exclusivity**\n- **Romantic Commitment (Asexual):**  \n  Usually involves a uniquely intense emotional bond. Partners see each other as their primary emotional connection, sharing vulnerabilities and intimacy at a deeper, often exclusive level. This partnership may mirror traditional romantic relationships, minus sexual attraction.\n  \n- **Deep Friendship:**  \n  Although profound and emotionally rich, friendships often allow emotional openness with multiple friends. Exclusivity is usually less common or less formally articulated.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Life Partnership and Commitment**\n- **Romantic Commitment (Asexual):**  \n  Often involves shared long-term goals, commitment, cohabitation, financial interdependence, and mutual support in life decisions. It's common to formally acknowledge the commitment (e.g., marriage, civil partnership).\n  \n- **Deep Friendship:**  \n  May involve strong mutual support but typically does not involve the same long-term life-planning commitment or formal recognition.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Physical and Non-sexual Intimacy**\n- **Romantic Commitment (Asexual):**  \n  May still involve affectionate physical intimacy, such as cuddling, hand-holding, or kissing, reflecting emotional closeness beyond mere friendship.\n  \n- **Deep Friendship:**  \n  Physical affection typically remains limited or socially differentiated (e.g., hugs, casual touching). More intimate or consistent physical gestures usually suggest something beyond friendship.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Social Recognition and Expectation**\n- **Romantic Commitment (Asexual):**  \n  Socially recognized as a couple, often implying a deeper partnership and a publicly acknowledged union. Society typically understands and acknowledges their commitment as something akin to traditional romantic relationships.\n  \n- **Deep Friendship:**  \n  Usually recognized as friendship without implicit assumptions of romantic pairing or deeper relational expectations by society.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Identity and Labels**\n- **Romantic Commitment (Asexual):**  \n  Individuals often explicitly identify as romantic partners and may use terms like \"boyfriend,\" \"girlfriend,\" \"partner,\" \"spouse,\" or similar labels.\n  \n- **Deep Friendship:**  \n  Individuals generally identify simply as \"friends,\" avoiding labels traditionally associated with romance or partnership.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Mutual Expectations and Boundaries**\n- **Romantic Commitment (Asexual):**  \n  Usually involves clearly communicated expectations regarding mutual responsibility, fidelity (emotional or otherwise), future planning, cohabitation, and relational boundaries typical of romantic relationships.\n  \n- **Deep Friendship:**  \n  Boundaries and expectations typically allow greater independence, more freedom regarding emotional or social engagement outside the friendship, and less explicit mutual obligation.\n\n---\n\n### Illustrative Examples:\n- **Asexual romantic commitment**: Two people who choose to marry, live together, openly call each other \"partner,\" share long-term life plans, hold hands, or cuddle, but experience no sexual attraction or desire.\n  \n- **Deep friendship**: Lifelong best friends who support each other emotionally, occasionally live together as roommates, frequently socialize and depend on each other, but maintain separate life plans, do not share romantic gestures like hand-holding or sustained intimate physical closeness, and identify socially explicitly as friends.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhat distinguishes an **asexual romantic relationship** from a **deep friendship** is the depth, nature, and exclusivity of the emotional bond; the intentional partnership in life; the presence of romantic intimacy (non-sexual but still intimate); explicit identification as partners; clear mutual expectations; and societal acknowledgment of their status as a committed, romantic pair rather than friends."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"a9b7f7ef-f61f-4197-b889-ec9549ed8598","request_id":"944a2e988ccd410a-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a9b7f7ef-f61f-4197-b889-ec9549ed8598","children":[]}}}
