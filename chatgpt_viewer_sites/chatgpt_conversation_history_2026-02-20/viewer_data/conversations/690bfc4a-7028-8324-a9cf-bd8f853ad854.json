Below is a curated list of **widely discussed works** (published or preprints in 2025) that introduced novel architectures, training paradigms, agent frameworks, or breakthrough applications. Each entry includes the paper title, authors/source, venue or preprint info, and a brief overview of key contributions and why it\u2019s considered promising.\n\n1. **Llama 4 (Meta AI, 2025)** \u2013 *Meta AI Research Team* \u2013 *Open Source Model Release (April 2025).* Meta\u2019s **Llama\u00a04** is a landmark open-source LLM that is *natively multimodal* (handling text, images, etc.) and utilizes a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** transformer architecture for massive scale-up\u301025\u2020L109-L117\u3011. The Llama\u00a04 *Scout* variant (17B active params, 109B total) boasts an unprecedented **10 million token context window**, a huge leap from Llama\u00a03\u2019s 128K-token limit\u301025\u2020L75-L83\u3011. The larger *Maverick* model (17B active, 400B total with 128 experts) supports **1 million tokens** of context and *native vision-text fusion*, and it reportedly *outperforms* comparable models (e.g. GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Gemini) on coding, reasoning, multilingual understanding, and image-based tasks\u301025\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Llama\u00a04 introduces technical innovations like early-fusion multimodal layers, an interleaved rope (iRoPE) positional scheme for long contexts, and FP8 precision training for efficiency\u301025\u2020L117-L125\u3011. Notably, **Scout and Maverick were released openly**, reflecting Meta\u2019s commitment to open research\u301023\u2020L203-L209\u3011. Llama\u00a04\u2019s combination of *MoE scaling* (up to a 2 trillion\u2013parameter \u201cBehemoth\u201d teacher model) and extreme context length chart new territory for LLM capabilities, making it a foundation for further innovation in the community.\n\n2. **Gemma\u00a03 Technical Report (Gemma Team, 2025)** \u2013 *Aishwarya Kamath et al. (Google DeepMind)* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, Mar\u00a02025*. **Gemma\u00a03** is a family of \u201clightweight\u201d open foundation models (1B\u201327B parameters) introduced as an update to Google\u2019s Gemma series\u301037\u2020L117-L125\u3011. This generation adds **vision-language** capabilities, broader multilingual support, and a **long context window (\u2265128K tokens)**\u301037\u2020L117-L124\u3011. To handle long inputs efficiently, the authors **modified the Transformer architecture** by increasing the ratio of local-attention layers (shorter spans) versus global layers, greatly reducing memory growth from the key-value cache\u301037\u2020L119-L127\u3011. Gemma\u00a03 models were trained with extensive **distillation**, and a novel post-training recipe that significantly boosts math reasoning, chat proficiency, instruction following, and multilingual accuracy\u301037\u2020L123-L131\u3011. Impressively, the 4B-parameter Gemma\u00a03 (instruction-tuned) nearly matches the performance of the previous 27B model, and the 27B Gemma\u00a03 **rivals much larger proprietary models** (e.g. \u201cGemini-1.5-Pro\u201d) on benchmarks\u301037\u2020L123-L131\u3011. All Gemma\u00a03 models have been openly released\u301037\u2020L125-L129\u3011, and their strong performance with *efficient architecture tweaks* (for long contexts) plus *training improvements* makes this work a promising path toward more accessible yet high-performing LLMs\u301037\u2020L125-L129\u3011.\n\n3. **DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning in LLMs via RL (DeepSeek-AI, 2025)** \u2013 *Xuanyu Wang et al.* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, Jan\u00a02025*. **DeepSeek-R1** is a new large reasoning model that demonstrates the power of *pure reinforcement learning* (RL) to teach an LLM to \u201cthink.\u201d Starting from a base model, the team applied thousands of RL training steps (with carefully designed rewards) **without any supervised fine-tuning** \u2013 the resulting model, *DeepSeek-R1-Zero*, *naturally emerged* with powerful reasoning behaviors (albeit with some quirks)\u301016\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u301016\u2020L81-L89\u3011. They then introduced a multi-stage pipeline (\u201ccold-start\u201d supervised data + RL + rejection-sampling fine-tuning) to refine these skills, yielding **DeepSeek-R1** which achieves reasoning performance *comparable to OpenAI\u2019s proprietary* \u201co1\u201d series models\u301016\u2020L21-L25\u3011. Notably, RL-trained DeepSeek-R1-Zero dramatically improved on a math word-problem benchmark (AIME 2024) \u2013 boosting pass@1 accuracy from **15.6% to 71.0%**, and up to 86.7% with ensemble voting, *matching OpenAI\u2019s level*\u301016\u2020L85-L93\u3011. The final DeepSeek-R1 model maintains these gains while fixing issues like readability and language-mixing via a small supervised \u201ckickstart\u201d before RL\u301016\u2020L91-L100\u3011. Perhaps most impactful, the authors **open-sourced DeepSeek-R1** along with **six distilled models** (ranging 1.5B\u201370B parameters) derived from it\u301016\u2020L21-L25\u3011. By releasing a high-performing reasoning LLM and demonstrating a novel *RL-first training paradigm*, this work has sparked considerable excitement in the open-source AI community.\n\n4. **Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI (Belc\u00e1k et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Peter Belc\u00e1k et al. (NVIDIA)* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, Jun\u00a02025*. This influential position paper argues that for many AI **agent** applications, we should swap giant general models for networks of **specialized \u201csmall\u201d language models (SLMs)**. The authors define an SLM as a model that *runs on common consumer hardware with single-user latency* \u2013 roughly in the 3B\u201310B parameter range\u301019\u2020L59-L67\u3011. They contend that **SLMs are \u201csufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical\u201d for many repetitive or focused tasks in agentic systems**, compared to relying on one gargantuan LLM\u301020\u2020L61-L69\u3011. For instance, autonomous agents often break tasks into subtasks (API calls, formatting outputs, simple reasoning) that do *not* require billions of weights \u2013 experiments show that fine-tuned SLMs already excel at such targeted duties\u301019\u2020L87-L95\u3011. Crucially, SLMs are *faster and cheaper*: deploying a 5B model for a step instead of a 70B one can be **10\u201330\u00d7 more efficient in speed and cost**\u301019\u2020L91-L99\u3011. The paper outlines a practical **hybrid architecture** where many subtasks are handled by SLM \u201cassistants,\u201d while a larger LLM is reserved only for the most complex decisions\u301019\u2020L99-L107\u3011\u301019\u2020L113-L121\u3011. This division of labor improves reliability (small models are easier to control and fine-tune) and reduces infrastructure load. By articulating a clear vision and migration path (logging tasks, clustering them, fine-tuning small models, etc.), this work has sparked discussion and follow-up work on building **multi-agent systems** that combine specialized mini-LLMs \u2013 a potentially transformative shift in how we design AI agents\u301019\u2020L149-L157\u3011.\n\n5. **GenSI MemAgent: Long-Context LLM with RL-Based Memory (Wang et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Yuzhong Wang et al.* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, July\u00a02025*. The **MemAgent** paper tackles one of the hardest challenges for LLMs: efficiently handling *extremely long documents and dialogues*. The authors propose an *agent-like workflow* for a language model to ingest text in **segments** and incrementally **overwrite a fixed-length memory**, rather than processing a whole document at once\u30102\u2020L315-L323\u3011. This memory mechanism \u2013 trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning \u2013 allows the model to **retain crucial information and discard irrelevant details** much like human note-taking\u30102\u2020L331-L339\u3011. The results are astounding: MemAgent achieves **nearly lossless performance when scaling from an 8K token context to a 3.5\u00a0million token context**, with under 5% performance drop and *over 95% accuracy* on a 512K-token evaluation\u30102\u2020L324-L332\u3011. In other words, it breaks the \u201ccontext ceiling\u201d of standard transformers and can effectively reason over book-length (or longer) text. The agent\u2019s memory updates are guided by an RL reward that encourages preserving details that help answer questions later. Empirically, MemAgent **outperforms state-of-the-art long-context LLMs** on tasks such as QA, tracking variables through text, and information extraction\u30102\u2020L345-L353\u3011. Importantly, this approach *does not require architectural changes* to the underlying transformer \u2013 the memory is stored as part of the prompt \u2013 making it **compatible with existing models**\u30102\u2020L347-L355\u3011. By solving the long-context bottleneck in a principled way, MemAgent is seen as a breakthrough toward LLM-based **agents with lifelong reading and reasoning abilities**, enabling applications like processing entire books or multi-year conversational histories\u30102\u2020L354-L361\u3011\u30102\u2020L363-L370\u3011.\n\n6. **AI Research Agents for Machine Learning (Toledo et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Edan Toledo et al. (Meta FAIR & collaborators)* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, Jul\u00a02025*. This paper introduces a novel paradigm: autonomous **\u201cAI research agents\u201d** that can perform the full cycle of developing and tuning ML models, evaluated on a benchmark called **MLE-bench**\u30102\u2020L245-L253\u3011. The authors formalize the problem as an agent navigating a search space of code edits and model training runs to maximize performance on a given task (framed like Kaggle competitions). A key insight is separating the agent\u2019s **search strategy** (e.g. greedy search, MCTS, evolutionary search) from its toolkit of **operators** \u2013 atomic actions like writing an initial solution, debugging errors, improving code, leveraging memory, or recombining solutions\u30102\u2020L247-L253\u3011\u30102\u2020L256-L264\u3011. Through extensive experiments, they find that the *choice and design of operators* is even more critical than the search algorithm\u30102\u2020L256-L264\u3011. With a rich operator set, their best agent achieved **47.7% success** on a suite of ML problems (solving nearly half to a winning standard) \u2013 a notable jump from 39.6% by previous approaches\u30102\u2020L263-L270\u3011. This is effectively *state-of-the-art automated ML research performance* on the benchmark. The paper also introduces **AIRA-dojo**, a scalable open platform for training and evaluating such research agents, enabling reproducible experiments on this new frontier\u30102\u2020L277-L284\u3011. Overall, this work is promising because it charts a path toward **agent-based AI development** \u2013 systems that could autonomously try out model improvements, tuning, and debugging, potentially **accelerating innovation in ML** itself\u30102\u2020L294-L302\u3011. It has spurred interest in the community to build on the framework and explore more sophisticated agent behaviors for automating research.\n\n7. **Dynamic Chunking for Hierarchical Sequence Modeling (Hwang et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Sukjun Hwang, Brandon Wang, Albert Gu* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, July\u00a02025*. This paper proposes **H-Net**, a new architecture that challenges the longstanding need for **tokenization** in language models. Instead of using a fixed tokenizer (e.g. BPE) to pre-segment text, H-Net learns to **dynamically \u201cchunk\u201d raw text** into meaningful units as part of a multi-scale neural network\u30104\u2020L381-L389\u3011. The model processes input bytes with an encoder, **segments them on the fly** into chunks, feeds these to a higher-level model, and can iterate this hierarchically. The result is an *end-to-end* system that replaces the traditional tokenize\u2013LM\u2013detokenize pipeline with one learned model\u30104\u2020L381-L389\u3011. Remarkably, at equal compute budget, a 1-layer H-Net (one level of learned chunking) **outperforms a strong Transformer LM using BPE tokens** on standard language tasks\u30104\u2020L389-L397\u3011. Stacking multiple chunking stages yields even bigger gains: a 2-level H-Net matched a token-based Transformer *twice its size* by leveraging the extra hierarchy to capture abstraction\u301035\u2020L25-L34\u3011\u301035\u2020L27-L34\u3011. H-Net also shows much greater robustness to character-level noise and can naturally adapt to **languages or data with no good tokenizer** (e.g. Chinese text, code, DNA sequences) \u2013 in such cases it achieves up to **4\u00d7 better data efficiency** than token-based baselines\u30104\u2020L405-L413\u3011. In short, dynamic chunking enables true end-to-end learning from raw text, avoiding the biases and limitations of fixed vocabularies. This is considered a foundational innovation: it suggests that future large models might **learn their own discrete representations** and thereby generalize and scale even better\u30104\u2020L413-L419\u3011. H-Net\u2019s advances in efficiency and performance without tokenization open a new research direction in model architecture design.\n\n8. **REFRAG: Rethinking RAG-Based Decoding (Lin et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Xiaoqiang Lin et al. (Meta & collaborators)* \u2013 *arXiv Preprint, Oct\u00a02025*. The **REFRAG** framework offers a breakthrough in how large language models handle **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** \u2013 i.e. when the model is given external documents or knowledge. Normally, feeding a lot of retrieved text into an LLM causes *huge latency* and memory usage due to the quadratic cost of self-attention over a long prompt. REFRAG solves this by **compressing and sparsifying the retrieved context before decoding**\u301031\u2020L23-L31\u3011\u301031\u2020L97-L105\u3011. Specifically, it breaks retrieved passages into fixed-size chunks (e.g. 16 tokens each) and passes them through a lightweight encoder to get dense *chunk embeddings*\u301030\u2020L7-L15\u3011. During LLM decoding, these embeddings (which are much shorter sequences) are used in place of raw text. A small RL-trained policy decides when a particular chunk is critical and needs to be fully \u201cexpanded\u201d (fed as real tokens) versus when the embedding approximation is sufficient\u301030\u2020L13-L21\u3011. By **feeding compressed representations** and only expanding important parts, REFRAG **slashes the effective prompt length** and exploits the inherent sparsity (many retrievals are irrelevant)\u301031\u2020L25-L34\u3011\u301031\u2020L99-L107\u3011. The results are dramatic: Meta reports **up to 30\u00d7 faster** time-to-first-token and about **6\u20137\u00d7 higher throughput** for long-context inference, *without* any drop in answer quality\u301027\u2020L213-L221\u3011\u301030\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Moreover, REFRAG can *extend a model\u2019s usable context window* by roughly 16\u00d7, since the model only \u201csees\u201d compressed embeddings but can still integrate far more knowledge than before\u301027\u2020L213-L221\u3011. Importantly, this is a **model-agnostic, plug-and-play decoder** \u2013 it requires *no changes to the LLM\u2019s architecture or weights*, making it easy to adopt\u301030\u2020L23-L30\u3011\u301030\u2020L25-L33\u3011. REFRAG is viewed as a significant innovation for building **scalable QA systems and agents** that need to consume large knowledge bases quickly. By decoupling context length from latency so effectively, it paves the way for more **efficient long-context and retrieval-heavy applications** in practice.\n\n9. **Beyond Browsing: API-Based Web Agents (Song et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Yueqi\u00a0Song, Frank\u00a0F. Xu, Shuyan\u00a0Zhou, Graham\u00a0Neubig* \u2013 *ICLR\u00a02025 (preprint Oct\u00a02024)*. This work pioneers a new approach for **web automation agents** by enabling them to use **web APIs** in addition to traditional browser actions\u301032\u2020L41-L48\u3011. Most prior \u201cweb navigation\u201d agents learn to click buttons and fill forms on websites (simulating a human using the GUI). Song et al. instead ask: *if a website offers a structured API, why not let the agent call it directly?* They develop two agents \u2013 one that solely uses API calls to complete tasks, and a **hybrid agent** that can **interleave API calls with normal browsing** steps\u301032\u2020L41-L48\u3011\u301032\u2020L19-L27\u3011. The paper evaluates these agents on **WebArena**, a benchmark of tasks like managing online accounts, shopping, and using web apps. The results show a **dramatic improvement** when API access is available. The purely API-based agent more than doubled the success rate of a browsing-only agent (29.2% vs 14.8% average success), and the hybrid agent further improved to **38.9% success**, achieving the new state-of-the-art on WebArena tasks\u301032\u2020L49-L57\u3011. In some cases, the API approach solved tasks in *a fraction of the steps* that a browser bot took (since the agent can fetch exactly what it needs via a query rather than clicking through pages)\u301032\u2020L59-L67\u3011. This research is significant because it suggests a paradigm shift for **web agents** \u2013 from treating the web only as a GUI to be manipulated, toward exploiting back-end APIs when possible. By **dynamically choosing between browsing and API calling**, the hybrid agent gains both **robustness and efficiency**, tackling a wider range of web tasks than either method alone\u301032\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301032\u2020L61-L64\u3011. This has inspired follow-up work on standardized web APIs for AI and agents that can autonomously read API documentation to improve their performance.\n\n10. **MedGemma: Medical Vision-Language Foundation Models (Schmidgall et al., 2025)** \u2013 *Samuel Schmidgall et al. (Google Health)* \u2013 *Technical Report on alphaXiv (Aug\u00a02025)*. **MedGemma** introduces a suite of large generative models **specialized for medical data**, built by adapting the Gemma\u00a03 multimodal architecture\u30104\u2020L437-L445\u3011. These models (with up to 27B parameters, plus a 4B version) have been **pre-trained on medical text and imaging datasets** to function as general-purpose *medical assistants* \u2013 capable of interpreting clinical images (like X-rays or pathology slides), answering medical questions, and understanding electronic health records. The paper demonstrates that domain-specific foundation models can achieve **state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance** on a variety of medical AI benchmarks\u30104\u2020L444-L452\u3011. For example, the 4B MedGemma (vision-language) model excels at *medical visual QA* and even outperforms some task-tuned models on chest X-ray diagnosis\u30104\u2020L444-L452\u3011. The larger 27B text-only model outperforms prior general LLMs on medical QA datasets and can retrieve patient records with high precision when fine-tuned\u30104\u2020L451-L459\u3011. Furthermore, MedGemma includes a **specialized vision encoder (MedSigLIP)** that enables strong zero-shot image understanding, and the models exhibit data-efficient learning on domain tasks\u30104\u2020L457-L465\u3011. Crucially, Google **openly released the MedGemma models and code**, allowing the community to build on them\u30104\u2020L471-L476\u3011. This is notable since medical AI has historically been dominated by closed, task-specific models \u2013 MedGemma shows that a *general foundation model* targeted at healthcare can be both highly performant and broadly applicable. By bridging **general-purpose generative AI with medical expertise**, it charts new territory in trustworthy medical AI. It also validates the idea that *verticalized* foundation models (for law, medicine, science, etc.) can deliver real-world impact while sharing the benefits of large-scale pretraining\u30104\u2020L470-L476\u3011.\n\nEach of these papers has garnered significant attention in 2025, either by **charting new directions** (e.g. tokenization-free LMs, RL-driven reasoning, API-enabled agents) or by achieving a **notable first** (e.g. 10M context windows, autonomous ML researchers, open multimodal models). Collectively, they highlight a trend toward more **specialized yet interoperable AI systems** \u2013 combining large foundation models with new structures that make them more efficient, grounded, or adapted to specific domains. These works are likely to **inspire extensive follow-up research and open-source implementations**, and many have already seeded new projects (from community LLM releases to agent frameworks) building on their ideas. They represent the cutting edge of generative AI and agents in 2025, pointing the way to the next generation of AI breakthroughs.\n\n**Sources:** The information above was synthesized from the papers\u2019 official reports and technical blog summaries: for example, Meta\u2019s Llama\u00a04 announcement\u301025\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301025\u2020L109-L117\u3011 and Reuters coverage\u301023\u2020L203-L209\u3011; the Gemma\u00a03 arXiv report\u301037\u2020L117-L125\u3011; the DeepSeek-R1 preprint\u301016\u2020L21-L25\u3011\u301016\u2020L85-L93\u3011; NVIDIA\u2019s SLM position paper\u301020\u2020L61-L69\u3011; the GenSI MemAgent arXiv and summary\u30102\u2020L324-L332\u3011\u30102\u2020L345-L353\u3011; the AI Research Agents arXiv and blog overview\u30102\u2020L247-L253\u3011\u30102\u2020L263-L270\u3011; the H-Net dynamic chunking arXiv and summary\u30104\u2020L389-L397\u3011\u30104\u2020L405-L413\u3011; the REFRAG arXiv and Meta blog\u301027\u2020L213-L221\u3011\u301030\u2020L7-L15\u3011; the API-Based Agents paper and authors\u2019 project page\u301032\u2020L49-L57\u3011; and Google\u2019s MedGemma technical report summary\u30104\u2020L444-L452\u3011\u30104\u2020L470-L476\u3011, among other sources.
