The big idea is to pick a *single source of truth* (code/spec), auto-render from it, and keep styling centralized.\n\n## 1) Write \u201cconstruction code\u201d directly in LaTeX (max control, max maintainability)\n**Best when:** you want diagrams to survive years of edits and compile identically everywhere.\n\n### (a) Euclidean geometry \u2192 TikZ + tkz-euclide\n- Use **TikZ** (the TeX vector-graphics language) plus **tkz-euclide** for higher-level Euclidean primitives (points, circles, intersections, perpendiculars, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- Workflow:\n  1. Translate the text description into *construction steps* (not coordinates) (e.g., \u201cLet \\(C\\) be the intersection of circles\u2026\u201d).\n  2. Encode steps in tkz-euclide macros.\n  3. Keep a shared `styles.tex` for line weights, arrowheads, label style, color palette.\n\n### (b) Commutative diagrams \u2192 tikz-cd + Quiver export\n- Use **tikz-cd** directly if you\u2019re comfortable editing matrices of nodes/arrows.\n- Or: author in **Quiver** (graphical editor) \u2192 export **tikz-cd** code \u2192 commit the code. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- Why this is maintainable: the output is still plain LaTeX, diff-able in Git.\n\n### (c) Graph theory graphs \u2192 TikZ graph libraries\n- For smaller graphs you hand-tune, just define nodes/edges in TikZ and apply shared styles.\n- If you want automated layout, see workflows (4) and (5) below.\n\n**Pros:** pure, portable, version-control friendly.  \n**Cons:** steep learning curve; large diagrams can become verbose.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Use a diagram GUI that saves *TeX-native* source (fast authoring, still maintainable)\n**Best when:** you want drag-and-drop but still end up with editable code.\n\n### (a) TikZiT for graphs / string diagrams (category theory-friendly)\n- **TikZiT** is a graphical user interface (GUI) editor whose native format is a subset of **PGF/TikZ**, so you can include the saved file directly in LaTeX. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- Workflow:\n  1. Build diagram in TikZiT.\n  2. Save `.tikz` (or TikZiT\u2019s format) in repo.\n  3. `\\input{...}` from LaTeX; keep a shared style file.\n\n### (b) Ipe for geometry-style textbook figures (excellent labels)\n- **Ipe** is a drawing editor designed for figures with LaTeX text integration. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search17\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- Workflow:\n  1. Draw geometrically (snap, guides, layers).\n  2. Use LaTeX labels inside Ipe (consistent fonts/math).\n  3. Export PDF for inclusion, and keep `.ipe` as editable source.\n\n**Pros:** very fast layout; good for \u201ctextbook look\u201d.  \n**Cons:** true \u201cconstruction constraints\u201d aren\u2019t encoded (unless you enforce them manually); diffing binary formats can be awkward (Ipe is better than many, but still not like code).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Use a dynamic geometry system for *constraint-based* construction, then export\n**Best when:** you want \u201cEuclid-style constraints\u201d (perpendicular, equal lengths, intersection points) rather than hand-placed art.\n\n### GeoGebra \u2192 export to TikZ/Asymptote\n- GeoGebra explicitly supports export to **LaTeX PGF/TikZ** / **Asymptote** formats. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- Workflow:\n  1. Convert text description into a GeoGebra construction (constraints + named points).\n  2. Save `.ggb` as the canonical editable source.\n  3. Export TikZ (or Asymptote) for inclusion in LaTeX; re-export whenever you update the construction.\n\n**Important caveat:** exported TikZ often \u201cbakes in\u201d coordinates; the maintainable source is the `.ggb`, not the export.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Graph layout engines \u2192 LaTeX via converters (great for big graphs)\n**Best when:** graphs are too large to hand-place, and layout quality matters.\n\n### Graphviz DOT \u2192 dot2tex \u2192 TikZ\n- Write a **DOT** (Graphviz) spec (nodes/edges + attributes), then convert with **dot2tex** into PGF/TikZ (or PSTricks). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search19\ue201  \n- Workflow:\n  1. From your text description, author `graph.dot`.\n  2. Run `dot -Txdot graph.dot | dot2tex ... > graph.tikz`.\n  3. Include `graph.tikz` in LaTeX, optionally overlay manual annotations.\n\n**Pros:** automated layout; DOT is very maintainable for big graphs.  \n**Cons:** conversion isn\u2019t perfect; manual tweaks can get overwritten unless you separate \u201cgenerated base\u201d vs \u201chand overlay\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Python as the \u201ccompiler\u201d: text \u2192 data structure \u2192 TikZ/PGF\n**Best when:** you want repeatability, parameterization, and you already live in Python.\n\n### (a) NetworkX \u2192 LaTeX/TikZ exporters\n- NetworkX has a `to_latex` utility for emitting TikZ-based LaTeX. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- There are also dedicated exporters like `nx2tikz` (exports NetworkX graphs to TikZ, often expecting TikZ to do layout via LuaTeX). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \n\n### (b) network2tikz for \u201cnice default\u201d network visuals\n- `network2tikz` is a Python tool that converts network visualizations into TikZ (via tikz-network). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n\n**Workflow pattern:**\n1. Write a small \u201cdiagram spec\u201d in Python (or JSON/YAML) capturing nodes, edges, labels, styles.\n2. Generate TikZ from that spec.\n3. Compile via `latexmk` in a build step.\n\n**Pros:** extremely maintainable for *families* of diagrams; easy global styling.  \n**Cons:** you\u2019ll need to decide how you want layout handled (Python vs TikZ vs Graphviz).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Asymptote for \u201ccode-driven\u201d Euclidean and 3D-ish figures (clean + programmable)\n**Best when:** you want a real programming language for drawings, with LaTeX-quality labels.\n\n- Asymptote is explicitly TeX-aware and can be embedded directly in LaTeX via the `asymptote` package and `asy` environment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search16\ue201  \n- Workflow:\n  1. Encode construction in Asymptote (variables, functions, computed intersections).\n  2. Keep reusable geometry helper functions.\n  3. Embed or include `.asy` files.\n\n**Pros:** very maintainable and expressive; great when geometry is algorithmic.  \n**Cons:** separate language to learn; toolchain details (shell escape / external compilation) may need care.\n\n---\n\n## 7) \u201cText \u2192 (structured spec) \u2192 render\u201d as a long-term maintainability strategy\nIf your starting point is *natural language descriptions*, the biggest failure mode is **ambiguity**. A robust approach is to force the text into a **domain-specific language (DSL)** you control, then compile.\n\nExample DSL idea (high level):\n- **Geometry DSL:** \u201cGiven A,B; let C be intersection of circle(A,r) and circle(B,r2); draw segment AC; mark right angle at \u2026\u201d\n- **Commutative DSL:** objects placed on a grid; arrows with labels; options for bends/2-cells.\n- **Graph DSL:** node set + edge list + attributes; choose layout engine.\n\nThen:\n1. Text description \u2192 DSL (manually or with a model)\n2. DSL \u2192 TikZ / tikz-cd / DOT / Asymptote (deterministic codegen)\n3. Central `style` + CI compile check\n\nThis is the best way to get *both* \u201ctext driven\u201d and \u201cmaintainable\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## A practical default stack (low regret)\n- **Commutative diagrams:** Quiver \u2192 export tikz-cd \u2192 commit the `.tex` snippet. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- **Euclidean geometry:** tkz-euclide when the figure is \u201cEuclid construction-y\u201d; GeoGebra when you need fast constraint fiddling (keep `.ggb` as truth). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \n- **Graph theory graphs:** DOT + dot2tex for large graphs; TikZiT for smaller hand-tuned ones. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Maintainability checklist (applies to all workflows)\n- **Single source of truth:** never hand-edit generated output unless you separate \u201cgenerated base\u201d and \u201cmanual overlay\u201d.\n- **Centralize styling:** one file for node styles, arrows, fonts, spacing, line thickness.\n- **Name everything:** named points/nodes beat numeric coordinates.\n- **Parameterize, don\u2019t copy-paste:** macros / functions for repeated motifs (pullback squares, exact sequences, angle marks, etc.).\n- **Automate compilation:** a one-command build (`latexmk`, `make`) that regenerates all figures and fails fast on errors.\n\nIf you show me **one example text description** (say: a Euclidean geometry diagram with constraints, a commutative square with a couple of diagonals, or a graph with 10\u201330 vertices), I can propose the *best-fit workflow* and what the \u201ccanonical source\u201d should look like for that class of diagrams."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":641,"end_idx":674,"safe_urls":["https://altermundus.fr/files/tkz-euclide/tkz-euclide.pdf","https://altermundus.fr/files/tkz-euclide/tkz-euclide.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ctan.org/pkg/tkz-euclide?lang=en","https://ctan.org/pkg/tkz-euclide?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/tkz-euclide?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Package tkz-euclide","url":"https://ctan.org/pkg/tkz-euclide?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The tkz-euclide package is a set of files designed to give math teachers and students easy access to the programming of Euclidean geometry with TikZ.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"tkz-euclide 5.11c","url":"https://altermundus.fr/files/tkz-euclide/tkz-euclide.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"It handles the most classic situa- tions in Euclidean Geometry. tkz-euclide is built on top of PGF and its associated front-. endTikZ and is a (La)TeX-friendly ...Read more","attribution":"Altermundus"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"CTAN"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201","start_idx":1183,"end_idx":1228,"safe_urls":["https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/graphics/pgf/contrib/quiver/quiver-doc.pdf","https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/graphics/pgf/contrib/quiver/quiver-doc.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://github.com/varkor/quiver","https://github.com/varkor/quiver?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://q.uiver.app/","https://q.uiver.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([q.uiver.app](https://q.uiver.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"quiver: a modern commutative diagram editor","url":"https://q.uiver.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"quiver is a modern, graphical editor for commutative and pasting diagrams, capable of rendering high-quality diagrams for screen viewing, and exporting to LaTeX ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"quiver","url":"https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/graphics/pgf/contrib/quiver/quiver-doc.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"It functions as a wrapper around the tikz-cd package that provides some extra TikZ styles, which are used in diagrams exported by the editor.
