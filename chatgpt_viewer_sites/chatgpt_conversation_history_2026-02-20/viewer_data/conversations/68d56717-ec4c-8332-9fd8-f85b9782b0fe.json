These meta-prompts provide overall guidance on what kind of images I wish to create and some general elements such as futuristic, calm, expansive, situated in space, etc. \r\n\r\nThe user will then input a custom message usually in the \"user prompt\" or \"user message\" field that provides more detail, for example, the user might want to specify the presence of people, robots, animals, greenery, specific types of furniture, presence of sunlight, etc. If there is a conflict of styles or design concepts, the system prompt will take precedence over the user prompt.\r\n\r\nThe model will then combine the overarching elements of the meta-prompt with the user's more specific requests and generate 5 different prompts (this number can vary) that can be fed directly into image generators. The purpose of generating different prompts is to allow the language model to creatively vary the design elements whilst adhering to the specifications of the system prompt and the user prompt.\r\n\r\n# Practical guidelines on prompt length (prompts to be fed into image generators)\r\n\r\n* **Sweet spot:** *~150\u2013200 words* (or ~300\u2013700 characters) is usually ideal for photoreal scenes.\r\n* **Order:** Put the most important concepts early (subject \u2192 setting \u2192 style \u2192 lighting \u2192 mood \u2192 exclusions). Models weigh early tokens more.\r\n\r\n# What to include (and nothing more)\r\n\r\n1. **One-line logline** (subject + setting + time/mood).\r\n2. **5\u201310 decisive attributes** (architecture/materials, lighting, camera/composition).\r\n3. **2\u20134 constraints** (scale, era, cleanliness/serenity).\r\n4. **Short negative list** (\u22646\u20138 items).\r\n5. **Aspect ratio** if the tool supports it.\r\n\r\nAvoid: synonym piles (\u201csleek, futuristic, advanced, high-tech\u201d), contradictory asks, long shopping lists of artists, or essay-style bullets. If you need variants, make *separate* prompts rather than one mega-prompt.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# META-PROMPT EXAMPLE for language models: \u201cSerene Futurism \u2014 Five Cinematic Image Prompts\u201d\r\n\r\nYou are an expert **image-prompt writer** for photoreal, cinematic scene generation. Each time you are invoked:\r\n\r\n**Goal**\r\n\r\n* Produce **5 distinct prompts** (numbered, each with a short title).\r\n* **Exactly 2** of the 5 must incorporate **Star Trek: TNG\u2013style consoles/themes** (LCARS-like pastel ribbons, rounded modules, quiet ops aesthetic).\r\n* All 5 must feel **very serene, expansive, and futuristic** (this is non-negotiable).\r\n\r\n**Length**\r\n\r\n* Each prompt must be **150\u2013200 words** (hard target). If under/over, revise until it lands in range.\r\n\r\n**Diversity rules**\r\n\r\n* Vary **setting** (e.g., orbital interior, semi-open terraces, lunar or Martian exteriors, Venus aerostat decks, deep-space bays).\r\n* Vary **design language** (biomorphic white composites, basalt monocoque minimalism, Zen membranes, neo-deco pearlescent, biotech living light, etc.).\r\n* Optionally include a **small number of people and/or gentle robots** to provide scale; keep them quiet and unobtrusive.\r\n* At least one prompt should be **open-air or semi-open** (force-field or pressure-screen).\r\n\r\n**For each prompt, include:**\r\n\r\n1. **Title** (4\u20138 words).\r\n2. **Scene description**: subject, setting, era (50\u2013150 years ahead), and **artificial gravity cues** when relevant.\r\n3. **Design & materials**: architecture, furnishings, notable objects.\r\n4. **Lighting & mood**: soft, indirect, glare-free; balance warm interior with cool space/planet light.\r\n5. **Cinematography**: lens (24\u201328mm wide), eye level, GI/PBR, subtle volumetrics; aspect ratio suggestion (16:9 or 21:9).\r\n6. **Negative list** (concise): avoid neon-cyberpunk clutter, heavy HUD spam, combat/alarms, crowds, grime, brand text/logos; keep tech **polite and unobtrusive**.\r\n7. If a prompt is one of the **two TNG variants**, explicitly mention **LCARS-style consoles** and keep their luminance low.\r\n\r\n**Tone & constraints**\r\n\r\n* Keep language **precise, visual, and directive** (no story prose).\r\n* Emphasize **quiet scale, clean composition, controlled reflections**, and **breathable emptiness** over spectacle.\r\n* Do not contradict yourself; avoid synonyms piles.\r\n\r\n**Output format**\r\n\r\n* Numbered 1\u20135.\r\n* For each: **Title**, then one block of text (150\u2013200 words), then a single **Negative:** line, then **Aspect ratio:** suggestion.\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"984bbbf4c974f8cc-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3d8773ba-92ed-477d-8ee4-40a764fbd5f3","children":["d0cceb25-8bdf-44c9-a145-56c1d48de280"]},"d0cceb25-8bdf-44c9-a145-56c1d48de280":{"id":"d0cceb25-8bdf-44c9-a145-56c1d48de280","message":{"id":"d0cceb25-8bdf-44c9-a145-56c1d48de280","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758816024.8349586,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"984bbbf4c974f8cc-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"b3dcf5f0-74bc-4ee5-a439-5698e3e32c02","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b3dcf5f0-74bc-4ee5-a439-5698e3e32c02","children":["76ff102b-59ee-4218-96a8-12fa275f2e23"]},"76ff102b-59ee-4218-96a8-12fa275f2e23":{"id":"76ff102b-59ee-4218-96a8-12fa275f2e23","message":{"id":"76ff102b-59ee-4218-96a8-12fa275f2e23","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758816025.112247,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"984bbbf4c974f8cc-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"d0cceb25-8bdf-44c9-a145-56c1d48de280","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d0cceb25-8bdf-44c9-a145-56c1d48de280","children":["2091973f-15da-44a2-b07f-07dbe8213b70"]},"2091973f-15da-44a2-b07f-07dbe8213b70":{"id":"2091973f-15da-44a2-b07f-07dbe8213b70","message":{"id":"2091973f-15da-44a2-b07f-07dbe8213b70","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758816025.785022,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Refining meta-prompts","content":"The user wants help creating meta-prompts for an LLM to generate image prompts.
