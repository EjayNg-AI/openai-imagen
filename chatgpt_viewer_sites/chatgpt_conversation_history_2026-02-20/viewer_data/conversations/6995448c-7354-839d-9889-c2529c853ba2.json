Hassabis, who co-founded DeepMind in 2010 and led it through its 2023 merger with Google Brain, revealed that he typically sleeps around six hours per night and splits his workday into two distinct segments. His daytime hours are packed with meetings, leaving little free time. After spending evenings with his family, Hassabis begins a second work shift around 10 p.m., focusing on deep thinking, creativity, and research until about 4 a.m. He noted that he has followed this schedule for about a decade and feels most mentally active around 1 a.m. His unusual routine mirrors that of other tech leaders such as Elon Musk and Marc Benioff, who have also adapted their sleep patterns to meet professional demands. Hassabis, along with colleague John Jumper, was awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contributions to protein structure prediction.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770875117.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfTQXMtoZw","title":"Can Google's New AI Solve Everything? | Titans and Disruptors","snippet":"FULL DISCUSSION: Google's Demis Hassabis, Anthropic's Dario Amodei Debate the World After AGI | AI1G.
