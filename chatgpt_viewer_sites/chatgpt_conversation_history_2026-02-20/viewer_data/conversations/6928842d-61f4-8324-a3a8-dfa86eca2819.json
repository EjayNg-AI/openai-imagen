Society Foundations (OSF), declared the organization's readiness to take legal action against the U.S. federal government in response to President Trump's escalating attacks. The Trump administration has targeted OSF\u2014founded by George Soros and known for supporting progressive causes\u2014by proposing Justice Department and IRS investigations, alleging OSF's involvement in left-wing activism, including ties to antifa. Nowrojee voiced strong support for free speech and lawful protest, emphasizing the need to protect OSF grantees, especially those facing life-threatening risks in areas like Latin America. She also underscored OSF\u2019s policy of non-interference with grantees as long as they comply with grant terms. Speaking from the Amazon-based climate summit, Nowrojee praised vibrant civil society participation and criticized the U.S. government's absence following Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. She stressed global interdependence in addressing the climate crisis.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1764169229.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/06/the-george-soros-philosophy-and-its-fatal-flaw","title":"The George Soros philosophy \u2013 and its fatal flaw","snippet":"6 Jul 2018 \u2014 For Soros, the goal of contemporary human existence is to establish a world defined not by sovereign states, but by a global community whose ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1530853217.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/george-soros-antisemitism-bomb-attacks","title":"'Dripping with poison of antisemitism': the demonization ...","snippet":"25 Oct 2018 \u2014 ...

OSF, now led by Soros\u2019s son Alex, supports a vast global network of non-profits involved in democracy, climate justice, racial justice, and Palestinian rights. The Trump administration and its allies launched investigations and legislative efforts to strip certain progressive groups of their non-profit status, framing them as extremist or terrorist-linked\u2014claims widely condemned as politically motivated and lacking evidence.\n\nIn response, OSF and its beneficiaries have reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful, lawful advocacy and constitutional freedoms. Non-profit leaders argue that these attacks mirror authoritarian tactics, aiming to drain resources and demoralize opposition. Groups like Indivisible, Sunrise Movement, and the Center for American Progress have vowed solidarity and resilience, refusing to be silenced. The crackdown particularly threatens Palestinian rights organizations, which already face systematic stigmatization.\n\nDespite threats, non-profits are uniting in defiance, treating attacks on any one group as assaults on all. They emphasize transparency, legality, and solidarity in resistance efforts, warning that undermining civil society erodes democracy for everyone.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":58},"pub_date":1760705053.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"besacenter.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://besacenter.org/george-soros-jewish-world/","title":"George Soros's Negative Interactions with the Jewish World","snippet":"26 Oct 2020 \u2014 ... antisemitic attacks on Soros himself.

The Trump administration and its allies launched investigations and legislative efforts to strip certain progressive groups of their non-profit status, framing them as extremist or terrorist-linked\u2014claims widely condemned as politically motivated and lacking evidence.\n\nIn response, OSF and its beneficiaries have reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful, lawful advocacy and constitutional freedoms. Non-profit leaders argue that these attacks mirror authoritarian tactics, aiming to drain resources and demoralize opposition. Groups like Indivisible, Sunrise Movement, and the Center for American Progress have vowed solidarity and resilience, refusing to be silenced. The crackdown particularly threatens Palestinian rights organizations, which already face systematic stigmatization.\n\nDespite threats, non-profits are uniting in defiance, treating attacks on any one group as assaults on all. They emphasize transparency, legality, and solidarity in resistance efforts, warning that undermining civil society erodes democracy for everyone.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1760705053.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/05/trump-administration-george-soros-investigation","title":"Trump sets sights on liberal mega-donor George Soros","snippet":"5 Oct 2025 \u2014 When Trump ally Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary was running for re-election in 2018, he targeted Soros with antisemitic dog whistles, saying: \u201cWe ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1759665634.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/23/antisemitism-redefinition-jewish-safety-christian-nationalism-democracy","title":"The new definition of antisemitism is transforming America","snippet":"23 Mar 2025 \u2014 Redefining antisemitism in the law was never about Jewish safety.

It\u2019s a very polemical, selectively framed take with a few kernels of truth wrapped in a lot of exaggeration and causal overreach.\n\nLet me unpack that in pieces.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What\u2019s roughly grounded in reality\n\n### a) Soros really is hostile to nationalism in a classical sense  \nGeorge Soros is a Holocaust survivor, billionaire investor, and founder of the Open Society Foundations (OSF). He\u2019s donated over $30 billion to promote democracy, human rights, and liberal institutions worldwide. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search21\ue201  \n\nPhilosophically, he\u2019s explicitly influenced by Karl Popper\u2019s notion of the \u201copen society.\u201d He has argued for a global order where states are constrained by international norms and where national sovereignty is not absolute. One widely cited profile notes that for Soros, the goal is a world defined less by sovereign states and more by a global community committed to freedom, equality, and shared prosperity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n\nSo:\n\n- It\u2019s accurate that he opposes strong ethnic or exclusionary nationalism.  \n- It\u2019s **not** literally accurate to say he wants \u201ca world without nations\u201d in the sense of erasing all states tomorrow, but he *does* advocate weakening traditional notions of national sovereignty in favour of a more integrated global order. Critics reasonably interpret that as undermining the nation-state.\n\n### b) He funds liberal/progressive and some hard-left causes  \nOSF is one of the largest private funders of civil society in the world, backing a wide ecosystem of NGOs (non-governmental organizations) focused on democracy, minority rights, rule of law, criminal-justice reform, migration, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search21\ue202turn1news32\ue201  \n\nSome of those grantees are:\n\n- Mainstream human-rights groups (e.g. Human Rights Watch).  \n- Liberal Jewish or pro-peace groups (e.g. J Street).  \n- Palestinian or anti-occupation organizations, some of which are **very** critical of Israel and Zionism.\n\nCritics from the Israeli right and parts of the Jewish establishment have long argued that Soros money reaches organizations they describe as participating in \u201cdelegitimization\u201d campaigns against Israel, and some analyses from that camp document specific grants to such groups. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n\nSo there *is* a real ideological conflict here: he funds actors many Zionist or nationalist Jews see as directly harmful to Jewish collective interests.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where the statement becomes misleading or simply wrong\n\nNow the problems.\n\n### a) \u201cEvery far-left group\u201d and \u201cevery vector of left-wing antisemitism\u201d  \nThis is just rhetoric. Soros does *not* fund \u201cevery\u201d far-left group, nor \u201cevery vector\u201d of left-wing antisemitism. That\u2019s obviously false on its face.\n\nMore substantively:\n\n- There is **no evidence** that Soros or OSF intentionally support antisemitic ideology.  \n- Even highly critical reports that track his funding to harshly anti-Israel NGOs explicitly say there is no evidence that he or his family oppose Israel\u2019s existence or harbour special hostility to Jews as such. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n- OSF itself has a documented track record funding initiatives explicitly aimed at combating antisemitism and other forms of hate; Alex Soros recently announced additional funding specifically to fight antisemitism and stop its \u201cweaponization\u201d in political discourse. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n\nYou can absolutely argue that some OSF-funded groups cross a line into antisemitism (depending on which definition\u2014IHRA, JDA, etc.\u2014you adopt). But to summarise that entire ecosystem as \u201csponsoring Jew-hate\u201d is a **massive compression** of a very heterogeneous grant portfolio.\n\n### b) Blaming him for far-right antisemitism  \nThis is the most fundamentally broken part of the tweet.\n\nFar-right antisemitism is **centuries** older than Soros. In the last decade, hard-right movements and politicians in the US, Hungary, and elsewhere have used Soros as a convenient symbol: a wealthy, cosmopolitan Jewish financier allegedly \u201ccontrolling\u201d migration, protests, prosecutors, globalism, etc. Multiple independent outlets and Jewish organizations have pointed out that these narratives recycle classic antisemitic tropes about secret Jewish cabals and puppet-masters. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\nYou can see this in:\n\n- Hungarian campaigns under Viktor Orb\u00e1n featuring Soros on posters as a shadowy enemy of the nation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \n- US right-wing rhetoric around Trump\u2019s indictment, campus protests, and immigration, where \u201cSoros\u201d is shorthand for an imagined Jewish-globalist plot. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search19\ue201  \n- Repeated false viral claims, like Australia allegedly declaring Soros a terrorist \u2013 debunked outright by Reuters. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news29\ue201  \n\nTo say that the far right \u201clargely because of him\u201d gets to paint Jews as a civilizational enemy badly misallocates responsibility. Antisemites are not reacting neutrally to \u201cfacts about Soros\u201d; they are choosing to weaponize him as a symbol in a pre-existing conspiratorial worldview.\n\nThat is **not** on him. It\u2019s on them.\n\nAttributing blame for antisemitic backlash to the behaviour of a single Jewish philanthropist is conceptually very close to victim-blaming, even if the author of the tweet is himself Jewish.\n\n### c) Hyper-personalisation of structural trends  \nThe claim that Soros\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d will be a world of hardened nationalism and invigorated extremists on all sides suggests that:\n\n> Rising nationalism + polarization \u2248 mostly a reaction to Soros\u2019s project.\n\nThat\u2019s implausible. Nationalist and authoritarian backlashes are driven by:\n\n- Economic shocks and inequality.  \n- Migration and demographic change.  \n- Information technology and social media dynamics.  \n- Long histories of ethnic, religious, and political grievance.\n\nSoros is **one** prominent symbol in these battles, not their root cause. Collapsing complex structural phenomena into the story of one man makes for a punchy tweet, but it\u2019s not a fair causal analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Jews themselves are split on Soros\n\nThe tweet also speaks as if there is a single coherent \u201cworld Jewry\u201d whose interests Soros has damaged. That\u2019s not remotely true.\n\nAmong Jews you can find:\n\n- **Harsh critics** who see his funding of anti-occupation or anti-Zionist groups as materially endangering Jews or Israel. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n- **Defenders** who argue that strengthening liberal democracy, minority rights, and rule of law is exactly what historically kept Jews safest, and that the attacks on Soros are themselves one of today\u2019s main vectors of antisemitism. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1news37\ue201  \n- **Mixed views** (critical of some of his grantees, but strongly opposed to the conspiracy-theory demonization of Soros).\n\nSo even *within* Jewish communities, the evaluation of his \u201clegacy\u201d is contested. Presenting \u201cworld Jewry\u201d as a single bloc that has objectively suffered \u201cimmeasurable damage\u201d from him is more rhetorical flourish than sociological fact.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Overall verdict on fairness\n\nIf by \u201cfair\u201d you mean:\n\n> *\u201cAccurately describes his record, acknowledges relevant complexity, and assigns responsibility proportionately.\u201d*\n\n\u2026then no, this isn\u2019t fair.\n\n- It **accurately** captures that Soros is ideologically anti-nationalist and has heavily funded liberal/progressive causes, including some that many Jews and Israelis regard as deeply hostile to their interests.  \n- It **distorts** reality by:\n  - Using absolute language (\u201cevery vector\u201d, \u201cimmeasurable damage\u201d) that no serious empirical analysis could defend.  \n  - Collapsing the whole far-right antisemitic backlash onto Soros\u2019s shoulders instead of on the far right.  \n  - Treating \u201cworld Jewry\u201d as a single interest group whose fate he has supposedly mangled.  \n\nA more intellectually honest critique would be something like:\n\n> \u201cSoros\u2019s open-borders, anti-nationalist liberalism, and his funding of harshly anti-Israel NGOs, have, in my view, undermined the interests of many Jews and provoked a powerful nationalist backlash that has made Jewish life more precarious in some contexts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still debatable, but at least it\u2019s recognisable as an arguable thesis rather than a quasi-mythological story in which one man \u201ccauses\u201d both left-wing and right-wing Jew-hate and defines an era.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can try to reconstruct an actually balanced two-page profile: one column \u201ccase for Soros as harmful to Jewish interests,\u201d one column \u201ccase for Soros as protective of Jewish safety,\u201d each backed by concrete examples and sources rather than vibes."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search21\ue201","start_idx":540,"end_idx":574,"safe_urls":["https://www.devex.com/news/the-open-society-foundations-and-their-enemies-92664","https://www.devex.com/news/the-open-society-foundations-and-their-enemies-92664?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ebc.com/forex/george-soros","https://www.ebc.com/forex/george-soros?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([EBC

This reorganization involved the closure of some programs and significant structural adjustments but aims to focus resources more effectively. Notably, OSF has launched new programs such as a $400 million initiative for green jobs and economic development, as well as a limited-time project to protect environmental defenders. OSF, one of the largest global human rights funders, has also outlined plans to grant funds with longer duration and greater flexibility to address emergencies more adeptly.

OSF, now led by Soros\u2019s son Alex, supports a vast global network of non-profits involved in democracy, climate justice, racial justice, and Palestinian rights. The Trump administration and its allies launched investigations and legislative efforts to strip certain progressive groups of their non-profit status, framing them as extremist or terrorist-linked\u2014claims widely condemned as politically motivated and lacking evidence.\n\nIn response, OSF and its beneficiaries have reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful, lawful advocacy and constitutional freedoms. Non-profit leaders argue that these attacks mirror authoritarian tactics, aiming to drain resources and demoralize opposition. Groups like Indivisible, Sunrise Movement, and the Center for American Progress have vowed solidarity and resilience, refusing to be silenced. The crackdown particularly threatens Palestinian rights organizations, which already face systematic stigmatization.\n\nDespite threats, non-profits are uniting in defiance, treating attacks on any one group as assaults on all.

This marks a significant shift in NEH's funding strategy under the reorganization by the Trump administration, favoring fewer, larger, and often non-competitive grants directed at ideologically aligned institutions.

The NEH, with a significantly reduced staff and program portfolio, has redirected funds away from state humanities councils and broadly distributed cultural grants, prompting backlash from organizations like the American Historical Association and the Federation of State Humanities Councils.

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was arrested at the scene and allegedly shouted \"Free, free Palestine!\" while in custody. Social media users accused Soros of contributing to the environment that fuels anti-Semitic violence, citing his and his father's history of donating to groups critical of Israel, some of which have been accused of promoting extremist views. Israeli officials, including Minister Amichai Chikli and UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, have previously criticized the Soros family for funding organizations perceived as hostile to the Jewish state, such as Human Rights Watch, J Street, and Adalah.

In response, Soros' office denied all allegations, calling them \u201c100% false,\u201d and encouraged the public to support democratic values. OSF issued a statement rejecting any connections to terrorism, emphasizing its mission to strengthen democracy in the U.S., and confirmed it has not been contacted by federal authorities.

In a joint statement, these groups criticized Trump's reported attempts to direct the Justice Department to investigate OSF, labeling the move an attack on free speech and democratic values. The backlash follows a New York Times report and Trump's August claims that Soros\u2019 organizations funded violent protests. In response, Soros' office denied all allegations, calling them \u201c100% false,\u201d and encouraged the public to support democratic values. OSF issued a statement rejecting any connections to terrorism, emphasizing its mission to strengthen democracy in the U.S., and confirmed it has not been contacted by federal authorities. Trump later expanded his rhetoric by targeting other prominent donors like Reid Hoffman. Progressive groups, including religious advocacy organizations like Interfaith Alliance, condemned these actions as a dangerous suppression of dissent, urging broader bipartisan opposition to such government overreach.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1759173905.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"jewishjournal.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://jewishjournal.com/news/united-states/83345/","title":"Insiders: Why was J Street so scared of Soros?","snippet":"28 Sept 2010 \u2014 He also sought to clarify 2003 comments that had led some critics to accuse him of blaming Jews and Israel for anti-Semitism. \u201cAnti-Semitism ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1285675200.0,"attribution":"jewishjournal.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"philanthropynewsdigest.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/george-soros-receives-european-sinti-roma-civil-rights-prize","title":"George Soros receives European Sinti, Roma civil rights ...","snippet":"28 Oct 2025 \u2014 A memorial honoring Sinti and Roma victims of the Holocaust surrounds the German Reichstag.

The glossary had provided information on extremist ideologies and hate groups, including neo-Nazis, militias, and antisemitic conspiracies. The criticism intensified after the glossary mentioned Charlie Kirk\u2019s organization, Turning Point USA, and the extremist Christian Identity movement, which Musk and others misrepresented as an attack on Christians. The ADL said the glossary was outdated and had been misused, and its removal is part of an effort to develop more effective outreach strategies. However, the move comes amid growing internal and public criticism of the ADL for narrowing its mission, defending Musk, and focusing more on pro-Israel policies. The organization's previous endorsement of Musk, despite his harsh criticism and attacks branding the ADL itself as a \u201chate group,\u201d further fueled controversy.

Wilson claimed Frank raped and murdered a 13-year-old girl and attempted to frame a Black man, remarks that align with longstanding white supremacist conspiracy theories. Her tweet resurfaced through Tristan Lee, a data scientist at Bellingcat. Wilson, previously associated with pro-Trump activities and organizations, has a history of controversial tweets, including support for the racist \"Great Replacement\" theory and criticism of immigration, trans people, and international military aid. The ADL expressed concern over her statements reflecting such conspiracies, urging an immediate retraction, while the Pentagon referred comments to Wilson, who has yet to respond. Frank's case, which led to his posthumous pardon in 1986, remains a touchpoint for extremist groups and continues to influence neo-Nazi narratives today.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1741213963.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/29/elon-musk-anti-defamation-league-christian-extremism","title":"Musk calls Anti-Defamation League 'hate group' for documenting Christian extremism","snippet":"Elon Musk has publicly accused the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a prominent U.S. Jewish organization, of being a \u201chate group\u201d that opposes Christians, claiming such behavior encourages violence. His accusations were in response to the ADL's documentation of extremist and racist behavior by members of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a group aligned with rightwing ideologies. The ADL had described TPUSA as having ties to white nationalism and noted several racially charged incidents involving its members. Musk's comments mark a sharp shift in his relationship with the ADL, which previously defended him against accusations of antisemitism, including a controversial salute made after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTensions rose as rightwing influencers and Musk criticized the ADL's tracking of the Christian Identity movement, a belief system promoting racial violence. The ADL responded, rejecting the accusation of anti-Christian bias and emphasizing their collaboration with Christian allies in fighting hate. Internally, the ADL has faced criticism over its leadership and alliance with Musk, particularly after it downplayed Musk's controversial behavior and comments, leading to staff resignations and broader organizational backlash. The conflict highlights broader cultural divisions and the ADL's struggle to balance traditional advocacy with high-profile political entanglements.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1759174136.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/12/media/over-10k-posts-tie-charlie-kirks-murder-to-israel-as-conspiracy-theories-explode-online-adl-report/","title":"Over 10K posts tie Charlie Kirk's murder to Israel as conspiracy theories explode online: ADL report","snippet":"Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, over 10,000 social media posts have surfaced on platform X alone, promoting conspiracy theories that blame Israel for his death, according to an Anti-Defamation League (ADL) report. Kirk, aged 31, was killed during a Turning Point USA event in Utah and was known as a vocal supporter of Israel. Despite this, some online figures, including Jackson Hinkle and InfoWars host Harrison Smith, have circulated claims that Kirk was targeted by Israel due to a perceived shift in his views.\n\nThese posts have gained millions of views, often citing out-of-context or speculative statements without concrete evidence. The ADL highlighted how antisemitic actors exploit such events to fuel hatred and misinformation, including unfounded narratives implicating Jewish groups or suggesting government collusion. The rise in antisemitic rhetoric comes amid a broader decline in content moderation across platforms like X, now under Elon Musk\u2019s leadership. Despite the virality of these posts, many remained online without removal as of the report\u2019s release. The ADL emphasized the growing threat to the Jewish community and noted a broader trend of such rhetoric following major tragedies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1757702180.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6928882b09748326932f08fd08231aac","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for pro-Soros and Jewish safety evidence","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"2ba0be13-5017-4d40-a06c-53fb80fb6956","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c5e13ef2-3e09-4f98-8e83-7917a050e3ea","turn_exchange_id":"95bee277-7940-44a1-a3d2-fdbe6c82498a","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c5e13ef2-3e09-4f98-8e83-7917a050e3ea","children":["c0038a3d-27a5-49ee-aa39-5a5aba602379"]},"c0038a3d-27a5-49ee-aa39-5a5aba602379":{"id":"c0038a3d-27a5-49ee-aa39-5a5aba602379","message":{"id":"c0038a3d-27a5-49ee-aa39-5a5aba602379","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764264006.015021,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Creating a balanced Soros profile structure","content":"For the user\u2019s request, I\u2019ll construct a two-column profile in a markdown table format.

Israel, Zionism, and \u201cJewish interests\u201d defined as collective security of the Jewish state\n\n| Aspect | Case: harmful | Case: protective |\n|-------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Core claim** | By funding NGOs that relentlessly attack Israel\u2019s legitimacy and policies, Soros undermines the security and international standing of the world\u2019s only Jewish state, hence Jewish collective safety. | By funding human-rights NGOs and pro-peace/pro-two-state groups, Soros works to end occupation, reduce abuses, and stabilize the region long-term, which he sees as ultimately good for Israel\u2019s survival and Jews\u2019 moral standing. |\n| **Concrete NGO funding in the Arab\u2013Israeli arena** | NGO Monitor and related work document OSF grants to groups such as **Al-Haq, Al-Mezan, B\u2019Tselem, Breaking the Silence, Yesh Din, Adalah**, and others. Critics describe many of these as \u201cpoliticized,\u201d \u201canti-Israel,\u201d or involved in lawfare (e.g. pushing ICC/UN campaigns against Israel). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search26\ue201 | Supporters note that most of these organizations are respected by the broader human-rights community and often include Jewish Israelis (e.g. B\u2019Tselem, Breaking the Silence). Their missions\u2014documenting abuses, challenging occupation, supporting Arab minority rights\u2014are framed as necessary to keep Israel both democratic and Jewish. That aligns with positions taken by many liberal/progressive Jewish groups such as J Street and the New Israel Fund. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search24\ue202turn1search13\ue201 |\n| **Israeli governmental reactions** | Israel\u2019s foreign ministry has explicitly called Soros a *\u201cthreat\u201d* in a 2017 statement, aligning with Hungary\u2019s right-wing government against him and accusing him of funding organizations that \u201cdefame the Jewish state.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | The same episode shows the other side: Hungary\u2019s anti-Soros campaign was widely criticised by Jewish and human-rights groups as *itself* \u201cpoisonous\u201d and dangerous, using billboards and tropes seen as antisemitic. The head of Hungary\u2019s main Jewish organization condemned it in those terms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search17\ue202turn0search0\ue201 |\n| **How \u201cJewish interests\u201d are defined** | In this frame, \u201cJewish interests\u201d \u2248 **security and legitimacy of the Jewish nation-state**, plus rejection of NGOs seen as part of a broader de-legitimisation and BDS adjacent ecosystem. On this definition, OSF money going to those NGOs is ipso facto harmful. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search13\ue201 | In the OSF / liberal Jewish frame, \u201cJewish interests\u201d include **living in societies governed by universal rights, accountable power, and minority protections**. Supporting those norms\u2014even when they constrain Israel\u2014is viewed as pro-Jewish. Soros himself has said he has \u201cdeep concern for the survival of Israel,\u201d even while criticising its policies. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Antisemitism, left and right\n\n| Aspect | Case: harmful | Case: protective |\n|-------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Funding groups adjacent to left-wing antisemitism** | Critics argue that OSF funds movements in which antisemitism is present: e.g. elements of radical anti-Zionism, some campus coalitions, parts of Black Lives Matter, and NGOs accused of using antisemitic tropes in anti-Israel advocacy. Analyses from BESA, JNS and similar outlets explicitly claim Soros supports organizations \u201cpermeated by antisemitism.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn0search13\ue201 | Defenders respond that OSF\u2019s intent is to support **anti-racist and human-rights work**, not antisemitism, and that where partner groups cross lines, responsibility lies with those groups. Even NGO Monitor, highly critical of OSF, says criticism of OSF should not use antisemitic expressions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search13\ue201 |\n| **Effect on left-wing discourse about Jews/Israel** | The \u201charmful\u201d argument says large OSF money tilts progressive ecosystems toward particular stances (anti-occupation, strong critique of Israeli policy, cautious or hostile to Zionism). That allegedly normalises environments where antisemitism more easily piggybacks on anti-Israel activism (e.g. \u201cZionists control everything,\u201d denial of Jewish peoplehood). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn0search20\ue201 | The \u201cprotective\u201d case notes that OSF also funds **explicit anti-antisemitism** work and universalist anti-hate frameworks. In 2023\u201324, OSF publicly highlighted funding to combat antisemitism and \u201cprevent the weaponization\u201d of the term to silence criticism of Israeli policy, and directed emergency money toward groups protecting vulnerable communities in Israel and the West Bank. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search19\ue201 |\n| **Right-wing antisemitic conspiracy theories about Soros** | Some argue Soros *contributes* to antisemitism by living out, in their view, the stereotype of a powerful Jewish \u201cglobalist\u201d subverting national sovereignty and traditional values; they say he thereby fuels backlash. A JNS piece goes as far as claiming the rise of antisemitism and violence in the US is \u201cpartly the result\u201d of Soros\u2019s political donations. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn1search29\ue201 | Mainstream Jewish and anti-hate organizations (ADL, AJC, etc.) strongly stress that **Soros conspiracy narratives are themselves textbook antisemitism**: portraying a wealthy Jew as puppet-master controlling migration, protests, \u201cglobalism,\u201d etc. ADL research shows a large share of antisemitic tweets at Jewish lawmakers invoked Soros conspiracies. AJC\u2019s \u201cTranslate Hate\u201d glossary lists \u201cSoros\u201d as a modern antisemitic code word. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn1search25\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search22\ue201 |\n| **Attacks and physical risk** | \u201cHarmful\u201d side sometimes folds this in: by polarising politics and funding divisive causes, Soros allegedly helps create the conditions in which all forms of extremism\u2014including antisemitic\u2014flourish. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn1search29\ue201 | \u201cProtective\u201d side points out that **Soros himself has been the target** of violence and threats: a pipe bomb was sent to his home in 2018; he is routinely depicted with Nazi imagery by extremists. Cartoonishly demonising a Jewish philanthropist is seen as dangerous for Jews more broadly, and OSF\u2019s pushback is framed as part of defending Jews from modern antisemitic tropes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn1search31\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search32\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diaspora Jews, democracy, and \u201copen society\u201d\n\n| Aspect | Case: harmful | Case: protective |\n|-------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Criminal-justice and progressive causes in the US** | Critics (including some Jewish commentators) argue Soros\u2019s heavy funding of progressive prosecutors, decarceration campaigns, and radical racial-justice groups has contributed to rising crime, social instability, and increased vulnerability of Jewish communities in US cities\u2014e.g. making it harder to respond to antisemitic street violence. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search18\ue201 | Supporters argue that **strong rule of law, civil rights, and protections for minorities** are the best long-run defense against antisemitism. They see Soros-style philanthropy as continuing the traditional Jewish interest in liberal democracy, civil liberties, and protections for vulnerable groups, all of which historically correlate with safer conditions for Jews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news49\ue202turn0news50\ue202turn0news48\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201 |\n| **Attitudes within Jewish communities** | Think-tank pieces (BESA, JNS, some Israeli politicians) describe Soros as having \u201cdamaging statements and actions\u201d toward Jews and Israel, or even as uniquely harmful among Jewish figures in public life. Right-wing Zionist voices frequently depict J Street and similar Soros-linked groups as \u201chostile\u201d to Israel. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn1search29\ue202turn1search20\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search21\ue201 | Other Jewish voices\u2014including liberal/progressive organizations\u2014reject both the demonisation of Soros and the idea that he is anti-Jewish. J Street, New Israel Fund and others stress that criticising Israeli policy, supporting two-state diplomacy, and funding human-rights NGOs are legitimate pro-Israel / pro-Jewish positions, and they condemn the anti-Soros campaigns as bigoted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search17\ue202turn1search16\ue201 |\n| **Symbolism: \u201cglobalist Jew\u201d vs \u201cHolocaust-shaped liberal\u201d** | For critics, Soros is the emblem of a **border-erasing globalism** that they see as naive or hostile to Jewish national resilience; they worry he\u2019s helping dismantle the nation-state framework that allowed a Jewish state to arise and diaspora communities to organise politically. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search21\ue201 | For defenders, his experience of the Holocaust explains his life\u2019s work against authoritarianism and ethnic chauvinism. Museum and civil-rights bodies have honoured him for defending Sinti/Roma and other persecuted minorities; he has directed prize money to Roma education and Holocaust remembrance efforts, and sees that universalism as learned from Jewish catastrophe. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search26\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Meta-level: how to interpret his \u201clegacy\u201d for Jews\n\n| Aspect | Case: harmful | Case: protective |\n|-------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Causal story** | Soros channels enormous capital into movements that (a) erode national sovereignty, including Israel\u2019s diplomatic position, (b) empower far-left spaces where anti-Zionism and antisemitism intermingle, and (c) trigger a ferocious nationalist backlash on the right. On this view, Jews end up \u201csqueezed\u201d between two radicalised camps he has helped feed. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn1search29\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201 | Soros invests heavily in **open, pluralist societies**, independent institutions, minority rights, and anti-hate efforts, including explicit antisemitism programs. Meanwhile, antisemitic actors instrumentalise his name in conspiracies; OSF\u2019s stance is that the blame for antisemitism lies with the antisemites, and strengthening democratic norms is precisely how you protect Jewish communities from them. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search15\ue202turn1search25\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search22\ue201 |\n| **Judgment about intent vs outcome** | Even if Soros doesn\u2019t intend harm to Jews, critics say intent is irrelevant: the *net effect* of his targeted funding is to weaken pro-Israel forces, embolden hostile NGOs, and destabilise cities\u2014so from a realpolitik perspective, he is objectively a negative force for \u201cworld Jewry.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn1search29\ue202turn0search6\ue201 | Defenders stress both **intent and alignment** with broad Jewish historical concerns: fighting authoritarianism, supporting refugees, defending minorities, and building liberal institutions. They argue that blaming a Jewish philanthropist for antisemites\u2019 behaviour reproduces a very old pattern of scapegoating. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search31\ue202turn1search32\ue202turn1search25\ue201 |\n\n---\n\n### Where this leaves us\n\n- There is *real* substance behind the \u201charmful\u201d case: OSF does fund many NGOs and movements that a significant segment of Jewish and Israeli opinion views as structurally hostile to Israel or tolerant of antisemitism.  \n- There is also *real* substance behind the \u201cprotective\u201d case: Soros and OSF are major funders of anti-authoritarian, anti-hate, and minority-protection work; they\u2019ve explicitly funded programs against antisemitism, and Soros is a prime modern target of antisemitic conspiracy narratives.\n\nThe dispute is doing three things at once:\n\n1. **Redefining \u201cJewish interests\u201d**: Are they primarily national (Jewish state / communal power) or primarily liberal-universalist (open societies / minority protection), or some mixture?  \n2. **Arguing about second-order effects**: Do Soros-aligned projects empirically reduce or increase risk to Jews once you factor in backlash and political realignment?  \n3. **Fighting over symbolism**: Is Soros an archetype of the \u201cbad Jew\u201d in some internal Jewish polemics, or an archetypal Jewish liberal humanist being demonised from outside?\n\nIf you want, next step we can:\n\n- Drill into specific OSF grants and trace their *actual* behaviour vis-\u00e0-vis Israel/Jews; or  \n- Model the causal stories (backlash, radicalisation, etc.) more explicitly and see how plausible they really are, given the data."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200i\ue202turn0image0\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":15,"safe_urls":["https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/11/SOROS_stills4_GS-Portrait-color-e1605870323752.jpg","https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.OjHtUgcgT9cJBQKOesqKwQHaEo?pid=Api","https://www.timesofisrael.com/soros-squanders-an-opportunity-with-poor-picture-of-controversial-billionaire/","https://www.timesofisrael.com/soros-squanders-an-opportunity-with-poor-picture-of-controversial-billionaire/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":0}],"alt":"[!['Soros'

According to The New York Times, a senior Justice Department official instructed U.S. attorneys to draft plans to investigate the organization. In a statement to Reuters, the foundation emphasized its commitment to peaceful, lawful work and condemned terrorism. This move comes amid increased pressure on liberal groups following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. President Donald Trump has linked Soros to alleged domestic terrorism efforts and has vowed to dismantle so-called left-wing terrorism networks, labeling Antifa a domestic terrorist group. Trump and conservatives have long targeted Soros, with Trump recently claiming without evidence that Soros and his son should face RICO charges. The Open Society Foundations, established in 1979, supports global initiatives for human rights, transparency, and education.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Progressive nonprofits condemn Trump's targeting of George Soros and his foundations","url":"https://apnews.com/article/9b4c1899b09143e0cac981d5da181f63?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dozens of progressive nonprofits, including the ACLU, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and Oxfam America, have publicly denounced President Donald Trump\u2019s targeting of billionaire philanthropist George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF). In a joint statement, these groups criticized Trump's reported attempts to direct the Justice Department to investigate OSF, labeling the move an attack on free speech and democratic values. The backlash follows a New York Times report and Trump's August claims that Soros\u2019 organizations funded violent protests. In response, Soros' office denied all allegations, calling them \u201c100% false,\u201d and encouraged the public to support democratic values. OSF issued a statement rejecting any connections to terrorism, emphasizing its mission to strengthen democracy in the U.S., and confirmed it has not been contacted by federal authorities. Trump later expanded his rhetoric by targeting other prominent donors like Reid Hoffman. Progressive groups, including religious advocacy organizations like Interfaith Alliance, condemned these actions as a dangerous suppression of dissent, urging broader bipartisan opposition to such government overreach.","attribution":"AP News"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"opensocietyfoundations.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search26\ue201","start_idx":2437,"end_idx":2497,"safe_urls":["https://brill.com/downloadpdf/book/edcoll/9789004265561/B9789004265561-s018.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOopFN1mAJ9RjTv1VI4Ri0BVllhpuFJvkGuNXlIYYw7N8U7t8jBzg","https://brill.com/downloadpdf/book/edcoll/9789004265561/B9789004265561-s018.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOopFN1mAJ9RjTv1VI4Ri0BVllhpuFJvkGuNXlIYYw7N8U7t8jBzg&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ngo-monitor.org/books/bad_investment_the_philanthropy_of_george_soros_and_the_arab_israeli_conflict/","https://ngo-monitor.org/books/bad_investment_the_philanthropy_of_george_soros_and_the_arab_israeli_conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ngo-monitor.org/funder/open_society_institute_osi_/","https://ngo-monitor.org/funder/open_society_institute_osi_/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/israelstudies.24.2.15","https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/israelstudies.24.2.15?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ngomonitor](https://ngo-monitor.org/funder/open_society_institute_osi_/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Open Society Foundations (OSF)","url":"https://ngo-monitor.org/funder/open_society_institute_osi_/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1741125601.0,"snippet":"5 Mar 2025 \u2014 OSF is an organization funded by George Soros that provides funding to civil society groups around the world.

In a joint statement, these groups criticized Trump's reported attempts to direct the Justice Department to investigate OSF, labeling the move an attack on free speech and democratic values. The backlash follows a New York Times report and Trump's August claims that Soros\u2019 organizations funded violent protests. In response, Soros' office denied all allegations, calling them \u201c100% false,\u201d and encouraged the public to support democratic values. OSF issued a statement rejecting any connections to terrorism, emphasizing its mission to strengthen democracy in the U.S., and confirmed it has not been contacted by federal authorities.

According to The New York Times, a senior Justice Department official instructed U.S. attorneys to draft plans to investigate the organization. In a statement to Reuters, the foundation emphasized its commitment to peaceful, lawful work and condemned terrorism. This move comes amid increased pressure on liberal groups following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. President Donald Trump has linked Soros to alleged domestic terrorism efforts and has vowed to dismantle so-called left-wing terrorism networks, labeling Antifa a domestic terrorist group. Trump and conservatives have long targeted Soros, with Trump recently claiming without evidence that Soros and his son should face RICO charges. The Open Society Foundations, established in 1979, supports global initiatives for human rights, transparency, and education.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"US non-profits 'lock arms' amid Trump's menacing of George Soros: 'We will not be intimidated'","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/george-soros-trump-non-profits?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In October 2025, tensions escalated as Donald Trump targeted George Soros and his philanthropic organization, the Open Society Foundations (OSF), accusing them of enabling left-wing political violence. OSF, now led by Soros\u2019s son Alex, supports a vast global network of non-profits involved in democracy, climate justice, racial justice, and Palestinian rights. The Trump administration and its allies launched investigations and legislative efforts to strip certain progressive groups of their non-profit status, framing them as extremist or terrorist-linked\u2014claims widely condemned as politically motivated and lacking evidence.\n\nIn response, OSF and its beneficiaries have reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful, lawful advocacy and constitutional freedoms. Non-profit leaders argue that these attacks mirror authoritarian tactics, aiming to drain resources and demoralize opposition. Groups like Indivisible, Sunrise Movement, and the Center for American Progress have vowed solidarity and resilience, refusing to be silenced. The crackdown particularly threatens Palestinian rights organizations, which already face systematic stigmatization.\n\nDespite threats, non-profits are uniting in defiance, treating attacks on any one group as assaults on all. They emphasize transparency, legality, and solidarity in resistance efforts, warning that undermining civil society erodes democracy for everyone.","attribution":"The Guardian"},{"title":"George Soros Awarded European Civil Rights Prize of the ...","url":"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/newsroom/george-soros-awarded-european-civil-rights-prize-of-the-sinti-and-roma?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"22 Oct 2025 \u2014 George Soros announced he will donate the prize money to the Roma Education Fund, which empowers Roma communities through access to skills and ...","attribution":"opensocietyfoundations.org"},{"title":"George Soros receives European Sinti, Roma civil rights ...","url":"https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/george-soros-receives-european-sinti-roma-civil-rights-prize?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"28 Oct 2025 \u2014 A memorial honoring Sinti and Roma victims of the Holocaust surrounds the German Reichstag.
