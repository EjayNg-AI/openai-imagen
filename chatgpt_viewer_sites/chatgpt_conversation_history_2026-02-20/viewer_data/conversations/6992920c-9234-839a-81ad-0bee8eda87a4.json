I'll create 40 new questions, focusing on vocabulary and staying consistent with the pedagogical approach. I'll also include concise answers, while avoiding new terms and explanatory notes. I'll identify multiple types of questions as we go.\n\n**Inspecting structure and enumerations**\n\nI need to check the structure of the 53 enumerated blocks quickly. I\u2019ll focus on extracting the headings around each enumeration to better understand how they\u2019re organized. Once I have an overview, I can better proceed with analyzing the content and ensuring consistency across the sections.\n\n**Inspecting sections 2.1-2.5**\n\nI think I should replicate sections 2.1 to 2.5. To get started, I\u2019ll focus on inspecting section 2.1 first. I'll look for the structure around the first enumeration and take an excerpt to understand the setup. That way, I can be consistent as I move through the other sections.\n\n**Isolating section 2.1 practice questions**\n\nIt seems like section 2.1 has practice questions, possibly up to seven. To really understand, I\u2019ll check the count. The outer enumeration ended at 5421, so I need to isolate the portion of section 2.1 that includes just the practice questions. That way, I can focus on them properly.\n\n**Extracting practice question section**\n\nI need to focus on extracting just the practice questions from this section, as it also includes extra notes. I'll go ahead and isolate the outer enumeration for the practice questions, counting the questions by their pattern (label=Q). I\u2019ll parse through everything starting from \"Practice Questions\" to the end to get an accurate count and list.\n\n**Parsing the enumerate section from section 2.1**\n\nI\u2019ll start by counting braces to help pinpoint the beginning of the enumerate block in section 2.1. The goal is to find the first `\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\textbf{Q\\arabic*.}]` and extract everything until the matching end. That should give me just the practice questions from this section.\n\n**Counting outer enumerate items**\n\nThere are 37 occurrences of `'\\item '` in block 21, including subitems. It's likely the outer questions are around 7. To clarify, I'll count the outer `\\item` at depth 1. I can parse by scanning lines and using regex to match lines that start with `\\item` without prior spaces\u2014subitems have extra indentation. Let's go with counting `^\\item` lines.\n\n**Inspecting section 2.2 for question types**\n\nSection 2.1 has Q1-Q10, and sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 likely follow a similar pattern with practice sets. To make sure we have a full range, I'll need to devise 40 questions based on the scope and types in Exercises across sections 2.1-2.5. Let me start by inspecting section 2.2.\n\n**Examining section 2.2\u2019s questions**\n\nSection 2.2 includes 16 outer questions (Q1-Q16). The question types appear to involve evaluating without a calculator, word problems, filling in missing numbers, and using parentheses. I'll need to take a closer look at more of block 22 to confirm the question range and scope.\n\n**Clarifying section 2.2's question count**\n\nSection 2.2 has 13 outer questions, not 16. Earlier, I counted 16 items, but I think I may have miscounted because some entries had \\item at the start of the line within itemized lists, which my regex mistakenly counted as outer items. These miscounts likely inflated the total.\n\n**Clarifying item counting and section 2.3 question types**\n\nI need a more reliable way to count outer items. They're defined by '\\begin{enumerate}' at depth 1, but itemized lists nested within can cause confusion since they start with '\\item'. I'll refine the parsing to focus on outer items. For now, section 2.3 includes questions about multiplication, division, and combined operations with integers.\n\n**Summarizing section 2.3 and moving to section 2.4**\n\nSection 2.3 includes topics like multiplication/division rules, exponent precedence, roots, combined operations, and word problems. It also covers operations with fractions, scoring, and evaluating expressions. Now for section 2.4, which deals with rational, irrational, and real numbers. I\u2019ll take a closer look.\n\n**Reviewing section 2.4 and moving to 2.5**\n\nSection 2.4 covers topics like converting decimals to fractions, classifying rational/irrational numbers, ordering surds, and simplifying recurring decimals. Section 2.5 seems to focus on operations with real numbers, possibly including surd simplification and rationalization. I'll take a closer look at this next section.\n\n**Reviewing section 2.5 and preparing task**\n\nSection 2.5 covers operations with fractions, mixed/improper fractions, and decimal arithmetic, along with word problems and unit conversions. The task is to devise a set of 40 questions, keeping the style, difficulty, and vocabulary of the existing questions. I'll focus on staying consistent with the existing structure and terminology.\n\n**Preparing structure for 40 questions**\n\nI need to create 40 questions across sections 2.1-2.5, sticking closely to the existing terms and concepts from the notes. I'll likely break them down by concept within each section (e.g., 8 questions per section) and label each one with Q1, Q2, etc., ensuring concise answers follow. This structured approach should make it easier to organize.\n\n**Ensuring full coverage of topics and terminology**\n\nI need to make sure the questions cover a wide range of concepts: comparisons, word problems, number classifications, arithmetic, fractions, exponents, and more. I'll also need concise answers (final numbers or orders). I should avoid terms not listed in the notes, so I'll cross-check the vocabulary before finalizing.\n\n**Maintaining style and focus on context**\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to avoid using terms like \"absolute value,\" but \"distance from zero\" works. I won't introduce new contexts but will base questions on similar settings, like profit or bank balances. I need 40 questions with clear answers, no explanations, and follow the same formatting with subparts.\n\n**Formulating LaTeX output for questions and answers**\n\nI think using LaTeX makes sense since they provided a LaTeX file. To match the style, I\u2019ll provide the questions in LaTeX format with enumerations like \\section* and \\begin{enumerate}, without extra explanation. After the questions, I\u2019ll offer concise solutions in an enumerated answer key. I'll stick to providing just LaTeX code, no files.\n\n**Mirroring LaTeX style and formatting**\n\nThe user prefers no files, so I\u2019ll provide LaTeX code blocks they can copy. Each section uses \\section* and \\subsection*, with practice questions enumerated using the proper format, like \\textbf{Q\\arabic*}. For solutions, I\u2019ll match their style with labels and proper formatting (fractions, mixed numbers, decimals with negative signs). Let\u2019s check solution style.\n\n**Determining balance for 40 questions**\n\nFollowing the user\u2019s request, I'll divide the 40 questions across sections proportionally: 8 for 2.1, 10 for 2.2, 8 for 2.3, 6 for 2.4, and 8 for 2.5. This should cover the full range of question types. For answers, I\u2019ll make them concise, similar to the shown examples, keeping subanswers separated appropriately.\n\n**Ensuring consistent vocabulary and coverage**\n\nI\u2019ll include a broad range of question types: positive/negative, ordering/compare, time zones, word problems, arithmetic evaluation, fraction operations, and more\u2014following the requested coverage. I\u2019ll avoid introducing new terms like \"HCF\" unless it's already used in the references. I'll make sure to stick to the vocabulary and formatting exactly.\n\n**Avoiding unnecessary terminology**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the term \"ratio\" is used in the existing notes or questions. Since it might not be mentioned explicitly in the questions, it\u2019s probably best to avoid using it. I\u2019ll check the context again to make sure we\u2019re staying consistent with the terms already used.\n\n**Formatting practice questions and solutions**\n\nThe user seems to want a LaTeX snippet with a clean structure for the practice set, with sections and enumerations. I\u2019ll avoid adding extra explanatory notes since they likely just want the question list and answers. I can maintain the style with reset numbering per section but keeping 40 total questions. I'll make sure to structure everything neatly in LaTeX.\n\n**Handling question numbering consistency**\n\nThe user wants a set of 40 questions overall. While the original sections reset numbering, I might opt for global numbering from Q1-Q40 to avoid confusion. However, they might still expect the format with separate section labeling. I'll go with numbering Q1-Q40 overall to fit their request but mimic the section style where needed.\n\n**Designing questions for the new set**\n\nThe current format resets question numbers per section. If the user wants 40 questions total, we'll keep the same pattern: group by sections like 2.1 for 7, 2.2 for 9, and so on, adding up to 40. I'll ensure each section starts with Q1 to match the style in the original file and avoid duplicates.\n\n**Designing the question distribution**\n\nSince the numbering resets per section, I'll label answers by section (e.g., 2.1 Q1). Following the original structure, we can allocate 40 questions in a balanced way: 7 for 2.1, 8 for 2.2, 9 for 2.3, 7 for 2.4, and 9 for 2.5. Each section will include a variety of question types, like positive/negative contexts, comparisons, and word problems.\n\n**Question and term design across sections**\n\nFor section 2.3, I'll include concepts like multiplication/division, powers/roots, order of operations, and fractions. Section 2.4 will involve decimal-to-fraction conversion, rational/irrational classification, and approximations. Section 2.5 will focus on simplifying and working with fractions. I\u2019ll use standard units (m, cm, etc.) and common displays like $\\sqrt[3]{-216}$ and recurring decimals. I\u2019ll avoid new abbreviations, like BODMAS, as the worksheet doesn\u2019t introduce them explicitly.\n\n**Creating questions based on difficulty and consistent terms**\n\nFor section 2.1, I\u2019ll create 7 questions with clear, concise wording:\n\n- Q1: Lift below ground, initial position of -18; calculate position, change, and new position.\n- Q2: Given list of mixed numbers, ask for ascending order and comparison.\n- Q3: Identify the leftmost point on the number line, compare points, and list integers in between.\n- Q4: Insert appropriate symbols for inequalities.\n- Q5: Interpret negative temperature differences and find actual temperatures.\n- Q6: Calculate weekly profit/loss, identify greatest loss.\n- Q7: Scoreboard changes and final score, include negative score changes.\n\n**Refining 2.2 question structure**\n\nFor 2.2, I\u2019ll have 8 questions:\n\n- Q1: Simple addition/subtraction without a calculator\n- Q2: More complex addition/subtraction without a calculator\n- Q3: Solve for missing integer in equations\n- Q4: Evaluate expressions with brackets\n- Q5: Word problem involving submarine/diver's position and sequence of rises/dips\n- Q6: Convert between time zones (GMT+8, GMT-5)\n- Q7: Find sum and average of a list of numbers\n- Q8: Word problem with bank account transactions and balance\n\n**Refining 2.2 questions and adding midpoints**\n\nFor 2.2, we may need to include midpoint as it fits well within addition/subtraction. I'll leave it in but note that 2.5 will also cover midpoints between numbers as fractions. Here\u2019s the updated list for 2.2:\n\n1. Evaluate simple pair addition    \n2. Evaluate multi-term addition/subtraction  \n3. Solve for missing integer  \n4. Evaluate expressions with brackets  \n5. Missing integer with parentheses  \n6. Word problem with temperature or submersible  \n7. Time zones calculation  \n8. Bank account transactions  \n\n**Working on 2.3 questions**  \n\nFor 2.3, the questions should focus on the order of operations with multiplication, division, and roots. We\u2019ll have a few word problems, including situations like a robot moving. That should cover all necessary examples for this section. Here\u2019s the suggested breakdown:\n\n1. Evaluate simple multiplication/division expressions  \n2. Powers, roots, and dealing with negative exponents  \n3. Evaluate expressions with order of operations  \n4. Evaluate expressions with brackets/roots  \n5. Word problems: elevator descending, robot motions\n\n**Refining questions and considerations for Q6-Q9, and 2.4 structure**\n\nI could use a similar phrasing for certain word problems, like the lift descending at a rate. For Q6, I'll focus on the lowest possible score, given the quiz setup. For Q7, it'll be about inserting brackets for logical correctness in two expressions. Q8 should test power mistakes, and Q9 will deal with reciprocals.\n\nFor 2.4, I'd do these next:\n\n1. Simple fraction forms for decimals and mixed numbers  \n2. Fractions evaluated for terminating/recurring properties  \n3. Rational and irrational numbers from a list  \n4. Orders of irrational/decimal numbers  \n5. Recurring decimals as fractions  \n6. Rational or irrational numbers from calculations  \n7. Range of values for \u221a8, with conceptual context on irrational numbers\n\n**Adjusting section 2.5 to fit key concepts**\n\nI decided to scale down 2.5 to 8 questions, focusing on essential topics like fraction operations, decimals, and word problems. I\u2019ll include key operations like simplifications, conversions, and fractions with decimals. A unit conversion word problem might be a good alternative for Q7, but I\u2019ll stick to the essentials for now.\n\n**Final adjustments for section 2.5**\n\nFor section 2.5, I\u2019ve decided to keep the overall focus on fractions, decimals, and word problems. I\u2019ll merge some fraction operation questions to fit in 8 total, replacing the class fractions question with Nisa\u2019s more complex problem. I\u2019ll also adjust the jar mass and significant figures questions to ensure coverage of all key types.\n\n**Designing section 2.1 and 2.2 questions**\n\nFor section 2.1, I've designed a set of questions that cover different math concepts like position changes, order of numbers, and comparisons. I incorporated questions with slight adjustments to prevent complexity overload, including both fractions and negatives. Section 2.2 focuses on integer operations for addition and subtraction, with clear and manageable questions using simple arithmetic. Everything should yield neat results!\n\n**Designing section 2.3 questions**\n\nFor section 2.3, I\u2019ve crafted a variety of questions focusing on arithmetic operations, including multiplication, division, powers, roots, and exponents. The questions involve negative numbers, and expressions that need detailed evaluation without a calculator. I\u2019ve chosen operations like squaring negatives, cube roots, exponent multiplication, and more, ensuring clarity and manageable answers. Everything aligns well!\n\n**Balancing question structure and content**\n\nFor the final section, I\u2019m adjusting to ensure we have 9 outer questions, while also including a reciprocal question. I\u2019ll consider combining similar questions (like drone descends and water drains) to make room for the new content. This keeps the flow intact while fulfilling the prompt's requirements.\n\n**Finalizing question structure and balance**\n\nI've decided to keep both the drone problem and water drains but merged into a single question with four subparts. This ensures we have 9 total questions while maintaining variety. We\u2019ll also add a reciprocal question and adjust a few other areas to ensure everything flows well with distinct contexts and numerical variety.\n\n**Evaluating fractions for decimals**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating fractions to see if their decimals are terminating or recurring. For example, 3/40 is 0.075 (terminating), and 5/12 is 0.4166... (recurring). I\u2019ll show the decimals in the answers just to be clear, since the original solutions had decimals. Let\u2019s double-check the solutions.\n\n**Listing rational and irrational numbers**\n\nFor Q3, I'll list the rational and irrational numbers. Examples of rational numbers include 3.14, 0.\\overline{3}, -9, -7/4, and 5/6. Irrational numbers include sqrt(50) and pi/6. I think I\u2019ll avoid writing complicated factors for the irrational numbers, like sqrt(50) as 5*sqrt(2). Let me move on to the next question.\n\n**Arranging numbers and finding integers**\n\nFor Q4, I\u2019ve figured out the ascending order: -\u221a7 ( -2.65), -2.6, -2, 0.4, and \u221a3 (1.73). \n\nFor Q5, the integers are -8, 0, \u221a64 (which is 8), 3.0, and -12/(-4) (which equals 3). 11/2 and -\u221a5 are not integers.\n\nFor Q6, let\u2019s change up the repeating decimals to avoid duplication.\n\n**Reviewing rational vs. irrational numbers**\n\nFor Q7:\n- 6\u03c0/\u03c0 = 6 is rational.\n- \u221a18 / \u221a2 = \u221a9 = 3 is rational.\n- \u221a8 + \u221a50 = 7\u221a2 is irrational.\n- \u221a48 / 4 = \u221a3 is irrational.\n\nFor Q8:\n- \u221a8 is between 2 and 3, and \u221a8 \u2248 2.83.\n- \u221a15 is between 3 and 4, and \u221a15 \u2248 3.87. Both are correctly approximated.\n\n**Adding a conceptual part to Q8**\n\nI'm thinking of incorporating a conceptual question into Q8 (currently having parts a and b). In part (c), two students make claims: A says every irrational number is a real number, and B says every real number is rational. I\u2019ll include this in the same question to avoid increasing the count. I'll keep the vocabulary simple and avoid overcomplicating terms like \"rational.\"\n\n**Reorganizing and finalizing question structure**\n\nI\u2019m considering reworking the structure of Q8 and Q7. For clarity, I'll make Q7 about numerical approximations, focusing on finding approximations between integers. If Q8 instead becomes a conceptual statement question, then it will fit well without changing the total number of questions in the section. I'll make sure the flow is clear and logical.\n\n**Finalizing calculations for fractions and word problems**\n\nI\u2019ve worked through some fraction and decimal calculations. For example, in Q2 and Q3, the operations are finalizing correctly with answers like -1/12 and 3/5. I\u2019m also preparing the word problem for Q7, where I calculate Nisa\u2019s expenses, donations, and savings. The fraction work is consistent, and the steps seem good for clear answers overall!\n\n**Refining Nisa's money problem with simple fractions**\n\nI\u2019ve adjusted the problem scenario to use neat fractions. Nisa spends 1/5 on food, 1/8 on transport, and donates 1/3 of the remainder, which leads to simpler calculations. With exemplary integers for the saved amount of $270, the total comes to $600, yielding a clear solution for each part of the problem.\n\n**Adjusting Q8 for manageable calculation and including jar mass**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of adjusting Q8 to include both jar mass and calculator evaluation. The jar mass part is unique, but I\u2019ll include it with calculations in a way that keeps things clear and within the question limits. I could either combine them in Q8 or separate them to stay within the total count.\n\n**Evaluating section adjustments and including jar mass**\n\nI'm thinking about reducing section 2.1 by removing Q4 or 2.2 by dropping Q7, but I want to make sure the range of topics is still covered well. For jar mass, while it's unique, it\u2019s important for covering unit conversions, so it might be worth including\u2014though we could adjust other questions in the section to make space.\n\n**Adjusting question distribution and adding jar mass**\n\nI'm thinking about reducing section 2.1 by removing Q4 since comparisons are covered earlier, but it\u2019s a common type of question. Then, I could add jar mass conversion to 2.5. To keep the total at 40, I might reduce section 2.3 to 8 by merging bracket insertion and mistakes. This works for keeping variety while ensuring all topics are covered.\n\n**Finalizing questions and ensuring balance**\n\nI\u2019m considering dropping the \"score change\" question in 2.1 to reduce redundancy, as \"bank account\" in 2.2 covers a similar type. So, we\u2019ll keep 6 questions in 2.1, add jar mass conversion to 2.5, and finalize the math for accurate results. The total question count is now 40, which works!\n\n**Preparing systematic answers for computation**\n\nI\u2019m going to systematically compute the answers and prepare them in an organized way. To make sure everything is clear, I\u2019ll create a Python dictionary to keep track of the answer strings. This will help keep things tidy as I go along.\n\n**Choosing the best formatting for solutions**\n\nI think it\u2019s better to compute the proper formatting later, but I'll use LaTeX for fractions. For regular fractions, I\u2019ll use \\frac, since that's the common style in solutions. For mixed numbers (like \"3\\frac{13}{24}\") and recurring decimals (like 0.\\overline{296}), I'll handle those properly too. I'll generate a LaTeX code block for questions and solutions, even if the user might not strictly need it.\n\n**Crafting LaTeX for questions and solutions**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about creating a LaTeX snippet that includes section headings, and numbering for the questions and answers. I'll format it with sections like for 2.1, and give a clean layout with no explanatory notes, just headings and short instructions. The questions will be split into two parts: (A) questions with sections and (B) answers at the end. Let's prepare it this way!\n\n**Drafting LaTeX questions format**\n\nI\u2019m starting the LaTeX draft with section 2.1 about negative numbers and the number line. The first question involves a lift 18 meters below ground and asks the user to write its position using positive and negative numbers. The question then continues with an inquiry about the rise of the lift by 22 meters.\n\n**Drafting more LaTeX questions**\n\nThe next set of questions focuses on integers, fractions, and comparing numbers. There are exercises around arranging numbers in ascending order, comparing fractions, and determining the leftmost point on a number line. I'll continue to follow the pattern, using LaTeX to format these math questions clearly.\n\n**Finalizing Section 2.2 and adjusting coverage**\n\nI realize sum and average are missing from this set, which seems like a notable gap, especially since these are usually key concepts in this section. We haven't yet included the \"halfway between integers\" question, but it\u2019s already in another section, so let's focus on ensuring the sum and average are covered. I'll add that in.\n\n**Adjusting question distribution and including sum/average**\n\nIt looks like our current set may benefit from including a sum/average question, especially since that's a key concept often expected. To avoid increasing the total number, I can replace one of the other existing questions, like Q2 (the one with three terms), and add a sum/average question instead. This should maintain the set's structure.\n\n**Revising questions for section 2.2**\n\nOkay, I think it\u2019s best to revise 2.2 by replacing the second missing integer question with a sum/average and midpoint question. This will keep the total at 8 questions. So the revised set includes simple operations, multi-term operations, missing integer, evaluations, sum/average, word problem, and time zone, which looks good. Time to finalize the sum/average question!\n\n**Finalizing question structure and answer precision**\n\nI\u2019ve decided on the sum/average question: the sum is 6, and the average is 1. Now, the total number of questions in section 2.2 is set to 8. For Section 2.3, I want to include that \"lowest possible score\" question, and we'll focus on accurate answers, especially with fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals. I'll craft all the necessary answers now.\n\n**Finalizing section formatting and answers**\n\nI\u2019ve completed the answers for sections 2.2 and 2.3. For section 2.2, the sum and average question gives a sum of 6 and an average of 1. The time zone calculations look good, and the bank account balance is clear too. Now, I\u2019ll ensure all answers are consistent and double-check everything for accuracy.\n\n**Finalizing answers for section 2.4**\n\nFor section 2.4, I\u2019ve finalized the answers, including handling decimal and fraction conversions, and adjusting for recurring decimals. For the rational for irrational question classifications, I\u2019ve identified the proper terms. Also, I\u2019ve streamlined the integer list, removing duplicates when needed. Now, I\u2019ll check everything again to make sure it all aligns.\n\n**Organizing and finalizing answers for various questions**\n\nFor question 8, between consecutive integers and sqrt approximations: \u221a8 \u2248 2.83 and \u221a15 \u2248 3.87 are accurate.\n\nFor Q9, I recognized a mistake in statement phrasing and will clarify the rational and irrational number discussion using examples like \u221a2.\n\nFor Section 2.5, questions are calculated based on fraction conversions, arithmetic, and simplifying problems, ensuring accuracy throughout.\n\n**Final check for significant figures and choosing expressions**\n\nFor 35.1051298122, rounding to 5 significant figures gives 35.105. Examined carefully, the digit following is 1, so it stays as 35.105. Next, for the fifth root expression, I got 7.1952. I'll calculate the fifth root of that value next.\n\n**Confirming significant figures and using consistent notation**\n\nFor 1.4839, rounding to 5 significant figures confirms that it stays the same\u20141.4839. For the root expression, I made sure to use the correct style with parentheses and thin spaces, like the original example. Now, I\u2019ll present the answers: (a) 35.105 and (b) 1.4839, keeping everything consistent.\n\n**Confirming significant figures and preparing concise answers**\n\nFor the significant figures, I'll follow a similar style. For 35.105, no trailing zero is needed, but for 1.4839, I\u2019ll include the trailing zero. I'll also use the symbol \"\u2248\" for approximations. To keep everything concise, I'll include the solutions in a \u201cSolutions\u201d section after the questions, ensuring they match the user\u2019s request.\n\n**Aligning with instructions and standardizing format**\n\nTo keep everything consistent with their instructions, I'll make sure the answers follow the same structure as the original, using terms like \"overall loss,\" \"terminating,\" \"recurring,\" etc. I will avoid introducing new mathematical terms and use abbreviations like \"GMT\" without redefining them, since they're already present in the questions.\n\n**Considering abbreviation use and terminology**\n\nHmm, the instructions say to define abbreviations like \"GMT\" before using them, but I also need to stick to the vocabulary used in the notes. \"Greenwich Mean Time\" might add a new term that\u2019s not in the text, so I\u2019ll check if \"Greenwich\" shows up in the material.\n\n**Deciding on abbreviation use and formatting**\n\nGiven the instructions, it\u2019s best to stick with \"GMT\" as used in the original file and avoid expanding it to \"Greenwich Mean Time.\" Since the user wants concise answers, I\u2019ll simply keep it as \"GMT\" without defining it. I'll also provide a code block where appropriate and ensure exactly 40 questions.\n\n**Verifying terms and question count**\n\nI\u2019ve double-checked the question count and it adds up to 40, which is great. Next, I\u2019m scanning for terms we've used, like \"coldest to warmest\" and \"drone descends,\" and confirming they are included. \"Holds\" and \"hence\" weren\u2019t used, but everything else checks out. Now I\u2019ll finalize the LaTeX and answer key accordingly.\n\n**Reviewing terms and preparing the answer key**\n\nI\u2019ll make sure no new math terms, like \"simplify\" and \"reciprocal,\" are introduced incorrectly. Drone is fine, instead of robot, which works. Now, I need to prepare the answer key with the correct formatting. I\u2019ll compute all the answers using fractions for accuracy before finalizing the answers.\n\n**Computing closest to zero without using the term \"absolute value\"**\n\nI need to find the closest number to zero, so I\u2019ll just compute the absolute values but avoid directly stating \"absolute value.\" Instead, I'll use the \u201cabs\u201d function to make the calculations without introducing extra terms. This should work!\n\n**Choosing values based on constraints**\n\nFor Q3, I'm picking 0 because it\u2019s between -0.8 and 1.6, and it's the most fitting integer. For Q4, I need to focus on the signs. It's really all about sticking to the instructions while ensuring everything makes sense in the context of the task.\n\n**Checking executed cells and recomputing**\n\nIt seems like I lost the variable because of a cell error. The temperature variables were defined, but there might've been an issue if the cell wasn\u2019t executed properly. I'll check the previous cell to make sure it ran, and then I\u2019ll recompute to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Sorting from coldest to warmest**\n\nTo arrange from coldest to warmest, I\u2019ll sort the temperatures in ascending order. This way, the lowest temperature will be first and the highest last. It\u2019s straightforward: I\u2019ll ensure I use the correct sorting function to handle this.\n\n**Calculating profit/loss for Q6**\n\nFor this, I need to sum up 120 \u2212 80 \u2212 45 + 60 \u2212 155. I\u2019ll do it step by step: starting with 120 \u2212 80 to get 40, then subtract 45 to get -5, add 60 to get 55, and finally subtract 155 to get the final result. Let\u2019s compute that and verify.\n\n**Checking Q3 for missing values**\n\nIt looks like Q3 is missing some details, like \\( x = 23 \\). I need to check if there are any other variables or information I need to include for this problem. Let me double-check and make sure I don't miss anything.\n\n**Calculating Q5 sum and average**\n\nI\u2019ll calculate the sum and average of the numbers in the list [-8, 14, -5, -11, 20, -4]. First, I\u2019ll add them up: -8 + 14 + (-5) + (-11) + 20 + (-4). Then, I\u2019ll divide by the number of values to find the average. Time for some quick math!\n\n**Calculating final value for submersible**\n\nI\u2019ll first sum the number \u201c6\u201d and then calculate the average, which seems to be \u201c1\u201d. Afterward, I need to calculate the value for Q6, with the final result being -115. Time to do the math and confirm if I\u2019m computing everything correctly!\n\n**Handling time zone conversions and computing bank account**\n\nThe time zone difference is 9 hours. When it\u2019s 3:50 PM, adding 9 hours gives us 12:50 AM the next day. Now, for the second case, 7:15 AM minus 9 hours is 10:15 PM the previous day. And finally, it looks like I need to compute something for a bank account.\n\n**Computing expressions and validating integer inputs**\n\nb and c should be integers, so I'll use the int function to ensure that. For Q2, I need to compute expressions like -4^2 and others. I\u2019ll verify the operations closely, as raising negative numbers to powers can sometimes show unexpected results\u2014so I\u2019ll make sure to get them right!\n\n**Evaluating expressions and handling computations**\n\nWhen I take the cube root of a negative number with a fractional power, it gives a complex result, so I'll stick with c = -5 manually. Moving on, for d, -math.sqrt(196) gives -14. For e, I calculate (-3)^2 * (-3)^3 = 9 * -27 = -243. As for Q3, 12 - 5\u00d7(-3) + 36 \u00f7 (-9) gives 23, as computed earlier.\n\n**Simplifying Q4 expression**\n\nFor Q4, I need to simplify: ((-6)^2 - sqrt(64)) / (-4) + 5. First, (-6)^2 is 36, and sqrt(64) is 8, so I get (36 - 8) / (-4) + 5. That\u2019s 28 / (-4) + 5, which simplifies to -7 + 5, resulting in -2.\n\n**Computing Q5 drone descent**\n\nFor Q5, the drone descends at -28*120, which equals -3360. Then, starting from 4200, I add -3360, giving me a result of 840. That\u2019s the current position I\u2019ve computed. Let me process further and confirm if anything else needs adjusting or if this is all!\n\n**Computing Q6 reciprocal**\n\nFor Q6, the reciprocal question involves x = -5/4. I\u2019ll need to flip this fraction to find the reciprocal. That would be -4/5. From here, I\u2019ll analyze the problem and proceed with any other necessary calculations. Let\u2019s move forward.\n\n**Reviewing calculations for Q9 and fractions**\n\nFor Q8, I\u2019ll do the same as before with brackets. For Q9, the calculation with -3^4 gives -81 since it's -(3^4). However, (-3)^4 results in 81, as the negative sign is outside the parentheses. For Section 2.4, I\u2019ve confirmed the fractions: 0.84 = 21/25, -2.125 = -17/8, 1.06 = 53/50, and 5 1/3 = 16/3.\n\n**Confirming fraction simplification**\n\nTo convert -2.125 as a fraction, I start with -2125/1000 and simplify it by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 125. This gives me -17/8, which is the simplified form. So, everything checks out."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 20m
