Due to the limitations of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle, Juice cannot travel directly to Jupiter. Instead, its trajectory involves multiple gravity assists, with the unprecedented step of a double Moon-Earth flyby. On August 19, 2024, Juice flew by the Moon, refining its path for an Earth flyby on August 20, 2024. This course correction optimizes the probe's trajectory for an encounter with Venus in 2025 and subsequently additional Earth flybys in 2026 and 2029, before arriving at Jupiter in 2031. This complex navigation, supported by precise tracking, allows for fuel conservation and ensures the accuracy of the probe's instruments in preparation for its scientific mission. The Moon-Earth flyby is particularly crucial, providing a unique opportunity to calibrate Juice's instruments, crucial for the intensive operations awaiting at Jupiter.

The implementation of AI has drastically reduced customer support waiting times and problem resolution durations while maintaining customer satisfaction. Klarna continues to explore the use of AI in areas like credit decisions but is cautious due to the need for reliability and fairness.

Apple's penalty resulted from its restrictions that discouraged app developers from using outside distribution channels and informing users about alternative, cheaper purchasing options. The European Commission found these limitations unnecessary and harmful to competition. Apple must now eliminate technical and commercial barriers within 60 days or face further fines.\n\nMeta was fined for its \"Consent or Pay\" model initiated in November 2023, which offered ad-free access to Facebook and Instagram for a fee and free access with data tracking. The Commission concluded the model limited user choices regarding data usage and did not comply with DMA regulations during the period between March and November 2024. Although Meta revised its model to include a less invasive ad option, regulators are still assessing its compliance. Critics argue the new version leads to poor user experience and subtly coerces users into accepting full tracking. Both companies have indicated plans to challenge or further adapt their business models following the EU's regulatory actions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745424081.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/record-45-bln-eu-fine-punished-its-innovation-google-tells-eu-court-2025-01-28/","title":"Record EU fine punished Google's innovation, it tells court ... - Reuters","snippet":"A record EU antitrust fine of 4.3-billion-euro ($4.5 billion) imposed on Google seven years ago punished the tech giant over its innovation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1738022400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-wins-challenge-against-149-bln-euro-eu-antitrust-fine-2024-09-18/","title":"Google wins EU antitrust fine fight but setback for Qualcomm","snippet":"El autor de la noticia proporciona detalles sobre dos casos recientes de antitrust en la Uni\u00f3n Europea.

Apple's penalty resulted from its restrictions that discouraged app developers from using outside distribution channels and informing users about alternative, cheaper purchasing options. The European Commission found these limitations unnecessary and harmful to competition. Apple must now eliminate technical and commercial barriers within 60 days or face further fines.\n\nMeta was fined for its \"Consent or Pay\" model initiated in November 2023, which offered ad-free access to Facebook and Instagram for a fee and free access with data tracking. The Commission concluded the model limited user choices regarding data usage and did not comply with DMA regulations during the period between March and November 2024. Although Meta revised its model to include a less invasive ad option, regulators are still assessing its compliance. Critics argue the new version leads to poor user experience and subtly coerces users into accepting full tracking.

complex trade dynamics. Former President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have incentives to negotiate amid crippling tariffs\u2014145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. products\u2014but skepticism remains high. A similar \"Phase One\" deal from 2020, which failed to achieve its goals, casts doubt on future pacts. The U.S. trade deficit with China persists despite a shift in supply chains through other Asian nations. Compounding the problem, Washington\u2019s increasing restrictions on Chinese technology, framed as national security measures, signal a hardening stance. Policies from both Trump and President Biden target Chinese firms in key sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles. The U.S. now follows a \"small yard, high fence\" approach, tightening tech controls while limiting cooperation. Moreover, China\u2019s large manufacturing capacity and ambitions for tech dominance under the \"Made in China 2025\" plan further fuel Western concerns. Trump's strategy to unite allies like India and Japan against China may worsen tensions. Even if a temporary truce is reached, deep mistrust and the potential for renewed sanctions will continue to strain global economic stability.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745448820.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-issues-temporary-rules-generative-ai-services-2023-07-13/","title":"China says generative AI rules to apply only to products for the public","snippet":"The rules, set to take effect on Aug. 15 and which Beijing described as \"interim\", come after authorities signalled the end of their years-long ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1689292800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-says-new-rule-will-weaken-us-leadership-ai-2025-01-13/","title":"Nvidia faces revenue threat from new U.S. AI chip export ... - Reuters","snippet":"Nvidia faces a significant revenue threat due to the latest U.S. export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips, designed to limit the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1736726400.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai","title":"AI Act | Shaping Europe's digital future - European Union","snippet":"The AI Act entered into force on 1 August 2024, and will be fully applicable 2 years later on 2 August 2026, with some exceptions: prohibitions and AI literacy ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"Shaping Europe\u2019s digital future"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi","title":"The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)","snippet":"The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) summarised indicators on Europe's digital performance and tracked the progress of EU countries.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1722988800.0,"attribution":"Shaping Europe\u2019s digital future"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mckinsey.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai","title":"The State of AI: Global survey - McKinsey","snippet":"AI use continues to climb\u200b\u200b Reported use of AI increased in 2024. 3.

This represents a significant lead over other surveyed regions, with the United States at 65% and a global average of 54%. The survey included decision-makers from various industries such as banking, healthcare, and telecommunications. China\u2019s rapid progress in generative AI follows the global attention generated by ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in late 2022. Additionally, a report from the World Intellectual Property Organization indicates that China leads in generative AI patent filings, with over 38,000 patents compared to 6,276 by the U.S. This growth is fueled by Chinese tech giants and startups, amidst constraints on international providers like OpenAI. Moreover, China is also advancing in continuous automated monitoring (CAM), which enables extensive data collection and analysis on user behavior, raising privacy concerns due to the proprietary and opaque nature of the technology\u2019s algorithms and processes.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1720526916.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/why-china-may-struggle-unlock-power-ai-2025-02-25/","title":"Why China may struggle to unlock the power of AI","snippet":"Artificial intelligence is positioned to play a crucial role in China's drive to establish itself as a great power, as evidenced by its \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan\" aiming for global leadership in AI by 2030. However, several challenges could impede this ambition. Firstly, China's persistence in maintaining control through the Communist Party's regulations, such as censorship and political adherence, may hinder technological advancements. Additionally, China faces a \"diffusion deficit,\" a concept emphasized by Jeffrey Ding, indicating that innovations may struggle to integrate broadly across industries due to weak skill infrastructure. Historical parallels with Japan highlight potential setbacks from talent gaps. Despite having a large pool of engineers and scientists, Chinese firms lag in technological adoption. Xi Jinping's push for innovation, while significant, might also be undermined by inefficiencies bred from top-down industrial planning. While AI holds potential to boost China's productivity by 8% over the next decade, surpassing the U.S.'s 15% increase seems unlikely without education reform and greater freedom for private enterprises.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1740443264.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/how-china-can-keep-pace-global-ai-race-2025-01-24/","title":"How China can keep pace in the global AI race","snippet":"In recent years, China has made significant strides in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race, despite facing restrictive sanctions from the U.S. and its allies. Key achievements include Huawei's launch of a high-tech smartphone with a domestic chip and DeepSeek's development of a competitive large language model. By directing substantial financial resources to AI through subsidies and grants, and by focusing heavily on R&D, Chinese companies are developing alternative solutions to overcome the lack of access to advanced foreign technologies.\n\nManufacturing giants like SMIC have made progress in producing advanced chips, while companies like Cambricon Technologies are poised to fill the void caused by decreased access to NVIDIA's GPUs. Additionally, China's significant deployment of industrial robots and widespread AI adoption across business sectors further bolster its position. Militarily, China's AI capabilities are evolving, with advancements in drone technology and other AI applications, closing the gap with the U.S.\n\nUltimately, China's growing AI industry promises substantial economic benefits and may challenge the West's technological dominance, despite continued geopolitical hurdles and technological constraints.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1737677189.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-adoption-increasing-sales-telecoms-sector-nvidia-report-shows-2024-02-15/","title":"AI adoption increasing sales in telecoms sector, Nvidia report shows","snippet":"Some 66% of the survey's respondents said their companies would boost AI investment in 2024, up from 47% in the survey done a year earlier.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1707955200.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/if-ai-doesnt-kill-your-company-it-will-make-it-stronger-study-shows-2025-04-01/","title":"If AI doesn't kill your company, it will make it stronger, study shows","snippet":"McElheran and colleagues worked on a sample of 30,000 firms among which AI adoption rose from 7.5% to 9.1% over the course of the study period.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743465600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-sanction-hit-tech-industry-puzzles-over-impact-trump-harris-presidencies-2024-11-01/","title":"China's sanction-hit tech industry puzzles over impact of Trump, Harris presidencies","snippet":"Chinese tech industry faces uncertainty regarding the impact of U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Trump's unpredictable style could either exacerbate or ease sanctions on China's technology sector, while Harris is expected to continue the current administration's policies, focusing on incremental changes and international collaboration to counter China's growth. Trump's past tariffs and sanctions notably affected companies like Huawei and SMIC. Despite challenges, China has increased self-sufficiency, implementing numerous government projects to replace foreign technology with domestic alternatives. Both Trump's aggressive trade policies and Harris' potential for stable, long-term restrictions present distinct challenges for China's semiconductor industry. Analysts note that Trump's erratic policies might encounter resistance from global allies, potentially serving Chinese interests. Ultimately, Chinese tech executives aim to navigate these uncertainties by advancing their technological capabilities independently.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1730449600.0,"attribution":"Reuters"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-rushes-launch-new-ai-model-china-goes-all-2025-02-25/","title":"DeepSeek rushes to launch new AI model as China goes all in","snippet":"DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model, which outperformed several Western competitors and triggered a significant sell-off in global equities markets. The R2 model, initially planned for early May, aims to enhance coding and improve reasoning in multiple languages. DeepSeek's success is built on cost-effective AI models using less-powerful Nvidia chips, differing from the costly approaches of U.S. tech giants. The company operates with a collaborative, flat management style, and its founder, Liang Wenfeng, emphasizes research over app development. DeepSeek's R2 model could disrupt the AI industry, prompting global companies to accelerate their AI efforts. Meanwhile, the U.S. government may view this development with concern, as it has prioritized AI leadership. Despite potential challenges due to restrictions on high-end AI chips, China's support for DeepSeek continues to grow, with numerous companies and government bodies integrating its models into their systems.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1740529800.0,"attribution":"Reuters"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.scmp.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3262535/asia-pacifics-advanced-economies-lag-their-less-developed-peers-ai-take-deloitte-survey-finds","title":"Asia-Pacific's advanced economies lag less developed peers in AI ...","snippet":"Mainland China, India, and Southeast Asia have a 30 per cent higher share of GenAI users compared to Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1715644800.0,"attribution":"South China Morning Post"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6809a01aaee48007acc01950d20a35bc","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"caee3646-88d9-4c99-ba89-00e8d0112e38","request_id":"93521f957b4b8998-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"caee3646-88d9-4c99-ba89-00e8d0112e38","children":["68e21cee-b4f3-4226-88bf-d0c0d0019430"]},"68e21cee-b4f3-4226-88bf-d0c0d0019430":{"id":"68e21cee-b4f3-4226-88bf-d0c0d0019430","message":{"id":"68e21cee-b4f3-4226-88bf-d0c0d0019430","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745461311.154321,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for EU AI Act compliance cost","content":"I need more information on the EU AI Act\u2019s impact, specifically regarding compliance costs.
