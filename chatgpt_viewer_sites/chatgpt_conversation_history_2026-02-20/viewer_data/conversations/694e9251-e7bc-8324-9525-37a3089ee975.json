RN MP Jean-Philippe Tanguy is preparing a bill to establish brothels operated as worker cooperatives, claiming this would improve safety and rights for sex workers. He argues the current abolitionist legal framework, particularly the 2016 law that penalizes clients, has worsened conditions by forcing prostitution underground. Tanguy is supported by RN leaders Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, although the proposal could face internal resistance from conservative factions.\n\nThe initiative contrasts with past RN stances, which focused on combating foreign trafficking rather than regulating sex work. Tanguy stresses that the model he proposes eliminates pimps and empowers sex workers. The plan, however, faces criticism both from abolitionist groups and sex worker advocates, including STRASS, who support cooperatives but reject any association with the far right due to their anti-migrant positions.\n\nOther political figures, like LR MP Philippe Juvin, also seek to regulate sex work for safety and work rights, citing Belgium\u2019s model as an example. The debate exemplifies broader tensions over prostitution policy, public morality, and worker autonomy in France.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1765234414.0,"attribution":"www.lemonde.fr"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_694e929348d083278df3d7d522d45095","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for sources on brothels and gentrification","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"1e923411-f6b5-4b37-9e9e-792a43d33e1a","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ece7d1a8-da47-4c98-855b-10257938cb92","turn_exchange_id":"65264567-4219-4d95-b47d-baffd81bc299","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ece7d1a8-da47-4c98-855b-10257938cb92","children":["a5b3c23b-6964-4f91-8cf5-9c929675327d"]},"a5b3c23b-6964-4f91-8cf5-9c929675327d":{"id":"a5b3c23b-6964-4f91-8cf5-9c929675327d","message":{"id":"a5b3c23b-6964-4f91-8cf5-9c929675327d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766757125.277126,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Summarizing current status of Petain Road and Geylang","content":"According to NLB Infopedia, Geylang saw most brothels move out by the 21st century, with around 10 still in operation in 2003.

A Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy case study summarises this logic (and quotes a 1999 ministerial view that moving brothels out of Desker Road would \u201ccreate new problems\u201d), while describing expected controls (indoors-only operations, enforcement, patrols, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view6\ue201\n\nHistorically, this containment approach is also tied to public health: Singapore introduced a **Medical Surveillance Scheme** in 1976 to control sexually transmitted infections among commercial sex workers via regular screening. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search9\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Origins: why these places, and why \u201cred-light streets\u201d emerged at all\n\nIn colonial Singapore, the core drivers were:\n- **Demography (gender imbalance) + migrant labour**: BiblioAsia notes an extreme skew (e.g., one female to 14 males in 1860) and explains that colonial administrators sanctioned brothels to meet \u201cneeds\u201d of a male-heavy population. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search27\ue201  \n- **Early geographic clustering**: Brothels concentrated in specific streets (notably in and around Chinatown). For example, NLB\u2019s entry on Smith Street states it was a red-light area with at least 25 brothels in 1901. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search2\ue201  \n- **Transnational sex markets**: BiblioAsia documents Japanese \u201ckarayuki-san\u201d prostitution networks and notes brothels on Malay Street around 1877; Smith Street also appears as a prostitution haunt in the early 20th century. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search6\ue202turn10search4\ue201  \n\nOver time, policing, urban renewal, and land-use planning pushed visible vice to **more containable edges**\u2014and later, digital channels reduced the need for a fixed street presence (a point echoed in contemporary reporting on Geylang). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 1) Geylang\n\n### Origins (as a place)\nURA\u2019s conservation history frames Geylang as an area that shifted from **agricultural settlement** into a mixed Chinese/Malay district, then an **entertainment belt** (e.g., Happy World/Gay World amusement park started in 1936 and closed in the 1970s). \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201  \nIt developed a \u201clorong\u201d (lane) urban fabric with shophouses and bungalows (1910s\u20131950s) that still shapes how street-level businesses cluster today. \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201\n\n### Evolution into Singapore\u2019s main red-light district\nBy the late 20th century, **Geylang** became the best-known area for regulated brothels. CNA\u2019s \u201cBig Read\u201d states it is common knowledge that the **even-numbered lorongs** are home to brothels, and that brothels must obtain a licence to operate. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201\n\n### Recent evolution (policy + neighbourhood change)\nCNA reports:\n- **No official public number** of brothels; media estimates exist but aren\u2019t official. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n- Residents perceive fewer illegal \u201cstreetwalkers\u201d (especially post-pandemic). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n- The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) **rezoned** a bounded area in 2015 due to \u201cspillover of disamenities and friction\u201d amid rising residential development\u2014evidence that planning policy has been used to manage mixed-use tensions. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n\n### Current status (late-2024/2025 picture)\n- Still the **central, most visible** locus of regulated brothels; stigma persists even as some public-order issues are perceived to have improved. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n- A Straits Times feature (2025) describes the regulated brothel ecosystem in Geylang in order-of-magnitude terms (hundreds to ~1,000 workers; 100+ brothels), but explicitly notes the absence of official statistics and reliance on anecdotal counts. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n# 2) Desker Road (and the Jalan Besar/Little India fringe)\n\n### Why it became a \u201ctraditional\u201d vice pocket\nDesker Road sits near long-standing gathering/transport corridors around Little India/Jalan Besar\u2014areas that historically brought large flows of single men (including migrant workers) and late-night economies.\n\nA widely-cited account (Mothership, 2017) argues Desker/Rowell became associated with transgender sex work partly through **spillover/displacement** from older nightlife/vice zones (e.g., Bugis Street/Johore Road) as enforcement and redevelopment intensified. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \nTreat that as a synthesis narrative rather than an official account, but it aligns with the broader \u201ccontain vs disperse\u201d logic in public policy.\n\n### Containment policy signal\nThe LKYSPP case study is unusually explicit about the state\u2019s reasoning for not relocating brothels out of Desker Road: it quotes the 1999 position that dispersal would create new problems and describes the expectation that vice be kept **indoors**, with enforcement against street solicitation and other spillovers. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view6\ue201\n\n### Current status\n- Desker Road is still referenced in recent journalism as part of Singapore\u2019s broader sex-trade map (including activity linked to South Asian communities around Little India). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201  \n- At street level, it is also very much a **mixed neighbourhood** (heritage shophouses, F&B, proximity to tourist/cultural zones), not a single-purpose \u201cred light street\u201d in the way outsiders sometimes imagine.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Petain Road (Jalan Besar Conservation Area)\n\n### Origins (built heritage + urban form)\nURA\u2019s Jalan Besar conservation write-up explicitly includes the **ornate terrace houses along Petain Road** and situates the wider area in late-19th/early-20th-century development and streetscapes. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view5\ue201  \nThis matters: the architecture (tight, low-rise terraces) makes Petain Road feel very different from Geylang\u2019s lorong grid.\n\n### How it became associated with sex work\nPublicly available *documented* history here is thinner than for Geylang/Keong Saik. The most detailed accounts tend to be journalistic/feature rather than archival.\n\nRice Media describes Petain Road as a small, older cluster\u2014**daytime** operations, comparatively \u201cplain sight,\u201d and locally nicknamed \u201cKin Chio Kar\u201d (\u201cfoot of the banana\u201d) tied to earlier cultivation patterns; it also implies that only a small remnant of the older brothel row remains. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n### Current status (best described as \u201cresidual + opaque\u201d)\n- Petain Road today is *primarily* known publicly for its conserved streetscape, not as a mainstream nightlife/vice destination. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view5\ue201  \n- Claims about current brothel numbers/activity exist, but reliable, up-to-date public reporting is sparse compared with Geylang. The safest assessment is: **smaller-scale and lower-visibility** than Geylang, and heavily shaped by conservation-era land use and neighbourhood scrutiny. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \n\n---\n\n# 4) Keong Saik Road (Chinatown)\n\n### Origins: from business street to entertainment to red-light\nBiblioAsia gives one of the clearest \u201chow it happened\u201d accounts:\n- Keong Saik Road wasn\u2019t originally red-light; in the **1930s**, clan associations and wholesalers set up offices there.  \n- Post-meeting entertainment demand led to \u201centertainment houses,\u201d which over time shifted toward vice (including opium dens), transforming the area into a red-light district. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view4\ue201  \n\n### Peak and coexistence with ordinary life\nBiblioAsia emphasises that even in the 1970s\u201380s, the area was a functioning neighbourhood with shops and services alongside brothels. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view4\ue201\n\n### Gentrification and \u201cpost red-light\u201d identity\nBy 2019, lifestyle coverage (Time Out) presents Keong Saik\u2019s dominant identity as **food, bars, offices, and boutique hospitality**, explicitly contrasting it with its 1960s-era red-light reputation. \ue200cite\ue202turn16view0\ue201  \nBiblioAsia similarly describes Keong Saik Road today as a trendy wine-and-dine street in restored shophouses. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view4\ue201\n\n### Current status\nKeong Saik is best understood as **a former red-light street that has been substantially gentrified**\u2014with its past now more a matter of heritage memory and occasional narrative tourism than a visible, dominant street economy. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view4\ue202turn16view0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## What\u2019s changed overall (and what hasn\u2019t)\n\n**Changed**\n- **Urban planning and rezoning** increasingly manage the friction of mixed uses (Geylang is the clearest recent example). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n- **Visibility**: street solicitation seems lower in some areas; vice activity can move online, reducing the need for street presence. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n- **Gentrification**: Keong Saik is the archetype of \u201cvice to nice,\u201d while Petain and parts of Jalan Besar are increasingly \u201cheritage-first.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn7view4\ue202turn7view5\ue202turn16view0\ue201  \n\n**Not changed**\n- The state\u2019s basic stance remains a **containment-and-control** model: keep it bounded, reduce spillovers, enforce against what it sees as most socially harmful, and avoid dispersal that multiplies enforcement problems. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view6\ue201  \n\nIf you want, I can also map this into a **timeline** (pre-war \u2192 post-war \u2192 containment era \u2192 gentrification/online shift) with the key inflection points for each street."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200i\ue202turn14image6\ue202turn14image0\ue202turn14image10\ue202turn15image4\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":56,"safe_urls":["https://cw-gbl-gws-prod.azureedge.net/-/media/cw/apac/singapore/news/row-of-three-freehold-shophouses-image.jpg?hash=A97639F4F137CC076FEEFF36BB08117E&rev=b5d91c832d474201a69783c5d8b7541b","https://img.tepcdn.com/img-style/simplecrop_article/81778311.jpg","https://media.timeout.com/images/105403138/630/472/image.jpg","https://remembersingapore.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/petain-road-chinese-baroque-terrace-houses2.jpg?w=640","https://remembersingapore.org/2019/12/29/petain-road-terrace-houses/","https://remembersingapore.org/2019/12/29/petain-road-terrace-houses/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.0qiG-QnPhKxZggziOG32pQHaE_?pid=Api","https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.0R3Ja7U_Tv5xhtTmVPsuqgHaFq?pid=Api","https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.wjqn57kXojWHJWuh3WvL8gHaE8?pid=Api","https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.XPu8dxgsDp2Lt_j2dio5dQHaFj?pid=Api","https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/singapore/news/2024/03/row-of-three-freehold-shophouses-along-geylang-road-sold","https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/singapore/news/2024/03/row-of-three-freehold-shophouses-along-geylang-road-sold?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/portfolio-nine-conservation-shophouses-desker-road-rowell-road-sale-66-mil","https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/portfolio-nine-conservation-shophouses-desker-road-rowell-road-sale-66-mil?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/the-ultimate-guide-to-keong-saik-road","https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/the-ultimate-guide-to-keong-saik-road?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":6},{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":14,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":10},{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"image","ref_index":4}],"alt":"[![Row
