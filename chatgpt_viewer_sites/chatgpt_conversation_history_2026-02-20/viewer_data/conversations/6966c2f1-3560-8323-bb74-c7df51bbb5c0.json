Apple Is Why.","snippet":"Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to sell a significant portion of Apple stock may have cost Berkshire Hathaway approximately $50 billion in unrealized gains, according to Barron\u2019s. Between 2016 and 2018, Berkshire acquired around 1 billion shares of Apple at an average price of $35. Most of the holding was sold in 2024 and 2025 at an estimated average price of $185, significantly below Apple\u2019s current price of $262.24. By June 30, 2025, Berkshire\u2019s Apple holdings had fallen to 280 million shares from 906 million at the end of 2023.\n\nThe sale generated roughly $96 billion in pretax gains but also resulted in nearly $20 billion in corporate income tax, lowering net proceeds to around $155 per share. Buffett cited concern over higher corporate taxes and the large size of the Apple stake as reasons for the sale. Some speculate he also aimed to strengthen Berkshire\u2019s cash position, which stood at over $330 billion mid-2025, ahead of his retirement.\n\nApple was previously described by Buffett as a \u201cpillar\u201d of Berkshire\u2019s value, suggesting it would be a long-term holding. The Apple sale, along with similar moves involving Bank of America, appears to have negatively impacted Berkshire\u2019s performance, with its stock up 9% in 2025 versus the S&P 500\u2019s 16%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1760997600.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-957a00c2","title":"Berkshire Sold 25% of Its Apple Stock in the Third Quarter","snippet":"In the third quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway sold 100 million shares of Apple, reducing its stake by 25% to 300 million shares. This follows a nearly 50% reduction in the second quarter, cutting the investment down from its peak of 905 million shares at the start of the year. The decision appears to be driven by Apple\u2019s high valuation\u2014trading at 30 times expected earnings\u2014and a strategic rebalancing of Berkshire's portfolio, where Apple had previously comprised about 45%. Despite the sales, Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest equity holding, now worth approximately $67 billion, accounting for under 25% of its $300 billion portfolio. The Apple shares were originally purchased at about $35 each between 2016 and 2018, and with the stock closing at $222.91 on the last trading day of the quarter, Berkshire has realized massive gains, estimated between $15 to $20 billion on the Apple sales alone. Cumulatively in 2024, the company reported $76.5 billion in investment gains, mostly from Apple.

Buffett noted that although Berkshire invested around $35 billion in Apple from 2016 to 2018, its value had risen to $173 billion by the end of 2023, largely due to Cook's leadership. Despite selling approximately two-thirds of its Apple holdings in 2024, retaining 300 million shares worth around $62 billion, Buffett lauded Cook's unmatched ability to grow the company. He highlighted that while Steve Jobs uniquely created Apple, only Cook could have developed it to its current stature.

The sale involved 4.3 million shares at $285 each, reducing Berkshire's ownership from 14.2% to 9.6%. VeriSign noted the sale was intended to reduce Berkshire's stake below the 10% threshold, which triggers regulatory obligations. The price per share reflected a 6.9% discount from VeriSign\u2019s last closing price of $305.98, and the stock dropped 5.9% in after-hours trading. Berkshire, which held 13.29 million shares valued at around $4.07 billion as of March 31, has been a shareholder since 2012, when the stock traded at much lower levels. Despite having added to its position as recently as January, Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for ten consecutive quarters and ended March with $347.7 billion in cash. Typically, the firm's smaller tech investments are managed by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

This move aimed to bring the stake below the 10% regulatory threshold. Berkshire\u2019s sale comes after a substantial long-term investment in VeriSign, which began in 2012 and had grown in value as the shares surged more than six-fold. Notably, further sales are restricted by a 365-day lock-up agreement. Analysts anticipate short-term market weakness but maintain a positive outlook focused on strong domain growth.

With this move, Berkshire's total stake in Verisign has grown to 13.3 million shares, equating to about 14% of the company and valued around $2.7 billion. These recent buys continue a trend that began in mid-December, marking Berkshire's return to Verisign after a lengthy hiatus since 2014.\n\nThe buying activity may be attributed to Berkshire investment managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, who each manage about 10% of the firm\u2019s $300 billion equity portfolio, with smaller individual stock holdings typically under $3 billion. Berkshire has now purchased shares for 12 consecutive trading days, although some transactions have been modest \u2014 such as 1,600 shares bought on a recent Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the news, Verisign shares rose 2.1% to $210 in premarket trading, while Berkshire Hathaway shares increased 0.6% to $456.30.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1736169120.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/8c4d4941-4d10-4ade-af1c-7ef419e6f61c","title":"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway offloaded Apple shares again in second quarter","snippet":"Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway resumed selling Apple shares in Q2 2025, offloading 20 million shares valued at over $4 billion, reducing its holdings to 280 million shares worth $57.4 billion. Despite these reductions, Apple still represents about 20% of Berkshire\u2019s $268 billion stock portfolio. Buffett has been locking in profits from the Apple investment made in 2016, citing overvaluation and reduced growth as reasons for the sale. The timing proved challenging due to Apple\u2019s stock volatility amid U.S.-China trade tensions, though shares recently rebounded 12% following a U.S. investment pledge by CEO Tim Cook.\n\nApple's sale formed the bulk of Berkshire\u2019s $6.9 billion in equity divestments this quarter, which also included exiting T-Mobile and reducing holdings in Bank of America. The moves contributed to a $4.2 billion investment gain. Concurrently, Berkshire invested $3.9 billion in other equities, boosting stakes in Chevron, Domino\u2019s Pizza, and Constellation Brands. It also added shares in Lennar, DR Horton, Nucor, and a $1.6 billion stake in insurer UnitedHealth, which rebounded 10% after the disclosure despite facing significant regulatory scrutiny and executive turnover.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1755205624.063,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6966c31be9508327a6ec863741bcd028","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for updates on Berkshire purchases and sales","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"25fd013f-10a5-45e7-8d63-e3a03b4cf574","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"618a301b-6302-4fda-ac80-00745325b672","turn_exchange_id":"cd933cb2-9d88-4d3e-b952-fb5adb8a32e6","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"618a301b-6302-4fda-ac80-00745325b672","children":["e406741d-4a40-4cf4-9b6a-04ad3aec7aae"]},"e406741d-4a40-4cf4-9b6a-04ad3aec7aae":{"id":"e406741d-4a40-4cf4-9b6a-04ad3aec7aae","message":{"id":"e406741d-4a40-4cf4-9b6a-04ad3aec7aae","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768342318.69626,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for IBM purchase and sale details","content":"I\u2019ve got some good info on Amazon, Snowflake, VeriSign, and Apple sales, but I still need stronger sources for IBM\u2019s purchase and sale, such as Berkshire\u2019s annual letters or 13F filings.

This follows a nearly 50% reduction in the second quarter, cutting the investment down from its peak of 905 million shares at the start of the year. The decision appears to be driven by Apple\u2019s high valuation\u2014trading at 30 times expected earnings\u2014and a strategic rebalancing of Berkshire's portfolio, where Apple had previously comprised about 45%. Despite the sales, Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest equity holding, now worth approximately $67 billion, accounting for under 25% of its $300 billion portfolio. The Apple shares were originally purchased at about $35 each between 2016 and 2018, and with the stock closing at $222.91 on the last trading day of the quarter, Berkshire has realized massive gains, estimated between $15 to $20 billion on the Apple sales alone. Cumulatively in 2024, the company reported $76.5 billion in investment gains, mostly from Apple. CEO Warren Buffett previously indicated Apple would likely remain Berkshire\u2019s largest holding by year-end.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1730555040.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-buffett-sale-apple-stock-25abc100","title":"Berkshire May Have Left $50 Billion on Table. Apple Is Why.","snippet":"Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to sell a significant portion of Apple stock may have cost Berkshire Hathaway approximately $50 billion in unrealized gains, according to Barron\u2019s. Between 2016 and 2018, Berkshire acquired around 1 billion shares of Apple at an average price of $35. Most of the holding was sold in 2024 and 2025 at an estimated average price of $185, significantly below Apple\u2019s current price of $262.24. By June 30, 2025, Berkshire\u2019s Apple holdings had fallen to 280 million shares from 906 million at the end of 2023.\n\nThe sale generated roughly $96 billion in pretax gains but also resulted in nearly $20 billion in corporate income tax, lowering net proceeds to around $155 per share. Buffett cited concern over higher corporate taxes and the large size of the Apple stake as reasons for the sale. Some speculate he also aimed to strengthen Berkshire\u2019s cash position, which stood at over $330 billion mid-2025, ahead of his retirement.\n\nApple was previously described by Buffett as a \u201cpillar\u201d of Berkshire\u2019s value, suggesting it would be a long-term holding. The Apple sale, along with similar moves involving Bank of America, appears to have negatively impacted Berkshire\u2019s performance, with its stock up 9% in 2025 versus the S&P 500\u2019s 16%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1760997600.0,"attribution":"www.barrons.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/fd3b3324-d775-4e09-a916-76f2f3ac675b","title":"Berkshire after Buffett: can any stockpicker follow the Oracle?","snippet":"This Financial Times article examines the future of Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy in a post-Warren Buffett era, focusing on the two successors likely to manage its $354 billion portfolio: Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. With the passing of Charlie Munger and Buffett nearing retirement at age 93, scrutiny has intensified over whether the duo can uphold the \"Oracle of Omaha\u2019s\" extraordinary legacy.\n\nCombs and Weschler, both former hedge fund managers, shared Buffett's value-oriented approach and his intense research habits. They made notable early investments\u2014including in Visa, Mastercard, and DaVita\u2014but recently have underperformed the S&P 500, trailing it in seven of the past ten years. Their average annual return of 7.8% lags behind both Buffett\u2019s 10.2% and the index\u2019s 12%. However, they initiated Berkshire\u2019s hugely successful Apple investment, one of its best recent trades.\n\nTheir flexibility and autonomy, coupled with the company's \u201cpermanent capital\u201d from insurance float and vast cash reserves, offer structural advantages. Still, they face challenges due to their massive portfolio size and the difficulty of finding high-return opportunities on such a scale.\n\nInvestors remain cautiously optimistic, acknowledging their skills but anxious for more transparency as they prepare to step into Buffett\u2019s shoes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1714536014.89,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6966c31be9508327a6ec863741bcd028","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Berkshire's IBM investments and sales","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"25fd013f-10a5-45e7-8d63-e3a03b4cf574","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7518a345-2e68-499f-89e9-1d47615446c9","turn_exchange_id":"cd933cb2-9d88-4d3e-b952-fb5adb8a32e6","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7518a345-2e68-499f-89e9-1d47615446c9","children":["01b65929-0aa4-4b9c-805c-da89438d3f91"]},"01b65929-0aa4-4b9c-805c-da89438d3f91":{"id":"01b65929-0aa4-4b9c-805c-da89438d3f91","message":{"id":"01b65929-0aa4-4b9c-805c-da89438d3f91","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768342331.789473,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying previous tech investments and focusing on major moves","content":"We have good sources regarding IBM purchases and sales from Reuters and Investopedia.

This marks a notable move considering Warren Buffett's historical hesitance toward technology investments. Simultaneously, Berkshire continued to decrease its holdings in Apple, cutting its shares from 280 million to 238.2 million, and has now sold nearly three-quarters of its peak position of over 900 million shares. Despite the reduction, Apple remains its largest holding at $60.7 billion.\n\nIn its SEC filing covering the quarter ending September 30, Berkshire disclosed U.S.-listed stock holdings totaling $283.2 billion. The company also sold 6% of its Bank of America shares and exited its stake in homebuilder DR Horton, while purchasing additional shares in companies such as Chubb and Domino's Pizza. With $12.5 billion in stock sales and $6.4 billion in purchases for the quarter, Berkshire continues to be a net seller for the twelfth consecutive quarter. Its cash reserves have reached a record $381.7 billion.\n\nThis update comes as Warren Buffett prepares to step down after 60 years, handing over leadership to Vice Chairman Greg Abel on January 1, 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1763162484.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"e.vnexpress.net","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/tech/tech-news/warren-buffett-praises-apple-ceo-tim-cook-for-making-more-money-for-berkshire-hathaway-than-he-ever-did-4882142.html","title":"Warren Buffett praises Apple CEO Tim Cook for making ...","snippet":"5 May 2025 \u2014 Berkshire's investment in Apple, which ranged from $35 billion between 2016 and 2018, grew to $173 billion by the end of 2023.

This follows a nearly 50% reduction in the second quarter, cutting the investment down from its peak of 905 million shares at the start of the year. The decision appears to be driven by Apple\u2019s high valuation\u2014trading at 30 times expected earnings\u2014and a strategic rebalancing of Berkshire's portfolio, where Apple had previously comprised about 45%. Despite the sales, Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest equity holding, now worth approximately $67 billion, accounting for under 25% of its $300 billion portfolio. The Apple shares were originally purchased at about $35 each between 2016 and 2018, and with the stock closing at $222.91 on the last trading day of the quarter, Berkshire has realized massive gains, estimated between $15 to $20 billion on the Apple sales alone. Cumulatively in 2024, the company reported $76.5 billion in investment gains, mostly from Apple.

StoneCo, based in S\u00e3o Paulo with headquarters in the Cayman Islands, offers a cloud-based platform to support digital payments, primarily targeting small- and medium-sized businesses in Brazil. It experienced rapid growth, reaching over four million customers by 2024 and capturing an increasing share of Brazil's payment processing market.\n\nStoneCo was founded in 2012 by Andr\u00e9 Street and Eduardo Pontes, following their exit from a previous payments firm. It launched a successful IPO in 2018, raising its valuation to $6.1 billion. Berkshire Hathaway bought over 14 million shares at IPO, representing an 11.3% stake, despite Buffett\u2019s usual skepticism of IPOs\u2014this investment was attributed to his associate Todd Combs.\n\nThe company attracted other major investors, including Ant Financial and 3G Capital founders. However, StoneCo\u2019s market capitalization saw a significant decline from a peak of $25.86 billion in 2020 to $2.39 billion by early 2025.

The stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average and formed a cup-with-handle pattern, clearing a buy point at $16. After a brief pullback, it remains within the 5% buy range, signaling potential for further gains. StoneCo's recent rally was fueled by strong second-quarter results, reporting 46% earnings growth to $0.41 per share and a 24% revenue increase to $644.4 million. This marked an acceleration from the prior quarter\u2019s 21% earnings growth and 6% sales increase.\n\nOnce boosted to an all-time high of $95.12 in 2021 by Warren Buffett\u2019s investment through Berkshire Hathaway, the stock later plummeted to $6.81 by May 2022 following Buffett\u2019s divestment in 2023.

The firm took a 5% stake in each company through its subsidiary, National Indemnity, and could potentially increase holdings to 9.9%. This move comes as a surprise, with analysts noting the typical conservatism in Buffett's investment strategy. However, the low valuations of the trading houses, whose shares had dipped during the pandemic, may have been an attractive factor. These \"sogo shosha\" play a crucial role in the Japanese economy, spanning industries from food imports to manufacturing and global joint ventures. The announcement boosted shares in all five companies, reflecting market approval. The investment strategy aligns with Buffett's aim to reduce Berkshire Hathaway's reliance on the US economy, which experienced steep contraction amid the COVID-19 crisis. It also follows a $4 billion yen bond issuance by Berkshire in 2019, signaling prior interest in Japanese financial markets.

Buffett has repeatedly framed Apple as *not a typical tech bet*, and in 2023 said it was a better business than any other Berkshire holding. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## The arc in 3 phases\n\n### 1) First modern \u201cbig tech\u201d attempt: IBM (and why it failed)\n**IBM (2011 \u2192 exited by 2018)** was Buffett-era Berkshire\u2019s first large, explicit \u201ctechnology\u201d purchase:\n- Berkshire began buying IBM in **March 2011** and built a roughly **$10.7B** position (about **64M shares**) disclosed publicly in November 2011. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- Over time, the thesis eroded; Berkshire **cut the IBM stake heavily** (e.g., a large reduction disclosed in 2017). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n- By 2018, Buffett said Berkshire had effectively **zero** IBM shares. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search13\ue201  \n\n**Interpretation:** IBM is the \u201cwhy Buffett feared tech\u201d case study. The risk wasn\u2019t that IBM was unprofitable; it\u2019s that in enterprise tech, **competitive position can decay faster than accounting statements reveal** (platform shifts like cloud/services, changing buyer preferences, and the difficulty of separating durable customer lock-in from inertia).\n\n---\n\n### 2) The breakthrough: Apple (the \u201ctech\u201d holding treated as consumer ecosystem)\n**Apple (first bought 2016; built huge through 2018; trimmed heavily 2024\u20132025)**:\n- Berkshire revealed an initial Apple stake in **Q1 2016** (about **9.8M shares**, ~**$1B** at the time). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- Buffett later publicly leaned in\u2014saying Berkshire had more than doubled its Apple stake by early 2017. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search14\ue201  \n- By 2023, Buffett explicitly called Apple the best business in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search3\ue201  \n- Then, Berkshire **reduced Apple materially in 2024 and continued trimming in 2025** (concentration, valuation/tax positioning, and cash build all show up in contemporaneous reporting). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn2news31\ue201  \n\n**Why Apple fit Buffett-style investing (despite \u201ctech\u201d):**\n- **Ecosystem switching costs** + brand loyalty = unusually durable demand versus typical hardware cycles.\n- **Massive cash generation + buybacks**: buybacks were effectively Berkshire \u201cowning more of Apple over time\u201d even without buying new shares.\n- **Predictability of consumer behavior** (vs forecasting which enterprise stack wins).\n\nIn short: **Buffett didn\u2019t become a \u201ctech investor\u201d; he became willing to own a dominant consumer ecosystem that happens to use technology.**\n\n---\n\n### 3) Post-Apple: selective, often smaller, and sometimes event-driven tech exposure\nFrom ~2019 onward, Berkshire\u2019s tech purchases look like **a barbell**:\n- a few \u201cmoat/tollbooth\u201d compounders, and  \n- smaller, more experimental positions (often attributed to Berkshire\u2019s other portfolio managers rather than Buffett personally).\n\nKey examples:\n\n**HP (2022\u2013 ) \u2014 \u201cvalue tech\u201d / capital return story**  \nBerkshire disclosed buying nearly **121M shares** (~**11.4% stake**, ~**$4.2B**). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \nInterpretation: not \u201cinnovation upside,\u201d but a **cash-flow + buyback + valuation** bet in a mature hardware business.\n\n**TSMC (2022 \u2192 mostly sold quickly) \u2014 fundamentals vs geopolitics**  \nBerkshire bought **>$4.1B** of TSMC shares (July\u2013Sept 2022) then sold **~86%** by year-end; Buffett cited **geopolitics** as a consideration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \nInterpretation: even when the business quality is elite, **non-business risk can dominate** position sizing/holding period.\n\n**Amazon (2019) \u2014 platform admiration, small position, likely \u201clieutenants\u201d**  \nBerkshire revealed an ~**$861M** Amazon stake and Buffett indicated it was bought by Combs/Weschler. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search13\ue201  \nInterpretation: Berkshire liked the business; the modest size signals either **valuation discomfort** or **circle-of-competence caution**.\n\n**Snowflake (2020 \u2192 later exited) \u2014 rare IPO exposure**  \nBerkshire disclosed a stake around the IPO period in 2020, widely read as a Combs/Weschler-style growth position, later sold out. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search14\ue201  \nInterpretation: Berkshire experimented with high-growth cloud software\u2014but the later exit suggests it didn\u2019t become a \u201ccore Berkshire kind of holding.\u201d\n\n**VeriSign (owned since 2012; trimmed 2025) \u2014 classic \u201ctollbooth tech\u201d**  \nIn 2025 Berkshire sold ~one-third of its VeriSign stake to get below the **10%** threshold (regulatory/filing implications). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \nInterpretation: this is arguably *more Buffett-like than most tech*: a quasi-infrastructure business with recurring economics.\n\n**Activision Blizzard (merger arb) \u2014 not really \u201ctech conviction\u201d**  \nReuters described Berkshire cutting most of the position before a key Microsoft merger ruling. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue201  \nInterpretation: primarily **deal/price mechanics**, not a long-horizon tech thesis.\n\n**Alphabet / Google parent (new stake disclosed 2025) \u2014 notable late-cycle entrance**  \nBerkshire disclosed a new **$4.3B** Alphabet position in 2025. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news41\ue201  \nInterpretation: this looks like Berkshire expanding its \u201cacceptable tech\u201d set toward **cash-rich platforms**\u2014especially as leadership responsibilities shift.\n\n---\n\n## The pattern: Buffett-style investing applied to a narrow subset of \u201ctech\u201d\nAcross winners and losers, Berkshire\u2019s tech purchases cluster around businesses that look like one (or more) of these:\n\n1) **Consumer ecosystem / habit-forming product** (Apple)  \n2) **Infrastructure tollbooth** (VeriSign; arguably parts of the semiconductor supply chain like TSMC, though geopolitics intervened)  \n3) **Mature cash-flow + buybacks** (HP)  \n4) **Event-driven / special situations** (Activision)  \n5) **Manager-driven exploratory growth** (Snowflake; some fintech-like bets)\n\nAnd IBM shows the \u201canti-pattern\u201d: a legacy enterprise incumbent where **the moat was harder to verify than the financials implied**.\n\n---\n\n## Forward-looking implication (still consistent with the last 20 years)\nWith Greg Abel taking over as CEO on **Jan 1, 2026** (Buffett remaining chairman), it\u2019s plausible that Berkshire\u2019s future \u201ctech\u201d purchases skew more toward the Combs/Weschler style\u2014**more names, smaller positions, still value-aware**\u2014while Apple remains the template for what a \u201cBerkshire-grade tech investment\u201d looks like. \ue200cite\ue202turn6news19\ue201\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Further reading\ue202turn4news41,turn1news42,turn5news40,turn0news42,turn0news40,turn6news19\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200finance\ue202turn3finance0\ue201","start_idx":0,"end_idx":23,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"finance","ref_index":0}],"alt":"## Stock market information for Apple Inc (AAPL)\n- Apple Inc is a equity in the USA market.\n- The price is 261.05 USD currently with a change of 0.80 USD (0.00%) from the previous close.\n- The latest open price was 258.59 USD and the intraday volume is 45641570.\n- The intraday high is 261.77 USD and the intraday low is 258.23 USD.\n- The latest trade time is Wednesday, January 14, 05:56:10 +0800.\n","prompt_text":"Apple Inc (AAPL) is a equity in the USA market.

Despite these reductions, Apple still represents about 20% of Berkshire\u2019s $268 billion stock portfolio. Buffett has been locking in profits from the Apple investment made in 2016, citing overvaluation and reduced growth as reasons for the sale. The timing proved challenging due to Apple\u2019s stock volatility amid U.S.-China trade tensions, though shares recently rebounded 12% following a U.S. investment pledge by CEO Tim Cook.\n\nApple's sale formed the bulk of Berkshire\u2019s $6.9 billion in equity divestments this quarter, which also included exiting T-Mobile and reducing holdings in Bank of America. The moves contributed to a $4.2 billion investment gain. Concurrently, Berkshire invested $3.9 billion in other equities, boosting stakes in Chevron, Domino\u2019s Pizza, and Constellation Brands. It also added shares in Lennar, DR Horton, Nucor, and a $1.6 billion stake in insurer UnitedHealth, which rebounded 10% after the disclosure despite facing significant regulatory scrutiny and executive turnover.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Berkshire May Have Left $50 Billion on Table.

Between 2016 and 2018, Berkshire acquired around 1 billion shares of Apple at an average price of $35. Most of the holding was sold in 2024 and 2025 at an estimated average price of $185, significantly below Apple\u2019s current price of $262.24. By June 30, 2025, Berkshire\u2019s Apple holdings had fallen to 280 million shares from 906 million at the end of 2023.\n\nThe sale generated roughly $96 billion in pretax gains but also resulted in nearly $20 billion in corporate income tax, lowering net proceeds to around $155 per share. Buffett cited concern over higher corporate taxes and the large size of the Apple stake as reasons for the sale. Some speculate he also aimed to strengthen Berkshire\u2019s cash position, which stood at over $330 billion mid-2025, ahead of his retirement.\n\nApple was previously described by Buffett as a \u201cpillar\u201d of Berkshire\u2019s value, suggesting it would be a long-term holding. The Apple sale, along with similar moves involving Bank of America, appears to have negatively impacted Berkshire\u2019s performance, with its stock up 9% in 2025 versus the S&P 500\u2019s 16%.","attribution":"Barron's"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial

Despite stepping down as CEO, Warren Buffett, 95, remains Berkshire\u2019s chairman after transforming the company into a $1 trillion conglomerate over six decades, owning businesses like Geico, BNSF Railway, and others. Berkshire has long taken a unique approach to executive compensation, diverging from other major public firms.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Further reading\ue202turn4news41,turn1news42,turn5news40,turn0news42,turn0news40,turn6news19\ue201","start_idx":6637,"end_idx":6734,"safe_urls":["https://images.openai.com/static-rsc-1/NBLWYVI3_zGroC7EyqPKw1fgp56djtsyoTmb5c_ytYhS_EunlOxrAY-iCM3SmW0nWo08GugTd0WIriHOV5l6I5itvVSW5aLfCS_un9IHdHxmCB5R792Moq_WpV9HtgURhHIEqWDpxhbKWPRlZqVopsj8kYIWDIBQd8Jccwqil2sDlnSY2PacpEpLAbGq56QL7QLH7DDjiHDAPM6nIbvdhB1-Bb5-i9ZCdYLgquLDYEifDYrnpI9X7lOF-JRbcVPjnr7U7R1rer8XrhyGAsUTPg","https://images.openai.com/static-rsc-1/_Q26FI7O_htSs1wY-maPu-E4Z7p4_E205jFjjp8EaOoir2w7KZqGfKF2vNANVwyz56Q1t3YaZVTMmzFnxq2t5K104LZeZnyhV-gi94TiyOVxQndYaw5K9dyHLbyem54O3ADSc2K5Wm4YAmeK5zkOwNTE7sPInacGa9vYyt77mTbazkIAhLIhvx0wJc0-a2gQGwaRTA6zTcBv6_eNKRNjPxueSar43IADi_bmXejLy8kp0WJVnvmTHBUj0MY_Vkb63Vzk_-SC9icEZLitDGCO0w","https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-957a00c2","https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-957a00c2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-buffett-sale-apple-stock-25abc100","https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-buffett-sale-apple-stock-25abc100?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/8c4d4941-4d10-4ade-af1c-7ef419e6f61c","https://www.ft.com/content/8c4d4941-4d10-4ade-af1c-7ef419e6f61c?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/berkshire-buys-shares-google-parent-alphabet-sells-more-apple-2025-11-14/","https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/berkshire-buys-shares-google-parent-alphabet-sells-more-apple-2025-11-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/buffetts-berkshire-sells-one-third-verisign-stake-123-billion-2025-07-28/","https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/buffetts-berkshire-sells-one-third-verisign-stake-123-billion-2025-07-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/berkshire-hathaway-raises-new-ceo-abels-salary-25-million-2026-01-06/","https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/berkshire-hathaway-raises-new-ceo-abels-salary-25-million-2026-01-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19}],"alt":"- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/berkshire-buys-shares-google-parent-alphabet-sells-more-apple-2025-11-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/8c4d4941-4d10-4ade-af1c-7ef419e6f61c?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/buffetts-berkshire-sells-one-third-verisign-stake-123-billion-2025-07-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-957a00c2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-buffett-sale-apple-stock-25abc100?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/berkshire-hathaway-raises-new-ceo-abels-salary-25-million-2026-01-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)","prompt_text":"\nnavlist containing the following URLs:\n- [Berkshire reveals new $4.3 billion Alphabet stake, sells more Apple](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/berkshire-buys-shares-google-parent-alphabet-sells-more-apple-2025-11-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway offloaded Apple shares again in second quarter](https://www.ft.com/content/8c4d4941-4d10-4ade-af1c-7ef419e6f61c?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Buffett's Berkshire sells one-third of VeriSign stake for $1.23 billion](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/buffetts-berkshire-sells-one-third-verisign-stake-123-billion-2025-07-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Berkshire Sold 25% of Its Apple Stock in the Third Quarter](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-957a00c2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Berkshire May Have Left $50 Billion on Table.
