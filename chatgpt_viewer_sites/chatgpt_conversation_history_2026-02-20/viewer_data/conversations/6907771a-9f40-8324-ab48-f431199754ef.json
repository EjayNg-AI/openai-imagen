Grocery-store \u201craw\u201d cacao powder is food-grade and safe to drink when mixed with pasteurized milk and heated to a boil (or near-boil). Heating actually lowers the already-small microbiological risk in low-moisture powders.\n\nA few caveats worth knowing (objective, not marketing):\n\n- **Heavy metals (lead/cadmium):** Cocoa can contain trace amounts from soil/drying. This isn\u2019t fixed by boiling. Keep servings moderate (e.g., 1\u20132 tsp \u2248 3\u20136 g per cup; avoid multiple large mugs daily), and prefer brands that publish third-party test results and/or source from regions with lower cadmium. Especially important for kids and pregnancy.\n- **Caffeine/theobromine:** Stimulants can cause jitters/heartburn or transient BP/HR bumps in sensitive people. With hypertension (you\u2019re on perindopril), stay at modest doses and avoid drinking late.\n- **Potassium & oxalate:** Cocoa is relatively high in both. If you have kidney disease, a history of calcium-oxalate stones, or are on potassium-raising meds, keep portions small. Pairing with milk provides calcium that can reduce oxalate absorption.\n- **Flavanols vs heat & milk:** Boiling and milk binding can reduce flavanol bioavailability somewhat, but not to zero; you\u2019ll still get some cardiovascular-beneficial polyphenols. If you want to maximize them, heat to just-steaming (not a rolling boil) and drink promptly.\n- **Marketing claims:** \u201cMore calcium than cow\u2019s milk\u201d and \u201c40\u00d7 blueberries\u201d are not reliable; cacao isn\u2019t a meaningful calcium source, and antioxidant comparisons across foods are misleading.\n\n**Practical prep (zero-sugar hot chocolate):**\n1. Whisk 1\u20132 tsp cacao with a splash of cold milk into a smooth slurry.\n2. Warm 200\u2013250 ml milk to hot/steaming (near-boil if you want maximum safety), then whisk in the slurry until just simmering.\n3. Optional: pinch of salt/cinnamon; sweeten lightly only if desired.\n\nBottom line: perfectly safe done this way, with sensible portion control and the above caveats."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"94a55289-126d-4927-a5b8-044c2cf19c83","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7d28fb53-2a3f-4045-89fa-37ad006e22ac","turn_exchange_id":"56be0bd4-b3a1-4631-a106-6305df7ebcd8","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"7d28fb53-2a3f-4045-89fa-37ad006e22ac","children":["0dfd7fa2-528e-4ea8-ba00-4c213279a29c"]},"0dfd7fa2-528e-4ea8-ba00-4c213279a29c":{"id":"0dfd7fa2-528e-4ea8-ba00-4c213279a29c","message":{"id":"0dfd7fa2-528e-4ea8-ba00-4c213279a29c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1762138950.023,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How
