What beta blockers actually do in this context\n\nA **beta blocker** (BB) is a drug that blocks beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing heart rate, blood pressure, and some physical symptoms of anxiety (palpitations, tremor, sweating). They\u2019re widely used for cardiovascular disease, and sometimes for **performance anxiety** (public speaking, exams, stage fright). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n\nHowever:\n\n- Beta blockers, especially older non-selective ones (for example, propranolol, atenolol), are **well-documented to be associated with erectile dysfunction** as a side effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n- Mechanisms include reduced penile blood flow, altered autonomic signalling, and possibly hormonal effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n\nSo you\u2019d be asking for a medication that is **classically on the list of drugs that can *cause or worsen* ED**, to treat ED. From a risk\u2013benefit perspective, that\u2019s immediately suspect.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where beta blockers *are* used for anxiety\n\nThere *is* a niche where a psychiatrist or GP might use a beta blocker off-label:  \n\n- **Short-acting, situational performance anxiety**, where the primary problem is intense physical arousal (racing heart, shaking, sweating) that then spirals into fear of \u201cchoking\u201d.  \n\nThis is well-described for public speaking and stage performance. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search7\ue201  \n\nFor **sexual performance anxiety**, some private clinics do prescribe propranolol in very specific cases, but:\n\n- The evidence base is thin compared to other treatments.\n- You\u2019re still fighting against a class of drugs with **known sexual side effects** (including ED and reduced libido). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n\nA conservative psychiatrist is going to look at that and think:  \n> \u201cWhy am I using a drug that might directly worsen the very thing we are trying to fix?\u201d\n\nSo while it\u2019s *possible* someone would do this, it is **not mainstream or guideline-level practice**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What\u2019s actually recommended for psychogenic erectile dysfunction\n\nFor **erectile dysfunction (ED) that is predominantly psychogenic** (caused by psychological factors), modern guidelines and reviews generally emphasize:\n\n1. **Psychological / sex-therapy interventions as first-line**  \n   - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) focused on performance anxiety, catastrophic thoughts, perfectionism, etc.  \n   - Sex therapy and couples therapy (sensate focus, graded exposure, reframing of sexual scripts).  \n   - Addressing the *actual* stressors you mentioned: work, relationship dynamics, self-esteem, body image. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search24\ue201  \n\n2. **Pharmacologic support with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors**, not beta blockers  \n   - Drugs like sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil \u2013 collectively called **phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors** \u2013 are guideline-recommended first-line for ED of almost all causes, unless contraindicated (for example, nitrates, certain cardiac situations). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n   - They are often used **even when the ED is mainly psychological**, because reliably achieving erections can break the anxiety-failure cycle and support the psychological work. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search24\ue201  \n\n3. **Medical work-up and risk factor management**  \n   Even if you\u2019re convinced it\u2019s \u201c100% psychological\u201d, a competent psychiatrist/urologist/GP will want to rule out:\n   - Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, endocrine issues (for example, low testosterone).  \n   - Medication-induced ED (antidepressants, antihypertensives, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search22\ue202turn1search12\ue201  \n\n   This is not pedantry: ED can be one of the **earliest external signs of vascular disease**.\n\n4. **Choice of psychiatric medication, if any**  \n   - Many antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs; serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs) can *worsen* sexual function.  \n   - If you need an antidepressant or anxiolytic, psychiatrists often consider options with a **better sexual side-effect profile** (for example, bupropion, some atypical agents) depending on the overall clinical picture.\n\nNote what is **not** in that list: using a beta blocker as primary treatment for ED.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why a psychiatrist is unlikely to say \u201cyes\u201d to this request\n\nFrom a psychiatrist\u2019s decision-theory point of view:\n\n- **Benefit** of a beta blocker here:\n  - Possible reduction in physical anxiety symptoms in the moment.\n  - Possible indirect improvement in confidence.\n\n- **Risks / downsides**:\n  - Established association of many beta blockers with ED and reduced libido. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search18\ue202turn1search22\ue201  \n  - Cardiovascular effects (bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm in susceptible people, masking of hypoglycaemia, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue201  \n  - It can become a **psychological crutch/safety behaviour**, maintaining the underlying anxiety because you never get disconfirmatory experiences without the pill.\n  - No guideline support and minimal high-quality evidence specifically for psychogenic ED.\n\nGiven that there are:\n\n- **Effective, targeted drugs** for erections (PDE5 inhibitors), and  \n- **Evidence-based psychotherapies** for performance / stress-related sexual problems,\n\na beta blocker is, frankly, a **dominated option** in most scenarios.\n\nSo a thoughtful psychiatrist is more likely to say something like:\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s properly evaluate the ED, address the stress and anxiety with therapy, and, if needed, coordinate with your GP or urologist about a PDE5 inhibitor. A beta blocker would not be my first or second choice for this problem.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. What you can productively bring to a doctor\n\nIf you want to move this forward in the real world, a more productive framing than \u201cCan I have a beta blocker?\u201d would be:\n\n- \u201cI have erectile dysfunction that seems tightly linked to psychological stress and performance anxiety.\u201d  \n- \u201cI\u2019d like to (i) rule out medical causes, and (ii) work on the anxiety and stress in a structured way.\u201d  \n- \u201cI\u2019m open to medications that support erections and to therapy, but I\u2019m wary of medications that *worsen* sexual function.\u201d\n\nThat invites:\n\n- A **proper medical work-up** (which you *do* want, even if you suspect it\u2019s purely psychological).  \n- A discussion of **PDE5 inhibitors vs other options**, and  \n- A referral to a **psychologist or sex therapist** if appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Big picture\n\nSo, to answer your question directly:\n\n> **Would a psychiatrist recommend beta blockers for alleviation of erectile dysfunction that you believe is entirely due to psychological stress?**\n\nIn mainstream, evidence-based practice: **usually no.**  \n\nThey might occasionally consider a beta blocker for severe, situational performance anxiety with prominent somatic symptoms, but for erectile dysfunction specifically, especially when we care about long-term sexual function and not just numbing anxiety, it\u2019s **not a rational first-line choice** and may very well make things worse.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, we can next sketch a *concrete* plan for addressing psychogenic ED: what diagnostic work-up to ask for, how to structure the psychological side, and where medications fit in as tools rather than magic bullets."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue201","start_idx":696,"end_idx":716,"safe_urls":["https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers","https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Beta-Blockers: Uses & Side Effects","url":"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1643818008.0,"snippet":"Some side effects of all beta-blockers include: Dizziness \u00b7 Dry mouth or eyes \u00b7 Fatigue.
