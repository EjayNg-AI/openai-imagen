Bell's theorem is a mathematical proof that \nsays: a model with certain assumptions X, Y, Z will obey an inequality on measurement results. \nThis inequality is violated in experiments. This means that any model which fulfils all \nassumptions is incompatible with evidence. The question I keep asking chatbots is: what are \nthe assumptions? The first assumption for the model is that measurement outcomes can be \ncalculated from a variable usually called the \"hidden variable\". A lot of confusion surrounds this \nassumption. Note that you can calculate the measurement outcome from the measurement \noutcome (duh), so there is always such a variable, even for quantum mechanics itself. The \nquestion is, what are the properties that the distribution of these variables needs to fulfil? The \nsecond assumption is the most famous one and is called \"local causality\". It looks like this  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfor a situation with two detectors. a is the detector setting of the first detector and O_a is the \nobserved measurement outcome. b is the detector setting of the second detector and O_b is \nthe observed measurement outcome. and Lambda are the \"hidden variables\", that is, what you \nneed to know to calculate the measurement outcome. Don't worry if you don't understand what \nthis equation means, it just says that a theory should be local in the sense that causes travel \nfrom one point only to its neighbors (they cannot \"jump\" -- that would be nonlocal), and they \ncannot travel faster than light. Bell also thought it includes causality, but that depends on what \nyou mean by \"causality\". But this isn't so relevant here, so let me skip over this. This assumption \nof local causality is sometimes broken down into a list of other assumptions, output \nindependence, setting independence, parameter independence, factorizability etc. So, there \nare many different ways to formulate it and it can get somewhat confusing because everyone \ndoes it somewhat differently, but in the end you need local causality for Bell's theorem. The third \nassumption is statistical independence:  \n\n \n\nhttps://x.com/skdh/status/1892845359501562335/photo/1\nhttps://x.com/skdh/status/1892845359501562335/photo/1\nhttps://x.com/skdh/status/1892845359501562335/photo/2\nhttps://x.com/skdh/status/1892845359501562335/photo/1\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe relevant thing is now this: Statistical Independence is necessary to derive Bell's theorem. \nBut this assumption is independent of local causality. This means you can violate statistical \nindependence without non-locality. Bell himself got this wrong in his original paper. He seems \nto have thought that Statistical Independence is implied in local causality. It is not. This means \nmost importantly, a theory which violates Statistical Independence can be locally causal AND \nviolate Bell's inequality. That Bell made this assumption without noticing was only pointed out in \n1976 by Shimony, Horne, and Clauser (same Clauser who won the Nobel Prize in 2022). The \npaper is titled \u201cComment on \u2018The theory of local beables\u2019.\u201d, and is published in Epistemological \nLetters 13, 1 (1976). Bell and Clauser both realized that since this additional assumption was \nrequired, an experimental violation of Bell's inequality would *NOT* demonstrate a violation of \nLocal Causality. Hence, they tried to find a reason why statistical independence must be \nfulfilled on philosophical grounds. They claimed that it's necessary for free will to exist, which is \nnot only nonsense (free will is difficult to reconcile with any deterministic theory, but that's \nnothing to do with statistical independence) it is also putting a lot of philosophical baggage onto \na simple equality. This is why Bell dismissed a violation of Statistical Independence as \n\"superdeterminism\". But none of that matters -- it is clearly an assumption that enters the proof. \nIt is highly problematic that this necessary assumption is now usually not even mentioned. (Let \nme note in the passing that Bell's theorem makes no assumptions about either realism or \ndeterminism, it's just unnecessary. Strictly speaking it makes a bunch of other assumptions \nwhich are necessary for the probability distribution to be well-defined.) It's even more worrying \nbecause since the 1980s we have had multiple models that have demonstrated explicitly that it \nis possible to violate Bell's inequality with local hidden variable models, so long as those \nmodels violate statistical independence.

I keep going on \nabout this because I strongly believe that we will not make progress in the foundations of \nphysics as long as we use a model that violates local causality. We currently do: Quantum \nmechanics itself violates local causality. All the difficulty we have with finding a quantum \nversion of gravity comes from using a quantum model that is incompatible with the locality of \ngeneral relativity.

Experiments, however, show this inequality is violated. Therefore, real-world measurements contradict at least one of the assumptions that went into deriving Bell\u2019s inequality.  \n   \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n2. **Which assumptions does Bell\u2019s theorem rely on?**  \n   The writeup highlights three important assumptions that lead to Bell\u2019s inequality:  \n   - **Hidden variables**: The idea that the outcome of any measurement can be determined by some \u201chidden variable(s)\u201d you haven\u2019t observed yet. This is sometimes referred to as \u201crealism\u201d or simply a premise that the measurement results are encoded in variables.  \n   - **Local causality**: This states that events in one region of space cannot be influenced by what happens instantaneously in another distant region. Put another way, any causal influence travels no faster than light. Mathematically, this is typically expressed so that one detector\u2019s outcome depends only on local information (its setting and local hidden variables), not on the faraway detector.  \n   - **Statistical independence**: The distribution of these hidden variables does not depend on the choice of measurement settings. In simpler terms, how you choose to orient or configure your measuring devices is assumed not to be secretly correlated with the hidden variables themselves.  \n   \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n3. **The key subtlety: statistical independence is separate from local causality**  \n   - Historically, Bell treated \u201cstatistical independence\u201d as if it followed from local causality. But later discussions (notably by Shimony, Horne, and Clauser in 1976) pointed out that you really need this additional assumption explicitly.  \n   - You could have a model that remains perfectly local (i.e. no faster-than-light signaling) while failing statistical independence (i.e. the hidden variables are correlated with the experimental settings in some nontrivial way). Such models can violate Bell\u2019s inequality purely by dropping statistical independence. This loophole is sometimes referred to as \u201csuperdeterminism.\u201d  \n   \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n4. **Why does it matter that statistical independence is often omitted?**  \n   The author laments that many quick explanations of Bell\u2019s theorem mention only \u201clocal hidden variables\u201d and talk about \u201cnonlocality\u201d once the inequality is violated. They rarely emphasize that one must also assume statistical independence (free of special correlations). Overlooking that assumption sometimes leads to the sweeping statement \u201cExperiments show quantum physics is nonlocal,\u201d whereas one could instead say, \u201cExperiments show at least one of these assumptions\u2014local causality or statistical independence\u2014is wrong.\u201d  \n   \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n5. **Bell\u2019s own stance and the \u2018free will\u2019 angle**  \n   - After realizing an extra assumption was needed to rule out certain correlations between hidden variables and measurement settings, Bell and Clauser tried to justify statistical independence by appealing to \u201cfree will.\u201d The idea: if the experimenter\u2019s choice of measurements is \u201cfree,\u201d that choice shouldn\u2019t be pre-correlated with any hidden variables.  \n   - The author here suggests that tying it to free will introduces a lot of philosophical baggage, and that it\u2019s logically just an extra assumption that can be dropped if you allow a sort of \u201csuperdeterministic\u201d framework.  \n   \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n6. **What does this mean for quantum mechanics?**  \n   - Standard quantum mechanics violates Bell\u2019s inequality and appears to violate local causality\u2014if you assume statistical independence holds.  \n   - The author contends that the troubles in merging quantum mechanics with general relativity may stem from this acceptance of nonlocality. They favor the idea of maintaining local causality and dropping statistical independence instead.  \n   - Regardless of which assumption you drop, the central point is that Bell\u2019s theorem does not uniquely force you to abandon locality unless you keep *all* the other assumptions, including statistical independence.  \n   \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n\n### In summary\nThis writeup argues that Bell\u2019s theorem says: \u201cGiven local causality **and** statistical independence, hidden-variable models must satisfy Bell\u2019s inequality.\u201d Experiments violate that inequality, so one of these assumptions must be false. Often people only talk about local causality being ruled out\u2014missing that statistical independence is also required and might be the assumption that fails. The author wants to highlight this often-overlooked point and emphasize that dropping statistical independence (superdeterminism) can let you keep locality without contradicting the experimental data."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":543,"end_ix":560,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"qm.pdf","id":"file-PTXrgFCASnic1o3qFLjgKL","source":"my_files","text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\nSince people are still confused about why I say the chatbot output about Bell's theorem is \nwrong, let me clarify what the correct answer is.

Let me break it down for you:\n\n### 1. **What is Bell\u2019s Theorem?**\nBell\u2019s theorem is a **mathematical proof** stating that any theory satisfying certain assumptions must obey **Bell\u2019s inequality**. However, **experiments show violations of Bell\u2019s inequality**, meaning that at least one of these assumptions must be false.\n\n### 2. **What are the assumptions in Bell\u2019s Theorem?**\nThe author focuses on three main assumptions:\n\n- **Hidden Variables Assumption**: Measurement outcomes can be determined by some underlying variable(s), often called *hidden variables* (denoted as \\( \\lambda \\)).\n- **Local Causality**: Causes must propagate locally, meaning that information cannot travel faster than light and events at one location should not be influenced instantaneously by distant events.\n- **Statistical Independence**: The hidden variable \\( \\lambda \\) is independent of the detector settings \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), meaning that the experimenters freely choose their detector settings without any hidden correlation with the system being measured.\n\n### 3. **The Key Issue: Statistical Independence is Separate from Local Causality**\nThe main argument in the write-up is that **Statistical Independence is a separate assumption from Local Causality**. This is **crucial**, because:\n\n- **John Bell originally thought** that Statistical Independence was implied by Local Causality.\n- **Shimony, Horne, and Clauser (1976)** pointed out that this is not true.\n- If Statistical Independence is violated, a theory can be **locally causal yet still violate Bell\u2019s inequality**.\n\nThis means that violating Bell\u2019s inequality **does not necessarily imply nonlocality**, as often claimed.\n\n### 4. **Why is this Important?**\n- Many physicists assume that violating Bell\u2019s inequality **proves** quantum mechanics is nonlocal. The write-up argues that this is **not necessarily true**, because some hidden-variable models can **violate Bell\u2019s inequality while remaining locally causal**\u2014as long as they also violate Statistical Independence.\n- This leads to **superdeterminism**, a controversial idea dismissed by Bell as a loophole, but which still provides a way to explain Bell\u2019s theorem **without nonlocality**.\n- The misunderstanding is widespread, even among AI chatbots and many physicists.\n\n### 5. **Implications for Quantum Gravity**\nThe author argues that quantum mechanics **violates local causality**, and this might be the reason why **we struggle to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity**, which is a **local** theory.\n\n### 6. **Final Takeaway**\nThe main argument is that **the way Bell\u2019s theorem is often explained is misleading**. It is essential to recognize that **Statistical Independence is a separate assumption**, and violating it allows hidden variable models to explain experimental results **without violating locality**.\n\nThis is an important point in the foundations of quantum mechanics and could have significant implications for developing new physics beyond our current theories.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to expand on any part, especially with mathematical details?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","requested_model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"7a228c34-3308-447f-b132-c030b762058f","request_id":"9155a122bc4afcde-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7a228c34-3308-447f-b132-c030b762058f","children":["b459be44-7920-4864-add8-c7c39ac44027"]},"b459be44-7920-4864-add8-c7c39ac44027":{"id":"b459be44-7920-4864-add8-c7c39ac44027","message":{"id":"b459be44-7920-4864-add8-c7c39ac44027","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740129474.016379,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Why does the violation of statistical independence together with the preservation of local causality lead to superdeterminism?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"9155a5578888fcde-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e7aba108-c85a-4be1-947d-657b4a55c41b","children":["c0826e7b-7ed6-41fe-a080-d98aacb16bbb"]},"c0826e7b-7ed6-41fe-a080-d98aacb16bbb":{"id":"c0826e7b-7ed6-41fe-a080-d98aacb16bbb","message":{"id":"c0826e7b-7ed6-41fe-a080-d98aacb16bbb","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740129493.922351,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_system_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"b459be44-7920-4864-add8-c7c39ac44027","request_id":"9155a5578888fcde-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b459be44-7920-4864-add8-c7c39ac44027","children":["391a211f-3384-41d2-b7c8-497638deacfd"]},"391a211f-3384-41d2-b7c8-497638deacfd":{"id":"391a211f-3384-41d2-b7c8-497638deacfd","message":{"id":"391a211f-3384-41d2-b7c8-497638deacfd","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740129493.922469,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"c0826e7b-7ed6-41fe-a080-d98aacb16bbb","request_id":"9155a5578888fcde-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c0826e7b-7ed6-41fe-a080-d98aacb16bbb","children":["ebd1675d-0b19-4985-b5f0-e25c74f480dd"]},"ebd1675d-0b19-4985-b5f0-e25c74f480dd":{"id":"ebd1675d-0b19-4985-b5f0-e25c74f480dd","message":{"id":"ebd1675d-0b19-4985-b5f0-e25c74f480dd","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1740129493.922542,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Connecting the dots**\n\nI'm piecing together how violating statistical independence and maintaining local causality leads to superdeterminism.

Here is why:\n\n---\n\n### 1. What Statistical Independence Means\n\nThe usual statement of *statistical independence* (sometimes also referred to as the \u201cmeasurement independence\u201d or \u201cfree will\u201d assumption) is that the hidden variables \\(\\lambda\\) in your theory are chosen from some probability distribution \\(p(\\lambda)\\) **independently** of the measurement settings \\(a, b\\). Symbolically:\n\n\\[\np(\\lambda \\mid a, b) \\;=\\; p(\\lambda).\n\\]\n\nIn other words, the system\u2019s hidden state \\(\\lambda\\) is not correlated with the choices of the detector settings \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Violating Statistical Independence\n\nIf your theory **violates** statistical independence, this means:\n\n\\[\np(\\lambda \\mid a, b) \\;\\neq\\; p(\\lambda).\n\\]\n\nThat is, the hidden variables \\(\\lambda\\) *do* depend on the settings \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Now, for many theories, letting \\(\\lambda\\) depend on \\((a,b)\\) immediately opens the possibility that **Bell\u2019s inequality can be violated** without invoking nonlocality. Essentially, you could \u201ctune\u201d the distribution of \\(\\lambda\\) in just the right way to match experimental data\u2014yet still have no faster-than-light influence.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Keeping Local Causality While Breaking the Inequality\n\nBell\u2019s theorem says you cannot simultaneously have:\n\n1. Local causality, **and**  \n2. Statistical independence,  \n\n**and** reproduce the experimentally observed violations of Bell\u2019s inequality. But if you **drop** (2) and keep (1), you end up with a framework called **superdeterminism**. In superdeterministic models:\n\n- **Local causality holds**: No influence propagates faster than light.  \n- **Statistical independence fails**: The hidden variables and the measurement settings are correlated.\n\nThis correlation can arise from the fact that everything\u2014**including** the choice of measurement settings\u2014has some common cause in the past, so that the \u201cchoice\u201d is not truly free. From a practical standpoint, it means that how you decide the measurement settings is not truly \u201cindependent\u201d of the system being measured; both have been (super)determined by the initial conditions of the universe, or by some deeper mechanism that couples experimenter choices and the system\u2019s state.\n\n---\n\n### 4. The Core Idea of Superdeterminism\n\nHence the term \u201csuperdeterminism\u201d:\n\n- It is \u201cdeterministic,\u201d in the sense that the hidden variables determine outcomes (as in a hidden-variable theory).  \n- It is \u201csuper\u201d in the sense that **it also determines** measurement choices. In other words, the entire experimental setup (including the choices for settings \\(a, b\\)) and the hidden variables \\(\\lambda\\) come from the same overarching initial conditions or underlying dynamics.  \n\nOnce you allow that everything is correlated from the get-go, the assumptions behind Bell\u2019s theorem\u2014especially the part about \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cindependent\u201d settings\u2014no longer hold, making it possible to violate Bell-type inequalities *without* introducing nonlocal influences.\n\n---\n\n#### In Short\n\n- **Local causality** forbids instantaneous, faster-than-light influences.  \n- **Violating statistical independence** allows the hidden variables to be correlated with the measurement settings.  \n\nPutting those together yields a **superdeterministic** model: **local** (no spooky action at a distance) yet able to reproduce the empirical violations of Bell\u2019s inequality, precisely because the measurement choices are not truly independent of the system\u2019s hidden state."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"ebd1675d-0b19-4985-b5f0-e25c74f480dd","request_id":"9155a5578888fcde-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ebd1675d-0b19-4985-b5f0-e25c74f480dd","children":[]}}}
