its valuation to $380 billion\u2014more than double its $183 billion valuation from September 2025. The funding was led by Singapore\u2019s GIC and Coatue Management, and ranks among the largest private fundraises in history. The surge in valuation stems from strong investor interest in Anthropic's rapid technological progress, especially the success of its coding assistant, Claude Code, released in May 2025. The company reports annualized revenue of $14 billion, maintaining growth of over tenfold annually for three years.\n\nDespite large spending on computing and talent, Anthropic aims to reduce cash burn to 9% of revenue by 2027 and targets profitability by 2028\u2014two years ahead of rival OpenAI, which seeks $100 billion in new funding. The rapid rise in AI company valuations has sparked concerns from investors about industry sustainability. Stock prices of major tech firms like Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia have experienced volatility amid reappraisal of AI spending. Anthropic, emphasizing safety and ad-free products, recently aired TV ads during Super Bowl LX, taking aim at OpenAI\u2019s ad-supported model.

Highlighting their ambitious goals, executives touted access to a massive GPU training cluster and revealed plans for future orbital data centers powered by SpaceX.\n\nAlthough xAI's chatbot Grok trails ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in market share, the company claims strong developments in image generation and coding infrastructure. The firm is now structured around four core units, with new leadership appointed to lead each team. Musk also shared a bold vision where AI could eventually replace traditional coding. xAI\u2019s integration with SpaceX aims to form a $1.25 trillion company with plans to go public later in the year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1770840195.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-is-unsatisfied-with-some-nvidia-chips-looking-alternatives-sources-say-2026-02-02/","title":"Exclusive: OpenAI is unsatisfied with some Nvidia chips ...","snippet":"3 Feb 2026 \u2014 OpenAI is unsatisfied with some of Nvidia's latest artificial intelligence chips, and it has sought alternatives since last year, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1770066955.185,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/","title":"OpenAI lays groundwork for juggernaut IPO at up to $1 trillion valuation","snippet":"OpenAI is preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO) that could value the artificial intelligence company at up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. While discussions are still in early stages, filings might occur as early as the second half of 2026, with some insiders suggesting a possible 2027 launch \u2014 or even sooner. The company is reportedly looking to raise at least $60 billion initially. Though OpenAI has stated that an IPO is not a current focus, it has undergone a key restructuring that positions it for public investment by reducing reliance on Microsoft, which owns around 27% of the company.\n\nThe latest restructuring involves the OpenAI Foundation, which now holds a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and holds warrants for more shares. This setup keeps the nonprofit\u2019s oversight while enabling OpenAI to raise capital more efficiently and pursue larger acquisitions to fund CEO Sam Altman\u2019s ambition of scaling AI infrastructure. OpenAI, projected to reach $20 billion in annual revenue by year-end, is also facing increasing losses. The IPO would benefit major investors including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX, amid a broader AI-driven market surge.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1761823499.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-buy-compute-capacity-startup-cerebras-around-10-billion-wsj-reports-2026-01-14/","title":"OpenAI signs $10 billion computing deal with Nvidia ...","snippet":"15 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI will purchase up to 750 megawatts of computing power over three years from chipmaker Cerebras as the ChatGPT maker looks to pull ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":1768421192.845,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/company/openai-llc/","title":"Openai LLC","snippet":"Japan's SoftBank Group booked a fourth consecutive quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by the rising valuation of its OpenAI investment and took on more ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wsj.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-ai-board-chris-liddell-1df5545b","title":"Anthropic Adds New Board Member as It Eyes IPO","snippet":"Anthropic has appointed Chris Liddell\u2014former Microsoft and General Motors executive\u2014to its board of directors as the company considers a potential IPO by the end of 2026.

The funding was led by Singapore\u2019s GIC and Coatue Management, and ranks among the largest private fundraises in history. The surge in valuation stems from strong investor interest in Anthropic's rapid technological progress, especially the success of its coding assistant, Claude Code, released in May 2025. The company reports annualized revenue of $14 billion, maintaining growth of over tenfold annually for three years.\n\nDespite large spending on computing and talent, Anthropic aims to reduce cash burn to 9% of revenue by 2027 and targets profitability by 2028\u2014two years ahead of rival OpenAI, which seeks $100 billion in new funding. The rapid rise in AI company valuations has sparked concerns from investors about industry sustainability. Stock prices of major tech firms like Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia have experienced volatility amid reappraisal of AI spending. Anthropic, emphasizing safety and ad-free products, recently aired TV ads during Super Bowl LX, taking aim at OpenAI\u2019s ad-supported model.

While discussions are still in early stages, filings might occur as early as the second half of 2026, with some insiders suggesting a possible 2027 launch \u2014 or even sooner. The company is reportedly looking to raise at least $60 billion initially. Though OpenAI has stated that an IPO is not a current focus, it has undergone a key restructuring that positions it for public investment by reducing reliance on Microsoft, which owns around 27% of the company.\n\nThe latest restructuring involves the OpenAI Foundation, which now holds a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and holds warrants for more shares. This setup keeps the nonprofit\u2019s oversight while enabling OpenAI to raise capital more efficiently and pursue larger acquisitions to fund CEO Sam Altman\u2019s ambition of scaling AI infrastructure. OpenAI, projected to reach $20 billion in annual revenue by year-end, is also facing increasing losses.

Companies like Notion, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, and SpaceX are facilitating tender offers, enabling employees to sell private shares and access liquidity. Notion\u2019s $270 million tender offer in January 2026 drew overwhelming interest, especially from former employees, forcing the company to scale back payouts.\n\nThis trend reflects a cultural shift as startups stay private longer, making early liquidity essential for talent retention. For example, OpenAI\u2019s recent $6.6 billion tender valued the company at $500 billion, and Anthropic is planning a similar offer at a $350 billion valuation. Even younger startups like Gamma, ElevenLabs, and Harvey are conducting tenders to help employees realize some of their paper wealth.\n\nWhile some critics worry that selling shares could dampen long-term commitment, the growing demand from investors and pressure to reward talent are driving the trend. Experts caution that current inflated AI compensation levels are unsustainable, predicting more realistic valuations and compensation in the future.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1770951600.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42","title":"OpenAI Plans Fourth-Quarter IPO in Race to Beat ...","snippet":"29 Jan 2026 \u2014 The $500 billion startup is holding informal talks with Wall Street banks about a potential initial public offering, people familiar with the ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-01-29-2026/card/kcyq2ilCPbJ7a1lRJj9C","title":"OpenAI Plans Fourth-Quarter IPO in Race to Beat ...","snippet":"OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a public listing in the fourth quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter said, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-says-xai-was-reorganized-2026-02-11/","title":"Musk reorganizes xAI after SpaceX merger and ahead of blockbuster IPO","snippet":"Elon Musk has reorganized his AI startup xAI following its merger with SpaceX, ahead of a highly anticipated IPO that could be among the largest in history. The restructuring comes amid significant leadership changes, with only half of xAI\u2019s original 12 co-founders remaining after recent resignations. Musk cited the need for improved efficiency at scale as the company competes with leading AI firms like OpenAI and Google.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting, Musk detailed plans to expand xAI\u2019s capabilities in language models, image and video generation, and coding tools. Highlighting their ambitious goals, executives touted access to a massive GPU training cluster and revealed plans for future orbital data centers powered by SpaceX.\n\nAlthough xAI's chatbot Grok trails ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in market share, the company claims strong developments in image generation and coding infrastructure. The firm is now structured around four core units, with new leadership appointed to lead each team.

While discussions are still in early stages, filings might occur as early as the second half of 2026, with some insiders suggesting a possible 2027 launch \u2014 or even sooner. The company is reportedly looking to raise at least $60 billion initially. Though OpenAI has stated that an IPO is not a current focus, it has undergone a key restructuring that positions it for public investment by reducing reliance on Microsoft, which owns around 27% of the company.\n\nThe latest restructuring involves the OpenAI Foundation, which now holds a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and holds warrants for more shares. This setup keeps the nonprofit\u2019s oversight while enabling OpenAI to raise capital more efficiently and pursue larger acquisitions to fund CEO Sam Altman\u2019s ambition of scaling AI infrastructure. OpenAI, projected to reach $20 billion in annual revenue by year-end, is also facing increasing losses. The IPO would benefit major investors including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX, amid a broader AI-driven market surge.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1761823499.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investing.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-preparing-for-fourthquarter-ipo-wsj-reports-4474945","title":"OpenAI preparing for fourth-quarter IPO, WSJ reports","snippet":"29 Jan 2026 \u2014 Recent reports showed OpenAI seeking to raise $100 billion from several global investors at a valuation of $830 billion.

Companies like Notion, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, and SpaceX are facilitating tender offers, enabling employees to sell private shares and access liquidity. Notion\u2019s $270 million tender offer in January 2026 drew overwhelming interest, especially from former employees, forcing the company to scale back payouts.\n\nThis trend reflects a cultural shift as startups stay private longer, making early liquidity essential for talent retention. For example, OpenAI\u2019s recent $6.6 billion tender valued the company at $500 billion, and Anthropic is planning a similar offer at a $350 billion valuation. Even younger startups like Gamma, ElevenLabs, and Harvey are conducting tenders to help employees realize some of their paper wealth.\n\nWhile some critics worry that selling shares could dampen long-term commitment, the growing demand from investors and pressure to reward talent are driving the trend. Experts caution that current inflated AI compensation levels are unsustainable, predicting more realistic valuations and compensation in the future.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1770951600.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42","title":"OpenAI Plans Fourth-Quarter IPO in Race to Beat ...","snippet":"29 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a public listing in the fourth quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter said, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-01-29-2026/card/kcyq2ilCPbJ7a1lRJj9C","title":"OpenAI Plans Fourth-Quarter IPO in Race to Beat ...","snippet":"29 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a public listing in the fourth quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter said, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/softbank-books-16-billion-profit-third-quarter-2026-02-12/","title":"SoftBank posts fourth straight quarterly profit on OpenAI investment gain","snippet":"SoftBank Group reported its fourth consecutive quarterly profit, buoyed by a significant gain from its investment in OpenAI. In the October-December 2025 quarter, the company posted a net profit of 248.6 billion yen ($1.62 billion), a recovery from a net loss of 369 billion yen in the same period the previous year. A major contributor was a $19.8 billion gain from its rising stake in OpenAI, in which SoftBank has invested over $30 billion, holding an 11% share. As OpenAI seeks additional funding at a potential $830 billion valuation, SoftBank\u2019s exposure continues to grow.\n\nTo fund this aggressive AI push, SoftBank has increased its borrowings, raised funds through asset sales (including a partial stake sale in T-Mobile), and expanded loans using shares in its holdings such as Arm and SoftBank Corp. The company's loan-to-value ratio rose to 20.6%, with its cash reserves dropping to 3.8 trillion yen. This strategy positions SoftBank as a de facto publicly traded proxy for OpenAI.

Meanwhile, Anthropic\u2014creator of the Claude chatbot\u2014is also planning an IPO and aiming to raise around $20 billion.\n\nBoth companies are operating at significant losses as they vie for dominance in the growing AI sector; Anthropic targets profitability by 2028, while OpenAI projects breaking even by 2030.

mission meets the market: Navigating nonprofit spinouts","snippet":"This article addresses the trend of nonprofit organizations, particularly in sectors like EdTech, healthcare, and software, engaging in spinouts\u2014where a nonprofit transfers all or most of its assets to a for-profit entity. These spinouts are increasingly used to access capital, remain competitive, and pursue evolving missions amid declining federal funding. Spinouts can help nonprofits overcome limitations on fundraising and compensation, but they bring regulatory and legal challenges due to IRS and state oversight meant to prevent misuse of charitable assets and private benefit.\n\nKey factors in determining whether a spinout is appropriate include the need for capital, mission alignment, tax concerns over unrelated business activities, and the inability to offer equity-based compensation. The article outlines crucial legal and strategic considerations: securing independent asset valuation, choosing proper compensation structures, establishing disinterested oversight, obtaining necessary state approvals, and managing public perception. It discusses how to structure the for-profit entity to align with nonprofit goals and mitigate risks. Overall, the article stresses careful planning, transparent governance, and early regulatory engagement for a successful nonprofit-to-for-profit spinout.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1770821675.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-seeks-up-134-billion-openai-microsoft-wrongful-gains-2026-01-17/","title":"Musk seeks up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft","snippet":"20 Jan 2026 \u2014 MICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\u200b\u200b During the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk.

OpenAI recently underwent a major corporate restructuring, converting its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation in a deal with Microsoft that valued the company at about $500 billion. This reorganization provided OpenAI with more operational flexibility while retaining control under its nonprofit parent, the OpenAI Foundation, which holds 26% of shares. The company is increasing investment in data centers and has established multibillion-dollar partnerships with Google and Amazon. Friar also mentioned OpenAI's efforts to secure U.S. government support to mitigate financing challenges related to AI chip development.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1762376449.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"roninlegalconsulting.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://roninlegalconsulting.com/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-a-closer-look/","title":"Elon Musk's Lawsuit Against OpenAI: A Closer Look","snippet":"8 May 2025 \u2014 Court Rulings.

CEO Sam Altman cited feedback from civic leaders and discussions with California and Delaware attorneys general as influencing the decision. Instead of converting to a conventional for-profit model, OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm will become a public benefit corporation (PBC), which allows it to pursue both profit and a social mission. This new structure will allow easier access to capital for things like mergers and acquisitions while preserving nonprofit oversight.\n\nUnder this recapitalization plan, PBC shareholders will receive stock, and profit caps for some early investors will be lifted. Nonetheless, the nonprofit will retain governance control by selecting PBC board members. This approach follows scrutiny from regulators and civil society groups, especially regarding alignment with OpenAI\u2019s original charitable mission to safely develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, some critics remain wary that the changes might lead to conflicts between public benefit goals and shareholder interests.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s move comes amid a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk over its shift away from its founding principles and ongoing regulatory reviews. Despite this, Altman affirmed that major investments, including those from SoftBank and Microsoft, are still expected.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1746469019.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/openai-scraps-for-profit-plans-to-remain-under-control-of-nonprofit-11728854","title":"OpenAI Scraps For-Profit Plans","snippet":"OpenAI has announced it will not transition to a for-profit structure as previously planned. Instead, it will convert its existing limited liability company (LLC), which develops ChatGPT and other AI tools, into a public benefit corporation (PBC), still under the control of its nonprofit board.

The nonprofit will continue overseeing the company and will become a major shareholder in the new structure. This decision followed consultations with the attorneys general of Delaware and California, whose approval would have been necessary for a full shift to for-profit. Despite the structural change, OpenAI intends to retain access to a $30 billion investment opportunity from SoftBank.

Musk alleges that OpenAI misled him by abandoning its nonprofit mission in favor of a profit-driven structure, particularly through its partnership with Microsoft. He claims to have donated $38 million to OpenAI to support its original vision and is seeking both monetary damages and a revocation of the Microsoft licensing deal. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that a jury should evaluate. OpenAI, meanwhile, denies the accusations, asserting Musk was aware of the for-profit shift and that their nonprofit entity still maintains control. A spokesperson for OpenAI labeled Musk's lawsuit as baseless and part of a pattern of harassment. Musk\u2019s legal team expressed confidence in presenting their case before the jury. The trial is scheduled for March 2026. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI in 2015, left the organization in 2018 and has since launched a rival AI company, xAI, which also recently filed a separate lawsuit against OpenAI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1767827755.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698fc309ee9c8320ab8807a3c7d80f51","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"request_id":"7834bfdb-406b-404f-9882-58dcb2ae7348","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"3ffd1b0a-723c-4582-9423-f12207382ddd","turn_exchange_id":"ac5d209a-5638-48ca-91d0-7d9076617d0d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing legal status and potential obstacles of Musk lawsuit","classifier_response":"default","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3ffd1b0a-723c-4582-9423-f12207382ddd","children":["76286eb5-cb22-4137-9064-378dbb57b865"]},"76286eb5-cb22-4137-9064-378dbb57b865":{"id":"76286eb5-cb22-4137-9064-378dbb57b865","message":{"id":"76286eb5-cb22-4137-9064-378dbb57b865","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771029269.01493,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing impact of Elon Musk lawsuit on IPO process","content":"The Musk lawsuit poses some legal risk, but it's unlikely to derail OpenAI's IPO.

lawsuit over OpenAI for-profit conversion can head to trial, US judge says","snippet":"A U.S. judge has ruled that Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI can proceed to a jury trial. Musk, a cofounder of OpenAI who departed in 2018, alleges the company violated its founding mission as a nonprofit promoting public benefit by restructuring into a for-profit entity. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated there was sufficient evidence to justify a trial, scheduled for March 2026. Musk claims he contributed $38 million and strategic support under the premise that OpenAI would remain nonprofit, and he seeks damages from alleged \"ill-gotten gains\" following deals with Microsoft. The lawsuit accuses OpenAI leaders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman of orchestrating this change for personal gain. OpenAI and Microsoft deny these claims, asserting Musk is a commercial competitor acting out of frustration. The court must also determine whether Musk filed the lawsuit within the statute of limitations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1767837394.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-seeks-up-134-billion-openai-microsoft-wrongful-gains-2026-01-17/","title":"Musk seeks up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft","snippet":"Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming they obtained \"wrongful gains\" from his foundational support of OpenAI. In a federal court filing, Musk alleges that OpenAI profited between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion, and Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion due to his early involvement, including $38 million in startup funding and his assistance in scaling the business. Musk\u2019s legal team emphasizes his central role in OpenAI\u2019s early development and argues that the returns he seeks align with what early investors can expect. OpenAI has dismissed the claim as \"unserious\" and part of a broader \"harassment campaign,\" while Microsoft has not commented. Both defendants filed rebuttals, criticizing the credibility and methodology of Musk\u2019s expert witness, C. Paul Wazzan, and rejecting the proposed damages as speculative and flawed. The case stems from Musk's accusation that OpenAI violated its nonprofit mission when it restructured into a for-profit entity. The dispute will proceed to jury trial in April in Oakland, California. Musk could also seek punitive damages and potential injunctions if liability is established.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1768681389.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/musks-bid-dismiss-openais-harassment-claims-denied-court-2025-08-13/","title":"Musk's bid to dismiss OpenAI's harassment claims denied ...","snippet":"13 Aug 2025 \u2014 Aug 13 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday denied Elon Musk's bid to dismiss OpenAI's claims of a \"years-long harassment campaign\" by the ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1755086643.246,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-court-denies-musk-preliminary-injunction-his-suit-against-openai-2025-03-05/","title":"Judge denies Musk's bid to halt OpenAI's for-profit shift, fast ...","snippet":"5 Mar 2025 \u2014 A US judge on Tuesday denied billionaire Elon Musk's request for a preliminary injunction to pause OpenAI's transition to a for-profit model.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1741137599.401,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-judge-signals-musks-xai-may-lose-lawsuit-accusing-altmans-openai-of-stealing-2026-01-31/","title":"US judge signals Musk's xAI may lose lawsuit accusing ...","snippet":"2 Feb 2026 \u2014 U.S. District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco said her \"tentative view\" is to grant OpenAI's motion to \u200cdismiss xAI's lawsuit, pending oral ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":1769821846.525,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/musk-openai-jury-trial-begin-spring-next-year-2025-04-04/","title":"Musk and OpenAI jury trial to begin in spring next year","snippet":"4 Apr 2025 \u2014 Billionaire Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI will go to a jury trial in spring 2026, the federal judge presiding over the case decided on Friday.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":1743808592.536,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-explains-order-new-york-times-openai-copyright-case-2025-04-04/","title":"Judge explains order for New York Times in OpenAI ...","snippet":"4 Apr 2025 \u2014 U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein, whose three-page order last week rejected parts of OpenAI and Microsoft's motion to dismiss, said in Friday's ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1743801866.444,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.straitstimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/openai-microsoft-lose-last-chance-to-avoid-trial-with-musk","title":"OpenAI, Microsoft lose last chance to avoid trial with Musk","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 A federal judge in Oakland, California, on Jan 15 rejected requests by OpenAI and Microsoft to dismiss claims by Mr Musk and ordered the case to ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1768556700.0,"attribution":"www.straitstimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techbuzz.ai","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techbuzz.ai/articles/open-ai-lawsuit-exposed-the-private-diaries-secret-texts-and-500-billion-fraud-case-going-to-trial-in-2026","title":"OpenAI Lawsuit Exposed: The Private Diaries, Secret Texts ...","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 On January 15, 2026, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a 28-page ruling that OpenAI's lawyers had been dreading for months.

Musk, who co-founded the organization in 2015 with Sam Altman, alleges that OpenAI misled him about its shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit enterprise, now valued at $500 billion. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated during a hearing in Oakland that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to decide the case, potentially including fraud and unjust enrichment claims, particularly those involving Microsoft\u2019s $135 billion stake in OpenAI.\n\nThe case hinges on whether and when OpenAI executives, particularly Altman and Greg Brockman, began planning the shift toward profit-driven goals. Musk claims he was misled into believing the organization would remain nonprofit and mission-focused. Evidence includes a 2017 diary entry from Brockman expressing interest in personal financial gain. The trial may require testimony from both Musk and Altman. The judge has yet to finalize logistics or determine if the alleged deceit occurred within the three-year statute of limitations for fraud claims, which could influence the trial's scope.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1767832123.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/judge-rejects-sam-altman-efforts-toss-elon-musk-case-openai-2026-1","title":"'This case is going to trial': Judge rejects Sam Altman's efforts to toss Elon Musk's OpenAI lawsuit","snippet":"A California federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman will proceed to trial, rejecting efforts to have the case dismissed. Musk alleges that OpenAI misled him by abandoning its nonprofit mission in favor of a profit-driven structure, particularly through its partnership with Microsoft. He claims to have donated $38 million to OpenAI to support its original vision and is seeking both monetary damages and a revocation of the Microsoft licensing deal. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that a jury should evaluate. OpenAI, meanwhile, denies the accusations, asserting Musk was aware of the for-profit shift and that their nonprofit entity still maintains control. A spokesperson for OpenAI labeled Musk's lawsuit as baseless and part of a pattern of harassment. Musk\u2019s legal team expressed confidence in presenting their case before the jury. The trial is scheduled for March 2026. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI in 2015, left the organization in 2018 and has since launched a rival AI company, xAI, which also recently filed a separate lawsuit against OpenAI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1767827755.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/7353391/elon-musk-sam-altman-openai-trial/","title":"The Lawsuit That Could Reshape the AI Industry Is Going to Trial","snippet":"A high-stakes lawsuit, Musk v. Altman, is set to go to trial and could significantly impact the future of the AI industry. Elon Musk is suing OpenAI\u2019s co-founders, including Sam Altman, and Microsoft, alleging they deceived him during OpenAI's transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit model. Musk, who previously donated $38 million, claims he was misled and denied financial stake despite helping lay the company's foundation, now seeking up to $134 billion in damages. OpenAI rebuffs these claims, calling them harassment fueled by Musk's competitive interests via his rival company, xAI.\n\nThe unfolding trial has already unveiled thousands of internal OpenAI documents, including a 2017 note suggesting ethical concerns over shifting the nonprofit without Musk\u2019s involvement. A loss for OpenAI could upend its financial and structural future, potentially jeopardizing its profit strategy and investor ties.\n\nSeparately, former OpenAI policy head Miles Brundage has launched AVERI, a nonprofit pushing for third-party AI auditing to address the industry's lack of accountability. Meanwhile, a group has released a \"data poisoning\" tool to disrupt AI model development, citing existential threats posed by machine intelligence. These developments reflect growing societal and legal tensions surrounding AI ethics, governance, and control.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1768925331.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698fc309ee9c8320ab8807a3c7d80f51","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"request_id":"7834bfdb-406b-404f-9882-58dcb2ae7348","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"3ce6707c-62cb-45e0-8739-cbf330187569","turn_exchange_id":"ac5d209a-5638-48ca-91d0-7d9076617d0d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for trial date updates on Reuters","classifier_response":"default","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"31af21b5-a413-41ed-922c-1ed9845f3340","children":["6e9c3f2c-6c2a-48a7-9d43-8bbb38bfc3f8"]},"6e9c3f2c-6c2a-48a7-9d43-8bbb38bfc3f8":{"id":"6e9c3f2c-6c2a-48a7-9d43-8bbb38bfc3f8","message":{"id":"6e9c3f2c-6c2a-48a7-9d43-8bbb38bfc3f8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771029291.552187,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Assessment of IPO derailment risk and potential obstacles","content":"The lawsuit's current status suggests low chances of derailing the IPO; after failing to secure a preliminary injunction, the trial isn't until April 2026, and injunctive relief remains uncertain.

While the CMA acknowledged Microsoft's \"material influence\" over OpenAI, it found no evidence of de facto control. Nonetheless, it clarified this does not mean the partnership is free from all competitive concerns. Microsoft welcomed the CMA's conclusion, calling the partnership a driver of competition and innovation in AI.

While U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein dismissed some claims, the core allegations \u2014 including copyright violations \u2014 will continue. A consolidated lawsuit also includes MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing. The Times alleges that generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has regurgitated its content verbatim, which threatens its business model. OpenAI responded positively to the partial dismissal, asserting that its data use aligns with fair use and innovation. Microsoft declined to comment on the ruling. The judge has not yet provided detailed reasoning but stated that it will follow soon.

The partnership will allow Amazon to incorporate summaries and excerpts of The Times' content into various customer-facing products, such as Alexa. Additionally, Amazon will use articles from The New York Times, including those from its subsidiaries The Athletic and NYT Cooking, to train its AI models.\n\nThis agreement follows a lawsuit filed by The Times over a year ago against Microsoft and OpenAI for allegedly using its content without permission for AI training, resulting in lost revenue. Similar lawsuits have been filed by other media outlets. In contrast, several publishers like The Atlantic, News Corp, and Vox Media have opted for licensing deals with AI companies.\n\nAmazon recently released an enhanced version of its Alexa assistant, which integrates AI and has reportedly been tested by hundreds of thousands of users.

Legal filings recently unsealed from a copyright lawsuit reveal the company spent tens of millions acquiring and disassembling books for digitization. Anthropic sourced books from sellers like Better World Books and World of Books, using high-speed scanners and recycling the books afterward.\n\nThis project is part of a broader trend among AI firms\u2014such as Meta, OpenAI, and Google\u2014racing to obtain vast text datasets, often without author or publisher consent. Internal documents show these companies also downloaded pirated books from shadow libraries like LibGen and the Pirate Library Mirror. Although courts have ruled that training AI with books might qualify as \u201cfair use,\u201d how these materials were acquired remains legally contentious. Anthropic settled its lawsuit by agreeing to pay $1.5 billion without admitting wrongdoing.\n\nSome industry insiders call for a reset to fairly compensate creators.

The cleanest path is often **settle, win, or wait**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search13\ue201  \n- Even if they press ahead, they\u2019d need to disclose the litigation in depth, and investors typically demand a **risk premium** (lower price) for: (i) uncertainty of outcome, (ii) potential remedies, (iii) discovery revealing awkward internal documents.\n\n**Less likely but higher-impact: a disruptive remedy**\n- To truly \u201cderail,\u201d Musk would need a court outcome that **forces structural/contractual changes** (e.g., restrictions on governance, unwinding/limiting parts of the Microsoft relationship, etc.). Courts *can* order injunction-like remedies after trial, but (a) he failed to get a preliminary injunction already, and (b) unwind remedies in complex, fast-moving tech partnerships are hard and usually appealed. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n\n**Wild card: statute of limitations**\n- The judge has flagged that **timing/statute-of-limitations issues** may matter for what claims survive and what damages window is even in play. That can sharply reduce (or reshape) the case even before a jury decides merits. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n\n### Other potential obstacles to an OpenAI IPO (even ignoring Musk)\n\n1) **Nonprofit-to\u2013Public Benefit Corporation governance + regulator oversight**\n- OpenAI\u2019s structure is unusual: a **public benefit corporation (PBC) with nonprofit control**, and they\u2019ve explicitly referenced ongoing engagement with **California and Delaware attorneys general** around the structure. That oversight can become a gating item for big capital-market moves. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view4\ue201  \n- More broadly, \u201cnonprofit spinout/asset transfer\u201d structures often trigger **valuation + private-benefit + state/IRS scrutiny** risks (the exact kind of thing that can slow transactions). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news32\ue201  \n\n2) **Antitrust/regulatory scrutiny tied to Microsoft**\n- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reportedly **intensified scrutiny of Microsoft\u2019s AI/cloud practices**, including how it bundles and uses market power\u2014exactly the ecosystem that OpenAI\u2019s distribution is entangled with. That doesn\u2019t automatically block an IPO, but it raises headline + compliance + remedy risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news33\ue201  \n- The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded Microsoft/OpenAI didn\u2019t qualify for a UK merger investigation under UK rules (helpful), but that\u2019s not the same as \u201cno competition risk anywhere.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn3news42\ue201  \n\n3) **Copyright / training-data litigation overhang**\n- U.S. cases by major authors/news outlets (including The New York Times) have been **consolidated** and are still moving through court; these are the kind of unresolved claims that can sit in S-1 risk factors and affect valuation. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn3news43\ue201  \n\n4) **Capital intensity + financing strategy**\n- Even OpenAI\u2019s CFO has publicly downplayed near-term IPO focus, emphasizing scaling and capital needs (datacenters, chips, financing structures). If private capital remains available on good terms, IPO urgency drops; if it tightens, IPO pressure rises. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view3\ue201  \n\n### Bottom line\n- **Musk can realistically slow an IPO** (or force a \u201csettle first\u201d decision) because the case is live, high-profile, and near-term in court. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search13\ue201  \n- **Outright derailment** is much less likely unless he wins a remedy that materially changes governance or key commercial arrangements\u2014and even then, appeals and negotiated settlements are common endgames. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent reporting on Musk/OpenAI legal and regulatory risks\ue202turn2search1,turn2search5,turn2search0,turn3news33,turn3news43,turn2search6\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search13\ue201","start_idx":206,"end_idx":252,"safe_urls":["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/openai-microsoft-lose-last-chance-to-avoid-trial-with-musk","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/openai-microsoft-lose-last-chance-to-avoid-trial-with-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-seeks-up-134-billion-openai-microsoft-wrongful-gains-2026-01-17/","https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-seeks-up-134-billion-openai-microsoft-wrongful-gains-2026-01-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.straitstimes.com/business/openai-microsoft-lose-last-chance-to-avoid-trial-with-musk","https://www.straitstimes.com/business/openai-microsoft-lose-last-chance-to-avoid-trial-with-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-seeks-up-134-billion-openai-microsoft-wrongful-gains-2026-01-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Musk seeks up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-seeks-up-134-billion-openai-microsoft-wrongful-gains-2026-01-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1768681389.0,"snippet":"Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming they obtained \"wrongful gains\" from his foundational support of OpenAI.

Musk, a cofounder of OpenAI who departed in 2018, alleges the company violated its founding mission as a nonprofit promoting public benefit by restructuring into a for-profit entity. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated there was sufficient evidence to justify a trial, scheduled for March 2026. Musk claims he contributed $38 million and strategic support under the premise that OpenAI would remain nonprofit, and he seeks damages from alleged \"ill-gotten gains\" following deals with Microsoft.

OpenAI and Microsoft deny these claims, asserting Musk is a commercial competitor acting out of frustration.

These spinouts are increasingly used to access capital, remain competitive, and pursue evolving missions amid declining federal funding. Spinouts can help nonprofits overcome limitations on fundraising and compensation, but they bring regulatory and legal challenges due to IRS and state oversight meant to prevent misuse of charitable assets and private benefit.\n\nKey factors in determining whether a spinout is appropriate include the need for capital, mission alignment, tax concerns over unrelated business activities, and the inability to offer equity-based compensation. The article outlines crucial legal and strategic considerations: securing independent asset valuation, choosing proper compensation structures, establishing disinterested oversight, obtaining necessary state approvals, and managing public perception. It discusses how to structure the for-profit entity to align with nonprofit goals and mitigate risks. Overall, the article stresses careful planning, transparent governance, and early regulatory engagement for a successful nonprofit-to-for-profit spinout.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3news33\ue201","start_idx":3358,"end_idx":3376,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-ftc-ramps-up-scrutiny-microsoft-over-ai-cloud-practices-questions-rivals-2026-02-13/","https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-ftc-ramps-up-scrutiny-microsoft-over-ai-cloud-practices-questions-rivals-2026-02-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-ftc-ramps-up-scrutiny-microsoft-over-ai-cloud-practices-questions-rivals-2026-02-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"US FTC ramps up scrutiny of Microsoft over AI, cloud practices, questions rivals, Bloomberg reports","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-ftc-ramps-up-scrutiny-microsoft-over-ai-cloud-practices-questions-rivals-2026-02-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1771000040.0,"snippet":"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is intensifying its investigation into Microsoft\u2019s business practices, particularly relating to its AI, cloud computing, and software licensing strategies, according to a Bloomberg News report.

This scrutiny follows a 2024 investigation initiated under then-chair Lina Khan, probing whether Microsoft leveraged its market power to restrict customer migration to rival platforms through restrictive licensing terms. Critics, including Google\u2014which also filed a complaint with the European Commission\u2014argue that Microsoft\u2019s practices are anti-competitive, especially concerning its Azure cloud platform and Windows Server ecosystem.

The partnership, which began with Microsoft\u2019s $1 billion investment in 2019, had come under regulatory examination in both the UK and U.S., especially following leadership turmoil at OpenAI in 2023. While the CMA acknowledged Microsoft's \"material influence\" over OpenAI, it found no evidence of de facto control. Nonetheless, it clarified this does not mean the partnership is free from all competitive concerns. Microsoft welcomed the CMA's conclusion, calling the partnership a driver of competition and innovation in AI. The CMA has been actively reviewing collaborations between major tech firms and AI startups\u2014like those between Microsoft and Mistral AI, Amazon and Anthropic, and Alphabet and Anthropic\u2014but none have triggered a full probe. Recently granted extended powers, the CMA has begun probing Apple and Google\u2019s market ecosystems, suggesting increased scrutiny of tech giants, though the recent appointment of former Amazon executive Doug Gurr as interim chair may indicate a more deal-friendly approach moving forward.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn3news43\ue201","start_idx":3892,"end_idx":3923,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/cc19ef2cf3f23343738e892b60d6d7a6","https://apnews.com/article/cc19ef2cf3f23343738e892b60d6d7a6?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-copyright-lawsuits-authors-new-york-times-consolidated-manhattan-2025-04-03/","https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-copyright-lawsuits-authors-new-york-times-consolidated-manhattan-2025-04-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-copyright-lawsuits-authors-new-york-times-consolidated-manhattan-2025-04-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"OpenAI copyright lawsuits from authors, New York Times ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-copyright-lawsuits-authors-new-york-times-consolidated-manhattan-2025-04-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1743712284.414,"snippet":"3 Apr 2025 \u2014 A U.S. judicial panel decided on Thursday to consolidate in New York several copyright cases brought by prominent authors and news outlets ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Judge allows newspaper copyright lawsuit against OpenAI to proceed","url":"https://apnews.com/article/cc19ef2cf3f23343738e892b60d6d7a6?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"A federal judge in New York has ruled that The New York Times and other newspapers can proceed with a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft.

A consolidated lawsuit also includes MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing.

OpenAI responded positively to the partial dismissal, asserting that its data use aligns with fair use and innovation. Microsoft declined to comment on the ruling.
