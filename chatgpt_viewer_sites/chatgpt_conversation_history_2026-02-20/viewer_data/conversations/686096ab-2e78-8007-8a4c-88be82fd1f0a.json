From an **AI-fueled startup boom** to the **rise of Gen Z founders** and **\u201cvibe coders,\u201d** to a rollercoaster in **unicorn valuations and exits**, and a resurgence of the **\u201cjust build it\u201d hacker mentality**, the landscape has evolved rapidly. Below, we examine five key themes shaping U.S. startup culture in this era, with data and examples illustrating each trend.\n\n## 1. AI\u2019s Outsized Role in Startup Trends and Strategy\n\n**AI Dominates Startup Investment:** Artificial intelligence became the defining force in venture capital and product development post-2021. Global funding to AI startups *surged* to record levels by 2024, even as overall venture funding cooled from 2021 highs. In 2024, roughly **one-third of all venture dollars worldwide went into AI-related companies**, totaling over $100 billion \u2013 an **80%+ jump** from $55.6B in 2023\u301010\u2020L202-L207\u3011. This eclipsed even 2021\u2019s funding peak, making AI the **leading sector** for startup investment\u301010\u2020L202-L207\u3011. Generative AI, in particular, attracted massive funding: VCs poured **$29B into generative AI startups in 2023**, which nearly **doubled to $56B in 2024**\u30104\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u30104\u2020L143-L151\u3011. By early 2025, the frenzy hadn\u2019t abated \u2013 in Q1 2025 alone AI startups globally raised about **$73B (58% of all VC funding that quarter)**, compared to just 28% a year prior\u30109\u2020L31-L40\u3011. Major late-stage deals for AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, etc.) at stratospheric valuations drove these totals\u301010\u2020L235-L243\u3011\u301010\u2020L242-L251\u3011.\n\n**Product Development & \u201cAI-First\u201d Startups:** The AI gold rush not only channeled funding but also reshaped startup playbooks. Founders increasingly adopted \u201cAI-first\u201d strategies \u2013 building products around AI capabilities or quickly integrating large language models (LLMs) into existing offerings. \u201cYou can just talk to the large language models and they will code entire apps,\u201d noted Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, describing how new startups rely on AI to do heavy coding work\u301036\u2020L189-L197\u3011. This enabled **faster product development cycles** \u2013 startups could prototype features with generative AI APIs (for text, image, code generation, etc.) in days rather than months. For example, by late 2024, *25%* of Y Combinator\u2019s startup batch reported that **95% of their code was written by AI** assistants\u301040\u2020L253-L262\u3011. Founders leaned on tools like GitHub Copilot, OpenAI\u2019s Codex, and domain-specific AI models to accelerate development. The result: many young companies launched with surprisingly mature AI-driven products \u2013 from AI copywriting tools to code assistants \u2013 built by small teams leveraging off-the-shelf models.\n\n**VC FOMO and Founder Strategies:** Investor **\u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out)** around AI further shaped founder behavior. Venture firms aggressively chased AI deals in 2023\u20132025, afraid to miss the next OpenAI or Anthropic. \u201cThe fear of somebody else winning your market has never been higher than it is now,\u201d said one VC partner, explaining how FOMO drove dollars into AI-centric startups\u30109\u2020L33-L41\u3011. In response, founders strategically **positioned their startups as AI companies** \u2013 sometimes pivoting existing products to include an AI angle or rebranding with \u201cAI\u201d \u2013 to attract investment. This emphasis on AI even in non-deep-tech startups became a cultural meme: by 2023\u201324, a pitch deck almost *required* an AI slide. The upside was plentiful funding for AI-oriented startups; the downside was a glut of similar-sounding companies. Indeed, analysts warned of an *oversaturation* of me-too ventures in hot areas like AI coding assistants (at least **4 startups in 2024 each raised $100M+ to build code-generation tools**\u30104\u2020L191-L199\u3011). Founders increasingly had to differentiate by focusing on niche applications or proprietary data. Meanwhile, incumbents (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon) began *acqui-hiring* AI startups or their talent instead of traditional acquisitions\u301010\u2020L289-L297\u3011, impacting exit options (discussed below).\n\n**AI as a Founder Tool:** Beyond attracting funding, AI began lowering barriers to entrepreneurship. Early-stage founders used AI not just *in* their products but *to build* their products. Generative AI can produce code, designs, business copy, even pitch decks. This significantly **reduced the cost and team size needed to launch a startup**. Industry observers noted that AI tools allow solo or small founder teams to accomplish what a full staff might have in the past. \u201cAI will lower the cost of doing a startup, so some founders will not need VC money, or will need far less of it,\u201d as one venture analysis put it\u301015\u2020L505-L513\u3011. In practical terms, a single determined developer can leverage AI APIs to create a functional MVP, automate customer service with chatbots, and generate marketing content \u2013 all without hiring additional employees. This dynamic contributed to the rise of solo-founder companies (explored in Section 5). It also meant startups could stay *lean* longer. By late 2024, Tan observed startups reaching **$1M\u2013$10M in revenue with under 10 employees**, something essentially unheard of before\u301036\u2020L178-L186\u3011. He credited AI-driven efficiency \u2013 what he dubbed **\u201cvibe coding\u201d** (see Section 3) \u2013 for enabling tiny teams to *do the work of 50-100 engineers* using cutting-edge code generation tools\u301036\u2020L211-L219\u3011.\n\n**Example \u2013 The AI Boom\u2019s Flagship Startups:** The period saw a new crop of AI-focused startups skyrocket in valuation. OpenAI, though founded earlier, became the poster child after the viral success of ChatGPT (Nov 2022) \u2013 it raised *$6.6B in 2024 at a **$157B valuation***\u301010\u2020L235-L243\u3011, making it one of the most valuable private tech companies. Competitor Anthropic likewise raised billions (including a $4B round from Amazon) and hit ~$18B valuation\u301010\u2020L247-L251\u3011. Other notable \u201cunicorn\u201d examples include **Databricks** (AI/analytics platform) which raised $10B in 2023 at a $62B valuation\u301010\u2020L235-L243\u3011, and newer entrants like **Inflection AI**, **Character.AI**, and **xAI**, which each achieved multi-billion valuations within mere months of founding by focusing on large-scale AI models. These staggering valuations \u2013 often **3\u20134\u00d7 higher than they might have been in a normal market**\u301045\u2020L155-L163\u3011 \u2013 exemplified both the exuberance and the expectation that AI could reshape entire industries. By mid-2025, nearly every tech startup, from SaaS to healthcare to finance, felt pressure to articulate an AI strategy, whether that meant leveraging AI in product features or using AI internally to boost productivity. In short, AI became *the central narrative* of post-pandemic startup culture, driving trends in funding, product innovation, and how founders allocated their time and resources.\n\n## 2. Young Entrepreneurs: Gen Z Founders, College Dropouts & Under-30 CEOs\n\nThe post-2020 startup scene also witnessed a new generation of entrepreneurs stepping into the spotlight. **Gen Z founders and other under-30 innovators** began to play a more visible role in founding, funding, and leading startups \u2013 challenging traditional assumptions about experience versus youth.\n\n**Gen Z\u2019s Entrepreneurial Surge:** Members of Gen Z (born ~1997\u20132012) came of age during this period and showed *remarkable zeal* for entrepreneurship. Surveys indicate an overwhelming majority aspire to start businesses. One 2020 poll found **62% of Gen Zers planned to start their own company**, and a more recent study by Square in 2023 put that number at **84%**\u301020\u2020L433-L441\u3011. This far outpaces prior generations\u2019 entrepreneurial intent. Culturally, Gen Z views startups not as unusually risky ventures but as *attractive career paths*. Having grown up with teen startup success stories on social media and examples like Mark Zuckerberg, many see founding a company as a viable (even desirable) alternative to the traditional corporate or professional track\u301020\u2020L459-L468\u3011. Gen Z values independence, creative control, and social impact in their work \u2013 all factors that align with entrepreneurship. Dave Liniger, a veteran founder, notes that this cohort \u201coften [prioritizes] work-life balance and the ability to control their own schedules,\u201d driving them toward owning businesses rather than climbing corporate ladders\u301020\u2020L449-L457\u3011. \n\n**College Dropouts and Alternative Paths:** With that mindset, *skipping or leaving college* to launch startups became increasingly normalized. The old Silicon Valley lore of brilliant dropouts (Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg) found new life among Gen Z. Organizations like the Thiel Fellowship actively encouraged this: each year **20 young people receive $100,000 to drop out of college and pursue a tech startup**\u301024\u2020L50-L58\u3011. By the 2020s, hundreds had taken this route. In 2022 alone, the U.S. saw **2.1 million college students drop out**, and strikingly, **28% of them cited \u201cto start a business\u201d as a primary reason**\u301024\u2020L79-L87\u3011. This corresponds to *hundreds of thousands* of would-be founders leaving school to \u201cjust build.\u201d Many dropouts congregated in tech hubs or online communities, finding support through programs like Y Combinator\u2019s Startup School or hackathons. \n\nNotably, **some of the era\u2019s most successful startups were led by dropouts in their 20s**. For example, Alexandr Wang, who **left MIT at 19** to found the AI data platform Scale AI, became a self-made billionaire by his mid-20s\u301030\u2020L203-L211\u3011. In 2025, at just 28, Wang struck a headline-grabbing deal with Meta, valuing Scale at $29B and landing himself a key role in Meta\u2019s AI strategy\u301030\u2020L182-L190\u3011\u301030\u2020L203-L211\u3011. His trajectory \u2013 from college dropout to unicorn CEO \u2013 exemplifies how youth was not a barrier to credibility in this period. Likewise, Lucy Guo (co-founder of Scale AI) and others proved that *technical skill and hustle could outweigh age*. By 2023, **over 300 companies with solo founders had reached unicorn status** \u2013 many led by young entrepreneurs\u301055\u2020L61-L66\u3011.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that the fetishization of youth came with caveats. While media celebrated wunderkinds, data showed the *average* successful startup founder is actually in their 40s\u301024\u2020L87-L95\u3011. Many investors became somewhat more sober after the fallout of poorly run youth-led ventures (the Theranos and FTX scandals in the late 2010s/early 2020s served as warnings). Thus, young founders often sought to **bolster their teams with experienced advisors or co-founders**. As one VC put it: having some \u201c*white hairs*\u201d in the room helps when it comes time to scale sales or manage crises\u301017\u2020L328-L336\u3011. We saw under-30 CEOs increasingly pairing up with seasoned executives in key roles (e.g. a 23-year-old CEO hiring a veteran COO). \n\n**Gen Z Startup Culture:** The influence of young founders also infused startup culture with new values and trends. Gen Z entrepreneurs tend to be *digital natives* fluent in emerging platforms \u2013 they grew up with TikTok, YouTube, and Discord, and leveraged these channels for user acquisition and personal branding\u301017\u2020L336-L344\u3011. This generation is notably adept at building in public and using memes/viral content to promote their projects (a skill closely related to the \u201cvibe\u201d culture discussed later). They have also pushed the envelope on **social impact and diversity** in startups. Many Gen Z-led ventures focus on climate tech, social justice, and creator economy tools, aligning with their generation\u2019s broader concerns\u301017\u2020L368-L377\u3011. Investors have taken note: funds and accelerator programs emerged specifically targeting young and first-time founders, offering mentorship to complement their tech savvy.\n\n**Young Founder Funding & Notable Figures:** Despite a tighter funding environment after 2022, many under-30 founders continued to secure capital. Some high-profile examples include: **Melanie Perkins** (co-founder of Canva, who was in her 20s when Canva hit unicorn status and revolutionized design SaaS), **Henrique Dubugras** (co-CEO of Brex, became a unicorn CEO at 23), and a wave of crypto/web3 founders born in the late 1990s (though the crypto crash tempered that craze). Traditional institutions also recognized young talent \u2013 Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d lists in 2022\u20132025 were dominated by startup founders in fields like fintech, AI, and e-commerce. While experience still mattered, it became clear that *youth was no longer a deal-breaker for VCs*. In fact, by 2024 **35% of new startups were led by solo founders** (many of them young), *double* the share in 2017\u301055\u2020L61-L66\u3011\u301055\u2020L79-L86\u3011. The narrative shifted from \u201cdo young founders know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d to **\u201chow can we support these high-potential Gen Z CEOs to grow into effective leaders?\u201d**. The result was a more age-diverse startup ecosystem, with intergenerational collaboration: twenty-something product geniuses working alongside industry veterans, blending fresh ideas with hard-earned experience.\n\n## 3. The Rise of the \u201cVibe Coders\u201d\n\nOne of the more colorful cultural phenomena of the mid-2020s startup world is the emergence of **\u201cvibe coders.\u201d** This term, popularized in Silicon Valley circles in 2024\u201325, refers to independent or small-team developers who create software with an emphasis on **energy, rapid output, and online presence (or memes)** over rigorous, deep technical engineering. In other words, the *opposite* of the stereotypical PhD-caliber programmer \u2013 instead these are builders who hack things together quickly, leverage AI tools, and cultivate hype around their projects.\n\n**Defining \u201cVibe Coding\u201d:** The phrase was reportedly coined in Feb 2025 by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy (an OpenAI co-founder)\u301033\u2020L11-L18\u3011. As Garry Tan explains, *\u201cvibe coding\u201d means you can just talk to AI models and they will code entire apps... if you want a change, you don\u2019t have to write the code yourself*\u301036\u2020L189-L197\u3011\u301036\u2020L201-L204\u3011. Vibe coders fully embrace this \u2013 they *\u201cgive in\u201d* to AI assistance and glue together apps by prompting code out of large language models, using high-level frameworks, and skipping a lot of traditional software process. In practice, a vibe coder might build a demo over a weekend by copy-pasting from StackOverflow, using no-code tools, and asking ChatGPT to generate features \u2013 all while live-tweeting their progress with enthusiasm and humor. The goal is a **quick, functioning prototype** that captures the *vibe* of an idea, even if the underlying code is brittle.\n\nThese developers often gain attention through their **presence on tech Twitter/Reddit** (now X) and Product Hunt. They are meme-savvy, share screenshots or screen recordings of their apps with witty captions, and sometimes cultivate a personal brand around being a \u201chustle\u201d coder. Their value to a startup ecosystem is injecting fresh ideas and quickly spinning up products that can be user-tested. As Tan noted, when teams are \u201c*fully vibe coders*\u201d and skilled with modern AI code-gen tools, a **team of 10 can accomplish what 50\u2013100 engineers might have a few years ago**\u301036\u2020L211-L219\u3011. This has super-charged early-stage startups \u2013 enabling ultra-lean teams (or even solo devs) to create complex apps fast. Indeed, *81%* of YC\u2019s Winter 2025 batch were AI-related startups, many built in this rapid fashion\u301036\u2020L205-L214\u3011.\n\n**Hype vs. Substance \u2013 A Double-Edged Sword:** However, the *cultural critique* of vibe coders is that they sometimes favor flash over substance. Tech memes joke that two vibe coders can **\u201cgenerate enough technical debt to bury 50 engineers\u201d**, cranking out sloppy code that may work today but will be a maintenance nightmare tomorrow\u301034\u2020L148-L156\u3011. There\u2019s truth in the humor: relying on AI suggestions and quick fixes can lead to brittle software. Seasoned developers (and ops teams) have reacted with a mix of horror and amusement at this trend. *\u201cQA, Security, and SRE people around the world [are] collectively having heart attacks\u201d* at the idea of pure vibe-coded systems, quipped one Redditor\u301032\u2020L284-L292\u3011. Common scenes in startups now include a \u201cvibe coder\u201d rapidly shipping a feature overnight, only for senior engineers to spend days refactoring it properly. In online forums, people share meme-filled tales of projects where **no tests, no documentation, and API keys committed to GitHub** are standard \u2013 until it all breaks\u301034\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u301034\u2020L165-L173\u3011. The ethos is *\u201cmove fast and break things\u201d* taken to an extreme: *ship now, fix later* (and sometimes \u201clater\u201d never comes). \n\nDespite the risks, the vibe coder culture has notable **benefits**. It *lowers the barrier* to entry for non-traditional programmers and encourages experimentation. Many non-CS-background founders (designers, product managers, etc.) feel empowered to build apps using AI copilots and no-code tools \u2013 effectively becoming vibe coders themselves. This democratization of creation means more diverse ideas get tried. It also aligns with the *build in public* movement: vibe coders often share their work openly, get user feedback on Twitter, and iterate quickly based on the \u201cvibes\u201d they get from the community. In fact, the term \u201cvibe\u201d underscores the idea that these developers operate on **instinct and user resonance** rather than formal specs \u2013 if something feels 80% right and excites early adopters, that\u2019s good enough to launch.\n\n**Institutional Support of Vibe Coding:** What started as a meme became embraced by startup leaders. Y Combinator\u2019s Garry Tan has openly encouraged young engineers to *\u201cvibe code\u201d* and start companies instead of grinding through leetcode interviews for Big Tech jobs\u301036\u2020L243-L252\u3011. The message: the playing field has been leveled \u2013 you don\u2019t need a 20-person team to build a great product, just master new AI-augmented tools. By 2025, hackathons and accelerators were full of projects built almost entirely via AI assistance and low-code platforms (see Section 5). Venture firms too began valuing the **ability to iterate rapidly**; they might tolerate some messy code in exchange for a startup that can capture a market window early.\n\nUltimately, \u201cvibe coders\u201d reflect a cultural shift in programming. Software creation has become faster, more social, and more accessible \u2013 but also more chaotic. The best outcomes seem to arise when startups can **blend the vibe** (energy/hustle) **with veteran oversight**. As one industry satire noted, very few large-scale successes are *purely* vibe-coded; most eventually bring in experienced engineers to shore up the foundations\u301024\u2020L85-L93\u3011. But in the early phase of innovation, vibe coders have undeniably injected dynamism into the U.S. startup scene \u2013 proving that sometimes, *just winging it with code and creativity* can produce something people want, which is what matters most at day one.\n\n## 4. Tech Unicorns Post-2021: Evolution, Concentration, and Exit Landscape\n\nThe fate of **tech \u201cunicorns\u201d** (startups valued \u2265 $1B) in the post-pandemic era is a story of extremes: a *flood* of new unicorns during the 2021 boom, followed by a sharp slowdown and valuation correction, and an IPO winter that only began to thaw in late 2023. We see greater concentration in certain regions and sectors, and a recalibration of what those billion-dollar valuations really mean.\n\n**Explosion and Slowdown in Unicorn Creation:** 2021 will be remembered as *the Year of the Unicorn*. With abundant capital and zero-interest-rate-fueled optimism, unicorns were being minted at a record pace. Over **580 new unicorns were formed globally in 2021**, more than the previous five years combined\u301044\u2020L15-L23\u3011. The total number of private unicorn companies worldwide roughly doubled in that single year. By the start of 2022, **over 1,100 unicorns** existed globally\u301044\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301044\u2020L23-L30\u3011, collectively valued in the trillions. The U.S. alone added 340+ unicorns in 2021\u301044\u2020L5-L12\u3011, including breakout names like Notion, Clubhouse, and many crypto/NFT startups.\n\nHowever, this breakneck pace could not last. In 2022, as interest rates rose and public tech stocks tumbled, the unicorn birth rate plummeted. New unicorns globally dropped about 73% year-over-year in 2023\u301043\u2020L1-L8\u3011. According to CB Insights, **2023 saw only 71 new unicorns worldwide \u2013 a 7-year low**\u301043\u2020L1-L8\u3011. Essentially, unicorn creation reverted to its pre-2015 levels, after peaking in late 2021. Many startups that might have attained $1B valuations in a looser market were now being priced more conservatively or not raising at all. Investors became far more cautious, seeking profitability over growth-at-all-costs. \n\n**Valuation Corrections:** For existing unicorns, the story of 2022\u20132023 was a humbling one of *valuation cutbacks*. The inflated prices of 2021 came down to earth as companies raised down-rounds or accepted lower exit prices. A vivid example is **Instacart**: valued at $39B in a 2021 private round, it went public in Sept 2023 at just **$9.9B** \u2013 barely one-quarter of that peak private valuation\u301048\u2020L159-L167\u3011. Many other unicorn darlings faced similar \u201cvaluation haircuts.\u201d Stripe, the fintech giant, quietly reduced its internal valuation by over 50% from its 2021 peak (from $95B down to ~$50B in 2023) and raised new funding at that lower valuation to shore up liquidity. Klarna, a Buy-Now-Pay-Later startup, went from a $45B valuation in 2021 to about $7B in a 2022 funding round amid fintech sector woes. These resets underscored that a lot of the unicorn market cap created in the free-money era was, as one analysis put it, *\u201covervalued by 3-4\u00d7 at their peaks\u201d*\u301045\u2020L155-L163\u3011. By late 2022, a not-so-secret trend emerged: the \u201cstealth correction\u201d \u2013 many unicorns did not formally down-round, but their investor marks and secondary market trades indicated significantly lower implied valuations. PitchBook and others estimated that **perhaps one-third of unicorns were \u201czombies\u201d** by 2023, meaning their valuations were stagnant or inflated on paper with little hope of an up-round soon.\n\n**Concentration of Unicorns \u2013 Geography and Sector:** An interesting outcome of the unicorn boom-bust was *increased concentration*. The United States solidified its dominance: by 2023 the U.S. accounted for **over half of all unicorns and ~53% of global unicorn market cap**\u301045\u2020L221-L227\u3011. China, which in the late 2010s had rivaled the U.S., saw its share drop to ~15% of unicorn count (20% of value)\u301045\u2020L209-L217\u3011 \u2013 a result of China\u2019s regulatory crackdowns and slower growth in its tech sector. **India and Europe** notably rose as secondary hubs: India\u2019s share of unicorn market value reached ~5%, roughly on par with the UK (5%) by 2023\u301045\u2020L221-L227\u3011. In fact, Europe (led by London, plus Berlin/Paris) *overtook China* in producing new unicorns post-2021\u301045\u2020L178-L186\u3011, while India nearly caught up to China\u2019s pace as well. This reflects a diversification of the startup ecosystem beyond the historical US/China duopoly. Still, when it comes to *where the biggest unicorns are*, the U.S. and China remain far ahead \u2013 a **2023 tally of top unicorns by country** showed the U.S. with ~$2.1T in unicorn market cap and China with ~$740B (together ~72% of the world), whereas no other country exceeded 5% of the total\u301045\u2020L221-L227\u3011.\n\nWithin the U.S., the **San Francisco Bay Area** retained its crown \u2013 about 26% of global unicorn value is tied to Bay Area companies\u301045\u2020L187-L195\u3011. New York grew its share from 6% to 8%, reflecting a boom in NYC fintech and media startups\u301045\u2020L187-L195\u3011. Secondary U.S. cities (Miami, Austin, Seattle, etc.) got a lot of attention during the pandemic migration, but in terms of unicorn counts they still lag \u2013 many have *\u201cmore Barry\u2019s Bootcamps than unicorns,\u201d* as one humorous analysis noted\u301045\u2020L99-L107\u3011. In summary, unicorns became *slightly more globally distributed* post-2021, but the wealth and count remain quite concentrated in a few key regions.\n\nSector-wise, **software and internet** still account for the majority of unicorns, but there were shifts. The 2021 boom generated many fintech and crypto/web3 unicorns; by 2025 a number of those had faded (some crypto unicorns even went to zero). Meanwhile **AI-focused unicorns multiplied** \u2013 by 2023, the highest-valued private startups were heavily AI (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic), fintech (Stripe, Revolut), or logistics/transport (SpaceX, which reached ~$150B valuation). *Enterprise software*, though less hyped, quietly produced steady unicorns as well, especially in cloud and cybersecurity (Databricks, Anduril, etc.). \n\n**IPO and Exit Climate:** A crucial part of the unicorn story is how few exited during 2022\u20132023. After the *banner IPO year of 2021* (when companies like Coinbase, Robinhood, Rivian, etc. went public amid frenzy), the window slammed shut. In the U.S., there were **83% fewer IPOs in 2022 vs 2021**\u301046\u2020L33-L37\u3011 \u2013 just 181 IPOs in 2022, many of them small-cap, compared to over 1,000 the year prior. Virtually *no major VC-backed tech companies* debuted in 2022. This led to a backlog of mature unicorns stuck in the private market. 2023 saw a *minor reopening* of IPOs: high-profile names like Arm (semiconductors), **Instacart**, and **Klaviyo** tested the waters in the fall of 2023. They had mixed results but generally traded up post-listing, signaling some pent-up demand. By mid-2025, more unicorns began preparing S-1 filings as market conditions improved. Still, the delay meant many unicorns stayed private far longer than planned, raising **\u201cextension\u201d funding rounds** to bridge them. Late-stage investors like SoftBank, Tiger Global, etc., who had fueled the unicorn surge, pulled back or faced losses, further reducing late-stage liquidity.\n\n**Exits via M&A were also subdued.** Big Tech acquirers were cautious due to antitrust scrutiny; rather than mega-acquisitions, they mostly did small talent acquisitions (especially AI teams)\u301010\u2020L289-L297\u3011. One exception was Adobe\u2019s announced $20B acquisition of design unicorn Figma in 2022 \u2013 a huge exit, though it faced regulatory review. Overall, **2024 was another slow year for exits**: M&A picked up slightly from 2023 but was \u201cslower than expected,\u201d and IPO markets only truly warmed in late 2024\u301010\u2020L284-L292\u3011\u301010\u2020L299-L307\u3011. By Q4 2024, there was optimism as a successful IPO (ServiceTitan) showed the window opening\u301010\u2020L295-L303\u3011. Investors noted that an IPO rebound in 2025 would \u201cdrive LP allocation to venture\u201d again\u301010\u2020L299-L307\u3011 \u2013 a positive sign for the whole ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the unicorn landscape post-2021 went from *go-go growth* to a period of *reckoning and resilience*. Startups that achieved sky-high valuations had to grow into them (or be cut down to size), and many have chosen to hunker down and operate rather than rush to exit. The **concentration in top markets increased**, reinforcing the advantages of being in major hubs. Yet, the correction also brought a healthier focus on sustainable business models among the unicorn club. By mid-2025, there were signs of a new cycle: AI unicorns on the rise, some long-delayed IPOs finally on the calendar, and lessons learned from the excess of the previous boom \u2013 hopefully leading to a more *grounded* generation of billion-dollar startups.\n\n*(Table: New Unicorns by Year \u2013 Boom and Bust)*\n\n| Year        | New Unicorn Startups (Global)        | \n|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **2019**    | ~119 (pre-boom level)\u301045\u2020L130-L139\u3011\u301045\u2020L144-L152\u3011 |\n| **2021**    | ~580 (record high)\u301044\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u301045\u2020L144-L152\u3011  |\n| **2022**    | ~260 (sharp decline, est.)\u301043\u2020L1-L8\u3011    |\n| **2023**    | 71 (7-year low)\u301043\u2020L1-L8\u3011           |\n\n*Source:* CB Insights, PitchBook, Crunchbase \u2013 illustrates the peak in 2021 and subsequent collapse in unicorn formation.\n\n## 5. \u201cYou Can Just Build Anything\u201d: Solo Founders, Hackathons & the Builder Mindset\n\nAmid these changes, a powerful cultural mindset took hold among entrepreneurs: **\u201cyou can just build anything.\u201d** This phrase captures the post-pandemic builder culture \u2013 a belief that with today\u2019s tools and platforms, an individual or tiny team can quickly create solutions to almost any problem. It reflects a DIY, **hacker ethos** that drove innovation and encouraged a proliferation of projects, regardless of formal credentials or resources.\n\n**Rise of Solo Founders:** In the 2020s, more entrepreneurs decided to **go it alone**. Traditionally, conventional wisdom held that startups need co-founders (the \u201cHustler and Hacker\u201d duo, etc.). But buoyed by success stories and enabling tech, solo founders became common. By 2024, **35% of startups were led by a single founder**, more than double the share in 2017\u301055\u2020L61-L66\u3011\u301055\u2020L79-L86\u3011. Moreover, hundreds of these solo-led startups have thrived \u2013 over **300 solo-founded companies reached unicorn status** by 2025\u301055\u2020L61-L66\u3011, debunking the myth that \u201cyou can\u2019t build a $1B company alone.\u201d The *advantages* of solo founding include agility in decision-making and clarity of vision. Tools like those discussed (AI, no-code) amplify what one person can do, making it feasible to manage product development, marketing, and operations single-handedly at early stages. The pandemic\u2019s remote work boom also contributed; starting a company became as simple as opening your laptop at home, so many did so without first seeking co-founders at a physical locale.\n\nHowever, this path isn\u2019t without challenges \u2013 **burnout and loneliness** afflict solo founders (over 60% report burnout symptoms)\u301055\u2020L79-L86\u3011\u301055\u2020L81-L83\u3011. To cope, many engage in communities (Indie Hackers, Hacker News, Twitter) to get feedback and support from fellow builders. We saw the emergence of terms like \u201csolopreneur\u201d and \u201cindie startup\u201d to describe these efforts, often bootstrapped or modestly funded. Platforms such as Product Hunt became launchpads for solo-built apps, rewarding those who could quickly craft a solution and get users in days. In essence, the mindset became: *if you have an idea, just start building it \u2013 you don\u2019t need permission or a full team.* \n\n**Hackathons and Startup Weekends:** This \u201cjust build it\u201d attitude was perfectly embodied in hackathons and startup weekends, which saw a resurgence in relevance. These time-boxed events (typically 24\u201372 hours) have long been around, but in 2021\u20132025 they evolved from mere college coding contests into **legitimate launchpads** for startups. Founders began using hackathons very strategically \u2013 not just for prizes, but to **validate ideas, find co-founders, attract early users, and even secure funding**\u301051\u2020L78-L87\u3011\u301051\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Hackathons moved online during the pandemic, allowing global participation. By 2025, it wasn\u2019t unusual to hear that a startup\u2019s origin was a hackathon project. For instance, the popular workflow automation company Zapier famously started as a hackathon idea. In this period, countless small products (chatbots, Chrome extensions, NFT marketplaces, etc.) were built over a weekend and posted publicly. Some of those struck a nerve and became real businesses.\n\nMajor tech companies and blockchain platforms also sponsored hackathons as a way to foster their ecosystems \u2013 winners might get investment or incubation opportunities. One founder noted that simply **participating in the right hackathon changed everything**: he didn\u2019t win first place, but he met his future co-founders, gained confidence, and got plugged into a Web3 community that eventually funded his idea\u301051\u2020L122-L130\u3011. Another startup ran a series of UX hackathons and managed to acquire 1,000 users for their product without spending on marketing\u301051\u2020L129-L137\u3011. These examples show hackathons became **fast-tracks for momentum**: they force builders to *\u201cshow up, build something fast, and tell a story that makes people care,\u201d* which is essentially the early startup journey in a nutshell\u301051\u2020L99-L107\u3011\u301051\u2020L108-L116\u3011. By compressing that journey into a weekend, founders learned to **prioritize ruthlessly, pitch clearly, and iterate in public**\u301051\u2020L137-L145\u3011. The cultural cachet of hackathons thus persisted into 2025, proving that even in an era of advanced tech, the basic recipe of *pizza, caffeine, code, demo* still has a place in seeding innovation.\n\n**No-Code and Low-Code Revolution:** Underpinning the \u201cbuild anything\u201d mindset is the explosion of **no-code/low-code tools**. Platforms like *Bubble, Webflow, Airtable, Zapier,* and *Retool* matured greatly by mid-decade, enabling even non-programmers to create complex web apps or automate processes. Founders leveraged these to spin up Minimum Viable Products with minimal engineering. For example, Bubble (a no-code app builder) boasted that its users have collectively raised over **$15B in funding** for startups built on its platform\u301052\u2020L7-L11\u3011. Bubble itself raised $100M in 2021 as validation of the no-code trend\u301052\u2020L21-L25\u3011. Use cases ranged from building a fully functional SaaS MVP without writing code, to growth teams at startups integrating multiple services via no-code automation. \n\nThese tools, plus the AI helpers described earlier, meant **one person could handle tasks that used to require specialized teams**. Need a mobile app front-end? Use Adalo or Glide. Need a data dashboard? Use Tableau or Google Data Studio. The learning curve for basic development flattened, encouraging more people from varied backgrounds to attempt startup projects. This contributed to the *long-tail startup revolution* \u2013 countless niche products serving micro-audiences, created by solo makers who might not even label themselves \u201cfounders\u201d in the traditional sense\u301052\u2020L33-L40\u3011. Some stayed side projects generating passive income; others scaled into formal companies. Either way, the permissionless building culture thrived: if you saw a problem, you could *hack together a solution quickly* with off-the-shelf components.\n\n**\u201cYou Can Build Anything\u201d Ethos in Practice:** A clear manifestation of this ethos was the proliferation of **side-projects-turned-startups**. During pandemic lockdowns, many tech workers and students had free time and remote tools, leading to a wave of new indie projects. Some examples: a college student builds a browser plugin for summarizing articles with AI \u2013 it goes viral, they incorporate a startup. A pair of friends at a hackathon create a mental health app over a weekend \u2013 it gains users and later joins an accelerator. A laid-off engineer decides to bootstrap a SaaS tool using no-code \u2013 a year later it\u2019s doing $10k/month in revenue from subscribers. Stories like these became common on platforms like Indie Hackers, where founders transparently share milestones. This created a positive feedback loop: seeing peers build cool things easily inspired others to try. \n\nEven the venture community adapted: micro-VCs and angel syndicates emerged that specialize in funding **solo founders and hacker types** at idea stage, trusting their ability to iterate rapidly. Y Combinator, for instance, reported that in its Winter 2023 batch *10% of startups had solo founders*, the highest share ever, reflecting that they were willing to bet on one-person teams. To support these founders, organizations offered \u201cfractional\u201d services (e.g. part-time CFOs, on-demand mentors) to fill gaps a lone founder might have.\n\nIn conclusion, the **post-2021 startup culture embraced builders of all stripes** \u2013 encouraging them to *stop waiting and start creating*. Whether through hackathons, no-code tools, or just the confidence imparted by community slogans like \u201cJust ship it!\u201d, the barrier to entry for launching a startup (or at least a product) dropped dramatically. The consequences are a more vibrant, experimental environment: many more small ideas get tried (and many fail fast), and when something hits a nerve, it can scale up faster than ever thanks to AI and abundant infrastructure. Culturally, this era rekindled some of the *\u201chacker spirit\u201d* of earlier tech decades \u2013 a belief that **one passionate person or a scrappy team can invent the future from a dorm room or garage**, armed with code and coffee. The big difference is now they have the cloud, AI, and a global internet at their disposal, truly meaning *the sky\u2019s the limit* on what they can just go out and build.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Crunchbase News (2025). *Startup Funding Regained Its Footing In 2024 As AI Became The Star Of The Show*\u301010\u2020L202-L207\u3011\u301010\u2020L235-L243\u3011  \n- TechCrunch (2025). *Generative AI funding reached new heights in 2024*\u30104\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u30104\u2020L191-L199\u3011  \n- LinkedIn post by Judy Robinett (quoting PitchBook/Forbes) on Q1 2025 AI investment share\u30109\u2020L31-L40\u3011  \n- NFX (2023). *How \"Venture Capital 3.0\" Impacts Founders in the AI Age*\u301015\u2020L505-L513\u3011  \n- Reuters (2025). *Meta poaches 28-year-old Scale AI CEO...* (Wang\u2019s story)\u301030\u2020L203-L211\u3011  \n- Futurism (2024). *College Dropout Entrepreneur...
