Wordfence blocked them before they could run. With Wordfence active and SiteGround\u2019s own WAF + Security Optimizer also on, your setup is **fundamentally sound**\u2014but only if every plugin/theme is patched and you keep a tight login surface. Details and concrete actions below.\n\n# What those blocks mean (in plain English)\n\n- **GutenKit \u2264 2.1.0 \u2013 Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload**  \n  The request hit `\u2026/wp-json/gutenkit/v1/install-active-plugin`. Vulnerable versions let an unauthenticated attacker upload and activate code via that REST route (CVSS 10.0). Fixed in **2.1.1**. Even if you don\u2019t use GutenKit, crawlers will spray this URL at random sites. Wordfence recognized the signature and blocked it. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n- **SureTriggers (now \u201cOttoKit\u201d) \u2264 1.0.78 \u2013 Admin account creation (auth bypass)**  \n  The attempts hit `\u2026/wp-json/sure-triggers/v1/automation/action`. A logic flaw let attackers create **admin** users without logging in; it was widely exploited within hours of disclosure in April 2025. Patched in later releases (e.g., \u22651.0.83). Again, scanners try this everywhere whether or not the plugin is installed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n- **\u201cBlocked by the Wordfence Security Network\u201d at `/wp-login.php`**  \n  That message indicates Wordfence blocked the IP on reputation (its IP blocklist / threat feed), separate from the rule-based WAF. It\u2019s still Wordfence, just a different mechanism inside Wordfence. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n# \u201cAnother firewall\u201d besides Wordfence\nYou likely have **two layers** in parallel:\n\n1) **Wordfence (endpoint WAF in WordPress).** Catches malicious requests and bad IPs at the app layer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n2) **SiteGround\u2019s server-side WAF + Security Optimizer plugin.** SiteGround deploys centralized WAF rules at the hosting layer, and their **Security Optimizer** plugin adds login security (2FA, limit attempts, custom login URL), folder hardening, etc. These can block traffic before it even reaches WordPress. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\nSo you\u2019re seeing Wordfence\u2019s own blocks; separately, SiteGround may also be blocking quietly at the server level.\n\n# Is your firewall \u201cadequate\u201d?\n**Yes, if you pair it with patching and minimal exposure.** Wordfence + SiteGround WAF is a solid stack for a site like yours (WP used mainly as a blog backend). But **no WAF guarantees safety on an unpatched plugin**\u2014those SureTriggers/GutenKit bugs were actively exploited in the wild. Keep the surface small and updated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n# 60-second triage (do these now)\n\n1) **Confirm neither plugin is present or vulnerable.**  \n   In WP Admin \u2192 Plugins, look for **GutenKit** and **SureTriggers/OttoKit**. If present, update immediately to fixed versions or remove. (Fixed: GutenKit \u22652.1.1; SureTriggers/OttoKit \u22651.0.83.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn3search7\ue201  \n   *CLI check:*  \n   `wp plugin list | egrep 'gutenkit|suretriggers|ottokit'` (update/remove if found).\n\n2) **Audit users for any surprise admins.**  \n   Users \u2192 Administrators: ensure only the intended accounts exist. (Those SureTriggers exploits create stealth admins if a site is vulnerable.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n   *CLI:* `wp user list --role=administrator --fields=ID,user_login,user_registered`\n\n3) **Run a full Wordfence scan** and clear any findings. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\n4) **Lock down logins.**  \n   - 2FA for all admins; limit login attempts; consider a custom login URL (Security Optimizer). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search23\ue201  \n   - Optionally add an extra password on `/wp-login.php` and `/wp-admin/` via **Site Tools \u2192 Security \u2192 Protected URLs**. This is server-side and very effective. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201\n\n# Hardening recommendations (low friction, high value)\n\n- **Keep auto-updates on** for plugins and minor WP core updates (SiteGround\u2019s Autoupdate or WP\u2019s built-in). Most mass exploits target outdated plugins. (Context on how quickly SureTriggers was hit.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n- **Remove unused plugins** entirely\u2014even deactivated ones expand your attack surface through leftover files.  \n- **Minimize anonymous REST attack surface** (optional, if you don\u2019t need it public): deny anonymous **POST** to WP REST while allowing normal reads. Place this in `.htaccess` (only if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t rely on public REST writes):  \n  ```\n  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-json/ [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST [NC]\n    RewriteRule ^ - [F]\n  </IfModule>\n  ```\n  (Revert if any editor feature breaks.)\n\n- **Second factor, everywhere:** Keep 2FA enforced via Security Optimizer or Wordfence\u2014but avoid enabling *overlapping* CAPTCHA/2FA in both to prevent login friction. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n- **Optional extra shield:** Put Cloudflare (free) in front for rate-limiting and bot mitigation. Wordfence still works fine behind it (endpoint WAF + scanner).\n\n# Interpreting your specific logs (timing)\n- **Sep 3, 2025**: Multiple blocks for GutenKit and SureTriggers exploit routes\u2014classic mass-scan behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **Aug 31, 2025**: Another SureTriggers attempt. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- **Aug 28, 2025**: Login attempt blocked on reputation by Wordfence\u2019s network list at `/wp-login.php`. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n# Bottom line\n- These were **real exploit attempts** against **well-documented** plugin bugs, and Wordfence did its job. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search16\ue201  \n- Your **defense-in-depth is OK** (SiteGround WAF + Security Optimizer + Wordfence).  \n- The **critical variable is patch hygiene** and a **tight login surface**. Do the triage steps above; if you want, I can give you a one-shot WP-CLI script to (a) verify the two plugins, (b) list and purge unexpected admins, and (c) flip on the key Security Optimizer protections."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":839,"end_idx":873,"safe_urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9234?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/gutenkit-blocks-addon/wordpress-gutenkit-plugin-2-1-0-unauthenticated-arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9234?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"CVE-2024-9234 Detail - NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9234?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Oct 11, 2024 \u2014 The GutenKit \u2013 Page Builder Blocks, Patterns, and Templates for Gutenberg Block Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"WordPress GutenKit Plugin <= 2.1.0 is vulnerable ...","url":"https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/gutenkit-blocks-addon/wordpress-gutenkit-plugin-2-1-0-unauthenticated-arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Oct 10, 2024 \u2014 This vulnerability is highly dangerous and expected to become mass exploited. 10.
