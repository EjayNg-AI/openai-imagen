Unlike JPM Coin, JPMD will operate on a public blockchain (Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2, Base), represent bank deposits, and potentially earn interest. It is also expected to qualify for deposit insurance, providing clarity for accounting and compliance. While JPMD may aid institutions engaging with crypto assets by offering features like Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering compliance, its practical value in real-world payment systems is limited. Cross-border settlement benefits are marginal since interoperability between banks remains constrained\u2014only useful if both parties use JPMorgan. JPMD, like stablecoins, lacks the universal acceptability of central bank-backed money, rendering it an incomplete solution to global settlements.\n\nThe article also explores the potential replacement of Fed Chair Jay Powell, whose term ends in 11 months. Discussion centers on whether the appointment matters significantly. Experts argue it does, as the Fed Chair wields substantial influence over policy direction and internal consensus, especially in uncertain conditions. Though a culture of consensus prevails, a dissenting chair could disrupt both internal dynamics and market stability.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"ft.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":2372,"end_idx":2391,"safe_urls":["https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2025/PayPal-USD-PYUSD-Plans-to-Use-Stellar-for-New-Use-Cases/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([investor.pypl.com](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2025/PayPal-USD-PYUSD-Plans-to-Use-Stellar-for-New-Use-Cases/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"PayPal USD (PYUSD) Plans to Use Stellar for New Use Cases","url":"https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2025/PayPal-USD-PYUSD-Plans-to-Use-Stellar-for-New-Use-Cases/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749600000.0,"snippet":"PayPal today announced plans to make the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin available on the Stellar network pending regulatory approval by the ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"investor.pypl.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":2698,"end_idx":2717,"safe_urls":["https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-global-crypto-adoption-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([chainalysis.com](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-global-crypto-adoption-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index -
