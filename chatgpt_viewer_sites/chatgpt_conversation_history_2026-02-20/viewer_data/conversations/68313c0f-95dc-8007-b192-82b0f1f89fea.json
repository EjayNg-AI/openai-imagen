Conclusion & Recommendations\n\n- **All courses** explicitly include sections on **editing FSE block themes**\u2014showing how to open the Gutenberg Site Editor, modify template parts (header, footer, etc.), and adjust global styles via `theme.json`.  \n- Each course also demonstrates **content creation** within FSE themes\u2014using core blocks, custom blocks, and block patterns to assemble pages and posts that seamlessly adhere to the block theme\u2019s design.  \n- If your primary focus is **hands-on FSE theme editing and content assembly**, the Udemy \u201cWordPress Gutenberg & Full Site Editing (FSE)\u201d and FullSiteEditing.com courses are exceptionally thorough, with dedicated lectures on both building and editing block themes.  \n- For a more guided experience that ties together **theme setup, editing, and advanced block development**, the \u201cUnlock WordPress Power \u2013 Build Themes, Plugins & FSE Sites\u201d (Udemy) and **LinkedIn Learning\u2019s \u201cMastering Full Site Editing\u201d** are ideal, as they tightly integrate FSE editing workflows with block and pattern creation.  \n- If you prefer a fully **structured, official-style curriculum**, the **Learn.WordPress.org Intermediate Theme Developer** track is a free, self-guided series that leaves no gap between theory and real-world FSE theme editing.  \n\nBy choosing any of the above courses, you will gain the precise, detailed guidance needed to edit FSE block themes and create rich, dynamic content exclusively through the Gutenberg Site Editor."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":463,"end_idx":482,"safe_urls":["https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-gutenberg-full-site-editing-fse/?srsltid=AfmBOopWrxrGubDHUd5WGDt-7gB8TxN6WRniXzg87GrUANcVuguckFcx&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-gutenberg-full-site-editing-fse/?srsltid=AfmBOopWrxrGubDHUd5WGDt-7gB8TxN6WRniXzg87GrUANcVuguckFcx&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"WordPress Gutenberg & Full Site Editing | Udemy","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-gutenberg-full-site-editing-fse/?srsltid=AfmBOopWrxrGubDHUd5WGDt-7gB8TxN6WRniXzg87GrUANcVuguckFcx&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Description \u00b7 We take a deep dive into using the Gutenberg editor to create better-looking web pages as well as a complete study on the Full Site Editor itself.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Udemy"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":697,"end_idx":716,"safe_urls":["https://www.udemy.com/course/unlock-wordpress-power-build-themes-plugins-fse-sites/?srsltid=AfmBOoox9plEXwZm-XUWOqt3csbhYCrI2HzvCoRiqr5PrQwFcTODmXx9&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unlock-wordpress-power-build-themes-plugins-fse-sites/?srsltid=AfmBOoox9plEXwZm-XUWOqt3csbhYCrI2HzvCoRiqr5PrQwFcTODmXx9&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Unlock WordPress Power: Build Themes, Plugins & FSE Sites.","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/unlock-wordpress-power-build-themes-plugins-fse-sites/?srsltid=AfmBOoox9plEXwZm-XUWOqt3csbhYCrI2HzvCoRiqr5PrQwFcTODmXx9&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"This comprehensive course is your gateway to mastering modern WordPress, including Full Site Editing (FSE), custom theme and plugin development, dynamic ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Udemy"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":958,"end_idx":990,"safe_urls":["https://www.udemy.com/course/unlock-wordpress-power-build-themes-plugins-fse-sites/?srsltid=AfmBOoox9plEXwZm-XUWOqt3csbhYCrI2HzvCoRiqr5PrQwFcTODmXx9&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFkcOkGymU&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFkcOkGymU&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unlock-wordpress-power-build-themes-plugins-fse-sites/?srsltid=AfmBOoox9plEXwZm-XUWOqt3csbhYCrI2HzvCoRiqr5PrQwFcTODmXx9&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"WordPress Gutenberg Full Site Editing (FSE) - A beginners guide","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFkcOkGymU&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1632268800.0,"snippet":"edit your entire website using the WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor.
