working inside a stable \\(\\infty\\)-category (or a Quillen model) is often indispensable for multiplicative and higher-order structures.\n\n---\n\n## 5\u2002Forward-looking directions\n\n1. **Tensor-triangulated geometry.**  Classifying thick subcategories of \\(E\\)-modules (Hopkins\u2013Smith, Balmer) links homological support theory with algebraic geometry\u2010like spectra of tensor ideals.\n2. **Parametrised and twisted coefficients.**  May\u2013Sigurdsson\u2019s parametrised spectra and ongoing work in fibrewise \\(\\infty\\)-categories allow \u201clocal coefficient spectra\u201d varying over a base; useful in index theory and manifold topology.\n3. **Non-commutative motives.**  Stable \\(\\infty\\)-categories of dg-categories admit \u201ccoefficients\u201d given by spectral Yoneda embeddings, leading to invariants such as topological Fukaya categories.\n4. **Higher topoi and condensed mathematics.**  Spectral sheaves in analytic or condensed settings extend the coefficient idea to functional analysis and \\(p\\)-adic geometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Take-away**\n\nYes\u2014*to talk sensibly about \u201chomology with coefficients\u201d you almost always want a **stable, symmetric-monoidal model (or \\(\\infty\\)) category***.  \nOnce that framework is in place, \u201ctensoring with a coefficient object\u201d becomes a universal construction that permeates modern homotopy theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and beyond."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"798066af-15f4-4187-b30d-b86352f57da1","request_id":"95ce4c153ceb9fa1-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"798066af-15f4-4187-b30d-b86352f57da1","children":["da4b7c81-f9c5-4292-9a20-f950dc335384"]},"da4b7c81-f9c5-4292-9a20-f950dc335384":{"id":"da4b7c81-f9c5-4292-9a20-f950dc335384","message":{"id":"da4b7c81-f9c5-4292-9a20-f950dc335384","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752132282.83,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what literature should I read to get myself up to speed on the above discussion, and what research directions are feasible?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95ce52a74dc79fa1-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"db2d56f9-67fc-418d-a949-207ad2f45918","children":["7692f81a-1fb3-4e46-9189-62cdd41ace9d"]},"7692f81a-1fb3-4e46-9189-62cdd41ace9d":{"id":"7692f81a-1fb3-4e46-9189-62cdd41ace9d","message":{"id":"7692f81a-1fb3-4e46-9189-62cdd41ace9d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752132293.883264,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Recommending literature and directions","content":"The user is seeking literature on topics like model categories, stable homotopy theory, and monoidal model categories.

Categories lacking connectivity or with other restrictions, like K(n)-local categories, do not satisfy these conditions.","chunks":[],"finished":true}],"source_analysis_msg_id":"e23c4bf8-dde4-44aa-8f43-0057199e9ca0"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"7ece1c66-fdf0-4e73-9580-0901aa6f4b3e","request_id":"95d7c56ecac5f900-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7ece1c66-fdf0-4e73-9580-0901aa6f4b3e","children":["d87db2c1-010a-4aab-be2d-f6ced666b041"]},"d87db2c1-010a-4aab-be2d-f6ced666b041":{"id":"d87db2c1-010a-4aab-be2d-f6ced666b041","message":{"id":"d87db2c1-010a-4aab-be2d-f6ced666b041","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752231355.179621,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"search_query\": [\n    {\n      \"q\": \"Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum functor left adjoint to pi_0 stable infinity category Lurie Higher Algebra 1.4.1.10\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"Rondigs Ostvaer motivic Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum existence any abelian group\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"Eilenberg-MacLane G-spectra represent Mackey functors EM-spectrum equivariant\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"HR E-infinity ring spectrum for any commutative ring Hovey Shipley Smith\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"q\": \"stable infinity category t-structure heart Ab existence of H functor abelian groups to C\",\n      \"recency\": null,\n      \"domains\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum functor left adjoint to pi_0 stable infinity category Lurie Higher Algebra 1.4.1.10"},{"type":"search","q":"Rondigs Ostvaer motivic Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum existence any abelian group"},{"type":"search","q":"Eilenberg-MacLane G-spectra represent Mackey functors EM-spectrum equivariant"},{"type":"search","q":"HR E-infinity ring spectrum for any commutative ring Hovey Shipley Smith"},{"type":"search","q":"stable infinity category t-structure heart Ab existence of H functor abelian groups to C"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"c27f564d-1612-4c8c-8d82-102012a48b5e","request_id":"95d7c56ecac5f900-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"c27f564d-1612-4c8c-8d82-102012a48b5e","children":["3b0b55cc-b7b9-4336-9acc-61dc7a54e467"]},"3b0b55cc-b7b9-4336-9acc-61dc7a54e467":{"id":"3b0b55cc-b7b9-4336-9acc-61dc7a54e467","message":{"id":"3b0b55cc-b7b9-4336-9acc-61dc7a54e467","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1752231418.6257741,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"mathoverflow.net","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/432176/why-do-homotopy-orbits-commute-with-the-eilenberg-mac-lane-spectrum-functor","title":"Why do homotopy orbits commute with the Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane ...","snippet":"The Eilenberg\u2013MacLane spectrum construction as it is defined in the question is a homotopy cocontinuous functor.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1665360000.0,"attribution":"mathoverflow.net"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/326923/a-question-about-the-motivic-integral-cohomology-of-the-eilenberg-maclane-spec","title":"A question about the (motivic) integral cohomology of the Eilenberg ...","snippet":"A question about the (motivic) integral cohomology of the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum ...

Each bullet tells you (i) why it is lively, (ii) what makes it relatively approachable, and (iii) a concrete starter project.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003**Work in a 2-periodic (or \\(n\\)-periodic) stable \u221e-category**\n\n* **Status.**  Inverting the Bott element (or any chosen \\(\\beta\\in\\pi_n\\mathbb 1\\)) to form \\(\\mathrm{Sp}[\\beta^{-1}]\\) is now routine in chromatic homotopy, and the same trick is being imported into non-commutative settings to model \\(K\\)-theory of \\(C^{*}\\)-algebras.  Current computations of graded Balmer spectra for periodic categories appeared as recently as May 2025 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\n\n* **Why it\u2019s approachable.**  You keep all the good properties of spectra (presentable, symmetric-monoidal) and simply accept that the **heart is \\(\\mathbf{Ab}^{\\mathbb Z/2}\\)** instead of \\(\\mathbf{Ab}\\).  Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane objects become \\(H(A_0,A_1)=HA_0\\oplus\\Sigma HA_1\\); no connective \\(t\\)-structure needed.\n\n* **Starter project.**  Build an explicit symmetric-monoidal functor  \n  \\[\n  \\mathrm{KK}_{\\infty}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\mathrm{Sp}[\u03b2^{-1}]\n  \\]\n  sending a separable \\(C^{*}\\)-algebra \\(A\\) to its (non-connective) \\(K\\)-theory spectrum.  Show that it is *initial* among homological, Bott-periodic functors out of \\(C^{*}\\)-Alg.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003**Replace \\(t\\)-structures by weight structures**\n\n* **Status.**  Bondarko & collaborators are systematically developing weight structures as an alternative \u201cheart\u201d for 2-periodic or exotic triangulated categories; see the 2024 preprint on \\(t\\)-structures adjacent to weight structures \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201.\n\n* **Why it\u2019s approachable.**  Weight structures exist in situations where every \\(t\\)-structure collapses (e.g. KK-theory).  The heart is still abelian (often \\(\\mathbf{Ab}^{\\mathbb Z/2}\\)), and one can prove Brown-representability\u2013type theorems *without* connectivity hypotheses.\n\n* **Starter project.**  Construct a **smashing weight structure on \\(NSp^{\\infty}\\)** (Joachim\u2013Mahanta\u2019s stable \u221e-category of non-commutative spectra) and prove that any coproduct-preserving functor to graded abelian groups is corepresented by a heart object.  This would give a \u201cweight-EM spectrum\u201d classification of bivariant \\(K\\)-theories.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003**Universal localising invariants / non-commutative motives**\n\n* **Status.**  Cisinski\u2013Tabuada, Blumberg\u2013Gepner\u2013Tabuada, and Mazel-Gee\u2013Stern (July 2024) have refined the **universal property** of the localising-motivic \u221e-category \\(\\mathcal M_{\\mathrm{loc}}\\) and its variants \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201.  Ramzi\u2019s M\u00fcnster seminar (Oct 2024) gives a fresh localisation model \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n* **Why it\u2019s approachable.**  Once you embed your source (dg-categories, \\(C^{*}\\)-algebras, etc.) in the universal target, **every homological functor factors automatically**.  The tensor is Day-convolution, so coefficient objects exist by general formalism.\n\n* **Starter project.**  Show that Joachim\u2013Mahanta\u2019s \\(NSp^{\\infty}\\) admits a colimit-preserving symmetric-monoidal functor  \n  \\[\n  NSp^{\\infty}\\;\\to\\;\\mathcal M_{\\mathrm{loc}}\n  \\]\n  which sends a \\(C^{*}\\)-algebra to its non-commutative motive.  Compute how classical KK-groups are recovered via \\(E\\otimes(-)\\) for a single object \\(E\\in\\mathcal M_{\\mathrm{loc}}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003**Connective covers & filtered approximations of \\(K\\)-type theories**\n\n* **Status.**  Recent lecture notes on *unbounded KK-theory* and on filtered approaches to negative \\(K\\)-groups (Feb 2024) show that researchers are actively constructing **connective models that split Bott periodicity into a filtration** \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201.\n\n* **Why it\u2019s approachable.**  In many cases the *connective* version sits in an ordinary chain-complex world where our original \\(t\\)-structure criterion applies.  One then recovers the periodic theory as the associated graded or as a telescope.\n\n* **Starter project.**  Define a **connective KK-spectrum** \\(KK^{\\mathrm{cn}}(A)\\) via Joachim\u2019s \\(S\\)-construction; prove that it lands in spectra with a genuine \\(t\\)-structure, and identify the comparison map  \n  \\[\n  KK^{\\mathrm{cn}}(A)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;KK(A)\n  \\]\n  as Bott-inversion.  A successful construction would let you import Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane coefficients and spectral sequences into non-commutative geometry.\n\n---\n\n## Quick decision guide\n\n| Direction | Active community | Technical entry barrier | Pay-off for \u201cEM-style coefficients\u201d |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Periodisation \\(\\mathrm{Sp}[\u03b2^{-1}]\\) | High (chromatic & operator-\\(K\\)) | **Low** (classical spectral tools) | Immediate, gives graded-EM objects |\n| Weight structures on KK / \\(NSp^{\\infty}\\) | Growing (Bondarko, Mahanta) | **Moderate** (learn weight theory) | EM classification without \\(t\\)-structure |\n| Universal localising motives | Mature & expanding | **Moderate\u2013High** (\u221e-categorical machinery) | One-stop target for *all* additive invariants |\n| Connective covers & filtrations | Emerging (filtered \\(K\\)-tools) | **Low\u2013Moderate** (standard homotopy colimits) | Bridges to classical chain-level algebra |\n\nStarting with **periodisation** or **connective covers** is usually the quickest way to get concrete results; the **weight-structure** and **motivic** routes are more conceptual but open larger vistas once the groundwork is done."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":782,"end_idx":801,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19352?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19352?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] arXiv:2406.19352v5 [math.AT] 4 May 2025","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19352?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746316800.0,"snippet":"We explore how the topology of the Balmer spectrum is related to Greenlees-May isotropy separation, and discuss the result- ing decomposition of ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arXiv"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201","start_idx":1747,"end_idx":1766,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1710265574.0,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arXiv"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":2684,"end_idx":2703,"safe_urls":["https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/theoretische_mathematik/topologie/211024_ramzi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([University of M\u00fcnster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/theoretische_mathematik/topologie/211024_ramzi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] Noncommutative motives as a localization of stable - Uni M\u00fcnster","url":"https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/theoretische_mathematik/topologie/211024_ramzi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1729468800.0,"snippet":"Abstract: The oo-category of noncommutative or localizing motives is the recipient of the universal localizing invariant, a refinement of ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"University of M\u00fcnster"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":2704,"end_idx":2723,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04021?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04021?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"[PDF] A universal characterization of noncommutative motives and ... - arXiv","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04021?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1720742400.0,"snippet":"Abstract.

A is a fun\rtor whose target \rategory\r\nis an abelian \rategory and whi\rh sends distinguished triangles to long exa\rt sequen\res of A-ob je\rts. We\r\n\ran extend the notion of a homologi\ral fun\rtor to more general \rategories. The usual homotopy fun\rtors\r\non the \rategory of pointed topologi\ral spa\res, the K-theory fun\rtors, and redu\red homology fun\rtors\r\non the \rategory of pointed CW-\romplexes are example of fun\rtors that we term homologi\ral in this\r\nthesis.\r\nIn this thesis, we provide a framework for de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients that \ran be applied to many\r\nexamples. We investigate fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite matrix of nonnegative integers as a\r\nprelude to investigating fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in abelian groups. The rationale for doing so is be\rause\r\n\rolumn-\fnite matri\res of nonnegative integers arise from nonnegative presentations, whi\rh always exist\r\nfor any abelian group.\r\nStart with a \rategory C that is equipped with a translation endofun\rtor T : C ! C analogous to the\r\nsuspension endofun\rtor on a triangulated \rategory. However, we do not assume that T is invertible. We\r\nalso assume that there is a distinguished \rolle\rtion of sequen\res in C of the form\r\nA\r\nf- B - Cf - T A\r\nor of the form\r\nT B - Pf - A\r\nf- B ;\r\nwhere Cf ; Pf are determined up to non-\ranoni\ral isomorphism by f . These are known as \roning\r\nsequen\res and ning sequen\res respe\rtively { the ob je\rt Cf is \ralled a mapping \rone and the ob je\rt\r\nPf is \ralled a mapping path ob je\rt, reminis\rent of their topologi\ral equivalents. A homologi\ral\r\nfun\rtor K : C ! A will then be a fun\rtor whose target \rategory is an abelian \rategory, and whi\rh sends\r\n\roning or ning sequen\res to half-long exa\rt sequen\res of A-ob je\rts.\r\nWe \ronsider two types of \rategories with homologi\ral fun\rtors in this thesis:\r\n1. Categories C that have \roprodu\rts equipped with homologi\ral fun\rtors K : C ! A that preserve\r\n\roprodu\rts.\r\n2. Categories C that have \fnite produ\rts and, optionally, \fltered \rolimits as well, equipped with\r\nhomologi\ral fun\rtors K : C ! A that preserve \fnite produ\rts and \fltered \rolimits (if \fltered\r\n\rolimits exist).\r\nFor both these types of \rategories, we let M : C ! C be a suitably \rhosen endofun\rtor on the \rategory.\r\nLet N be a \rolumn-\fnite I \u0002 J matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the \frst type of \rategory,\r\nwe de\fne a natural transformation\r\n\u0013N : a\r\nJ\r\n\u00c6M ! a\r\nI\r\n\u00c6M\r\non the \rategory C that indu\res multipli\ration by N in the \rategory A when we apply the homologi\ral\r\nfun\rtor K, where `here denotes the \ropower fun\rtor, or \roprodu\rt fun\rtor applied to \ropies of the\r\nsame ob je\rt.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 160>","CONTENTS ii\r\nFor the se\rond type of \rategory, we \frst de\fne the notion of restri\rted produ\rts in the \rategory (see\r\n\rhapter 2), whi\rh is the analog of \roprodu\rts.

For this, we restri\rt our attention to the \rase where A = Ab is the \rategory of abelian\r\ngroups.\r\nThe strategy employed is as follows: First, we show that given matri\res M ; N for whi\rh the produ\rt MN\r\nexists, \u0013MN = \u0013M \u0013N on the \rategory C, when C is assumed to satisfy \rertain \ronditions over and above\r\nwhat has been assumed previously when de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a nonnegative matrix.\r\nThen we use this result to prove that if is any presentation of an abelian group G ( does not have\r\nto be nonnegative), it is possible to de\fne the quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; ) in a way that generalizes our\r\nprevious \ronstru\rtion involving nonnegative presentations and nonnegatives matri\res. Furthermore, we\r\nalso show that if and 0are two presentations of the same group G, then KT m(C; ) is isomorphi\r\r\nto KT m(C; 0) for any ob je\rt C (see Theorem 4.6.5 and Remark 4.6.6). This allows us to de\fne the\r\nquasi-fun\rtor KT m(; G) in an abelian group G (see De\fnition 4.6.7).\r\nIn this thesis, we also explain how homologi\ral fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients \ran arise in \rategories that are\r\nequipped with a symmetri\r tensor produ\rt \n satisfying the property that whenever D is any ob je\rt of the\r\n\rategory, applying \nD to a \roning (respe\rtively, ning) sequen\re results in another \roning (respe\rtively,\r\nning) sequen\re.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 160>","CHAPTER 1.

Note that sin\re Z is a\r\nfree \rhain \romplex, so is the \rhain \romplex CZ\r\nN\u0001\r\nin the above \roning sequen\re. To apply the K\u007funneth\r\nTheorem to our situation, let R = Z and let C = CZ\r\nN\u0001\r\n. Then for any \rhain \romplex A,\r\nH(A \nZCZ\r\nN\u0001) \u0018= (H(A) \nZH(CZN\u0001)) \b (TorZ1 (H(A); H(CZN\u0001))): (1-8)\r\nWrite \nZ as \n and TorZ\r\n1 as Tor for \ronvenien\re. We \ran easily \rompute that homology of CZN\u0001 as\r\nH(CZ\r\nN\u0001) = G;\r\nwhere we regard G as a graded Z-module \ron\rentrated in dimension 0. Hen\re,\r\nH(A \n CZ\r\nN\u0001) \u0018= (H(A) \n G) \b (Tor(H(A); G)):\r\nOn the other hand, tensoring (1-7) with the \rhain \romplex A yields the \roning sequen\re\r\na\r\nJ\r\nA\r\nN-\u0001 a\r\nI\r\nA - CZ\r\nN\u0001 \n A -\r\n \r\na\r\nJ\r\nA\r\n!\r\n[1\u2104\r\nwhi\rh is homology isomorphi\r (in model-theoreti\r terms, weakly equivalent) to (1-5), and so the \rhain\r\n\romplexes CA\r\nN\u0001 and CZN\u0001 \n A share the same homology. Hen\re,\r\nH(CA\r\nN\u0001) \u0018= (H(A) \n G) \b (Tor(H(A); G)): (1-9)\r\nNow we let C = G regarded as a \rhain \romplex \ron\rentrated in dimension 0. Then for any \rat \rhain\r\n\romplex A, the K\u007funneth Theorem tells us that\r\nH(A \n G) \u0018= (H(A) \n H(G)) \b (Tor(H(A); H(G))) = (H(A) \n G) \b (Tor(H(A); G))\r\nbe\rause H(G) = G regarded as a graded abelian group \ron\rentrated in dimension 0. It follows that\r\nH(A \n G) \u0018= H(CA\r\nN\u0001) for any \rat \rhain \romplex A. Note that we \rould have used any presentation of\r\nG. Hen\re, we obtain the following result:\r\nProposition 1.4.2. Let G be an abelian group. For a \rat \rhain \romplex A of abelian groups, the\r\nfol lowing are equivalent ways of de\fning the homology group H(A; G) with \roe\u00c6\rients in G:\r\n1. Set H(A; G) := H(A \n G).\r\n2. Fix a free resolution\r\n0 - M\r\nJ\r\nZ - M\r\nI\r\nZ - G - 0\r\nof G, let N be the matrix of relative to the standard Z-bases of L\r\nI Z and LJ Z, and set\r\nH(A; G) := H(CA\r\nN\u0001), where CAN\u0001\r\nis the mapping \rone of (N\u0001) :\r\n`\r\nJ A ! `I A, that is, CA\r\nN\u0001\r\nis part\r\nof the fun\rtorial \roning sequen\re\r\na\r\nJ\r\nA\r\nN-\u0001 a\r\nI\r\nA - CA\r\nN\u0001 -\r\n \r\na\r\nJ\r\nA\r\n!\r\n[1\u2104\r\nin Ch(Ab). This de\fnition is independent of the \rhoi\re of presentation of G, be\rause if N0is the\r\nmatrix representing another presentation 0of G, H(CA\r\nN\u0001) \u0018= H(CAN0\u0001).","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 160>","CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 7\r\nIf A is an arbitrary \rhain \romplex of abelian groups, method 2 of the above proposition might provide\r\na better way of de\fning homology of A with G-\roe\u00c6\rients be\rause statement (1-9) tells us that even\r\nwhen A is not \rat, H(CA\r\nN\u0001) is isomorphi\r to (H(A) \n G) \b (Tor(H(A); G)) whi\rh is easily \romputable\r\nand does not depend on \rhosing any presentation of G. Of \rourse, whether a parti\rular de\fnition of a\r\nhomologi\ral fun\rtor with \roe\u00c6\rients is useful depends on whether it enables \romputations to be done\r\nand whether it sheds light on existing theory.\r\n1.5 Nonnegative matri\res\r\nIn the previous se\rtion, we \ronsidered arbitrary presentations of an abelian group G as well as multipli-\r\n\ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix N with integer entries.\r\nIn the more general \rategories that we examine later on, we \ran de\fne only multipli\ration by a \rolumn-\r\n\fnite matrix N with nonnegative integer entries. To take a simple example, in a semi-additive \rategory\r\nwith \roprodu\rts where the morphism sets \rarry only the stru\rture of a \rommutative monoid, we \ran\r\nde\fne only multipli\ration by a nonnegative integer n on a given ob je\rt C. Hen\re, we need to restri\rt\r\nourselves to \ronsidering nonnegative presentations of an abelian group G, namely, presentations\r\nM\r\nJ\r\nZ-- M\r\nI\r\nZ -- G\r\nin whi\rh the matrix of relative to the standard Z-bases of L\r\nI Z and LJ Z is a nonnegative matrix\r\n(we assume here that the index sets I ; J are well-ordered).\r\nWe prove later in Lemma 4.6.1 that any given presentation of an abelian group \ran be \\lifted\" to\r\na nonnegative presentation whi\rh we denote by Q( ) throughout this thesis. Hen\re, there is no loss\r\nof generality in restri\rting ourselves to nonnegative presentations of abelian groups and nonnegative\r\nmatri\res.\r\n1.6 The approa\rh we adopt\r\nBased on the dis\russion thus far, we devise the following approa\rh to de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients:\r\n1. Let a \rategory C be given. Assume that C has \roning sequen\res and that it is possible to de\fne\r\nmultipli\ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix with nonnegative integer entries in C. Assume further that\r\nthere is a given homologi\ral fun\rtor K with \rertain good properties. The pre\rise requirements are\r\nthat the \rategory C and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K have to satisfy all of the following:\r\n(a) Either De\fnition 3.1.1 or 3.4.5.\r\n(b) Either De\fnition 4.1.1 or 4.1.3.\r\n(\r) Either De\fnition 4.3.1 or 4.3.2.\r\n2. Use the \roning stru\rture as well as the notion of multipli\ration by a nonnegative matrix N to\r\nde\fne the quasi-fun\rtor or fun\rtor KT m(; N) with \roe\u00c6\rients in N, where m is a nonnegative\r\ninteger that depends on T and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K. Quasi-fun\rtors arise when the mapping\r\n\rone Cf does not depend fun\rtorially on the given morphism f and is determined by f only up to\r\nnon-unique isomorphism, as is the \rase for triangulated \rategories.\r\n3. In the \rase where the fun\rtor KT m(; G) with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group G has already been\r\nde\fned in the literature and is widely used, verify that our de\fnition of KT m(; N) \roin\rides with\r\nthe \\standard\" de\fnition, in the sense that if\r\nM\r\nJ\r\nZ-- M\r\nI\r\nZ -- G","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 14 / 160>","CHAPTER 1.

We treat these two types of\r\n\rategories separately. De\fnition 3.1.1 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory with\r\nrestri\rted produ\rts, and De\fnition 3.4.5 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory\r\nwith \roprodu\rts. Let \u0013N denote multipli\ration by a matrix N in either of su\rh \rategories. In se\rtions 3.3\r\nand 3.6 respe\rtively, we explore reasonable \ronditions under whi\rh \u0013MN = \u0013M \u0013N for \ronformable matri\res\r\nM ; N. Subsequently, this result is applied in \rhapter 4 to de\fning quasi-fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in an\r\nabelian group G.\r\nIn the \frst two se\rtions of \rhapter 4, we de\fne \roning and ning \rategories (a ning \rategory is dual to a\r\n\roning \rategory) and give examples. In se\rtion 4.3, we lay out pre\risely the properties that homologi\ral\r\nfun\rtors must have in order that quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients \ran be de\fned. The\r\na\rtual de\fnition of quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite matrix of nonnegative\r\nintegers is made in se\rtion 4.4. A universal \roe\u00c6\rient sequen\re for quasi-fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients is also\r\nestablished (see Theorems 4.4.5 and 4.4.6). In se\rtion 4.6, we de\fne quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with\r\n\roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group for suitable \roning and ning \rategories.\r\nIn \rhapter 5, we fo\rus on well-known examples of homologi\ral fun\rtors from algebrai\r topology and\r\nintrodu\re Adams' stable homotopy \rategory of CW-spe\rtra, whi\rh plays a \rentral role in homology and\r\n\rohomology theories.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 15 / 160>","CHAPTER 1.

In the \rategory Cstar of \romplex C\u0003-algebras and \u0003-homomorphisms, (the \rase of\r\nreal C\u0003-algebras is dealt with similarly), the restri\rted produ\rt Q0\r\nI Ai of a family fAigi2I of C\u0003\r\n-algebras\r\nindexed by I is more \rommonly known as the \romplete dire\rt sum, usually denoted by L\r\r\ni2IAi . (Bla\rk\u0002adar [8\u2104 simply \ralls it a dire\rt sum.) Note however that this ob je\rt is in general not a \roprodu\rt of\r\nfAigi2I in Cstar. An equivalent way of produ\ring the \romplete dire\rt sum of fAigi2I is to take the\r\n\rompletion of the algebrai\r dire\rt sum of fAigi2I under the C\u0003-norm k(ai)k = supi kaik. Elements of\r\nL\r\r\ni2IAi are those sequen\res (ai)i2I 2\r\nQ\r\ni2I Ai for whi\rh given any \u000f > 0, there are at most a \fnite num\u0002ber of elements ai satisfying kaik \u0015 \u000f. For \fnite I , the \romplete dire\rt sum is simply a \fnite produ\rt of\r\nC\u0003-algebras (in the literature, these are also \ralled dire\rt sums, even though they are not \roprodu\rts).\r\nThe \rategory Cstar satis\fes RP1(\b\f ) and RP2(\b\f ) for any in\fnite \rardinal \b\f.

Sin\re is a group homomorphism, or a Z-module homo\u0002morphism, the matrix N of relative to the standard bases of Z[I \u2104 and Z[J \u2104 over Z is a \rolumn-\fnite\r\nmatrix, meaning that every \rolumn of N \rontains only a \fnite number of nonzero entries. If all the\r\nentries of N are nonnegative, then we \rall\r\nZ[J \u2104- - Z[I \u2104 -\u0019- G\r\na nonnegative presentation. In general, for any morphism \u001e : Z[J \u2104 !

The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"deff455b-e45f-432a-bc93-4ca1de66f4f2","request_id":"95dcc7e5ad7587cf-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"deff455b-e45f-432a-bc93-4ca1de66f4f2","children":["b6737740-8651-421f-a624-fd5193c305d8"]},"b6737740-8651-421f-a624-fd5193c305d8":{"id":"b6737740-8651-421f-a624-fd5193c305d8","message":{"id":"b6737740-8651-421f-a624-fd5193c305d8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752283896.666766,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[],"source_analysis_msg_id":"7794b1d1-9465-421f-b96d-5746d90ed6b3"},"status":"in_progress","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"2630e7f1-d618-4625-89cb-a1c8b47b09aa","request_id":"95dcc7e5ad7587cf-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2630e7f1-d618-4625-89cb-a1c8b47b09aa","children":["db740bef-f8b8-486d-8dad-cc801415612d"]},"db740bef-f8b8-486d-8dad-cc801415612d":{"id":"db740bef-f8b8-486d-8dad-cc801415612d","message":{"id":"db740bef-f8b8-486d-8dad-cc801415612d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752283885.107519,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"queries\": [\"quasi-functor KT m thesis coefficients\", \"functor with coefficients matrix N\", \"quasi-functor KT m(; N)\", \"KT m(C; N) universal coefficient sequence\", \"homological functor with coefficients definition thesis\"]}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"b6737740-8651-421f-a624-fd5193c305d8","request_id":"95dcc7e5ad7587cf-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"file_search.msearch","channel":null},"parent":"b6737740-8651-421f-a624-fd5193c305d8","children":["958a203f-adc0-4e0f-acea-c6932b98506b"]},"958a203f-adc0-4e0f-acea-c6932b98506b":{"id":"958a203f-adc0-4e0f-acea-c6932b98506b","message":{"id":"958a203f-adc0-4e0f-acea-c6932b98506b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1752283896.666869,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"},{"product_type":"recording_knowledge","source_name":"recording_knowledge"}],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"db740bef-f8b8-486d-8dad-cc801415612d","request_id":"95dcc7e5ad7587cf-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"db740bef-f8b8-486d-8dad-cc801415612d","children":["bb6e513e-1039-4568-a870-32ef5f21392e"]},"bb6e513e-1039-4568-a870-32ef5f21392e":{"id":"bb6e513e-1039-4568-a870-32ef5f21392e","message":{"id":"bb6e513e-1039-4568-a870-32ef5f21392e","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1752283896.666922,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_browsing_display","result":"# \u30100\u2020NG-Ejay.pdf\u2020file-CkUxXaBVgwRJxCDagCNgSM\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: NG-Ejay.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue201\nMclick Target: \"1:0\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] H be a group homomorphism.

Typical examples are the homotopy categories of pointed spaces, CW-complexes, chain complexes, and separable \\(C^{*}\\)-algebras (via KK-theory) \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L16-L23\ue201.\n\n* **Step-1 \u2013 encode the coefficient group by a matrix.**  \n  Choose a presentation \\( \\Bbb Z[J]\\;\\xrightarrow{N}\\;\\Bbb Z[I]\\twoheadrightarrow G\\) of the abelian group \\(G\\); the column-finite matrix \\(N\\) encodes the relations \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue202L1-L8\ue201.\n\n* **Step-2 \u2013 act by that matrix inside \\(\\mathcal C\\).**  \n  Using the restricted products/aggregations available in \\(\\mathcal C\\), you form the morphisms\n  \\[\n      \\prod\\nolimits_J M C \\;\\xrightarrow{\\;{}^{\\langle N\\rangle}\\;}\\;\n      \\prod\\nolimits_I M C\n  \\]\n  and obtain an *object* \\(K\\!T_m(C;N)\\) as the mapping cone (or path) of that morphism.  \n  This yields a *quasi-functor with coefficients* \\(K\\!T_m(-;N)\\) \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L70-L84\ue201.\n\n* **Step-3 \u2013 universal coefficient sequence.**  \n  For every \\(C\\in\\mathcal C\\) you prove a natural exact triangle\n  \\[\n      G\\otimes K\\!T_m(C)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;K\\!T_m(C;N)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\n      \\operatorname{Tor}\\bigl(G,K\\!T_{m+1}(C)\\bigr),\n  \\]\n  which is the expected UCT \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L11\ue201.  Independence of the chosen presentation is established later (Thm 4.6.5).\n\n* **Optional step \u2013 monoidal refinement.**  \n  When \\(\\mathcal C\\) *also* carries a symmetric monoidal product \\(\\otimes\\) that preserves coning sequences in each variable, you show that the same idea can be phrased by *tensoring with an object* \\(D\\in\\mathcal C\\) (\u201cmultiplication by \\(D\\)\u201d) \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L26-L31\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How this lines up with the \u201cspectra/smash-product\u201d picture we discussed\n\n| Aspect | Your thesis construction | \u201cQE \u2227 \u2013\u2019\u2019 (spectral) construction |\n|--------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Coefficient data** | Presentation matrix \\(N\\) or group \\(G\\) \u27f6 mapping-cone definition | An *object* \\(Q E\\) in a symmetric-monoidal stable category (e.g. Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane spectrum \\(H A\\)) |\n| **Ambient category** | Any coning/ning category (no monoidal structure required) | Closed symmetric-monoidal *stable* model or \u221e-category |\n| **Formula** | Exact triangle \\(G\\otimes K_*(C)\\to K_*(C;G)\\to\\operatorname{Tor}(G,K_{*+1}(C))\\) | Derived smash/ tensor \\(Q E\\otimes^{\\mathbf L} X\\); UCT emerges as the K\u00fcnneth/Adams spectral sequence |\n| **Functoriality in coefficients** | Group morphisms induce natural transformations via matrix factorisations \ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue202L121-L134\ue201 | Maps of \\(E_\\infty\\)-ring spectra or \\(A_\\infty\\)-modules |\n| **When they coincide** | Whenever \\(\\mathcal C\\) has a \u2297 that sends cones to cones (e.g. spectra, chain complexes), your Step 2 becomes exactly \u201csmash with \\(Q E\\)\u2019\u2019 | Always available in monoidal stable categories, but *not* in settings like KK-theory where \u2297 fails to preserve triangles |\n\n*So:* the spectral \u201csmash-with-coefficients\u2019\u2019 picture is a **special case** of your more algebraic mapping-cone recipe, realised whenever the category happens to be monoidal in the right way.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Similarities and differences in more detail  \n\n1. **Universality.**  Both frameworks recover the classical UCT, but yours *axiomatises* the Tor-extension directly, whereas the spectral approach derives it from homotopical K\u00fcnneth theorems.\n\n2. **Representability.**  The spectral method packages the coefficient group into an *internal* object \\(Q E\\) that *represents* the homology theory (Brown representability).  In the thesis, \\(K\\!T_m(-;G)\\) is *defined* object-wise; an internal representing object may or may not exist, and you do not require it.\n\n3. **Required structure.**  \n   * Mapping cones and restricted (co)products are enough for your method; no tensor product is needed.  \n   * The smash-product method *needs* a closed symmetric monoidal structure that is compatible with homotopy limits/colimits.\n\n4. **Scope.**  Therefore your construction applies in situations where the smash-product approach does **not**: e.g. the triangulated category \\(\\mathrm{KK}\\) of separable \\(C^{*}\\)-algebras, whose minimal \\(C^{*}\\)-tensor product fails to respect mapping cones.  (Your thesis treats this via ning categories.)  \n\n   Conversely, in highly structured realms (spectra, dg-categories) the smash method is often preferable because the representing object \\(Q E\\) unlocks richer tools (module structures, multiplicative pairings, spectral algebra).\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Bottom line\n\n*Your Ph.D. method and the spectrum-smash method are two viewpoints on the same \u201chomology-with-coefficients\u2019\u2019 idea.*\n\n* **Agreement:**  Whenever \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a stable, symmetric-monoidal model category (spectra, chain complexes, motivic spectra, many dg-enhancements), your \\(K\\!T_m(-;G)\\) coincides up to natural isomorphism with \\((QE)\\otimes^{\\mathbf L}_{\\mathcal C}(-)\\).  \n* **Extra reach:**  In categories lacking such monoidal compatibility \u2013 notably various triangulated categories arising from functional analysis \u2013 your mapping-cone construction still works and *is strictly more general.*\n\nHence the strategy you outlined during our earlier discussion can be viewed as the *monoidal incarnation* of the more algebraic blueprint you developed in the thesis.  Integrating both perspectives allows you to pick the most efficient tool in each context: smash products when the tensor structure is well behaved, and the cone/Tor machinery when it is not."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue202L16-L23\ue201","start_idx":456,"end_idx":485,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file4\ue202L1-L8\ue201","start_idx":715,"end_idx":742,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file2\ue202L70-L84\ue201","start_idx":1166,"end_idx":1195,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L3-L11\ue201","start_idx":1478,"end_idx":1506,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L26-L31\ue201","start_idx":1877,"end_idx":1906,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn1file0\ue202L121-L134\ue201","start_idx":2799,"end_idx":2830,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"

For \ronvenien\re,\r\n[L5] we indi\rate the relevant proposition in this thesis that shows that the fun\rtor with \roe\u00c6\rients de\fned\r\n[L6] using our approa\rh is \ronsistent with the de\fnition already in use in the literature.\r\n[L7] 1. Homotopy fun\rtors on the \rategory of pointed topologi\ral spa\res with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \fnitely\r\n[L8] generated abelian group { Proposition 5.1.2. (Note that we also de\fne homotopy fun\rtors with\r\n[L9] \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rountable abelian group in se\rtion 5.1.)\r\n[L10] 2.

The restri\rted produ\rt of a family of ob je\rts fAigi2I is the \rolimit of the \fltered\r\n[L19] dire\rt system of \fnite produ\rts Q\r\n[L20] E Ai , where E varies over all \fnite subsets of I , under the natural\r\n[L21] in\rlusions\r\n[L22] Y\r\n[L23] E\r\n[L24] Ai ! Y\r\n[L25] E\r\n[L26] Ai (E \u0012 E):\r\n[L27] The reason for doing so is be\rause \rertain homologi\ral fun\rtors, for example, the topologi\ral K-theory\r\n[L28] fun\rtors applied to Bana\rh algebras, do not behave well with respe\rt to \roprodu\rts, but behave well\r\n[L29] with respe\rt to \fnite produ\rts and \fltered \rolimits.\r\n[L30] In \rhapter 3, we de\fne multipli\ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix N of nonnegative integers in \rategories\r\n[L31] that have restri\rted produ\rts, as well as in \rategories that have \roprodu\rts. We treat these two types of\r\n[L32] \rategories separately. De\fnition 3.1.1 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory with\r\n[L33] restri\rted produ\rts, and De\fnition 3.4.5 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory\r\n[L34] with \roprodu\rts.\n# \u30102\u2020NG-Ejay.pdf\u2020file-CkUxXaBVgwRJxCDagCNgSM\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: NG-Ejay.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file2\ue201\nMclick Target: \"3:2\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] . . . . . . . . . . . 57\r\n[L2] 3.5 Multipli\ration by N in a \rategory with \ro-aggregation and \roprodu\rts . . . . . . . . . . . 63\r\n[L3] 3.6 Conditions under whi\rh \u0013MN = \u0013M \u0013N for nonnegative \rolumn-\fnite matri\res M ; N for a\r\n[L4] \rategory with \ro-aggregation and \roprodu\rts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65\r\n[L5] 4 Quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients 71\r\n[L6] 4.1 Coning and ning \rategories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 71\r\n[L7] 4.2 Fun\rtorially generated \roning and ning \rategories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78\r\n[L8] 4.3 Coning and ning \rategories with restri\rted produ\rts or \roprodu\rts . . . . . . . . . . . . . 88\r\n[L9] 4.4 Quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a nonnegative \rolumn-\fnite matrix . . . . 92\r\n[L10] 4.5 Having KT m(T kX; N) isomorphi\r to KT m+k(X; N) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100\r\n[L11] 4.6 Quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 103\r\n[L12] 3 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 160> 5 Topologi\ral examples 113\r\n[L13] 5.1 Homotopy groups with \roe\u00c6\rients . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 113\r\n[L14] 5.2 Homology groups with \roe\u00c6\rients . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 119\r\n[L15] 5.3 Spe\rtra and the stable homotopy \rategory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n# \u30103\u2020NG-Ejay.pdf\u2020file-CkUxXaBVgwRJxCDagCNgSM\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: NG-Ejay.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"3:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 121\r\n[L2] 6 Algebrai\r K-theory of nonunital rings 125\r\n[L3] 6.1 Algebrai\r K-theory of rngs with \roe\u00c6\rients in a matrix of \rountable dimension . . . . . . 125\r\n[L4] 6.2 Algebrai\r K-theory of rngs with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rountable abelian group . . . . . . . . . 128\r\n[L5] 7 Symmetri\r monoidal \rategories 131\r\n[L6] 7.1 De\fnition and examples of symmetri\r monoidal \roning and ning \rategories . . . . . . . . 131\r\n[L7] 7.2 Homologi\ral fun\rtors KT m(; N) in symmetri\r monoidal \rategories . . . . . . . . . . . . 136\r\n[L8] 7.3 Obtaining a homologi\ral fun\rtor KT m(; G) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 137\r\n[L9] 8 Topologi\ral K-theory of C\u0003-algebras with \roe\u00c6\rients 138\r\n[L10] 8.1 Topologi\ral K-theory of \romplex C\u0003-algebras with \roe\u00c6\rients . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 138\r\n[L11] 8.2 The use of the bootstrap \rategory for \romplex C\u0003-algebras . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 139\r\n[L12] 8.3 Topologi\ral K-theory of real C\u0003-algebras with \roe\u00c6\rients . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 140\r\n[L13] 8.4 Determining \n[L14] 2(G) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 143\r\n[L15] Index of notation 152 <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 160> CONTENTS i\r\n[L16] Summary\r\n[L17] If C is a triangulated \rategory, a homologi\ral fun\rtor K : C !

A is a fun\rtor whose target \rategory\r\n[L83] is an abelian \rategory and whi\rh sends distinguished triangles to long exa\rt sequen\res of A-ob je\rts. We\r\n[L84] \ran extend the notion of a homologi\ral fun\rtor to more general \rategories. The usual homotopy fun\rtors\r\n[L85] on the \rategory of pointed topologi\ral spa\res, the K-theory fun\rtors, and redu\red homology fun\rtors\r\n[L86] on the \rategory of pointed CW-\romplexes are example of fun\rtors that we term homologi\ral in this\r\n[L87] thesis.\r\n[L88] In this thesis, we provide a framework for de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients that \ran be applied to many\r\n[L89] examples. We investigate fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite matrix of nonnegative integers as a\r\n[L90] prelude to investigating fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in abelian groups. The rationale for doing so is be\rause\r\n[L91] \rolumn-\fnite matri\res of nonnegative integers arise from nonnegative presentations, whi\rh always exist\r\n[L92] for any abelian group.\r\n[L93] Start with a \rategory C that is equipped with a translation endofun\rtor T : C ! C analogous to the\r\n[L94] suspension endofun\rtor on a triangulated \rategory. However, we do not assume that T is invertible. We\r\n[L95] also assume that there is a distinguished \rolle\rtion of sequen\res in C of the form\r\n[L96] A\r\n[L97] f- B - Cf - T A\r\n[L98] or of the form\r\n[L99] T B - Pf - A\r\n[L100] f- B ;\r\n[L101] where Cf ; Pf are determined up to non-\ranoni\ral isomorphism by f . These are known as \roning\r\n[L102] sequen\res and ning sequen\res respe\rtively { the ob je\rt Cf is \ralled a mapping \rone and the ob je\rt\r\n[L103] Pf is \ralled a mapping path ob je\rt, reminis\rent of their topologi\ral equivalents. A homologi\ral\r\n[L104] fun\rtor K : C ! A will then be a fun\rtor whose target \rategory is an abelian \rategory, and whi\rh sends\r\n[L105] \roning or ning sequen\res to half-long exa\rt sequen\res of A-ob je\rts.\r\n[L106] We \ronsider two types of \rategories with homologi\ral fun\rtors in this thesis:\r\n[L107] 1. Categories C that have \roprodu\rts equipped with homologi\ral fun\rtors K : C ! A that preserve\r\n[L108] \roprodu\rts.\r\n[L109] 2. Categories C that have \fnite produ\rts and, optionally, \fltered \rolimits as well, equipped with\r\n[L110] homologi\ral fun\rtors K : C ! A that preserve \fnite produ\rts and \fltered \rolimits (if \fltered\r\n[L111] \rolimits exist).\r\n[L112] For both these types of \rategories, we let M : C ! C be a suitably \rhosen endofun\rtor on the \rategory.\r\n[L113] Let N be a \rolumn-\fnite I \u0002 J matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the \frst type of \rategory,\r\n[L114] we de\fne a natural transformation\r\n[L115] \u0013N : a\r\n[L116] J\r\n[L117] \u00c6M ! a\r\n[L118] I\r\n[L119] \u00c6M\r\n[L120] on the \rategory C that indu\res multipli\ration by N in the \rategory A when we apply the homologi\ral\r\n[L121] fun\rtor K, where `here denotes the \ropower fun\rtor, or \roprodu\rt fun\rtor applied to \ropies of the\r\n[L122] same ob je\rt.","[L123] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 160>","[L124] CONTENTS ii\r\n[L125] For the se\rond type of \rategory, we \frst de\fne the notion of restri\rted produ\rts in the \rategory (see\r\n[L126] \rhapter 2), whi\rh is the analog of \roprodu\rts. In parti\rular, given any index set I , we use \fnite produ\rts\r\n[L127] and \fltered \rolimits to de\fne a fun\rtor CI ! C. The restri\rted power fun\rtor Q0\r\n[L128] I\r\n[L129] : C ! C is thus\r\n[L130] obtained by applying the restri\rted produ\rt fun\rtor to \ropies of the same ob je\rt. In this \rategory, we\r\n[L131] also de\fne a natural transformation\r\n[L132] \u0013N : Y0\r\n[L133] J\r\n[L134] \u00c6M ! Y0\r\n[L135] I\r\n[L136] \u00c6M\r\n[L137] on C that indu\res multipli\ration by N in the \rategory A when we apply the homologi\ral fun\rtor K.\r\n[L138] Given any ob je\rt C of C, we then use the natural transformation \u0013N to de\fne an ob je\rt KT m(C; N) in\r\n[L139] A (see \rhapter 4), where m is a nonnegative integer depending on T , M and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K.\r\n[L140] This produ\res a quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; N) : C ! A, and in the \rase where we have fun\rtorial mapping\r\n[L141] \rones or fun\rtorial mapping path ob je\rts in C, this produ\res a (stri\rt) fun\rtor KT m(; N) : C ! A. We\r\n[L142] term KT m(; N) the quasi-fun\rtor (respe\rtively, fun\rtor) with \roe\u00c6\rients in N.\r\n[L143] We prove that if N is the matrix representing some nonnegative presentation of an abelian group G, we\r\n[L144] obtain a universal \roe\u00c6\rient sequen\re\r\n[L145] G \n[L146]  KT mC- - KT m\r\n[L147] (C; N) -- Tor(G; KT m+1C)\r\n[L148] in the \rase where we have mapping \rones, and a universal \roe\u00c6\rient sequen\re\r\n[L149] G \n[L150]  KT m+1C- - KT m+1(C; N) -- Tor(G; KT m\r\n[L151] C)\r\n[L152] in the \rase where we have mapping path ob je\rts (see Theorems 4.4.5 and 4.4.6 respe\rtively).\r\n[L153] After investigating quasi-fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite matrix, we explore reasonable\r\n[L154] \ronditions under whi\rh the quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; G) : C ! A with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group G\r\n[L155] \ran be de\fned. For this, we restri\rt our attention to the \rase where A = Ab is the \rategory of abelian\r\n[L156] groups.\r\n[L157] The strategy employed is as follows: First, we show that given matri\res M ; N for whi\rh the produ\rt MN\r\n[L158] exists, \u0013MN = \u0013M \u0013N on the \rategory C, when C is assumed to satisfy \rertain \ronditions over and above\r\n[L159] what has been assumed previously when de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a nonnegative matrix.\r\n[L160] Then we use this result to prove that if is any presentation of an abelian group G ( does not have\r\n[L161] to be nonnegative), it is possible to de\fne the quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; ) in a way that generalizes our\r\n[L162] previous \ronstru\rtion involving nonnegative presentations and nonnegatives matri\res. Furthermore, we\r\n[L163] also show that if and 0are two presentations of the same group G, then KT m(C; ) is isomorphi\r\r\n[L164] to KT m(C; 0) for any ob je\rt C (see Theorem 4.6.5 and Remark 4.6.6). This allows us to de\fne the\r\n[L165] quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; G) in an abelian group G (see De\fnition 4.6.7).\r\n[L166] In this thesis, we also explain how homologi\ral fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients \ran arise in \rategories that are\r\n[L167] equipped with a symmetri\r tensor produ\rt \n[L168]  satisfying the property that whenever D is any ob je\rt of the\r\n[L169] \rategory, applying \n[L170] D to a \roning (respe\rtively, ning) sequen\re results in another \roning (respe\rtively,\r\n[L171] ning) sequen\re.","[L172] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 160>","[L173] CHAPTER 1.

For\r\n[L179] the de\fnition and properties of triangulated \rategories, see either Verdier's \rlassi\ral treatment [56\u2104 or\r\n[L180] Neeman's modern a\r\rount [39\u2104.\r\n[L181] Many fun\rtors that give rise to long exa\rt sequen\res a\rt on \rategories that are not triangulated, for\r\n[L182] example, the usual homotopy fun\rtors on the \rategory of pointed topologi\ral spa\res, the K-theory\r\n[L183] fun\rtors, and redu\red homology fun\rtors on the \rategory of pointed CW-\romplexes. Hen\re, we should\r\n[L184] extend the notion of a homologi\ral fun\rtor to in\rlude all these examples.\r\n[L185] Given a homologi\ral fun\rtor K, the fun\rtor K with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group is often \ronstru\rted in\r\n[L186] order to perform more \romputations or derive new results.

There are two reasons for undertaking this pro je\rt:\r\n[L190] 1. We \ran use the \rommon framework to gain a better understanding of a wide range of homologi\ral\r\n[L191] fun\rtors.\r\n[L192] 2.

INTRODUCTION 2\r\n[L206] K-theory of C\u0003-algebras. In parti\rular, the \ronstru\rtion involves using a C\u0003-algebra whose \romplex\r\n[L207] topologi\ral K-theory is A in even dimensions and 0 in odd dimensions, in other words, a C\u0003-algebra\r\n[L208] whose \romplex topologi\ral K-theory is given by KUtop\r\n[L209] \u0003 (C ; A), where C denotes the base \feld of \romplex\r\n[L210] numbers, and KUtop\r\n[L211] \u0003 (; A) denotes \romplex topologi\ral K-theory with \roe\u00c6\rients in A.\r\n[L212] In [6\u2104, it is shown that if abelian groups A; B ; C; D; E are spe\ri\fed, one \ran always \ronstru\rt a strongly\r\n[L213] torsion generated group S whose \rentre is isomorphi\r to A and whose higher integral homology up to\r\n[L214] dimension \fve is given by H2(S) \u0018= B, H3(S) \u0018= C, H4(S) \u0018= D, H5(S) \u0018= E. The \ronstru\rtion involves\r\n[L215] using a real C\u0003-algebra EA whose real topologi\ral K-theory is \rlosely related to A (see se\rtion 3 of [6\u2104).\r\n[L216] In this thesis, we de\fne real topologi\ral K-theory with \roe\u00c6\rients in any \rolumn-\fnite matrix of non\u0002negative integers.

Note that in the literature, homotopy groups\r\n[L322] with mod p \roe\u00c6\rients are often de\fned using Moore spa\res Mn(Z=pZ); Neisendorfer's \ronstru\rtion is\r\n[L323] a generalization of the mod p \ronstru\rtion be\rause for n \u0015 3 and any torsion abelian group A, a simply\r\n[L324] \ronne\rted nth Peterson spa\re P n(A) is the same as an (n  1)th Moore spa\re Mn1(A) up to unnatural\r\n[L325] isomorphism.\r\n[L326] On the other hand, \ronstru\rting singular homology of CW-\romplexes with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian\r\n[L327] group G involves taking tensor produ\rts of singular \rhain \romplexes with the group G regarded as a\r\n[L328] \rhain \romplex \ron\rentrated in dimension 0.\r\n[L329] Hen\re, we need a unifying approa\rh of de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients that \rovers many examples. In\r\n[L330] this se\rtion, we use the examples of topologi\ral and \rhain homology with \roe\u00c6\rients to illustrate the\r\n[L331] form that su\rh an approa\rh \ran take.\r\n[L332] Given a sub\romplex A of a pointed CW-\romplex X, the long exa\rt ordinary homology sequen\re with Z\r\n[L333] \roe\u00c6\rients\r\n[L334] \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 - H~\r\n[L335] n(A) - H~n(X) - H~n(X=A) - H~n1(A) - H~n1(X) - \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\r\n[L336] is obtained by applying the \rhain homology fun\rtor H to the short exa\rt sequen\re\r\n[L337] 0 - C(A) - C(X) - C(X; A) - 0 (1-2)\r\n[L338] of (augmented) singular \rhain \romplexes. Given an abelian group G, redu\red singular homology with\r\n[L339] G-\roe\u00c6\rients is obtained by \frst tensoring (1-2) with G, and then applying H to the short exa\rt sequen\re\r\n[L340] 0 - C(A) \n[L341]  G - C(X) \n[L342]  G - C(X; A) \n[L343]  G - 0; (1-3)\r\n[L344] where \n[L345]  denotes \n[L346] Z.

INTRODUCTION 7\r\n[L594] If A is an arbitrary \rhain \romplex of abelian groups, method 2 of the above proposition might provide\r\n[L595] a better way of de\fning homology of A with G-\roe\u00c6\rients be\rause statement (1-9) tells us that even\r\n[L596] when A is not \rat, H(CA\r\n[L597] N\u0001) is isomorphi\r to (H(A) \n[L598]  G) \b (Tor(H(A); G)) whi\rh is easily \romputable\r\n[L599] and does not depend on \rhosing any presentation of G. Of \rourse, whether a parti\rular de\fnition of a\r\n[L600] homologi\ral fun\rtor with \roe\u00c6\rients is useful depends on whether it enables \romputations to be done\r\n[L601] and whether it sheds light on existing theory.\r\n[L602] 1.5 Nonnegative matri\res\r\n[L603] In the previous se\rtion, we \ronsidered arbitrary presentations of an abelian group G as well as multipli-\r\n[L604] \ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix N with integer entries.\r\n[L605] In the more general \rategories that we examine later on, we \ran de\fne only multipli\ration by a \rolumn-\r\n[L606] \fnite matrix N with nonnegative integer entries. To take a simple example, in a semi-additive \rategory\r\n[L607] with \roprodu\rts where the morphism sets \rarry only the stru\rture of a \rommutative monoid, we \ran\r\n[L608] de\fne only multipli\ration by a nonnegative integer n on a given ob je\rt C. Hen\re, we need to restri\rt\r\n[L609] ourselves to \ronsidering nonnegative presentations of an abelian group G, namely, presentations\r\n[L610] M\r\n[L611] J\r\n[L612] Z-- M\r\n[L613] I\r\n[L614] Z -- G\r\n[L615] in whi\rh the matrix of relative to the standard Z-bases of L\r\n[L616] I Z and LJ Z is a nonnegative matrix\r\n[L617] (we assume here that the index sets I ; J are well-ordered).\r\n[L618] We prove later in Lemma 4.6.1 that any given presentation of an abelian group \ran be \\lifted\" to\r\n[L619] a nonnegative presentation whi\rh we denote by Q( ) throughout this thesis. Hen\re, there is no loss\r\n[L620] of generality in restri\rting ourselves to nonnegative presentations of abelian groups and nonnegative\r\n[L621] matri\res.\r\n[L622] 1.6 The approa\rh we adopt\r\n[L623] Based on the dis\russion thus far, we devise the following approa\rh to de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients:\r\n[L624] 1. Let a \rategory C be given. Assume that C has \roning sequen\res and that it is possible to de\fne\r\n[L625] multipli\ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix with nonnegative integer entries in C. Assume further that\r\n[L626] there is a given homologi\ral fun\rtor K with \rertain good properties. The pre\rise requirements are\r\n[L627] that the \rategory C and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K have to satisfy all of the following:\r\n[L628] (a) Either De\fnition 3.1.1 or 3.4.5.\r\n[L629] (b) Either De\fnition 4.1.1 or 4.1.3.\r\n[L630] (\r) Either De\fnition 4.3.1 or 4.3.2.\r\n[L631] 2. Use the \roning stru\rture as well as the notion of multipli\ration by a nonnegative matrix N to\r\n[L632] de\fne the quasi-fun\rtor or fun\rtor KT m(; N) with \roe\u00c6\rients in N, where m is a nonnegative\r\n[L633] integer that depends on T and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K. Quasi-fun\rtors arise when the mapping\r\n[L634] \rone Cf does not depend fun\rtorially on the given morphism f and is determined by f only up to\r\n[L635] non-unique isomorphism, as is the \rase for triangulated \rategories.\r\n[L636] 3. In the \rase where the fun\rtor KT m(; G) with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group G has already been\r\n[L637] de\fned in the literature and is widely used, verify that our de\fnition of KT m(; N) \roin\rides with\r\n[L638] the \\standard\" de\fnition, in the sense that if\r\n[L639] M\r\n[L640] J\r\n[L641] Z-- M\r\n[L642] I\r\n[L643] Z -- G","[L644] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 14 / 160>","[L645] CHAPTER 1.

The restri\rted produ\rt of a family of ob je\rts fAigi2I is the \rolimit of the \fltered\r\n[L666] dire\rt system of \fnite produ\rts Q\r\n[L667] E Ai , where E varies over all \fnite subsets of I , under the natural\r\n[L668] in\rlusions\r\n[L669] Y\r\n[L670] E\r\n[L671] Ai !

We treat these two types of\r\n[L679] \rategories separately. De\fnition 3.1.1 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory with\r\n[L680] restri\rted produ\rts, and De\fnition 3.4.5 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory\r\n[L681] with \roprodu\rts. Let \u0013N denote multipli\ration by a matrix N in either of su\rh \rategories.

Subsequently, this result is applied in \rhapter 4 to de\fning quasi-fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in an\r\n[L684] abelian group G.\r\n[L685] In the \frst two se\rtions of \rhapter 4, we de\fne \roning and ning \rategories (a ning \rategory is dual to a\r\n[L686] \roning \rategory) and give examples. In se\rtion 4.3, we lay out pre\risely the properties that homologi\ral\r\n[L687] fun\rtors must have in order that quasi-fun\rtors and fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients \ran be de\fned.

For \fnite I , the \romplete dire\rt sum is simply a \fnite produ\rt of\r\n[L2548] C\u0003-algebras (in the literature, these are also \ralled dire\rt sums, even though they are not \roprodu\rts).\r\n[L2549] The \rategory Cstar satis\fes RP1(\b\f ) and RP2(\b\f ) for any in\fnite \rardinal \b\f.

A\r\n[L3881] that sends restri\rted produ\rts to \roprodu\rts. We \rhoose a suitable fun\rtor M : C ! C and \ronstru\rt, for\r\n[L3882] every \rolumn-\fnite I \u0002 J matrix N with nonnegative integer entries, a natural transformation\r\n[L3883] \u0013N : Y0\r\n[L3884] J\r\n[L3885] \u00c6M ! Y0\r\n[L3886] I\r\n[L3887] \u00c6M\r\n[L3888] on C. For any ob je\rt C of C, applying the fun\rtor K to the natural map (\u0013N )C :\r\n[L3889] Q0\r\n[L3890] J MC !\r\n[L3891] Q0\r\n[L3892] I MC then\r\n[L3893] yields a map `\r\n[L3894] J K(MC) ! `I K(MC) in A, whi\rh under suitable additional assumptions, \rorresponds\r\n[L3895] to multipli\ration by N in A as well.\r\n[L3896] The se\rond \rase is if we have an abelian \rategory A, a \rategory C that has \roprodu\rts, and a homologi\ral\r\n[L3897] fun\rtor K : C ! A that preserves \roprodu\rts. Then we \rhoose a suitable fun\rtor M : C !

Note that any \rategory with \fnite\r\n[L3908] produ\rts and zero morphisms automati\rally satis\fes RP1(\b0). Assume that C has \fltered \rolimits if we\r\n[L3909] wish to \ronsider restri\rted produ\rts taken over in\fnite index sets; else, we do not make this assumption.\r\n[L3910] Suppose also that the following properties are satis\fed:\r\n[L3911] 1.

(Semi-additive \rategories.) Let A be a semi-additive \rategory with \fnite produ\rts and \fltered\r\n[L4040] \rolimits over index sets of \rardinality < \b\f . (A de\fnition and basi\r properties of semi-additive\r\n[L4041] \rategories \ran be found in se\rtion 40 of Herrli\rh & Stre\rker [22\u2104.) In A, \fnite produ\rts and \fnite\r\n[L4042] \roprodu\rts \roin\ride, and are termed biprodu\rts. Hen\re in A, the restri\rted produ\rt fun\rtor Q0\r\n[L4043] I\r\n[L4044] is the \roprodu\rt fun\rtor `\r\n[L4045] I\r\n[L4046] . We may take M to be the identity fun\rtor IdA on A. For any index\r\n[L4047] set I of \rardinality < \b\f , regard the aggregation transformation rI:\r\n[L4048] `\r\n[L4049] I ! IdA as the summation\r\n[L4050] \u0006I:\r\n[L4051] `\r\n[L4052] I ! IdA.

The primary referen\res for this example are: Bla\rkadar [8\u2104 se\rtion\r\n[L4074] II.9 (on tensor produ\rts of C\u0003-algebras), and Proposition 3.2 of Berri\rk & Matthey [6\u2104 (\ronstru\rting\r\n[L4075] the aggregation transformations).\r\n[L4076] Let C = Cstar be the \rategory of \romplex C\u0003-algebras and \u0003-homomorphisms, (the \rase of real\r\n[L4077] C\u0003-algebras is dealt with similarly). Let V be a well-ordered set of \rardinality \b\f, where \b\f is an\r\n[L4078] in\fnite \rardinal. Let `\r\n[L4079] 2\r\n[L4080] C (V ) be the Hilbert spa\re of square summable sequen\res (\ri)i2V of length\r\n[L4081] jV j of \romplex numbers.

Furthermore, if C has \fnite \roprodu\rts, then C also has \fnite\r\n[L90] produ\rts and \fnite biprodu\rts, and all three items \roin\ride.

A is a fun\rtor whose target \rategory\r\n[L83] is an abelian \rategory and whi\rh sends distinguished triangles to long exa\rt sequen\res of A-ob je\rts. We\r\n[L84] \ran extend the notion of a homologi\ral fun\rtor to more general \rategories. The usual homotopy fun\rtors\r\n[L85] on the \rategory of pointed topologi\ral spa\res, the K-theory fun\rtors, and redu\red homology fun\rtors\r\n[L86] on the \rategory of pointed CW-\romplexes are example of fun\rtors that we term homologi\ral in this\r\n[L87] thesis.\r\n[L88] In this thesis, we provide a framework for de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients that \ran be applied to many\r\n[L89] examples. We investigate fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite matrix of nonnegative integers as a\r\n[L90] prelude to investigating fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in abelian groups. The rationale for doing so is be\rause\r\n[L91] \rolumn-\fnite matri\res of nonnegative integers arise from nonnegative presentations, whi\rh always exist\r\n[L92] for any abelian group.\r\n[L93] Start with a \rategory C that is equipped with a translation endofun\rtor T : C ! C analogous to the\r\n[L94] suspension endofun\rtor on a triangulated \rategory. However, we do not assume that T is invertible. We\r\n[L95] also assume that there is a distinguished \rolle\rtion of sequen\res in C of the form\r\n[L96] A\r\n[L97] f- B - Cf - T A\r\n[L98] or of the form\r\n[L99] T B - Pf - A\r\n[L100] f- B ;\r\n[L101] where Cf ; Pf are determined up to non-\ranoni\ral isomorphism by f . These are known as \roning\r\n[L102] sequen\res and ning sequen\res respe\rtively { the ob je\rt Cf is \ralled a mapping \rone and the ob je\rt\r\n[L103] Pf is \ralled a mapping path ob je\rt, reminis\rent of their topologi\ral equivalents. A homologi\ral\r\n[L104] fun\rtor K : C ! A will then be a fun\rtor whose target \rategory is an abelian \rategory, and whi\rh sends\r\n[L105] \roning or ning sequen\res to half-long exa\rt sequen\res of A-ob je\rts.\r\n[L106] We \ronsider two types of \rategories with homologi\ral fun\rtors in this thesis:\r\n[L107] 1. Categories C that have \roprodu\rts equipped with homologi\ral fun\rtors K : C ! A that preserve\r\n[L108] \roprodu\rts.\r\n[L109] 2. Categories C that have \fnite produ\rts and, optionally, \fltered \rolimits as well, equipped with\r\n[L110] homologi\ral fun\rtors K : C ! A that preserve \fnite produ\rts and \fltered \rolimits (if \fltered\r\n[L111] \rolimits exist).\r\n[L112] For both these types of \rategories, we let M : C ! C be a suitably \rhosen endofun\rtor on the \rategory.\r\n[L113] Let N be a \rolumn-\fnite I \u0002 J matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the \frst type of \rategory,\r\n[L114] we de\fne a natural transformation\r\n[L115] \u0013N : a\r\n[L116] J\r\n[L117] \u00c6M ! a\r\n[L118] I\r\n[L119] \u00c6M\r\n[L120] on the \rategory C that indu\res multipli\ration by N in the \rategory A when we apply the homologi\ral\r\n[L121] fun\rtor K, where `here denotes the \ropower fun\rtor, or \roprodu\rt fun\rtor applied to \ropies of the\r\n[L122] same ob je\rt.","[L123] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 160>","[L124] CONTENTS ii\r\n[L125] For the se\rond type of \rategory, we \frst de\fne the notion of restri\rted produ\rts in the \rategory (see\r\n[L126] \rhapter 2), whi\rh is the analog of \roprodu\rts. In parti\rular, given any index set I , we use \fnite produ\rts\r\n[L127] and \fltered \rolimits to de\fne a fun\rtor CI ! C. The restri\rted power fun\rtor Q0\r\n[L128] I\r\n[L129] : C ! C is thus\r\n[L130] obtained by applying the restri\rted produ\rt fun\rtor to \ropies of the same ob je\rt. In this \rategory, we\r\n[L131] also de\fne a natural transformation\r\n[L132] \u0013N : Y0\r\n[L133] J\r\n[L134] \u00c6M !

A, and in the \rase where we have fun\rtorial mapping\r\n[L141] \rones or fun\rtorial mapping path ob je\rts in C, this produ\res a (stri\rt) fun\rtor KT m(; N) : C ! A. We\r\n[L142] term KT m(; N) the quasi-fun\rtor (respe\rtively, fun\rtor) with \roe\u00c6\rients in N.\r\n[L143] We prove that if N is the matrix representing some nonnegative presentation of an abelian group G, we\r\n[L144] obtain a universal \roe\u00c6\rient sequen\re\r\n[L145] G \n[L146]  KT mC- - KT m\r\n[L147] (C; N) -- Tor(G; KT m+1C)\r\n[L148] in the \rase where we have mapping \rones, and a universal \roe\u00c6\rient sequen\re\r\n[L149] G \n[L150]  KT m+1C- - KT m+1(C; N) -- Tor(G; KT m\r\n[L151] C)\r\n[L152] in the \rase where we have mapping path ob je\rts (see Theorems 4.4.5 and 4.4.6 respe\rtively).\r\n[L153] After investigating quasi-fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite matrix, we explore reasonable\r\n[L154] \ronditions under whi\rh the quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; G) : C !

For this, we restri\rt our attention to the \rase where A = Ab is the \rategory of abelian\r\n[L156] groups.\r\n[L157] The strategy employed is as follows: First, we show that given matri\res M ; N for whi\rh the produ\rt MN\r\n[L158] exists, \u0013MN = \u0013M \u0013N on the \rategory C, when C is assumed to satisfy \rertain \ronditions over and above\r\n[L159] what has been assumed previously when de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a nonnegative matrix.\r\n[L160] Then we use this result to prove that if is any presentation of an abelian group G ( does not have\r\n[L161] to be nonnegative), it is possible to de\fne the quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; ) in a way that generalizes our\r\n[L162] previous \ronstru\rtion involving nonnegative presentations and nonnegatives matri\res. Furthermore, we\r\n[L163] also show that if and 0are two presentations of the same group G, then KT m(C; ) is isomorphi\r\r\n[L164] to KT m(C; 0) for any ob je\rt C (see Theorem 4.6.5 and Remark 4.6.6). This allows us to de\fne the\r\n[L165] quasi-fun\rtor KT m(; G) in an abelian group G (see De\fnition 4.6.7).\r\n[L166] In this thesis, we also explain how homologi\ral fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients \ran arise in \rategories that are\r\n[L167] equipped with a symmetri\r tensor produ\rt \n[L168]  satisfying the property that whenever D is any ob je\rt of the\r\n[L169] \rategory, applying \n[L170] D to a \roning (respe\rtively, ning) sequen\re results in another \roning (respe\rtively,\r\n[L171] ning) sequen\re.","[L172] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 160>","[L173] CHAPTER 1.

Hen\re, we should\r\n[L184] extend the notion of a homologi\ral fun\rtor to in\rlude all these examples.\r\n[L185] Given a homologi\ral fun\rtor K, the fun\rtor K with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group is often \ronstru\rted in\r\n[L186] order to perform more \romputations or derive new results.

INTRODUCTION 2\r\n[L206] K-theory of C\u0003-algebras. In parti\rular, the \ronstru\rtion involves using a C\u0003-algebra whose \romplex\r\n[L207] topologi\ral K-theory is A in even dimensions and 0 in odd dimensions, in other words, a C\u0003-algebra\r\n[L208] whose \romplex topologi\ral K-theory is given by KUtop\r\n[L209] \u0003 (C ; A), where C denotes the base \feld of \romplex\r\n[L210] numbers, and KUtop\r\n[L211] \u0003 (; A) denotes \romplex topologi\ral K-theory with \roe\u00c6\rients in A.\r\n[L212] In [6\u2104, it is shown that if abelian groups A; B ; C; D; E are spe\ri\fed, one \ran always \ronstru\rt a strongly\r\n[L213] torsion generated group S whose \rentre is isomorphi\r to A and whose higher integral homology up to\r\n[L214] dimension \fve is given by H2(S) \u0018= B, H3(S) \u0018= C, H4(S) \u0018= D, H5(S) \u0018= E. The \ronstru\rtion involves\r\n[L215] using a real C\u0003-algebra EA whose real topologi\ral K-theory is \rlosely related to A (see se\rtion 3 of [6\u2104).\r\n[L216] In this thesis, we de\fne real topologi\ral K-theory with \roe\u00c6\rients in any \rolumn-\fnite matrix of non\u0002negative integers. It turns out that the real topologi\ral K-theory of EA is the same as the real topologi\ral\r\n[L217] K-theory (modulo some dimension shift) of R with \roe\u00c6\rients in N, where N is the matrix \rorresponding\r\n[L218] to any arbitrarily \rhosen nonnegative presentation of A (see se\rtion 8.3 of this thesis).\r\n[L219] This example forms the prototype for de\fning and studying fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in a \rolumn-\fnite\r\n[L220] matrix of nonnegative integers.\r\n[L221] 1.2.2 Algebrai\r K-theory with \roe\u00c6\rients\r\n[L222] Algebrai\r K-theory with mod p \roe\u00c6\rients, that is, \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group Z=pZ, was \frst\r\n[L223] studied in detail by Browder [13\u2104 who used it to improve on \rertain existing results by Harris-Segal\r\n[L224] and Lee-Sz\rzarba. Notably, this work of Browder provides tools for investigating the Li\rhtenbaum\u0002Quillen \ronje\rtures relating the algebrai\r K-theory of s\rhemes, \felds or rings of algebrai\r integers to\r\n[L225] their \u0013etale \rohomology or \u0013etale K-theory (see for instan\re Li\rhtenbaum [32\u2104, Snaith [51\u2104 and Jardine\r\n[L226] [27\u2104). Relevant work in this area was also \rarried out by Suslin who investigated algebrai\r K-theory with\r\n[L227] mod p \roe\u00c6\rients of both algebrai\rally \rlosed \felds as well as lo\ral \felds in [53\u2104 and [54\u2104 respe\rtively.\r\n[L228] Bott periodi\rity in \romplex, real and self-\ronjugate topologi\ral K-theory is well known, but similar\r\n[L229] periodi\rity results in algebrai\r K-theory are more di\u00c6\rult to establish.

In\r\n[L330] this se\rtion, we use the examples of topologi\ral and \rhain homology with \roe\u00c6\rients to illustrate the\r\n[L331] form that su\rh an approa\rh \ran take.\r\n[L332] Given a sub\romplex A of a pointed CW-\romplex X, the long exa\rt ordinary homology sequen\re with Z\r\n[L333] \roe\u00c6\rients\r\n[L334] \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 - H~\r\n[L335] n(A) - H~n(X) - H~n(X=A) - H~n1(A) - H~n1(X) - \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\r\n[L336] is obtained by applying the \rhain homology fun\rtor H to the short exa\rt sequen\re\r\n[L337] 0 - C(A) - C(X) - C(X; A) - 0 (1-2)\r\n[L338] of (augmented) singular \rhain \romplexes.

INTRODUCTION 7\r\n[L594] If A is an arbitrary \rhain \romplex of abelian groups, method 2 of the above proposition might provide\r\n[L595] a better way of de\fning homology of A with G-\roe\u00c6\rients be\rause statement (1-9) tells us that even\r\n[L596] when A is not \rat, H(CA\r\n[L597] N\u0001) is isomorphi\r to (H(A) \n[L598]  G) \b (Tor(H(A); G)) whi\rh is easily \romputable\r\n[L599] and does not depend on \rhosing any presentation of G. Of \rourse, whether a parti\rular de\fnition of a\r\n[L600] homologi\ral fun\rtor with \roe\u00c6\rients is useful depends on whether it enables \romputations to be done\r\n[L601] and whether it sheds light on existing theory.\r\n[L602] 1.5 Nonnegative matri\res\r\n[L603] In the previous se\rtion, we \ronsidered arbitrary presentations of an abelian group G as well as multipli-\r\n[L604] \ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix N with integer entries.\r\n[L605] In the more general \rategories that we examine later on, we \ran de\fne only multipli\ration by a \rolumn-\r\n[L606] \fnite matrix N with nonnegative integer entries. To take a simple example, in a semi-additive \rategory\r\n[L607] with \roprodu\rts where the morphism sets \rarry only the stru\rture of a \rommutative monoid, we \ran\r\n[L608] de\fne only multipli\ration by a nonnegative integer n on a given ob je\rt C. Hen\re, we need to restri\rt\r\n[L609] ourselves to \ronsidering nonnegative presentations of an abelian group G, namely, presentations\r\n[L610] M\r\n[L611] J\r\n[L612] Z-- M\r\n[L613] I\r\n[L614] Z -- G\r\n[L615] in whi\rh the matrix of relative to the standard Z-bases of L\r\n[L616] I Z and LJ Z is a nonnegative matrix\r\n[L617] (we assume here that the index sets I ; J are well-ordered).\r\n[L618] We prove later in Lemma 4.6.1 that any given presentation of an abelian group \ran be \\lifted\" to\r\n[L619] a nonnegative presentation whi\rh we denote by Q( ) throughout this thesis. Hen\re, there is no loss\r\n[L620] of generality in restri\rting ourselves to nonnegative presentations of abelian groups and nonnegative\r\n[L621] matri\res.\r\n[L622] 1.6 The approa\rh we adopt\r\n[L623] Based on the dis\russion thus far, we devise the following approa\rh to de\fning fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients:\r\n[L624] 1. Let a \rategory C be given. Assume that C has \roning sequen\res and that it is possible to de\fne\r\n[L625] multipli\ration by a \rolumn-\fnite matrix with nonnegative integer entries in C. Assume further that\r\n[L626] there is a given homologi\ral fun\rtor K with \rertain good properties. The pre\rise requirements are\r\n[L627] that the \rategory C and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K have to satisfy all of the following:\r\n[L628] (a) Either De\fnition 3.1.1 or 3.4.5.\r\n[L629] (b) Either De\fnition 4.1.1 or 4.1.3.\r\n[L630] (\r) Either De\fnition 4.3.1 or 4.3.2.\r\n[L631] 2. Use the \roning stru\rture as well as the notion of multipli\ration by a nonnegative matrix N to\r\n[L632] de\fne the quasi-fun\rtor or fun\rtor KT m(; N) with \roe\u00c6\rients in N, where m is a nonnegative\r\n[L633] integer that depends on T and the homologi\ral fun\rtor K. Quasi-fun\rtors arise when the mapping\r\n[L634] \rone Cf does not depend fun\rtorially on the given morphism f and is determined by f only up to\r\n[L635] non-unique isomorphism, as is the \rase for triangulated \rategories.\r\n[L636] 3. In the \rase where the fun\rtor KT m(; G) with \roe\u00c6\rients in an abelian group G has already been\r\n[L637] de\fned in the literature and is widely used, verify that our de\fnition of KT m(; N) \roin\rides with\r\n[L638] the \\standard\" de\fnition, in the sense that if\r\n[L639] M\r\n[L640] J\r\n[L641] Z-- M\r\n[L642] I\r\n[L643] Z -- G","[L644] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 14 / 160>","[L645] CHAPTER 1.

We treat these two types of\r\n[L679] \rategories separately. De\fnition 3.1.1 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory with\r\n[L680] restri\rted produ\rts, and De\fnition 3.4.5 lays out the ingredients that must be possessed by a \rategory\r\n[L681] with \roprodu\rts.

Subsequently, this result is applied in \rhapter 4 to de\fning quasi-fun\rtors with \roe\u00c6\rients in an\r\n[L684] abelian group G.\r\n[L685] In the \frst two se\rtions of \rhapter 4, we de\fne \roning and ning \rategories (a ning \rategory is dual to a\r\n[L686] \roning \rategory) and give examples.

In other words, *restricted products are the analogue of infinite direct sums when you cannot add morphisms*.\n\n---\n\n**2.  Why motivic homotopy theory is the perfect habitat.**  \nThe unstable category of pointed motivic spaces (simplicial presheaves on smooth schemes with the \\(A^1\\)-local model structure) and the stable motivic spectra category \\(\\mathbf{SH}(k)\\)\n\n* are **presentable** symmetric\u2013monoidal categories;  \n* filtered colimits *do* commute with finite products (and with smash products separately in each variable).\n\nThis property is singled out in the thesis as \u201caffable of type \\(\\kappa\\)\u201d: a category where filtered colimits indexed by sets of cardinality \\(<\\kappa\\) commute with finite products  \ue200cite\ue202turn6file0\ue202L3697-L3705\ue201.  Lemma 2.6.4 then shows that every affable category automatically satisfies the axioms (RP1, RP2) needed for the matrix\u2013action machinery.  Motivic categories are affable for *every* infinite cardinal, so all the technical lemmas of Chapter 2 go through verbatim.\n\n> **Translation:** in motivic homotopy, the restricted product \\(Q^{0}_{I}(-)\\) is *actually computable*: you can pull a filtered colimit past a finite product without changing the object.  That is exactly the hypothesis your Chapter 2 needs.\n\n---\n\n**3.  How this formalises \u201cinfinite sums\u201d.**\n\n* In an **additive** category the infinite direct sum \\(\\bigoplus_{I}C\\) is the colimit of the diagram of finite sums \\(\\bigoplus_{E}C\\) (\\(|E|<\\infty\\)).  \n* In a **non-additive** but affable category we imitate that recipe, replacing the finite **sum** by the finite **product**.  The restriction to finite-support elements is enforced automatically by the universal property of the colimit.\n\nThus the machinery packages \u201ccoproduct-like\u201d behaviour in a setting where genuine coproducts either do not exist or are not preserved by the functors we care about (e.g. topological or motivic K-theory, which typically preserve finite *products*).\n\n---\n\n**4.  Consequences for functors with coefficients.**\n\nOnce restricted products exist and behave as expected, Chapter 3 defines multiplication by a column-finite matrix \\(N\\) via natural transformations\n\n\\[\n\\varphi_N : Q^{0}_{J}M \\;\\longrightarrow\\; Q^{0}_{I}M ,\n\\]\n\nand Chapter 4 uses these to build the *quasi-functor with coefficients* \\(K^{T,m}(-;N)\\).  Because motivic categories satisfy all RP-axioms, every step of that construction\u2014mapping cones, matrix multiplication, universal coefficient sequences\u2014works exactly as in the thesis.\n\nIn practice this means:\n\n* **Homology and cohomology theories in motivic topology (motivic cohomology, algebraic K-theory, higher Chow groups, \u2026)** can be re-expressed as your \u201cfunctors with coefficients\u201d by replacing tensoring with an abelian group \\(A\\) by composing with the appropriate restricted\u2010product transformation.  \n* The same trick extends to **multiplicative cohomology theories**: smashing a motivic spectrum \\(E\\) with the spectrum representing the restricted product of \\(A\\) gives \u201c\\(E\\)-homology with \\(A\\)-coefficients\u201d without ever mentioning additive structure.\n\n---\n\n**5.  Take-away.**  \nYour restricted-product machinery *is* the universal way to talk about \u201cinfinite direct sums\u201d in any context where\n\n1. you have finite products and filtered colimits, and  \n2. those two operations commute.\n\nMotivic homotopy theory ticks both boxes, so the thesis\u2019s Chapter 2 constructions drop in seamlessly\u2014no extra hypotheses, no exotic model-category tricks needed."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6file0\ue202L706-L719\ue201","start_idx":435,"end_idx":462,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6file0\ue202L3697-L3705\ue201","start_idx":1500,"end_idx":1529,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":4259,"end_idx":4259,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"cc593d8a-a4a6-4e26-b76f-77da75da60cc","request_id":"95dd4996ba318bce-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"cc593d8a-a4a6-4e26-b76f-77da75da60cc","children":["991be0a2-531a-4784-ba02-ff01ecf7f7d6"]},"991be0a2-531a-4784-ba02-ff01ecf7f7d6":{"id":"991be0a2-531a-4784-ba02-ff01ecf7f7d6","message":{"id":"991be0a2-531a-4784-ba02-ff01ecf7f7d6","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752300535.783,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What kind of generalizations might be possible for functors with coefficients that *cannot* fall under this framework?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"targeted_reply":"E\u2217\u200b(X):=\u03c0\u2217\u200b(QE\u2297LQX)","request_id":"95de5e71db08f8f4-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"af9a9c3b-43d9-4584-b4f4-dcdd6b18b66e","children":["6e1615dd-0726-4dd0-b63b-969446c50218"]},"6e1615dd-0726-4dd0-b63b-969446c50218":{"id":"6e1615dd-0726-4dd0-b63b-969446c50218","message":{"id":"6e1615dd-0726-4dd0-b63b-969446c50218","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752300537.078485,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"95de5e71db08f8f4-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"991be0a2-531a-4784-ba02-ff01ecf7f7d6","children":["f89ce364-b807-4f1e-b68c-4b83ab87c0ab"]},"f89ce364-b807-4f1e-b68c-4b83ab87c0ab":{"id":"f89ce364-b807-4f1e-b68c-4b83ab87c0ab","message":{"id":"f89ce364-b807-4f1e-b68c-4b83ab87c0ab","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752300548.953521,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring alternative frameworks","content":"User\u2019s question is about generalizations for functors with coefficients that don't fit into the E\u2297^L X framework, since it requires the coefficients to follow specific conditions in stable monoidal categories.
