Exporting WhatsApp Messages:**\n\n*For Android:*\n\n\ue203- Open WhatsApp and navigate to the chat you wish to export.\n- Tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner.\n- Select **More** > **Export Chat**.\n- Choose whether to include media files or not.\n- Select a method to share the exported chat (e.g., email it to yourself).\ue204\n\n*For iOS:*\n\n\ue203- Open WhatsApp and go to the desired chat.\n- Tap the contact's name at the top.\n- Scroll down and select **Export Chat**.\n- Choose to attach media or not.\n- Select a method to share the exported chat (e.g., email it to yourself).\ue204\n\n\ue203The exported chat will be in a `.txt` format, with messages ordered from oldest to newest.\ue204\n\n**2. Preparing the Data for LLM Processing:**\n\n\ue203Since the exported chat is in plain text, you can process it using Python to reverse the order of messages and search for keywords related to payments or fees.\ue204\n\n**3. Implementing the Search Using an LLM:**\n\n\ue203You can use a pre-trained LLM, such as OpenAI's GPT, to analyze the chat data. Here's an example using Python:\ue204\n\n\ue203```python\nimport openai\n\n# Replace with your OpenAI API key\nopenai.api_key = 'your-api-key'\n\ndef search_payment_messages(chat_file):\n    with open(chat_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        messages = file.readlines()\n\n    # Reverse the messages to start from the most recent\n    messages.reverse()\n\n    # Combine messages into a single string\n    chat_history = ''.join(messages)\n\n    # Define the prompt for the LLM\n    prompt = (\n        \"Identify and list all messages related to payments or fees in the following chat history:\\n\\n\"\n        f\"{chat_history}\\n\\n\"\n        \"List the messages in reverse chronological order.\"\n    )\n\n    # Call the OpenAI API\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine='text-davinci-003',\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=1500,\n        temperature=0.5,\n    )\n\n    # Print the LLM's response\n    print(response.choices[0].text.strip())\n\n# Example usage\nsearch_payment_messages('path_to_exported_chat.txt')\n```\ue204\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\ue203- Ensure you have the OpenAI Python package installed (`pip install openai`).\ue204\n\ue203- Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API key.\ue204\n\ue203- Replace `'path_to_exported_chat.txt'` with the path to your exported WhatsApp chat file.\ue204\n\n\ue203This script reads the exported chat, reverses the message order, and uses the LLM to identify messages related to payments or fees, listing them from the most recent.\ue204\n\n**4. Alternative Approach:**\n\n\ue203If you prefer not to use an LLM, you can implement keyword-based filtering:\ue204\n\n\ue203```python\ndef filter_payment_messages(chat_file):\n    keywords = ['payment', 'fee', 'paid', 'amount', 'transaction']\n    with open(chat_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        messages = file.readlines()\n\n    # Reverse the messages to start from the most recent\n    messages.reverse()\n\n    # Filter messages containing any of the keywords\n    payment_messages = [\n        msg for msg in messages if any(keyword in msg.lower() for keyword in keywords)\n    ]\n\n    # Print the filtered messages\n    for message in payment_messages:\n        print(message.strip())\n\n# Example usage\nfilter_payment_messages('path_to_exported_chat.txt')\n```\ue204\n\n\ue203This script filters and displays messages containing keywords related to payments or fees, starting from the most recent.\ue204\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n\ue203- **Privacy:** Ensure you handle personal data responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations.\ue204\n\ue203- **Data Security:** Be cautious when exporting and processing sensitive information.\ue204\n\ue203- **LLM Limitations:** While LLMs can provide valuable insights, they may not always be accurate. Use them as a tool, not an absolute authority.\ue204\n\n\ue203By following these steps, you can effectively export your WhatsApp messages and utilize an LLM or keyword-based filtering to identify messages related to payments or fees, starting from the most recent.\ue204 "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_source":"composer_search","client_reported_search_source":"conversation_composer_web_icon","search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"androidpolice.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-export-messages-tutorial/","title":"How to export WhatsApp messages - Android Police","snippet":"Before exporting WhatsApp messages, learn about the current limitations.
