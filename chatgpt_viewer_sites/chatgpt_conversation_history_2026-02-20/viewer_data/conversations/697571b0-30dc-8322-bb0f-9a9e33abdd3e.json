Multiple WSL windows are just multiple Linux processes (often inside the same WSL2 \u201cutility VM\u201d for that distro). Running different coding agents in parallel is a normal workload pattern.\n\nWhere it can go wrong is less \u201cWSL crashes\u201d and more \u201cyour agents step on each other\u201d or \u201cyour machine thrashes.\u201d\n\n## What\u2019s safe\n- **Different folders / different repos**: Usually fine.\n- **Multiple terminals in the same distro**: Fine; they share the same filesystem and process space, like any Linux machine.\n- **Multiple distros** (Ubuntu + Debian etc.): Also fine; more isolation.\n\n## The real risks (and how to avoid them)\n\n### 1) Resource contention (CPU/RAM/disk) \u2192 slowdowns / OOM kills\nAgents can be heavy (LLM + builds + package installs + tests).\n- Cap WSL2 resources via `C:\\Users\\<you>\\.wslconfig` (memory/cores).\n- If needed, run one agent with lower priority: `nice -n 10 <cmd>`.\n\n### 2) Port collisions\nIf two agents start dev servers on the same port (e.g., 3000, 5173, 8000), one fails or binds unexpectedly.\n- Assign unique ports per agent/project (or export `PORT=...`).\n\n### 3) Git / repo collisions (the big one)\nIf two agents touch the **same git working tree** (same `.git`), you can get:\n- merge conflicts, index.lock issues, half-written files, confusing diffs.\nBest practice:\n- **One agent per clone** (separate directories, separate `.git`), or at least separate branches *and* avoid simultaneous operations that rewrite lots of files.\n\n### 4) Shared environment/caches causing weirdness\nExamples: `pip`/`npm` running concurrently, shared `~/.cache`, shared virtualenvs, shared `node_modules`.\n- Use **separate Python virtual environments** per project.\n- Avoid sharing `node_modules` between projects.\n- Don\u2019t let two agents install/update dependencies in the same environment at once.\n\n### 5) Working on `/mnt/c` (Windows filesystem) can be painful\nNot unsafe, but more prone to:\n- Slow I/O, file watcher glitches, antivirus interference, odd locking.\nRecommendation:\n- Keep active dev repos **inside the Linux filesystem** (`~/projects/...`) for best reliability/performance.\n\n## If you want \u201chard isolation\u201d\nIf you\u2019re running agents you don\u2019t fully trust or you want to eliminate cross-talk:\n- Create **separate WSL distros** (clone/import a distro per agent), or\n- Run each agent inside **containers** (Docker/Podman) within WSL.\n\n## Practical rule of thumb\n- \u2705 Safe: multiple agents in **separate repo clones**, separate envs, different ports  \n- \u26a0\ufe0f Risky: multiple agents editing the **same repo working tree** or sharing the **same venv/node_modules**\n\nIf you tell me what agents you\u2019re running (Codex CLI / Claude Code / etc.) and whether they build/run servers/tests automatically, I can give you a tight \u201cparallel workflow\u201d layout (folder structure + env + port conventions) that minimizes

Heavier, slower to start, more isolated.\n- **Container**: isolates processes using the **same host kernel** (on Linux, via kernel features like namespaces and control groups). Much lighter, starts fast, uses fewer resources.\n\nOn **Windows/macOS**, Docker typically runs Linux containers inside a small Linux VM behind the scenes (often via **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)** on Windows).\n\n## Core concepts you should know\n- **Image**: an immutable \u201ctemplate\u201d containing a filesystem snapshot + metadata (what command to run, environment, etc.).\n- **Container**: a running instance of an image (with a writable \u201ctop layer\u201d).\n- **Registry**: where images live (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).\n- **Dockerfile**: a recipe to build an image (steps like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`).\n- **Layering**: each Dockerfile step creates a layer; cached layers make rebuilds faster.\n- **Volume / bind mount**:\n  - **Volume**: Docker-managed persistent storage.\n  - **Bind mount**: map a host directory into the container (common for local dev).\n\n## Why people use Docker\n- **Reproducible dev environments**: \u201cworks on my machine\u201d becomes rarer.\n- **Clean dependency isolation**: different projects can use conflicting versions safely.\n- **Easy CI/CD** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): build once, run anywhere.\n- **Service composition**: run app + database + cache together.\n\nFor your earlier use-case (multiple agents in parallel): Docker can give you *harder isolation* than separate folders in WSL, especially if agents install system packages or run servers.\n\n## The tradeoffs (don\u2019t ignore these)\n- **Not a security sandbox by default**: containers share a kernel; misconfigurations matter.\n- **State management**: containers are meant to be disposable; persistent data needs volumes.\n- **Networking/ports**: you must manage port conflicts when running many services.\n- **File performance on Windows**: bind-mounting from the Windows filesystem can be slower; keeping code inside the Linux filesystem is usually smoother.\n\n## A minimal mental model of how you work with Docker\n1) Write a `Dockerfile` (defines how to build the environment)\n2) `docker build` to create an image\n3) `docker run` to start a container from that image\n4) Use mounts for your code/data, publish ports for web servers\n\n### Tiny command cheat sheet\n```bash\ndocker pull ubuntu\ndocker run -it --rm ubuntu bash     # interactive shell, auto-remove on exit\n\ndocker build -t myapp:dev .\ndocker run --rm -p 8000:8000 myapp:dev\n\ndocker ps                           # running containers\ndocker logs <name-or-id>\ndocker exec -it <name-or-id> bash   # get a shell inside\n```\n\n## Docker Compose: multi-service projects\nWhen you need app + database + cache:\n- **Docker Compose** uses a `compose.yaml` to declare services and run them together:\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\ndocker compose logs -f\ndocker compose down\n```\n\n## How Docker fits with WSL on Windows\nCommon setups:\n- **Docker Desktop + WSL2 backend**: easiest; integrates Windows + WSL nicely.\n- **Docker Engine inside WSL**: workable, but you manage more yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re running multiple agents, Docker lets you:\n- pin each agent to a specific toolchain image,\n- avoid cross-project dependency pollution,\n- run each agent with its own ports/volumes.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what you want Docker *for* (dev environment for Python/Node, isolating coding agents, deploying a web app, running databases locally, etc.), I\u2019ll map it to the right Docker pattern (single Dockerfile vs Compose, volumes vs bind mounts, and a clean folder layout)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9856bd53-b443-48db-a9aa-c1cc3228b7c6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"a96cbacd-721b-4dad-bf14-036ff88c2517","turn_exchange_id":"a1af5284-2346-43a9-ae46-b426cf1c965c","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"a96cbacd-721b-4dad-bf14-036ff88c2517","children":[]}}}
