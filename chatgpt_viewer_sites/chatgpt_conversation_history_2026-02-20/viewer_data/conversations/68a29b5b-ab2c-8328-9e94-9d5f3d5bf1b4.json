According to anonymous sources, these tracking devices are targeted rather than widespread, inserted into high-risk shipments by U.S. export enforcement agents, sometimes without court orders. Images and videos reportedly show trackers removed from Dell and Super Micro servers.\n\nThe controversy arises amid U.S. efforts to restrict the flow of advanced AI chips to China, citing national security concerns over the dual-use nature of such technologies. Despite restrictions and bans\u2014such as those imposed on Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308\u2014smuggling persists, fueling a robust black market for these chips. In response, U.S. companies like Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of sales revenue with the government in exchange for export licenses.\n\nMeanwhile, a legislative proposal to embed permanent geo-tracking in chips has raised cybersecurity concerns. Nvidia opposes the measure, warning it could create vulnerabilities.

This covert law enforcement tactic aims to enforce U.S. export restrictions on AI technologies and is primarily conducted through the Department of Commerce, with support from Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI. Trackers have reportedly been hidden in shipments from companies like Dell and Super Micro containing Nvidia and AMD chips, in some cases being placed within server components themselves.\n\nThese efforts are designed to prevent U.S.-made chips from being used in China\u2019s military modernization, with similar restrictions also applied to Russia. While multiple governments and company sources declined to comment, insiders confirmed that tracking has become a known risk among resellers, with some actively inspecting for the devices. The use of such trackers dates back decades, and in this context, serves as a tool to support legal cases against smuggling operations.

In exchange, Nvidia agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from these sales. Trump claimed the decision did not compromise national security because the H20 chip is \"obsolete.\" He emphasized that more advanced chips, like Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell, would not be sold to China unless degraded to prevent national security risks.\n\nThe arrangement sparked legal and ethical concerns from former officials, including Chris Padilla and Peter Harrell, who suggested it might violate the U.S. Export Control Reform Act and the constitutional ban on export taxes. Critics argue the deal undermines the purpose of export controls meant to prevent military technology transfers and sets a dangerous precedent by monetizing U.S. trade policy. Nvidia stated it follows U.S. regulations and aims to ensure American competitiveness globally. The Trump administration had earlier banned the H20 chip's export, but reversed the decision amid trade negotiations with China.

The U.S. Constitution and the Export Control Reform Act restrict the imposition of export-related fees, forcing the administration to consider alternative legal mechanisms. These may include targeting foreign-manufactured chips or framing the fee as a means to fund U.S. advancements in science and technology. Although the deal\u2019s text remains undisclosed, analysts estimate the government could generate billions in revenue, given the high Chinese demand for Nvidia's H20 chip\u2014even though it was banned for export after April 2025.\n\nHowever, the plan faces criticism from national security advocates and lawmakers who argue it risks aiding China\u2019s AI and military development, prioritizing profits over strategic security.

Led by Alan Estevez, under secretary of commerce for industry and security, the administration coordinated a sweeping export control policy in October 2022 to restrict China\u2019s acquisition of high-performance chips and semiconductor fabrication tools essential for developing advanced AI. This strategy was backed by key White House officials like Tarun Chhabra and Jason Matheny, who viewed AI as a transformative technology with profound implications for national security. The policy took cues from earlier Trump-era efforts, especially actions against Huawei, and expanded upon them with novel and broader measures.\n\nDriven by fears that China could gain a strategic edge in AI capabilities\u2014including potential artificial general intelligence\u2014the administration overcame internal disagreements and international diplomacy challenges, eventually securing cooperation from allies in the Netherlands and Japan. Despite concerns about economic repercussions and Chinese retaliation, the administration pressed forward, viewing the move as essential for U.S. technological dominance and security. However, subsequent shifts under a Trump administration, including easing some restrictions amid corporate lobbying, have sparked criticism and uncertainty about the continuity of this high-stakes tech strategy.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755198798.126,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/c06e20d9c3418f1d0b1292891c4610c6","title":"US will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under a new, unusual agreement","snippet":"Nvidia and AMD have reached an unusual agreement with the U.S. government to share 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal comes after the Trump administration had previously halted advanced chip sales to China due to national security concerns. President Trump stated he had initially sought 20% but negotiated down to 15% thanks to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The agreement permits the sale of Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, both used in artificial intelligence development.\n\nThe deal has sparked controversy among lawmakers. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar and Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi questioned the legal basis and national security implications of what some are calling a \u201ccreative taxation scheme.\u201d Analysts like Derek Scissors from the American Enterprise Institute criticized the deal as an unofficial export tax, potentially unconstitutional and risky for national security.\n\nNvidia maintains it is following established government rules and warned of lost competitiveness and revenue from stringent export controls. The Biden administration has linked the chip sales resumption to a broader trade agreement involving rare earth magnets. The move reflects ongoing tension in the U.S.-China tech rivalry, particularly over AI development and semiconductor access.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754919359.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.omm.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.omm.com/insights/alerts-publications/biden-administration-issues-more-restrictions-on-advanced-chips-and-ai-models/","title":"Biden Administration Issues More Restrictions on Advanced Chips ...","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.omm.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bis.doc.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/policy-guidance/3434-2023-frequently-asked-questions-003-clean-for-posting/file","title":"\u201cExport Controls on Semiconductor Manufacturing Items\u201d ( ...","snippet":"The BIS press release states \u201cExpanding license requirements for semiconductor manufacturing equipment to apply to additional countries beyond the PRC and Macau ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.bis.doc.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.csis.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.csis.org/analysis/where-chips-fall-us-export-controls-under-biden-administration-2022-2024","title":"Where the Chips Fall: U.S. Export Controls Under ...","snippet":"Dec 12, 2024 \u2014 The H800 (300 GB/s) and A800 (400 GB/s) were specifically engineered to remain below the 600 GB/s interconnect speed limit while still offering ...See more","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.csis.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.stblaw.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.stblaw.com/about-us/publications/view/2025/01/15/bis-announces-worldwide-export-controls-on-advanced-chips-and-ai-models","title":"BIS Announces Worldwide Export Controls on Advanced Chips and ...","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1736971680.0,"attribution":"www.stblaw.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bis.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bis.gov/media/documents/2023.1.25-updated-faqs-oct-7-advanced-computing-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment-rule.pdf","title":"[PDF] Certain Advanced Computing and Semiconductor Manufacturing Items","snippet":"First, the rule imposes restrictive export controls on certain advanced computing semiconductor chips, transactions for supercomputer end-uses, and ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1674658097.0,"attribution":"www.bis.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bis.gov/regulations/ear/federal-register-notices","title":"Federal Register Notices","snippet":"In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 11 entities under 11 entries to the Entity ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.bis.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"exportcontrol.lbl.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://exportcontrol.lbl.gov/a-bigger-yard-a-higher-fence-understanding-biss-expanded-controls-on-advanced-computing-exports/","title":"CSET: A Bigger Yard, A Higher Fence - export control","snippet":"May 14, 2024 \u2014 Non-datacenter chips are only controlled when they meet higher performance thresholds (TPP >= 4800), and, even then, the controls are lighter.See more","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"exportcontrol.lbl.gov"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sidley.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sidley.com/en/insights/newsupdates/2025/01/new-us-export-controls-on-advanced-computing-items-and-artificial-intelligence-model-weights","title":"New U.S. Export Controls on Advanced Computing Items and ...","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1736985600.0,"attribution":"www.sidley.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.federalregister.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/05/2024-28270/foreign-produced-direct-product-rule-additions-and-refinements-to-controls-for-advanced-computing","title":"Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule Additions, and ...","snippet":"Dec 5, 2024 \u2014 ...

While not fully open source\u2014only the model weights are available\u2014this release is seen as a response to China's advances in open AI, where models like DeepSeek, Alibaba's Qwen, and Baidu's ERNIE 4.5 have gained strong traction.\n\nExperts suggest this move by OpenAI could narrow the gap between the US and China in open AI development, potentially prompting Chinese firms to accelerate their own models. Analysts note that China still leads in available open models and is focused on ecosystem integration via platforms like Alipay and WeChat.\n\nThe broader concern is that without stronger US investment in open-source AI, Chinese models could set global standards, which may impact American influence in AI development. Although other US tech firms like Meta, Google, and xAI have also released open-weight models, the transition remains partial and mostly symbolic for now. The release of GPT-oss shortly after the unveiling of Trump's \"America's AI Action Plan\" suggests political motivations may also be at play.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755253265.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ai.meta.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/","title":"Introducing Llama 3.1: Our most capable models to date","snippet":"Jul 23, 2024 \u2014 We're publicly releasing Meta Llama 3.1 405B, which we believe is the world's largest and most capable openly available foundation model.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"ai.meta.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/","title":"Introducing Meta Llama 3: The most capable openly ...","snippet":"Apr 18, 2024 \u2014 This release features pretrained and instruction-fine-tuned language models with 8B and 70B parameters that can support a broad range of use cases.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"ai.meta.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"qwenlm.github.io","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-math/","title":"Qwen2.5-Math: The world's leading open-sourced ...","snippet":"Sep 19, 2024 \u2014 Qwen2.5-Math mainly supports solving English and Chinese math problems through CoT and TIR.

Nvidia's performance far surpassed competitors like Amazon and Groq, which achieved under 300 TPS/user, while others including Google Vertex and Azure remained below 200 TPS/user.\n\nThe breakthrough was largely due to various software optimizations, including the use of TensorRT, Eagle-3 speculative decoding, FP8 data types, and advanced techniques such as Attention operations and Mixture of Experts. Further CUDA kernel optimizations like spatial partitioning and GEMM weight shuffling contributed to a fourfold performance boost.

US strike on China's chips hits semiconductor toolmakers","snippet":"The U.S. has announced its third major crackdown on China's semiconductor industry in three years, imposing stringent export restrictions on 140 Chinese companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group, and chip toolmakers Piotech and SiCarrier Technology. The move is part of an effort to hinder China's chipmaking advancement, particularly in areas critical for AI and national security. The restrictions include curbs on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and new export controls on chipmaking equipment globally. This crackdown aims to restrict China's access to chips and tools necessary for advanced technology, potentially affecting U.S. and non-U.S. companies.

Even if you assume tighter U.S. advanced-computing controls, Singapore can (i) train meaningful small language models (SLMs), (ii) fine-tune and serve open-weight LLMs to reach state-of-the-art *open-model* performance on many domain tasks, and (iii) compose capable agentic systems that mix SLMs with tuned LLM \u201cspecialists.\u201d Below I separate the policy facts from the engineering realities, then map concrete paths for each of (i)\u2013(iii).\n\n# The policy reality (and what it means in practice)\n\nTwo distinct rule sets matter:\n\n1) **Advanced-computing semiconductor (AC/S) controls.** These are the chip rules (performance density + interconnect limits) first overhauled in Oct-2023 and refined in Oct-2024. They do not ban modern NVIDIA/AMD GPUs to Singapore per se; rather, vendors must comply with thresholds and diversion controls. In practice that\u2019s why hyperscalers can offer A100/L4/L40S in Singapore, and\u2014importantly\u2014Google now lists **H100 (A3 High/Mega)** capacity in the Singapore region (asia-southeast1), albeit with quota review. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue202turn10open0\ue201\n\n2) **The (rescinded) \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d / tiered model-weights framework (Jan-2025).** You\u2019ve likely seen \u201cTier-1 / Tier-2\u201d country language. BIS announced it in January, but **rescinded it and issued compliance guidance in May-2025**. Bottom line: the touted \u201cTier-2\u201d label is not an operative constraint today; you are back to the AC/S chip rules and normal export-screening obligations. Plan accordingly, but don\u2019t over-assume a binding \u201cTier-2\u201d status. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search2\ue201\n\nOperationally for Singapore:  \n\u2022 **Available today in-region:** AWS Singapore offers A100-80GB (p4de), plus L4/L40S-class instances (G6/G6e). Google Cloud Singapore offers L4 **and** H100 via A3* SKUs (with capacity gating). This is already enough for SLM training, LoRA/QLoRA fine-tunes up to 70B, and high-throughput inference. \ue200cite\ue202turn7open0\ue202turn10open0\ue201\n\n# (i) Training small language models (SLMs) in Singapore\n\nFrom a compute-economics viewpoint, training 1\u20134B-parameter models is entirely viable on A100/L40S/L4 clusters available in Singapore.\n\nA sober way to size the job is **Chinchilla**: for compute-optimal training, target ~20 training tokens per parameter. A 2B model with ~40B tokens needs ~6\u00b7N\u00b7T \u2248 4.8\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 FLOPs. On an 8\u00d7A100-80GB node (\u22488\u00d7312 TFLOP/s BF16 peak), the **theoretical** wall-clock is ~2.2 days; with realistic efficiency you\u2019re looking at roughly one work-week. A 3B at 60\u201380B tokens is still measured in (low) weeks. These are comfortably within typical cloud budgets, provided your datastream and evaluation harness are disciplined. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search0\ue202turn14search2\ue201\n\nTwo practical levers matter more than raw TFLOPs:\n\n\u2022 **Data curation > scale.** Microsoft\u2019s **Phi-3/3.5** line showed that small models trained on aggressively filtered + synthetic curricula can rival much larger baselines on many academic tasks (e.g., 3.8B models with multi-trillion-token curricula). If you lack a trillion-token budget, you can still get outsized gains by carefully shaping a 20\u2013100B-token corpus for your domains (math/ed-tech/finance), plus staged curriculum and mixture-of-sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn15search1\ue202turn15search3\ue201\n\n\u2022 **Modern training stacks.** FSDP/ZeRO3 + BF16 on A100/L40S; tokenizer-aware packing; FlashAttention-2; mixed-context curriculum; and strict eval (held-out, task-calibrated). With L40S/RTX-6000-Ada (48 GB), you train SLMs comfortably; with A100/H100 you can scale batch/seq and cut time further. \ue200cite\ue202turn20search1\ue202turn20search0\ue201\n\n**Conclusion (i):** Training 1\u20134B SLMs *from scratch* in Singapore is feasible on currently available cloud SKUs, and cost-effective if you emphasize data quality and scaling laws. For a first serious run: 2\u20133B params, 40\u201380B tokens, sequence lengths 8\u201316k, BF16, FSDP\u2014then measure.\n\n# (ii) Fine-tune + serve open-weight LLMs to reach SOTA\n\nYou can routinely reach *state-of-the-art among open models* on targeted domains (coding, math tutoring, retrieval-QA) with **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** and modern inference engines. Three pillars:\n\n**A. Efficient fine-tuning at scale.**  \n**QLoRA** enables 4-bit base weights with LoRA adapters, proven up to 65B on a single 48 GB GPU. This is ideal for enterprise datasets that fit your use cases (e.g., SG-specific educational syllabi, finance, regulatory text). For code/maths, start with Llama-3.1-70B, Qwen-2.5-72B, or domain seeds like Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search0\ue202turn19search5\ue202turn19search2\ue201\n\n**B. High-throughput inference on commodity datacenter GPUs.**  \nUse **vLLM** (PagedAttention) or **TensorRT-LLM**. vLLM delivers 2\u20134\u00d7 throughput via KV-cache paging; TensorRT-LLM squeezes Hopper/Ada harder (FP8/FP4, inflight batching, speculative decoding). For Singapore, L4/L40S give excellent $/throughput; A100/H100 raise concurrency ceilings. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search1\ue202turn16search5\ue202turn17search0\ue201\n\n**C. Quantization without wrecking quality.**  \n**AWQ** and **GPTQ** (4-bit) let you serve 70B models on 48 GB with acceptable context (KV-cache dominates long prompts\u2014account for it). Combine with vLLM/TensorRT-LLM for stable latency under load. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search2\ue202turn16search3\ue201\n\n**What \u201cSOTA\u201d means here.**  \nIf you mean *global* SOTA (frontier closed models) across *all* domains, that\u2019s unrealistic without frontier-scale pretraining + RL. But for **applied domains**, open-weight models\u2014properly fine-tuned and retrieval-augmented\u2014*do* top public leaderboards and/or match proprietary systems on many benchmarks (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B on code suites; Llama-3.1-70B as a strong generalist base). Build per-domain heads, not a single omnibus model. \ue200cite\ue202turn19search0\ue202turn19search2\ue202turn19search5\ue201\n\n**Conclusion (ii):** With QLoRA, AWQ/GPTQ, and vLLM/TensorRT-LLM on L40S/A100/H100 in Singapore, *domain-specific* SOTA (open-model class) is fully achievable.\n\n# (iii) Mixing SLMs + tuned LLMs for agentic systems\n\nThis is where you can punch above your weight. A robust pattern is **small-controller, big-solver**:\n\n\u2022 **Planner/Router (SLM).** A 1\u20133B SLM (your own trained or Phi-class) does intent classification, tool selection, and triage. It\u2019s cheap, fast, and lives close to your APIs. Evidence suggests well-tuned SLMs route competently when given clear JSON schemas and few-shot traces. \ue200cite\ue202turn15search1\ue201\n\n\u2022 **Specialists (fine-tuned LLMs).** Bring 8\u201370B open-weights for the heavy reasoning/coding/math legs, each fine-tuned on narrow corpora (e.g., MOE math, SG regulatory text, school-syllabus pedagogy, bank policy). Serve via vLLM/TensorRT-LLM with tool-calling enabled. Llama-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 families natively support function/tool calling; vLLM exposes OpenAI-style tool schemas. \ue200cite\ue202turn18search3\ue202turn18search4\ue202turn18search10\ue201\n\n\u2022 **Orchestration.** Use **LangGraph** (graph-based stateful workflows), which is well-suited to multi-agent reliability (checkpoints/guardrails/rollbacks). Alternatives include AutoGen or CrewAI, but LangGraph\u2019s formal state machine makes debugging easier at production scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201\n\n\u2022 **Retrieval + tools.** Back every agent with retrieval (FAISS/pgvector/Milvus), structured tools (JSON-schema), and cheap verifiers (SLM/regex/parsers). Keep the KV cache hot; add speculative decoding for burst relief. TensorRT-LLM and vLLM both support the necessary serving primitives. \ue200cite\ue202turn17search0\ue202turn16search1\ue201\n\n**Conclusion (iii):** Yes\u2014SLMs + tuned open LLMs are a proven recipe for cost-efficient, performant agentic systems that you can deploy on Singapore-region clouds without violating chip controls.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete, compliant build paths for Singapore (actionable)\n\n**A. SLM from scratch (2\u20133B)**\n1) **Infra:** 1\u20132\u00d7 nodes of 8\u00d7A100-80GB (AWS p4de, SG region) or L40S/L4 clusters (AWS G6/G6e; GCP L4). For faster turns, request H100 capacity on GCP A3-High/Mega in asia-southeast1. \ue200cite\ue202turn7open0\ue202turn10open0\ue201  \n2) **Recipe:** Chinchilla-ratio tokens; FlashAttention-2; FSDP/ZeRO3; eval harness; curriculum with filtered + synthetic data (Phi-style). \ue200cite\ue202turn13search0\ue202turn15search1\ue201\n\n**B. Domain SOTA with open weights**  \nStart from **Llama-3.1-70B** or **Qwen-2.5-72B/-Coder-32B**. Fine-tune with **QLoRA**; quantize with **AWQ**; serve via **vLLM** or **TensorRT-LLM**. Expect top-tier results on coding/math/finance QA when paired with RAG and tool-calling. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search0\ue202turn16search2\ue202turn16search1\ue202turn19search5\ue202turn19search2\ue201\n\n**C. Agentic system**\nUse **LangGraph** for orchestration; SLM router; LLM specialists; strict schemas; deterministic tools; and per-edge verifier agents. This architecture is hardware-agnostic and stays inside Singapore compliance envelopes. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Red flags and realistic limits\n\n\u2022 **\u201cTier-2 Singapore\u201d** isn\u2019t a current, binding BIS category. The January 2025 tiered framework was **rescinded** in May 2025; your constraints are the AC/S chip rules and standard diversion checks. Don\u2019t self-sabotage by assuming you can\u2019t access capable GPUs locally\u2014you can. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search2\ue202turn10open0\ue201\n\n\u2022 **Global frontier SOTA across *all* domains** is not reachable without frontier-scale pretraining and RL-HF. Define SOTA per-domain (and per metric), and you\u2019ll hit it with open weights plus good data and serving. \ue200cite\ue202turn19search0\ue202turn19search5\ue201\n\n\u2022 **Memory & context are your real serving limiters.** 4-bit 70B will \u201cfit\u201d on 48 GB, but long contexts explode KV-cache. Plan for tensor/kv sharding or multi-GPU for long-context workloads. vLLM\u2019s paging helps, but physics wins. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n(i) **Yes**, SLM training (1\u20134B) is straightforward in Singapore with today\u2019s cloud SKUs if you follow Chinchilla-style scaling and Phi-style data curation. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search0\ue202turn15search1\ue201\n\n(ii) **Yes**, you can hit *open-model* SOTA on specific domains via QLoRA fine-tunes and modern inference (vLLM/TensorRT-LLM) on A100/L40S/H100 in Singapore. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search0\ue202turn16search1\ue201\n\n(iii) **Yes**, combining SLM controllers with tuned LLM specialists is the most capital-efficient way to deploy robust agentic systems locally; use LangGraph + tool-calling + RAG. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search0\ue202turn18search4\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can sketch a concrete 8-week plan with bill-of-materials (instances, datasets, evals, and a LangGraph diagram) tuned for math/ed-tech and SG finance."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue202turn10open0\ue201","start_idx":1075,"end_idx":1107,"safe_urls":["https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/15/2025-ai-diffusion-export-controls-microsoft-regulatory-capture-oracle-tears/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/15/2025-ai-diffusion-export-controls-microsoft-regulatory-capture-oracle-tears/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"2025 AI Diffusion Export Controls \u2013 Microsoft Regulatory ...","url":"https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/15/2025-ai-diffusion-export-controls-microsoft-regulatory-capture-oracle-tears/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1736930625.0,"snippet":"Jan 15, 2025 \u2014 For UVEUs, the key restrictions are as follows: at least 75% of total AI computing power in Tier 1 countries, no more than 7% in any individual ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"SemiAnalysis"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn12search2\ue201","start_idx":1562,"end_idx":1582,"safe_urls":["https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/bis-rescinds-its-ai-diffusion-rule-and-issues-compliance-guidance-regarding-advanced-computing-items?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Akin - Akin, an Elite Global Law Firm](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/bis-rescinds-its-ai-diffusion-rule-and-issues-compliance-guidance-regarding-advanced-computing-items?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"BIS Rescinds Its AI Diffusion Rule and Issues Compliance ...","url":"https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/bis-rescinds-its-ai-diffusion-rule-and-issues-compliance-guidance-regarding-advanced-computing-items?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"May 21, 2025 \u2014 BIS did not announce any plans to change the pre-existing controls over advanced computing items, which, for example, require licenses to ship ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Akin - Akin, an Elite Global Law Firm"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7open0\ue202turn10open0\ue201","start_idx":1914,"end_idx":1943,"safe_urls":[],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":true},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13search0\ue202turn14search2\ue201","start_idx":2653,"end_idx":2687,"safe_urls":["https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([NVIDIA Images](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU Architecture","url":"https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1598381342.0,"snippet":"\u25cb BF16 Tensor Core instructions at the same throughput as FP16.
