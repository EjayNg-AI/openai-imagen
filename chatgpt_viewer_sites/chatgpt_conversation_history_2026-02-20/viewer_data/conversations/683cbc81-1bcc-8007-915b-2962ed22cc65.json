Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has recently provided several insights into the future of AI, the development of GPT-5, and broader technological initiatives.\ue204 Here is a comprehensive overview of his latest remarks and activities:\ue206\n\n---\n\n## GPT-5: Capabilities and Release Timeline\n\n\ue203Altman has indicated that GPT-5 will represent a significant advancement over GPT-4, focusing on enhanced reasoning, multimodal integration, and personalization.\ue204 Key anticipated features include:\ue206\n\n- **Unified Reasoning Engine**: \ue203Combining rapid intuitive responses with structured chain-of-thought logic, eliminating the need for users to select between different model types.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Advanced Multimodality**: \ue203Seamless integration of text, image, and voice inputs and outputs within a single interface, allowing the model to autonomously decide when to utilize tools such as web search, code execution, or image generation.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Long-Term Memory and Personalization**: \ue203The ability to remember previous interactions (with user consent), adapt to user preferences, and maintain context over extended conversations.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Expanded Context Window**: \ue203A substantial increase in the model's context window, with the API version potentially supporting over 256,000 tokens, facilitating more extensive and coherent interactions.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203The public release of GPT-5 is anticipated between Q3 and early Q4 of 2025.\ue204 \ue203Altman has emphasized that the delay from earlier projections is due to the goal of delivering a more robust and capable model than initially planned.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n## Vision for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\n\n\ue203In his blog post \"Reflections,\" Altman expressed confidence in OpenAI's understanding of how to build AGI, as traditionally defined.\ue204 \ue203He envisions the emergence of AI agents capable of significantly enhancing productivity across various industries by 2025.\ue204 \ue203Altman also highlighted the potential of superintelligent tools to accelerate scientific discovery and innovation, emphasizing the importance of iterative deployment and societal adaptation to ensure safety and alignment.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n## Hardware Collaboration with Jony Ive\n\n\ue203OpenAI has partnered with renowned designer Jony Ive to develop a new AI device aimed at reducing screen dependency.\ue204 \ue203This device is envisioned as a \"third device,\" distinct from smartphones and wearables, potentially featuring environmental awareness capabilities through integrated microphones and cameras, but without a traditional screen.\ue204 \ue203Altman aims for a rapid and widespread adoption, targeting the shipment of 100 million units.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news15\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Stance and AI Governance\n\n\ue203Altman's position on AI regulation has evolved in response to changing political landscapes.\ue204 \ue203While he previously advocated for stringent AI oversight, recent shifts, including the re-election of Donald Trump and a deregulatory agenda, have led to a more flexible approach.\ue204 \ue203Altman now emphasizes the importance of maintaining U.S. competitiveness in AI development, suggesting that overregulation could hinder innovation and economic growth.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news17\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n## Engagement with Policymakers\n\n\ue203On May 8, 2025, Altman testified before the U.S. Senate alongside executives from Microsoft, AMD, and CoreWeave, discussing the transformative potential of AI and the importance of strategic investments to maintain U.S. leadership in the field.\ue204 \ue203Key topics included cybersecurity, data privacy, energy infrastructure, and international competition, particularly with China.\ue204 \ue203Altman highlighted OpenAI's efforts to address the energy demands of AI through the development of a massive new data center in Texas.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news25\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n## Perspectives on Humanoid Robotics\n\n\ue203In a recent interview, Altman cautioned that society is unprepared for the imminent integration of humanoid robots into daily life.\ue204 \ue203He noted that the presence of such robots performing tasks in public spaces could soon become commonplace, likening it to a \"sci-fi\" scenario.\ue204 \ue203Altman emphasized the need for transparency and proactive measures to address the societal impacts of this technological shift.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news28\ue201\ue206\n\n---\n\n\ue203For a more in-depth understanding of Sam Altman's views on the future of AI, you may find the following interview

Reflecting on the unintended negative impacts of smartphones, particularly on youth attention spans, Ive aims to offer a transformative alternative. The yet-unnamed device is not meant to replace smartphones, but to function as a complementary \"third device\" that is aware of its user's environment, likely featuring a microphone and camera but no screen. Prototype designs suggest it could resemble a compact iPod Shuffle and connect with other devices.\n\nAltman is ambitious about the project, aiming to ship 100 million units faster than any previous tech launch. Their endeavor follows past failures in the standalone AI device market, such as Humane\u2019s AI Pin, which flopped due to technical flaws. Despite competition from companies like Meta, Apple, and Google, which are exploring AI-enhanced wearables, skeptics question whether Ive and Altman's non-wearable solution can succeed.

Initially, Altman, representing the AI industry's collective stance, advocated for governmental oversight to ensure responsible development. However, by 2025, calls for strict regulation have waned. The re-election of Donald Trump ushered in a deregulatory agenda prioritizing U.S. dominance in the global AI race, especially against China. Trump\u2019s administration, echoing venture capitalist Marc Andreessen\u2019s views, now views overregulation as economically harmful and potentially lethal to innovation. This shift has encouraged leading AI companies like OpenAI and Microsoft to seek minimal rules, focusing instead on growth and exploiting flexible interpretations of intellectual property. Efforts by states or the European Union to impose stricter guidelines are being resisted nationally under the guise of fostering innovation and economic competition. Despite some dissenters like Anthropic still advocating for robust preventive measures against AI risks, the prevailing U.S. strategy emphasizes accelerating development to maintain geopolitical supremacy, often at the expense of safety, transparency, and accountability.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":17}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":3149,"end_idx":3150,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How the Loudest Voices in AI Went From 'Regulate Us' to 'Unleash Us'","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-sam-altman-ai-regulation-trump?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1748613600.0,"snippet":"How the Loudest Voices in AI Went From \u2018Regulate Us\u2019 to \u2018Unleash Us\u2019 Date: Fri May 30 14:00:00 2025 UTC  On May 16, 2023, Sam Altman appeared before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary.

This infusion raises OpenAI\u2019s valuation to an unprecedented $300 billion, nearly doubling its value from last October. The funding will accelerate AI research, expand compute infrastructure, and enhance tools for ChatGPT\u2019s 500 million weekly users. Additionally, Altman revealed plans to introduce OpenAI\u2019s first open-weight language model since GPT-2, offering advanced reasoning capabilities. Unlike fully open-source models, open-weight models share pre-trained parameters but keep training code and data confidential. Altman also criticized Meta's restrictive use of its Llama 2 model for services exceeding 700 million active users. OpenAI's move signals a potential shift towards more open AI development, amid internal debates and competition with fully open-source alternatives like DeepSeek's AI model R1.

GPT-5 and core R-&-D roadmap  \n| Milestone | Original window | Current outlook | Evidence |  \n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|  \n| **Pre-training start** | early-2025 | Pushed to late-Q2 2025 after CoreWeave GPU contract (250k Nvidia GPUs) closed \ue200cite\ue202turn2search16\ue201 | Compute now adequate for first pass.  \n| **Model-picker retirement (merge of GPT & O-series)** | mid-2025 | Still planned; Altman calls GPT-4.5 the \u201clast model without full chain-of-thought\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2search16\ue201 |  \n| **Public release** | \u201csummer 2024\u201d (old BI rumour) \u2192 \u201cend-2024\u201d \u2192 Q3-Q4 2025 | Altman\u2019s May comments: launch \u201cin months, not weeks,\u201d contingent on Stargate power ramp \ue200cite\ue202turn8news10\ue201 |  \n| **Key upgrades** | unified reasoning engine; 256k+ context; multimodal I/O; persistent user memory \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue201 | Those features remain the public promise; no change announced.  \n\n**Reality check:** GPT-4.5 (Orion) and GPT-4.1 shipped on time, showing the research pipeline is healthy.  But GPT-5\u2019s compute budget is an order of magnitude larger, and without at least one U.S. Stargate campus online, sustained training runs will bottleneck on cloud capacity\u2014even with the CoreWeave deal.  \n\n## 5. Other strategic bets  \n* **Custom silicon** with Broadcom (3 nm, 2026) aims to cut Nvidia dependency \ue200cite\ue202turn2search16\ue201.  \n* **Consumer hardware (\u201cio\u201d acquisition, $6.5 bn)** brings Jony Ive in-house for an AI-native device; a prototype is reportedly in design review \ue200cite\ue202turn2news11\ue201.  \n* **Enterprise agents**: SoftBank\u2019s \u201cCristal\u201d JV in Japan will field-test agentic workflows at scale \ue200cite\ue202turn6search18\ue201.  \n\n## 6. Are they on track?  \n| Pillar | Status | Outlook |  \n|--------|--------|---------|  \n| **Capital** | ~$50 bn committed; runway through 2026 if tranches arrive | Adequate but vulnerable to SoftBank/Microsoft conditions.  \n| **Compute infrastructure** | Stargate U.S. behind; UAE cluster on schedule | Core gating factor; any further tariff or power-grid delays push GPT-5 past 2025.  \n| **Research cadence** | GPT-4.1 & 4.5 shipped; agents and tools proliferate | Strong; blocked mainly by compute, not ideas.  \n| **Governance** | PBC compromise calmed critics, but IPO timeline now 2027+ | Still messy but improving.  \n| **Competitive position** | Still ahead on model quality; DeepSeek-R1 shows cost pressure | Must deliver GPT-5 before open-weight rivals narrow the gap.  \n\n### Bottom line  \nOpenAI has the money, talent and near-term GPU leases to finish GPT-5\u2019s training, **but** the grand Stargate infrastructure is slipping and SoftBank\u2019s cash is slower than advertised.  Unless at least one large-scale data-centre phase is operational by early-2026, GPT-5\u2019s debut\u2014and by extension OpenAI\u2019s lead\u2014could slide into 2026.

Stargate UAE will launch a 1-GW AI cluster and aims to make the UAE the first country to implement ChatGPT nationwide. G42 is expected to invest equally in OpenAI's U.S. Stargate platform and may join SoftBank's $40 billion investment. Other partners include Oracle, Cisco, and Nvidia. The io deal is effectively an acqui-hire of a 55-person team, supporting OpenAI\u2019s ambitions to create consumer AI devices.\n\nIn other major news, AT&T will acquire Lumen\u2019s consumer fiber business for $5.75 billion, continuing a trend of U.S. telecom consolidations.\n\nNoteworthy venture deals include LMArena ($100M), Siro ($50M), and Slash ($41M), covering startups in AI, fintech, and enterprise software. Private equity investments include Ardian's acquisition of MasterGrid and McNally Capital's acquisition of Quiet Professionals.\n\nPublic offerings saw Hinge Health raise $437M and MNTN raise $187M. M&A deals featured Honeywell\u2019s \u00a31.8B acquisition of Johnson Matthey\u2019s unit and Sanofi\u2019s $600M acquisition of Vigil Neuroscience.
