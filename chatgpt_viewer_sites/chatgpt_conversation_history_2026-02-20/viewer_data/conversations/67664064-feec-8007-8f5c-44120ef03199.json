You might want to check any \u201cdisk cleanup\u201d or system-optimization tools you may have run.\n\nHopefully one of these approaches helps you locate your large Llama 2 file\u2014or confirm that it\u2019s truly gone. If it\u2019s nowhere to be found, you might have to re-download it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"c1bb90a1-c66b-43b0-a11e-fde1953517af","request_id":"8f550a164f12fd87-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c1bb90a1-c66b-43b0-a11e-fde1953517af","children":[]}}}
