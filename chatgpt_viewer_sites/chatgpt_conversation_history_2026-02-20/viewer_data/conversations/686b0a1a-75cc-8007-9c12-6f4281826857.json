However, the process can affect the meat's texture and flavor due to moisture loss. The USDA recommends refreezing meat if it has been thawed in the refrigerator. Thawing methods such as using a microwave or cold water require the meat to be cooked immediately and not refrozen. Meat thawed in the refrigerator should be used or refrozen within three to five days. Meat left at room temperature for more than two hours, or defrosted in hot water, should not be refrozen due to food safety concerns.

I'll refer to SFA guidelines on thawing and see if I can find more details to back up the explanation.","chunks":[],"finished":true}],"source_analysis_msg_id":"bd9f0aec-e116-49a2-82c1-3ce5ebdd2101"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"f4fe7857-97bf-45b3-8ca5-70bfd6988060","request_id":"95b2f6c43a126bc1-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f4fe7857-97bf-45b3-8ca5-70bfd6988060","children":["b8d5cc2c-9b3c-420f-b23c-e7a76cf0aa81"]},"b8d5cc2c-9b3c-420f-b23c-e7a76cf0aa81":{"id":"b8d5cc2c-9b3c-420f-b23c-e7a76cf0aa81","message":{"id":"b8d5cc2c-9b3c-420f-b23c-e7a76cf0aa81","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751845454.507043,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"open\": [\n    {\n      \"ref_id\": \"turn0search1\",\n      \"lineno\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"65724097-6b76-4ef4-a959-d84dee853a8e","request_id":"95b2f6c43a126bc1-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"65724097-6b76-4ef4-a959-d84dee853a8e","children":["a0c124ec-b4aa-409c-a077-1874b0614152"]},"a0c124ec-b4aa-409c-a077-1874b0614152":{"id":"a0c124ec-b4aa-409c-a077-1874b0614152","message":{"id":"a0c124ec-b4aa-409c-a077-1874b0614152","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1751845457.6113794,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sfa.gov.sg","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sfa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/food-retail/guidelines-on-thawing-of-food.pdf","title":"","snippet":"Total lines: 10\n","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.sfa.gov.sg"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686b0a2319a080078fb9d8fd58511472","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"b8d5cc2c-9b3c-420f-b23c-e7a76cf0aa81","request_id":"95b2f6c43a126bc1-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b8d5cc2c-9b3c-420f-b23c-e7a76cf0aa81","children":["5f2c69df-7880-4cd4-9908-efac57bf64db"]},"5f2c69df-7880-4cd4-9908-efac57bf64db":{"id":"5f2c69df-7880-4cd4-9908-efac57bf64db","message":{"id":"5f2c69df-7880-4cd4-9908-efac57bf64db","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751845459.848553,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Summarizing citations","content":"The Cold Food Storage Chart suggests that food is safe for 3-5 days (website).

Experts suggest that any cut of steak can be frozen, but fattier and larger cuts like ribeye and chuck roast retain moisture and texture better than leaner ones. Packaging plays a vital role: vacuum sealing with a moisture-absorbing pad helps prevent freezer burn and extends shelf life. Frozen steak remains safe indefinitely, though for optimal freshness, it\u2019s best to use it within one to two months. Steaks should be frozen promptly after purchase and defrosted slowly in the refrigerator to maintain quality. If needed quickly, placing vacuum-sealed steak in cold running water is an effective alternative. Once defrosted, steaks should be consumed within one to two days. While cooked steak can also be frozen, it's preferable to freeze it raw to preserve texture and moisture. Cooked steak should be consumed within two to three months post-freezing. Proper freezing, packaging, and defrosting techniques ensure flavor and texture are well preserved.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751817540.0,"attribution":"www.southernliving.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reddit.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/16vy2kd/freezing_post_dry_brine/","title":"Freezing post dry brine? : r/sousvide - Reddit","snippet":"I dry brine all my steaks before vacuum sealing and freezing them.

Common beef breeds in the U.S. include Angus, Hereford, and Wagyu, each with unique characteristics and preferred conditions. Beef can be grass-fed, providing a mineral-rich flavor, or grain-fed, preferred by most for its enhanced marbling. The USDA grades beef as Select, Choice, or Prime based on marbling, with Prime being the highest quality. Beef can be dry-aged, enhancing flavor and tenderness, or wet-aged, retaining more juiciness. The eight primal cuts of beef include Chuck, Brisket, Shank, Rib, Short Loin, Sirloin, Round, Flank, and Short Plate, each providing different textures and flavors. Proper storage of beef, including cryovacing and correct thawing procedures, ensures meat quality and safety.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1586291176.0,"attribution":"www.foodandwine.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_686b0a2319a080078fb9d8fd58511472","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"0156492a-2ae2-4229-a5df-d5eb8a55ebc4","request_id":"95ce5a1bce209fa1-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0156492a-2ae2-4229-a5df-d5eb8a55ebc4","children":["6fd106d3-ca57-4a26-b5f5-cb74cec00af3"]},"6fd106d3-ca57-4a26-b5f5-cb74cec00af3":{"id":"6fd106d3-ca57-4a26-b5f5-cb74cec00af3","message":{"id":"6fd106d3-ca57-4a26-b5f5-cb74cec00af3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752132632.308827,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\n  \"open\": [\n    {\n      \"ref_id\": \"turn7search2\",\n      \"lineno\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"response_length\": \"short\"\n}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"a110ebd1-7f38-4910-8e91-7da5bdaed43c","request_id":"95ce5a1bce209fa1-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"a110ebd1-7f38-4910-8e91-7da5bdaed43c","children":["68d9ac09-de32-4956-9a34-6b853d2dc2ec"]},"68d9ac09-de32-4956-9a34-6b853d2dc2ec":{"id":"68d9ac09-de32-4956-9a34-6b853d2dc2ec","message":{"id":"68d9ac09-de32-4956-9a34-6b853d2dc2ec","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1752132634.488731,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bbq-brethren.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bbq-brethren.com/threads/freezing-after-dry-brining-steaks.304590/","title":"Freezing after dry brining steaks?

Norwegian butter prices have since stabilized. The article explains the composition of butter, including its high fat content, which gives it a long shelf life. Butter can spoil under extreme conditions, but usually it just absorbs flavors or gets exposed to air and light, affecting its taste. Clarified butter or ghee lasts much longer. Butter can be frozen for up to six months and should be tightly wrapped to avoid freezer burn. While refrigeration is recommended to keep butter's flavor fresh, it can be left out for short periods.

Butter can also be frozen in cubes, properly wrapped to avoid freezer burn. Label these packages to track their freeze date. Frozen butter lasts between six to 12 months when stored correctly. After a year, its quality and flavor may decline. Frozen butter should be checked for discoloration, mold, off smells, or rancid taste as indicators of spoilage.

Norwegian butter prices have since stabilized. The article explains the composition of butter, including its high fat content, which gives it a long shelf life. Butter can spoil under extreme conditions, but usually it just absorbs flavors or gets exposed to air and light, affecting its taste. Clarified butter or ghee lasts much longer. Butter can be frozen for up to six months and should be tightly wrapped to avoid freezer burn. While refrigeration is recommended to keep butter's flavor fresh, it can be left out for short periods. Storing butter in airtight containers can help extend its shelf life. Spoilage is generally not a significant concern for butter.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1663160100.0,"attribution":"www.epicurious.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.eatingwell.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962715/does-butter-go-bad/","title":"Does Butter Go Bad?","snippet":"Butter can go bad due to fat breakdown caused by heat, light, and oxygen exposure. To determine if butter is unusable, look for sour or off-flavors, discoloration, and mold. Proper storage extends butter's shelf life: refrigerate for one to three months or freeze for up to a year. Different labels on packaging, such as sell-by and use-by, focus on quality rather than safety. Salted butter lasts longer than unsalted, as salt acts as a preservative, making it suitable for room temperature storage in a proper container for daily use. Store unsalted butter in the fridge. Always use wrapped butter to prevent odor and flavor absorption.

These volatiles migrate into the steak\u2019s outer 2\u20133 mm over months. | **Negative** for long storage (> 4\u20136 months); you risk off-flavours that the meat would not develop on its own. |\n| **Water in the butter** | The 15\u201316 % water fraction freezes as an **irregular glaze** around the steak. When you sear, that thin ice + butter mixture steams before the Maillard reaction starts, so browning is slower. | **Negative** for crust formation unless you scrape or pat the steak dry first. |\n| **Seasoning / flavour transfer** | Salted or compound butter will season only the outer rim. Diffusion is negligible while frozen; you still need a post-thaw rest for even salting. | **Neutral** \u2013 it doesn\u2019t save a step. |\n| **Practicality & mess** | Moulding butter slabs, re-wrapping, then carving the cold butter off before finishing is labour-intensive compared with slip-a-bag-in-the-freezer. | **Negative** unless you like the ritual. |\n\n---\n\n#### When *might* a fat-encasement make sense?\n\n* **Clarified butter or beef tallow glaze** \u2013 If you flash-freeze first (so crystal size is already small) and then dip the solid steak in **100 % fat** that contains no water, you get a thin, oxygen-tight film without the insulation penalty. That\u2019s how some game processors prevent freezer burn on long-stored venison backstraps.  \n* **Cook-then-coat (\u201cpotted beef\u201d approach)** \u2013 Encasing *cooked* meat in fat was a classic shelf-life extender before refrigeration. If you sous-vide or confit the steak first, submerging it in butter while still hot forms an anaerobic seal and lets you hold it a further 1\u20132 weeks chilled without quality loss. That\u2019s a different workflow from what you proposed.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nFor a raw prime steak whose eating quality matters, you will keep more tenderness, colour and flavour by:\n\n1. **Vacuum-sealing or tight double-wrapping** immediately.  \n2. **Fast-freezing** (\u2264 \u201325 \u00b0C, \u2273 1 m s\u207b\u00b9 airflow) to lock in small ice crystals.  \n3. **Seasoning during the refrigerator thaw** (the \u201cthaw-brine\u201d method), not before freezing.  \n\nA butter shell trades a small gain in surface dehydration control for bigger losses in texture, browning efficiency and long-term flavour integrity. In most home or professional contexts, it is an elegant-sounding technique that under-delivers."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202L1-L2\ue201","start_idx":243,"end_idx":266,"safe_urls":["https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Butter_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([AMS](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Butter_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"U.S. Standards for Grades of Butter","url":"https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Butter_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AMS"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202L52-L54\ue201","start_idx":524,"end_idx":549,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Frozen food - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue202L15-L17\ue201","start_idx":1125,"end_idx":1151,"safe_urls":["https://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2025/01/aged-butter-part-2-the-science-of-rancidity/"],"refs":["malformed"],"alt":"([nordicfoodlab.org](https://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2025/01/aged-butter-part-2-the-science-of-rancidity/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Aged Butter part 2: the science of rancidity \u2013 Nordic Food Lab","url":"https://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2025/01/aged-butter-part-2-the-science-of-rancidity/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"nordicfoodlab.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3456,"end_idx":3456,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"U.S. Standards for Grades of Butter","url":"https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Butter_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf","attribution":"AMS"},{"title":"Frozen food - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"Aged Butter part 2: the science of rancidity \u2013 Nordic Food Lab","url":"https://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2025/01/aged-butter-part-2-the-science-of-rancidity/","attribution":"nordicfoodlab.org"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Butter_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food","https://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2025/01/aged-butter-part-2-the-science-of-rancidity/"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"reddit.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/k63oyp/how_much_does_freezing_meat_actually_impact/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"How much does freezing meat actually impact texture? - Reddit","snippet":"If it gets exposed to the air, it can get freezer burn, in which case the texture gets thrown off.
