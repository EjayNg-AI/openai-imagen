Samsung plans to roll out performance-based stock compensation for all South Korean employees.

The company has already shown substantial dominance, with ChatGPT boasting 800 million weekly users\u2014over 10% of the global adult population. OpenAI\u2019s dissemination of AI tools, including its swift adoption of the Sora AI video app (1 million downloads in five days), exemplifies the unprecedented speed and scale of its user engagement. Researchers note that the rise of ChatGPT lacks modern parallels and places OpenAI far ahead of rivals like Meta AI and xAI\u2019s Grok.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1760451460.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.iea.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai","title":"Energy demand from AI","snippet":"From 2024 to 2030, data centre electricity consumption grows by around 15% per year, more than four times faster than the growth of total electricity ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.iea.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works","title":"AI is set to drive surging electricity demand from data ...","snippet":"Apr 10, 2025 \u2014 It projects that electricity demand from data centres worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to around 945 terawatt-hours (TWh).","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.iea.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/inside-the-ai-accelerator-arms-race-amd-nvidia-and-hyperscalers-commit-to-annual-releases-through-the-decade","title":"Inside the AI accelerator arms race: AMD, Nvidia, and ...","snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 ... share of the AI accelerator market is negligible.

This is projected to result in economic and political challenges for these countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, which will see a significant portion of global births. A study in The Lancet projects that by 2050, 76% of countries will fall below the replacement fertility level, increasing to 97% by 2100. The global fertility rate has already decreased from 5 births per woman in 1950 to 2.2 in 2021. Nations with extremely low fertility rates, like South Korea and Serbia, face potential workforce shortages. The study emphasizes the need for improved access to contraception and female education, suggesting that future economic growth will depend on open immigration policies to counter shrinking populations. The findings are grounded in data spanning from 1950 to 2021, noting potential limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1710978827.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/14/heat-exposure-of-older-people-across-the-world-to-double-by-2050-finds-study","title":"Heat exposure of older people across world to double by 2050, finds study","snippet":"By 2050, heat exposure for older people will at least double globally, exacerbated by both climate change and an aging population, according to a study in Nature Communications. An estimated additional 250 million elderly individuals will face dangerous heat levels of 37.5\u00b0C. This will disproportionately impact the global south, which is hotter and poorer, intensifying health and social vulnerabilities. The elderly are particularly susceptible to heat due to decreased thermoregulation, chronic illnesses, and dependence on medications that cause dehydration. Regions like Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe will see significant increases in heat exposure for older adults. The study emphasizes the need for better infrastructure, public health adaptations, and intergenerational equity to address these challenges, highlighting the divide between the preparedness of the richer north and the more vulnerable south. It calls for proactive measures to protect the elderly from the imminent risk of heat-related illnesses and deaths.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1715705313.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/c0559c904806f5dcae6b45a74ef39adc","title":"More countries, including China, are grappling with shrinking and aging populations","snippet":"Countries like China, Japan, Italy, and South Korea are facing significant challenges due to declining and aging populations.

These demographic changes are causing concerns about economic growth and the ability to support increasing elderly populations. Governments in these countries are introducing measures such as raising the retirement age, encouraging higher birth rates through financial incentives, and adapting policies to address social and cultural factors contributing to the decline. The United Nations projects that the global population will peak around 10.3 billion in 60 years before starting to decline.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1737086127.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68ef63a54c28832bbd8fc094e92fd2dd","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for demographic projections and aging workforce data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98ee259cbb7efdb3-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"388cda8c-b27d-45e6-99df-08607db5ea87","turn_exchange_id":"3268afba-6fed-4525-adae-5fcf526df6f0","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"388cda8c-b27d-45e6-99df-08607db5ea87","children":["d2cdaa4f-c231-4b8f-a515-946c1f81bd15"]},"d2cdaa4f-c231-4b8f-a515-946c1f81bd15":{"id":"d2cdaa4f-c231-4b8f-a515-946c1f81bd15","message":{"id":"d2cdaa4f-c231-4b8f-a515-946c1f81bd15","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760519157.991034,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing geopolitical predictions","content":"I\u2019ll integrate citations on demographic trends and examine geopolitical forecasts based on geography, demographics, and technology.

This wealth, now over 5.4 times world GDP, is increasingly disconnected from real economic fundamentals, with much of the growth stemming from paper gains and cumulative inflation. Only 30% of the increase has come from real investment, while rising asset values have also fueled a surge in global debt to 2.6 times GDP. McKinsey warns this imbalance makes the global economy vulnerable, with future financial stability hinging on whether productivity\u2014potentially through AI innovations\u2014can close the gap, or if prolonged inflation will erode wealth. Investors are hedging bets across booming tech stocks and gold, as market volatility reflects divergent future scenarios.

Despite significant investments from major tech firms like Salesforce and Oracle in AI systems that can autonomously carry out tasks, many of these projects remain in early, experimental stages and are often driven by hype rather than practical application. Gartner notes a trend of \u201cagent washing,\u201d where vendors mislabel conventional AI tools as agentic without true autonomous capabilities. Currently, only about 130 vendors genuinely offer agentic AI among thousands claiming to do so. Gartner's Anushree Verma highlights that most current agentic AI lacks the maturity to deliver real returns on investment and cannot yet handle complex or nuanced instructions. However, the firm predicts improvements, projecting that by 2028, 15% of day-to-day business decisions will be autonomously made using agentic AI, and 33% of enterprise software applications will incorporate such technology, up significantly from 2024 levels.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1750845910.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mckinsey.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier","title":"Economic potential of generative AI","snippet":"Jun 14, 2023 \u2014 Our latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases we ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1686614400.0,"attribution":"www.mckinsey.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/the%20economic%20potential%20of%20generative%20ai%20the%20next%20productivity%20frontier/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier.pdf","title":"The economic potential of generative AI","snippet":"Jun 1, 2023 \u2014 Our latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the. 63 use cases we ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.mckinsey.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-live/webinars/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier","title":"The economic potential of generative AI","snippet":"Generative artificial intelligence is poised to unleash a powerful wave of productivity growth that will likely affect all industries.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.mckinsey.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketingaiinstitute.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/mckinsey-ai-economic-impact","title":"McKinsey: AI Could Generate Up to $23 Trillion Annually ...","snippet":"Nov 5, 2024 \u2014 Generative AI alone could product $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of economic impact through enterprise use cases, with 75% of that value in ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1730817862.0,"attribution":"www.marketingaiinstitute.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.consultancy.eu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.consultancy.eu/news/9358/generative-ai-can-add-up-to-44-trillion-in-productivity-annually","title":"Generative AI can add up to $4.4 trillion in productivity ...","snippet":"Oct 9, 2023 \u2014 The generative artificial intelligence (AI) industry has the potential to add between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually in the coming years.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1696834860.0,"attribution":"www.consultancy.eu"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"papers.ssrn.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5214616.pdf?abstractid=5214616&mirid=1","title":"AI Agents: The Future of Autonomous Intelligence","snippet":"Abstract.

The Singapore Police confirmed ongoing investigations into the company for suspected legal breaches. Citing past Reuters reports on increasing demand for banned Nvidia products and China's alleged acquisition of these chips despite a ban, Cotton emphasized the national security threat posed by such diversions. He supports tighter enforcement measures, including chip location verification post-sale.

In recent weeks, customs teams have been deployed to inspect semiconductor shipments at major ports, targeting not just Nvidia chips but also potential smuggling of other high-end processors. This move follows guidance from Chinese regulators urging tech companies like ByteDance and Alibaba to halt orders and testing of Nvidia products.\n\nThese checks are part of a broader campaign to reduce technology dependence on the U.S. and bolster domestic semiconductor development. Investigations have extended to potential false import declarations, with U.S. firm Tower Research under scrutiny for alleged hardware smuggling. The crackdown aligns with China's strategy to enhance local chip manufacturing capacity and performance, aiming to triple production next year. While Nvidia has stopped counting on China for future revenues, it previously made $4.6 billion in Q1 from Chinese sales before the U.S. temporarily restricted exports. Both Chinese customs and Nvidia declined to comment on the developments.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1760068822.326,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-to-companies-stop-ordering-nvidias-china-specific-chips-they-are-/articleshow/124452081.cms","title":"China to companies: Stop ordering Nvidia's China-specific chips, they are ...","snippet":"China is intensifying its control over semiconductor imports, particularly targeting US-made AI processors such as Nvidia\u2019s China-specific H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips.

Initially aimed at stopping local companies from importing Nvidia\u2019s chips designed under US export restrictions, the checks have now broadened to encompass all advanced semiconductors. This move is part of a broader strategy by Beijing to reduce reliance on American technology, combat potential smuggling of restricted high-end chips, and support the development of China's domestic chip industry in the global AI race.

The article, dated August 18, 2025, details the growing threat posed by space-based cyber and physical attacks. For example, pro-Russian hackers hijacked a satellite broadcasting in Ukraine, replacing programming with Russian military parade footage. Such actions demonstrate how easily satellites, which support GPS, military operations, and communications, can be compromised.\n\nOver 12,000 satellites orbit Earth, making them vulnerable to cyber intrusions, particularly via outdated software. The 2022 hack on the Viasat network during the Russian invasion of Ukraine exemplifies this risk. U.S. officials also warn of a developing Russian nuclear anti-satellite weapon intended to cripple all satellites in low-Earth orbit, evoking Cold War-era fears akin to a new \u201cCuban Missile Crisis.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, competition for lunar resources, particularly by the U.S., Russia, and China, is heating up. Nations plan nuclear-powered lunar bases to exploit materials like helium-3 for future energy production. The U.S. is advancing its security efforts through the Space Force and unmanned missions like the X-37B.\n\nTensions and strategic investments reflect a new era where control of space could determine future geopolitical and economic dominance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1755490575.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/509b39e0-b40c-41b3-9c6a-9005859c6fea","title":"US Space Force warns of 'mind-boggling' build-up of Chinese capabilities","snippet":"General Chance Saltzman, chief of the US Space Force, has expressed significant concerns over China's rapid expansion of military capabilities in space, warning of the increased risk of orbital warfare. He emphasized that the number and speed of development of Chinese space weapons are alarming. During his European tour, Saltzman highlighted the necessity of cooperation between the US and European allies to bolster deterrence capabilities. The US Space Force, established in 2019 by then-president Donald Trump, monitors over 46,000 objects in orbit and has about 10,000 personnel. China and Russia have developed advanced satellite technologies, raising security concerns. Despite Beijing's dismissal of US claims, President Xi Jinping has restructured space, cyber, and information operations within the Chinese military. The US remains reliant on private sector partnerships, including with Elon Musk's SpaceX, to advance its space defenses amidst ongoing global competition.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1730437208.971,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/02/trump-space-command-alabama/","title":"Trump to move U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama","snippet":"President Donald Trump announced the relocation of the U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama, citing national security benefits and the Air Force\u2019s original 2021 preference. This decision follows a prolonged bipartisan dispute involving three administrations and reflects intense lobbying from both Colorado and Alabama. Trump made the announcement alongside Alabama lawmakers, including Rep. Mike Rogers and Sen. Katie Britt, who touted the economic benefits, including 1,600 new jobs. Trump implied Colorado\u2019s mail-in voting practices influenced his decision, while denying political motivations.\n\nThe move overturns the Biden administration\u2019s 2023 decision to keep the headquarters in Colorado Springs. Colorado officials, including Republican ally Rep. Lauren Boebert, condemned the reversal, arguing it would delay strategic efforts and waste billions. Business leaders in Denver also expressed concern, projecting a $1 billion local economic loss.\n\nU.S. Space Command, distinct from the Space Force, oversees military satellite operations and space defense. As space becomes a key area of international military competition, especially with China's rapid advancements, the headquarters\u2019 location is strategically significant. Huntsville, already a defense and aerospace hub home to NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center and major contractors, offers infrastructure to support growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1756834236.396,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68ef63a54c28832bbd8fc094e92fd2dd","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for space militarization and weaponry sources","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98ee259cbb7efdb3-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d96c3735-4e36-4111-a76c-513c879660ff","turn_exchange_id":"3268afba-6fed-4525-adae-5fcf526df6f0","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d96c3735-4e36-4111-a76c-513c879660ff","children":["846bd2c5-e181-4f02-8d6b-b156785f3a97"]},"846bd2c5-e181-4f02-8d6b-b156785f3a97":{"id":"846bd2c5-e181-4f02-8d6b-b156785f3a97","message":{"id":"846bd2c5-e181-4f02-8d6b-b156785f3a97","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1760519178.470102,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering Mexico's rise","content":"I've got enough to connect space militarization with GF's predictions.

In places they\u2019re already materializing (Japan\u2019s rearmament; Poland\u2019s re-armament; Turkey\u2019s drone-driven power projection; militarized space). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn8search0\ue202turn8news36\ue201  \n- **He underweighted AI** (he explicitly said he couldn\u2019t factor AI well in his U.S. cycles book). The AI stack will *amplify* some of his dynamics (U.S. lead, robotics easing labor shortages) and *undercut* others (cheap-labor advantages; the need for mass immigration at U.S. scale; the timing/character of mid-century conflict). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- **Compute, chips, and energy become geopolitics.** U.S.-led export controls + CHIPS policy tie AI leadership to allied industrial bases (US/EU/Japan/Taiwan), aligning with his U.S.-centric forecast and pressuring China\u2014consistent with Stratfor\u2019s own revisions favoring authoritarian consolidation over fragmentation. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search2\ue202turn7search1\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n- **AI\u2019s power footprint is large.** Data-center electricity roughly *doubling* by 2030 (base case) makes energy policy a first-order geopolitical variable in the 2030s; it also dovetails with Friedman\u2019s expectation of a major tech/energy shift. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201  \n- **Mexico\u2019s rise remains intact** (nearshoring, trade share), but AI+automation narrows the simple \u201clow-wage labor = advantage\u201d story Friedman leaned on; proximity + rule-of-law + grid/ports matter more than wage arbitrage. \ue200cite\ue202turn9news19\ue202turn9search12\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 1) Friedman\u2019s baseline for ~2028-2045 (from *The Next 100 Years* and later work)\n- **U.S. primacy endures**; China faces internal constraints; Russia wanes; new regional powers emerge (Japan, Turkey, Poland); Mexico rises later in the century. Space becomes a military domain by the 2040s; robotics/genetics reshape productivity and longevity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- **Demographic drag** in developed states drives immigration competition in the 2020s/30s; later, robots reduce labor scarcity. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n- In **U.S. cycles**, Friedman forecast institutional & socio-economic cycles peaking in the late 2020s, with a new phase beginning in the early 2030s; he also **explicitly notes** AI was a variable he didn\u2019t model. \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue201\n\n**What\u2019s already visible in 2024-2025 that lines up with his thesis?**  \n- **Japan**: 2022-27 defense build-up to ~2% of GDP; long-range strike plans; accelerated missile deployments. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3news34\ue201  \n- **Poland**: rapid rearmament (HIMARS, K2/K9), personnel expansion\u2014on track for Europe\u2019s strongest land forces. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news38\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search10\ue201  \n- **Turkey**: sovereign drone industry and \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d doctrine projecting power regionally. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search8\ue202turn3search11\ue201  \n- **Space militarization**: US Space Force (2019), ongoing ASAT concerns; space is openly contested. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search0\ue202turn8news36\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 2) What the AI wave adds (2028-2045)\nThink in \u201cstack\u201d terms:\n\n**a) Models & reasoning/agents.**  \nBy the early 2030s, enterprise software becomes agent-first (with a hype-cycle cull in the late 2020s). Gartner/Reuters expect many \u201cagentic AI\u201d projects to fail near-term, but a sustained shift toward autonomous task execution by the late 2020s/early 2030s. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search18\ue202turn6search16\ue202turn6news21\ue201\n\n**b) Compute & chips.**  \nU.S.-aligned control points (NVIDIA platforms; EUV monopoly via ASML; advanced-node foundries dominated by TSMC; export controls) make AI capacity a **coalition asset**, reinforcing U.S. primacy in Friedman's frame. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue202turn11search11\ue202turn11news21\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n**c) Energy.**  \nIEA base case: data-center power use \u2248 *double* by 2030 (\u2248945 TWh). Energy becomes a limiting reagent for AI scale; expect grid, siting, and generation to be strategic instruments across the 2030s. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201\n\n**d) Labor & demography.**  \nAI + robotics can substitute for some labor (esp. routine knowledge work) and complement elsewhere; in aging OECD economies, AI dampens but does not erase the demographic tax. Net: immigration pressure softens in some sectors, but care, trades, and defense stay labor-hungry. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn10search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 3) Convergences with Friedman (things AI strengthens)\n\n1) **U.S. primacy** through the AI-compute-chip alliance system (CHIPS Act, export controls) \u2192 consistent with his long-run U.S. lead. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search1\ue202turn7search0\ue201  \n2) **Japan/Turkey/Poland rise** gets an AI-defense kicker (C4ISR, missiles, drones), accelerating their regional weight during 2028-2045. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search8\ue201  \n3) **Robotics easing labor scarcity** in aging societies matches his demographic arc; AI makes this far broader than factory floors (agents handling services/admin/R&D). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue201  \n4) **Space militarization**: AI-enabled ISR, autonomous satellites, threat detection\u2014directly in the lane of his 2040s space conflict intuition. \ue200cite\ue202turn8news36\ue201  \n5) **Mexico\u2019s momentum** via nearshoring and U.S. trade integration through the 2030s is already visible; AI/automation + proximity keeps it competitive despite rising wages. \ue200cite\ue202turn9news19\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 4) Contradictions / places to revise\n\n1) **Geography vs. software leverage.**  \nFriedman\u2019s model is state-first and geography-anchored; AI creates *firm-centric*, globally deployable capabilities. Yet the *physical* stack (fabs, EUV, power) re-anchors advantage in allied territories. Net: revise to \u201cdual sovereignty\u201d\u2014states plus a handful of system-critical firms. \ue200cite\ue202turn11search11\ue201\n\n2) **Immigration in the 2030s.**  \nHe foresaw intense competition for migrants; AI likely *reduces* the depth/breadth of that competition in white-collar services, though demographics still bite in care, construction, defense. Expect more targeted migration rather than blanket liberalization. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue201\n\n3) **China\u2019s trajectory.**  \nHis early bet on fragmentation was walked back by Stratfor in favor of authoritarian re-centralization\u2014*and* AI tools tilt toward regime resilience (surveillance, censorship) over fragmentation. Keep the \u201cinternal strain\u201d thesis, drop the \u201cfragmentation as base case.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search21\ue201\n\n4) **Mid-century war style.**  \nA 2050s \u201cspace-centric kinetic war\u201d may be displaced by *protracted gray-zone conflict* (space disabling, cyber, economic coercion) long before any set-piece war. AI raises first-strike and miscalculation risks but also strengthens surveillance/deterrence. Down-weight a Thanksgiving-style bolt-from-the-blue. \ue200cite\ue202turn8news35\ue201\n\n5) **Energy assumptions.**  \nHe anticipated a tech/energy shift (even space solar). The *scale* of AI\u2019s energy appetite makes energy security a hard constraint by the 2030s\u2014policy, not just technology adoption, will drive outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n# 5) Integrated outlook for 2028-2045\n\n**2028-2032:** U.S. cycles settle into a new phase; AI agents diffuse but with high project attrition; compute export controls harden; Japan/Poland solidify rearmament; Turkey continues strategic autonomy; space domain risk rises (ASAT, jamming). \ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn6news21\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn8news36\ue201\n\n**2033-2038:** Energy bottlenecks and grid constraints dominate AI scaling; sovereign AI (national stacks) spread across G20; Mexico entrenches as U.S. partner despite trade frictions. Europe\u2019s defense posture rebalances around Poland; Japan\u2019s strike-back posture matures. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn9news20\ue202turn3search7\ue202turn3news34\ue201\n\n**2039-2045:** Space becomes the decisive sensor/comm layer for all theaters; conflict remains hybrid/attritional unless a major miscalculation occurs. AI\u2019s productivity lift offsets part of the demographic drag, but not all; immigration is targeted, not wholesale. U.S. primacy persists, now explicitly coupled to AI-chip-energy control points. \ue200cite\ue202turn8news36\ue202turn5search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n# Bottom line\nFriedman\u2019s *structure over headlines* method still travels well. The AI revolution doesn\u2019t overturn it; it **routes power through new chokepoints** (compute, chips, energy, talent) that\u2014critically\u2014sit inside the very U.S.-aligned geography he highlighted.

Gartner notes a trend of \u201cagent washing,\u201d where vendors mislabel conventional AI tools as agentic without true autonomous capabilities. Currently, only about 130 vendors genuinely offer agentic AI among thousands claiming to do so. Gartner's Anushree Verma highlights that most current agentic AI lacks the maturity to deliver real returns on investment and cannot yet handle complex or nuanced instructions.

The article, dated August 18, 2025, details the growing threat posed by space-based cyber and physical attacks. For example, pro-Russian hackers hijacked a satellite broadcasting in Ukraine, replacing programming with Russian military parade footage. Such actions demonstrate how easily satellites, which support GPS, military operations, and communications, can be compromised.\n\nOver 12,000 satellites orbit Earth, making them vulnerable to cyber intrusions, particularly via outdated software. The 2022 hack on the Viasat network during the Russian invasion of Ukraine exemplifies this risk. U.S. officials also warn of a developing Russian nuclear anti-satellite weapon intended to cripple all satellites in low-Earth orbit, evoking Cold War-era fears akin to a new \u201cCuban Missile Crisis.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, competition for lunar resources, particularly by the U.S., Russia, and China, is heating up. Nations plan nuclear-powered lunar bases to exploit materials like helium-3 for future energy production. The U.S. is advancing its security efforts through the Space Force and unmanned missions like the X-37B.\n\nTensions and strategic investments reflect a new era where control of space could determine future geopolitical and economic dominance.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201","start_idx":7330,"end_idx":7349,"safe_urls":["https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Energy demand from AI","url":"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"From 2024 to 2030, data centre electricity consumption grows by around 15% per year, more than four times faster than the growth of total electricity ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"IEA"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2view0\ue202turn6news21\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn8news36\ue201","start_idx":7642,"end_idx":7723,"safe_urls":["https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-storm-before-the-calm/","https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-shows-gaps-in-polands-military-drive/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/509b39e0-b40c-41b3-9c6a-9005859c6fea?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/over-40-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-scrapped-by-2027-gartner-says-2025-06-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/12/what-you-need-know-about-japans-new-national-security-strategy?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Geopolitical Futures](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-storm-before-the-calm/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Storm Before the Calm - Geopolitical Futures","url":"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/books/the-storm-before-the-calm/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Over 40% of agentic AI projects will be scrapped by 2027, Gartner says","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/over-40-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-scrapped-by-2027-gartner-says-2025-06-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"According to a report by Gartner, over 40% of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) projects are expected to be scrapped by the end of 2027 due to rising costs and unclear business value. Despite significant investments from major tech firms like Salesforce and Oracle in AI systems that can autonomously carry out tasks, many of these projects remain in early, experimental stages and are often driven by hype rather than practical application. Gartner notes a trend of \u201cagent washing,\u201d where vendors mislabel conventional AI tools as agentic without true autonomous capabilities.

However, the firm predicts improvements, projecting that by 2028, 15% of day-to-day business decisions will be autonomously made using agentic AI, and 33% of enterprise software applications will incorporate such technology, up significantly from 2024 levels.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":18},{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Consumer Goods Technology"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn7search2\ue202turn7search1\ue201","start_idx":9842,"end_idx":9887,"safe_urls":["https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48642?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Commerce Strengthens Export Controls to Restrict China's ...","url":"https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Dec 2, 2024 \u2014 In October 2022, BIS published an interim final rule (IFR) to restrict the PRC's ability to both purchase and manufacture certain high-end ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"U.S. Export Controls and China: Advanced Semiconductors","url":"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48642?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"In 2023, BIS added PRC entities involved in advanced computing and AI to the EL.
