In Kasparov\u2019s framework there are (at least) two standard things one might mean by\n\\[\nKK(G\\ltimes A).\n\\]\nI\u2019ll spell out both, because texts use both conventions.\n\n# 1) The crossed product as an **object** of the Kasparov category\n\nFix a second-countable locally compact group \\(G\\) acting on a separable \\(C^*\\)-algebra \\(A\\) via \\(\\alpha:G\\to\\mathrm{Aut}(A)\\). The crossed product \\(G\\ltimes_\\alpha A\\) (equivalently \\(A\\rtimes_\\alpha G\\)) is the \\(C^*\\)-completion of \\(C_c(G,A)\\) with twisted convolution\n\\[\n(f*g)(t)=\\int_G f(s)\\,\\alpha_s\\!\\big(g(s^{-1}t)\\big)\\,ds,\\qquad\nf^*(t)=\\Delta(t^{-1})\\,\\alpha_t\\!\\big(f(t^{-1})^*\\big),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta\\) is the modular function. There are \u201cfull\u201d and \u201creduced\u201d versions (\\(\\rtimes\\) and \\(\\rtimes_r\\)) depending on the norm you complete with.\n\nIn the **Kasparov category** \\(KK\\), the *objects* are separable \\(C^*\\)-algebras and the *morphisms* \\(\\mathrm{Hom}_{KK}(B,C)\\) are the groups \\(KK_0(B,C)\\) (with \\(\\mathbb Z/2\\)-grading giving \\(KK_0,KK_1\\)). In this sense, \u201c\\(KK(G\\ltimes A)\\)\u201d often just means \u201cthe object \\(G\\ltimes A\\) living in the non-equivariant Kasparov category\u201d. Morphisms out of it are the bivariant groups \\(KK_*(G\\ltimes A,\\,B)\\).\n\nThis viewpoint is tied to **descent**: the equivariant Kasparov category \\(KK^G\\) (objects: \\(G\\)-\\(C^*\\)-algebras; morphisms: \\(KK^G_*(A,B)\\)) admits a triangulated functor\n\\[\nj_G: KK^G \\longrightarrow KK,\\qquad\nA\\longmapsto G\\ltimes A,\\quad\nx\\in KK^G_*(A,B)\\longmapsto j_G(x)\\in KK_*(G\\ltimes A,\\,G\\ltimes B),\n\\]\nconstructed by \u201ccrossing\u201d Kasparov cycles with \\(G\\). Concretely, a \\(G\\)-equivariant Kasparov \\(A\\)\u2013\\(B\\) cycle \\((E,\\varphi,F)\\) is sent to a non-equivariant cycle \\((E\\rtimes G,\\;\\varphi\\rtimes G,\\;F\\rtimes G)\\) over the crossed products (built from \\(C_c(G,E)\\) with the natural \\(B\\rtimes G\\)-valued inner product and module structure; then complete). This is the object-level meaning: \\(G\\ltimes A\\) is an object of \\(KK\\), obtained from the equivariant object \\(A\\) via descent.\n\n# 2) A shorthand for **(co)homology** of the crossed product\n\nAuthors also write \u201c\\(KK(G\\ltimes A)\\)\u201d as a shorthand for a specific bivariant group where one leg is fixed:\n\n- \\(KK_*(\\mathbb C,\\,G\\ltimes A)\\cong K_*(G\\ltimes A)\\) (the **K-theory** of the crossed product),\n- or \\(KK_*(G\\ltimes A,\\,\\mathbb C)\\) (the **K-homology** of the crossed product).\n\nWhich one is intended is context-dependent; many operator algebra texts reserve \\(K_*(\\cdot)\\) for \\(KK_*(\\mathbb C,\\cdot)\\) and \\(K^*(\\cdot)\\) for \\(KK_*(\\cdot,\\mathbb C)\\), but you\u2019ll also see \u201c\\(KK(G\\ltimes A)\\)\u201d meaning \\(KK_*(G\\ltimes A,\\mathbb C)\\). When in doubt, check the author\u2019s convention for \\(K\\)-theory vs \\(K\\)-homology.\n\n# Why this object matters\n\n- **Green\u2013Julg (compact \\(G\\)).** If \\(G\\) is compact, there is a natural isomorphism\n  \\[\n  K_*^G(A)\\;=\\;KK_*^G(A,\\mathbb C)\\;\\cong\\;K_*(A\\rtimes G)\\;=\\;KK_*(\\mathbb C,\\,A\\rtimes G),\n  \\]\n  so the equivariant \\(K\\)-homology of \\(A\\) is the (non-equivariant) \\(K\\)-theory of the crossed product. In particular, for \\(A=\\mathbb C\\) (trivial action) you get \\(K_*(C^*(G))\\).\n\n- **Descent and Pimsner\u2013Voiculescu.** For \\(G=\\mathbb Z\\) or \\(\\mathbb Z^n\\), the descent \\(j_G\\) and Kasparov products yield the six-term PV exact sequence computing \\(K_*(A\\rtimes_\\alpha \\mathbb Z)\\) from \\((A,\\alpha)\\).\n\n- **Baum\u2013Connes assembly.** The analytic assembly map \\(\\mu_A:K_*^G(EG;A)\\to K_*(A\\rtimes_r G)\\) is built by combining descent with a Dirac-type element in \\(KK^G\\). Thus computations on the equivariant side are transported to \\(K\\)-theory (or \\(K\\)-homology) of the crossed product object \\(G\\ltimes A\\).\n\n# Practical takeaway\n\n- If you see \\(KK(G\\ltimes A, B)\\), read it literally as the bivariant group for the crossed product algebra.\n- If you see bare \\(KK(G\\ltimes A)\\), check the author\u2019s convention: it usually means either \\(KK_*(G\\ltimes A,\\mathbb C)\\) (K-homology) or is simply referring to the object \\(G\\ltimes A\\) in the non-equivariant Kasparov category\u2014obtained from the \\(G\\)-equivariant world via the descent functor.\n\nIf you can point me to the precise line or author where you saw \\(KK(G\\ltimes A)\\), I can pin down exactly which of the two meanings they use and translate it to the corresponding \\(K\\)-groups or morphisms in \\(KK\\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"970a68831ae2fdfb-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"a10c8bac-7e5a-4584-bbfb-66717bfbdb20","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"a10c8bac-7e5a-4584-bbfb-66717bfbdb20","children":[]}}}
