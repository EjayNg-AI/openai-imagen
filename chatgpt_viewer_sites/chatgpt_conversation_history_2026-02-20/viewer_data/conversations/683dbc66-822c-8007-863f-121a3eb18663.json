It is deducted each month together with principal.  \n2. **Accrued interest (presently 2.5 % p.a.) on the CPF monies you withdrew for housing** \u2013 this is **not** paid out now. It is an internal bookkeeping entry that says: \u201cHad those OA dollars stayed inside CPF, they would have earned 2.5 %. When you eventually sell/transfer the property (or make a voluntary refund), you must first put back the principal you used **plus** this foregone interest, so your retirement nest-egg is restored.\u201d\n\nBecause the two flows go to different \u201crecipients\u201d (the first to the lender CPF Board, the second back to *your own* CPF accounts at a later date), they do **not** amount to a double deduction.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Two separate interest mechanisms\n\n| Feature | Housing-loan interest | Accrued OA interest |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Rate | 0.10 % above OA rate (now 2.6 %) | OA rate (now 2.5 %) |\n| When it is charged | Monthly, on outstanding loan balance | Only when you finally refund the CPF you used (sale, transfer, or voluntary housing refund) |\n| Who ultimately receives it | CPF Board (as lender) | **You** \u2013 it is credited back into your OA/RA |\n| Purpose | Compensates CPF Board for lending | Restores retirement savings that stopped compounding |\n\n\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201\n\n### 1.1  CPF housing-loan interest (2.6 %)\n\n- Pegged at OA rate + 0.1 % to keep the HDB/CPF loan broadly in line with what your OA earns but ensure the loan fund is self-sustaining. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201  \n- Deducted monthly together with loan principal from your OA; you never see it again \u2013 it is the true financing cost of borrowing from CPF. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn7search0\ue201\n\n### 1.2  Accrued interest on CPF withdrawals\n\n- Every dollar you take out of OA for down-payment, stamp fees or instalments is deemed a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d. CPF tracks \u201cwhat those dollars *would* have earned inside OA\u201d (currently 2.5 %). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- The meter runs until you refund; the amount appears in your statement under \u201cProperty \u2013 Accrued Interest\u201d. It is **not** deducted now \u2013 it simply grows on the side. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 2  Why this is *not* double-charging\n\n1. **Different timing:** Loan interest comes out monthly; accrued interest is settled only when you have sales proceeds or when you choose to refund early.  \n2. **Different destinations:**  \n   - 2.6 % goes to CPF Board\u2019s housing-loan fund (like paying a bank).  \n   - 2.5 % goes back into your own OA/Retirement Account, boosting retirement payouts.  \n3. **Policy rationale:** Without the refund rule, using OA for housing would erode your retirement funds; the accrued-interest mechanism forces you to \u201cpay yourself back\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search8\ue201\n\nHence there is one real expense (loan interest) and one opportunity-cost replacement (accrued interest). They add up, but only the first is a *net* out-of-pocket cost.\n\n---\n\n## 3  How it shows up in your CPF statement\n\n1. **\u201cHousing Loan Outstanding\u201d** \u2013 principal still owed to CPF Board.  \n2. **\u201cAccrued Interest on CPF used for Property\u201d** \u2013 principal withdrawn + the interest it would have earned.  \n   - This figure can look alarming because it compounds, but it is *your* money once refunded. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn7search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 4  Practical implications for you\n\n### 4.1  When you sell the flat\n\n- Sale price  \n  \u2013 outstanding CPF housing-loan balance  \n  \u2013 CPF principal used & its accrued interest  \n  = cash you actually pocket. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn7search5\ue201  \n- If sale proceeds are insufficient *and* you sold at market value, CPF will **waive** any shortfall \u2013 you do not need to top up with cash. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n### 4.2  Impact on retirement savings\n\n- Refunded principal + accrued interest is credited back to OA/RA, where it resumes earning at least 2.5 \u2013 4.0 % for life. Your future CPF LIFE payouts are therefore higher. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 5  Common misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| \u201cI\u2019m paying 2 \u00d7 interest every month.\u201d | Only the 2.6 % is paid now. The 2.5 % is merely booked for future refund. |\n| \u201cAccrued interest is a penalty.\u201d | It is a *replacement* for the interest your CPF would have earned \u2013 it ends up in your own account. |\n| \u201cI lose cash when I refund.\u201d | You convert housing proceeds into retirement funds; the money is still yours, just not immediately liquid. |\n\n\ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 6  Managing the two interest streams\n\n1. **Use more cash, less CPF** for monthly instalments if you can afford it \u2013 slows the growth of accrued interest. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n2. **Voluntary Housing Refund (VHR):** You can repay part of the principal early to stop its interest from compounding. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n3. **Assess refinancing:** If market bank-loan rates drop well below 2.6 %, refinancing may cut the *real* interest you pay, although accrued interest rules still apply. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 7  Illustrative example (compressed)\n\n| Year-end | Loan balance | Interest paid that year (2.6 %) | CPF used so far | Accrued interest running tally (2.5 %) |\n|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Start | S$400 000 | \u2013 | S$0 | S$0 |\n| After Yr 1 | 390 000 | 10 140 | 15 000 | 375 |\n| After Yr 5 | 347 000 | 48 300 | 75 000 | 9 375 |\n\nWhen you later sell, you must first refund S$75 000 + 9 375 to OA, but that money is credited back to you and continues earning CPF interest thereafter.\n\n---\n\n## 8  Key takeaways\n\n- **Only one line (2.6 %) is a true cost.**  \n- **The other line is an internal refund to protect your retirement savings.**  \n- Track both figures, but evaluate them separately when planning your cash flows and retirement strategy.  \n\nIf you still see discrepancies or suspect mis-posting in your CPF statement, contact CPF Board directly with your property-usage statement; they can break down each component for you. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201","start_idx":1498,"end_idx":1543,"safe_urls":["https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/home-ownership/using-your-cpf-to-buy-a-home/cpf-refund-when-selling-or-transferring-property?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/sales-proceeds-after-selling-your-home?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Central Provident Fund](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/sales-proceeds-after-selling-your-home?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Central Provident Fund](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/home-ownership/using-your-cpf-to-buy-a-home/cpf-refund-when-selling-or-transferring-property?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Central Provident Fund](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/sales-proceeds-after-selling-your-home?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"What happens to the sales proceeds after selling your home","url":"https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/sales-proceeds-after-selling-your-home?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Together, these are your CPF housing refunds. \u00b7 Any housing grants received and its accrued interest will need to be returned to your CPF account.
