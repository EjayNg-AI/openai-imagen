We will show that the order of \\( G \\) cannot exceed 6, and in fact, the only such group (beyond the trivial and abelian cases) is \\( S_3 \\) which has order 6.\n\n**Step 1: Counting Conjugacy Classes via Irreducible Representations**\n\nA fundamental fact from representation theory is that the number of distinct conjugacy classes of a finite group \\( G \\) equals the number of irreducible complex representations of \\( G \\). Denote this number by \\( k \\). We are given \\( k = 3 \\). Thus, there are exactly three irreducible complex representations of \\( G \\).\n\nLet these irreducible representations have dimensions \\( d_1, d_2, d_3 \\). Without loss of generality, order them so that:\n\\[\nd_1 = 1, \\quad d_2 \\geq 1, \\quad d_3 \\geq 1.\n\\]\nWe always have at least one 1-dimensional representation, the trivial representation.\n\n**Step 2: The Dimension Constraints from the Orthogonality Relations**\n\nFrom the theory of finite group representations, we know:\n\\[\n|G| = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( d_1 = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[\n|G| = 1 + d_2^2 + d_3^2.\n\\]\n\nBecause \\( d_2 \\) and \\( d_3 \\) are positive integers, consider the smallest possibilities:\n\n1. **Case 1: All representations are 1-dimensional.**\n\n   If \\( d_2 = d_3 = 1 \\), then\n   \\[\n   |G| = 1 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3.\n   \\]\n   \n   A group of order 3 is necessarily cyclic and abelian (isomorphic to \\( C_3 \\)). But an abelian group has each element forming its own conjugacy class. Thus, if \\( G \\) is abelian and has three conjugacy classes, it must have exactly three elements, which matches \\( |G| = 3 \\). In that scenario, the group is \\( C_3 \\).\n\n   This gives one example of a group with three conjugacy classes: \\( C_3 \\).\n\n2. **Case 2: There is a nontrivial higher-dimensional representation.**\n\n   If not all irreps are 1-dimensional, the next smallest dimension is 2. Without loss of generality, let \\( d_2 = 2 \\). Since \\( d_3 \\geq 1 \\), try the smallest possibilities:\n   - If \\( d_3 = 1 \\), then\n     \\[\n     |G| = 1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n     \\]\n   - If \\( d_3 \\geq 2 \\), then\n     \\[\n     |G| \\geq 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.\n     \\]\n     But we must be cautious: having multiple higher-dimensional irreps quickly forces the group order to be quite large. Moreover, the structure of such groups with very few conjugacy classes and large order is very constrained. It is known from character theory and classification results that such \"low number of classes\" groups do not arise for large orders.\n\n   Let\u2019s focus on the minimal nontrivial case: \\( d_3 = 1 \\), so \\(|G| = 6\\).\n\n   Groups of order 6 are limited: up to isomorphism, they are either \\( C_6 \\) (cyclic of order 6), \\( C_2 \\times C_3 \\), or \\( S_3 \\). The abelian ones (\\( C_6 \\) and \\( C_2 \\times C_3 \\)) have more than three conjugacy classes because in an abelian group each element forms its own class. Hence, the only candidate for a non-abelian group with three conjugacy classes and order 6 is \\( S_3 \\).\n\n   Indeed, \\( S_3 \\) has the following three conjugacy classes:\n   - The identity class \\(\\{ e \\}\\).\n   - The class of transpositions \\(\\{ (12), (13), (23) \\}\\).\n   - The class of 3-cycles \\(\\{ (123), (132) \\}\\).\n\n   Thus, \\( S_3 \\) is a non-abelian example of a group with exactly three conjugacy classes.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminating Larger Orders**\n\nNow, suppose \\( |G| > 6 \\). We must have either:\n\n- More than one nontrivial irreducible representation with dimension at least 2, pushing \\(|G|\\) even larger and making it impossible to have only three classes.\n- Or no such configuration of irreps can yield exactly three classes because the dimension-squared sum grows too quickly.\n\nFor any larger order, attempting to keep the count of irreducible representations at exactly three while satisfying the sum of squares condition becomes impossible. The next possible dimension pattern would be something like \\((1,2,2)\\) which gives \\(|G| = 1+4+4=9\\). But known groups of order 9 are either \\( C_9 \\) or \\( C_3 \\times C_3 \\) (both abelian), and abelian groups of order 9 have 9 conjugacy classes (one for each element). There is no non-abelian group of order 9, and thus no candidate emerges.\n\nFor any larger order, introducing a higher-dimensional representation (dimension \\(\\geq 3\\)) would yield even larger orders and not simplify the conjugacy structure to just three classes. Known classification results confirm that no other groups arise with exactly three conjugacy classes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only finite groups with exactly three conjugacy classes are:\n- The cyclic group of order 3, \\( C_3 \\).\n- The non-abelian group \\( S_3 \\) of order 6.\n\nNo finite group of order greater than 6 can have exactly three conjugacy classes.
