Then \\(U\\subseteq \\overline{A}\\) and \\(U\\cap A=\\varnothing\\). But if \\(U\\subseteq \\overline{A}\\) and \\(U\\) is open, then \\(U\\cap A\\neq\\varnothing\\): for any \\(x\\in U\\), the open set \\(U\\) is a neighborhood of \\(x\\), and \\(x\\in\\overline{A}\\) means every neighborhood of \\(x\\) meets \\(A\\).
