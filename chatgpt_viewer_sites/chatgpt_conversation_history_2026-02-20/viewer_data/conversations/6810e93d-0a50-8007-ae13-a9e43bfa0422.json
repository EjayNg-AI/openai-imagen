the reboot of The Naked Gun has been released, featuring Liam Neeson in the lead role of Frank Drebin Jr., the son of the original character played by Leslie Nielsen. The reboot revives the slapstick comedy legacy of the original franchise, which began with the TV series Police Squad and continued through three films released between 1988 and 1994. Though the franchise waned in popularity with its sequels, the new film aims to bring back its comedic charm, largely playing on the humorous name similarity between Neeson and Nielsen. Known more for his action roles, Neeson embraces the over-the-top absurdity reminiscent of the original films. The reboot is produced by Seth MacFarlane and directed by Akiva Shaffer, a member of The Lonely Island comedy troupe, suggesting a strong comedic background for the project. The film is set for theatrical release on August 1, 2025, and will feature a diverse cast including Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, Busta Rhymes, and WWE Champion Cody Rhodes.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Everything we know about \"The Naked Gun\" reboot: Release date, cast, and how it acknowledges O.J.

Neeson's background in dramatic roles makes him a fitting straight-faced lead for the slapstick, irreverent comedy. Paul Walter Hauser joins as Ed Hocken Jr., alongside a supporting cast that includes Pamela Anderson, Liza Koshy, Danny Houston, Kevin Durand, WWE star Cody Rhodes, and rapper Busta Rhymes. The teaser trailer, shown at CinemaCon, showcases the film\u2019s commitment to absurd humor and acknowledges the controversial role of O.J.
