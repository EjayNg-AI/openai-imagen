I'm here to\r\n00:00:48.348\r\ntalk about AI opportunity.\r\n00:00:50.884\r\nWhen conferences like this\r\n00:00:52.519\r\nconvene to discuss. a\r\n00:00:53.820\r\nCutting Edge technology.\r\n00:00:55.955\r\noften times. I think our\r\n00:00:56.623\r\nresponse is to be too\r\n00:00:58.658\r\nself-conscious. too risk,\r\n00:01:00.026\r\naverse. But never have I\r\n00:01:02.162\r\nencountered a breakthrough\r\n00:01:03.129\r\nin Tech that. so clearly\r\n00:01:04.330\r\ncalls us to do. precisely\r\n00:01:05.832\r\nthe opposite. Now, our\r\n00:01:08.201\r\nAdministration, the Trump\r\n00:01:09.002\r\nAdministration. believes\r\n00:01:10.036\r\nthat AI will have\r\n00:01:11.337\r\ncountless revolutionary\r\n00:01:13.139\r\napplications and economic\r\n00:01:14.407\r\nin innovation. job creation.\r\n00:01:16.509\r\nNational Security health\r\n00:01:18.511\r\nFree expression and Beyond.\r\n00:01:21.047\r\nAnd to restrict its\r\n00:01:22.015\r\ndevelopment now. when not\r\n00:01:23.549\r\nonly unfairly benefit\r\n00:01:25.318\r\nincumbents in the space,\r\n00:01:26.486\r\nit would mean paralyzing\r\n00:01:28.521\r\n1 of the most promising\r\n00:01:29.889\r\nTechnologies, we have seen\r\n00:01:31.191\r\nin Generations. and with\r\n00:01:33.593\r\nthat, in mind, I'd like to\r\n00:01:34.927\r\nmake 4 main points today.\r\n00:01:37.830\r\nNumber 1. This\r\n00:01:39.732\r\nAdministration will ensure\r\n00:01:40.533\r\nthat American AI\r\n00:01:42.001\r\ntechnology. continues to be\r\n00:01:43.403\r\nthe gold standard\r\n00:01:44.737\r\nworldwide. And we are the\r\n00:01:46.206\r\npartner of choice for\r\n00:01:47.407\r\nothers. foreign countries.\r\n00:01:49.509\r\nand certainly businesses. as\r\n00:01:51.277\r\nthey expand their own use\r\n00:01:52.812\r\nof AI. Number 2. We\r\n00:01:55.615\r\nbelieve that excessive\r\n00:01:57.450\r\nregulation of the AI\r\n00:01:58.585\r\nsector. could kill a\r\n00:02:00.720\r\ntransformative industry.\r\n00:02:01.721\r\njust as it's taking off.\r\n00:02:03.856\r\nand we'll make every effort\r\n00:02:04.823\r\nto encourage pragra. Growth.\r\n00:02:06.826\r\nAI policies and I like\r\n00:02:08.394\r\npolicies see\r\n00:02:09.395\r\nthat deregulatory flavor uh,\r\n00:02:11.598\r\nmaking its way into a lot\r\n00:02:12.398\r\nof the conversations. This\r\n00:02:14.300\r\nThis, this, uh, conference\r\n00:02:16.502\r\nNumber 3. we feel very\r\n00:02:18.738\r\nstrongly that AI must\r\n00:02:20.006\r\nremain free from\r\n00:02:21.507\r\nideological bias. and that\r\n00:02:23.309\r\nAmerican AI will not be\r\n00:02:24.844\r\nco-opted into a tool for\r\n00:02:26.713\r\nauthoritarian censorship. And\r\n00:02:28.748\r\nfinally number 4. the Trump\r\n00:02:31.117\r\nAdministration. will\r\n00:02:32.085\r\nmaintain a pro-worker\r\n00:02:33.652\r\ngrowth path for AI. so it\r\n00:02:35.655\r\ncan be a potent tool for\r\n00:02:36.923\r\njob creation in the United\r\n00:02:38.224\r\nStates and I appreciate\r\n00:02:39.993\r\nprime Minister modi's\r\n00:02:40.926\r\npoint. AI. I really believe\r\n00:02:43.896\r\nwill FAQ And make people.\r\n00:02:47.200\r\nGoing to replace human\r\n00:02:48.301\r\nbeings, It will never\r\n00:02:49.569\r\nreplace human beings. and I\r\n00:02:51.104\r\nthink too many of the\r\n00:02:52.038\r\nleaders in the AI industry.\r\n00:02:53.572\r\nWhen they talk about this\r\n00:02:55.308\r\nfear of replacing workers,\r\n00:02:56.809\r\nI think they really missed\r\n00:02:58.043\r\nthe point. AI we believe\r\n00:02:59.846\r\nis going to make us more\r\n00:03:01.014\r\nproductive. more prosperous\r\n00:03:03.116\r\nand more free. The United\r\n00:03:05.418\r\nStates of America is the\r\n00:03:06.853\r\nleader in AI. and our\r\n00:03:08.421\r\nAdministration. plans to\r\n00:03:09.322\r\nkeep it that way.\r\n00:03:12.091\r\nThe US possess. All\r\n00:03:12.925\r\ncomponents of the full AI\r\n00:03:15.028\r\nstack. including Advanced\r\n00:03:17.497\r\nsemiconductor design.\r\n00:03:18.931\r\nFrontier. algorithms and\r\n00:03:20.133\r\nof course transformational\r\n00:03:21.801\r\napplications. Now, the\r\n00:03:23.703\r\ncomputing power this stack\r\n00:03:25.104\r\nrequires is integral to\r\n00:03:27.040\r\nadvancing AI technology. and\r\n00:03:29.309\r\na safeguard. America's\r\n00:03:30.710\r\nadvantage. The Trump\r\n00:03:32.145\r\nAdministration will ensure\r\n00:03:33.045\r\nthat the most powerful AI\r\n00:03:34.714\r\nsystems are built. in the\r\n00:03:36.249\r\nUS. with American designed\r\n00:03:38.518\r\nand manufactured chips.\r\n00:03:41.387\r\nnow, just because we're the\r\n00:03:42.254\r\nleader doesn't mean we\r\n00:03:43.122\r\nwant to or need to go\r\n00:03:44.691\r\nto a loan of course. And\r\n00:03:45.992\r\nlet me be emphatic about\r\n00:03:47.627\r\nthis point. America wants\r\n00:03:50.029\r\nto partner with all of\r\n00:03:50.930\r\nyou. and we want to\r\n00:03:52.732\r\nembark. on the AI\r\n00:03:54.233\r\nRevolution. before us. with\r\n00:03:56.602\r\nthe spirit of openness and\r\n00:03:58.805\r\ncollaboration. but, to\r\n00:04:01.941\r\ncreate that kind of trust.\r\n00:04:03.509\r\nwe need International\r\n00:04:05.011\r\nregulatory regimes. that\r\n00:04:07.213\r\nFosters, the creation of\r\n00:04:09.115\r\nAI technology. rather than\r\n00:04:11.617\r\nstrangles it. And we need\r\n00:04:12.418\r\nour European friends\r\n00:04:13.720\r\nin particular. to look to\r\n00:04:15.121\r\nthis new frontier with\r\n00:04:16.789\r\noptimism. rather than\r\n00:04:18.791\r\ntrepidation now, the\r\n00:04:20.293\r\ndevelopment of Cutting Edge\r\n00:04:21.394\r\nAI in the US, is no\r\n00:04:22.829\r\naccident. by preserving an\r\n00:04:24.897\r\nopen regulatory\r\n00:04:25.832\r\nenvironment. We've\r\n00:04:27.100\r\nencouraged American\r\n00:04:28.134\r\ninnovators to experiment.\r\n00:04:29.602\r\nand to make unparalleled\r\n00:04:31.104\r\nR&D Investments of these 700\r\n00:04:34.140\r\nbillion dollars give or\r\n00:04:35.141\r\ntake, that's estimated to\r\n00:04:36.542\r\nbe spent on AI in 2028\r\n00:04:38.845\r\nover half of, it will\r\n00:04:40.012\r\nlikely be invested in the\r\n00:04:41.314\r\nUnited States of America.\r\n00:04:43.649\r\nnow, this Administration\r\n00:04:44.584\r\nwill not be the 1 to Snuff\r\n00:04:45.885\r\nout the startups and the\r\n00:04:47.553\r\ngrad students producing\r\n00:04:49.021\r\nsome of the most\r\n00:04:50.223\r\ngroundbreaking applications\r\n00:04:51.624\r\nof artificial intelligence.\r\n00:04:53.993\r\ninstead. our laws will\r\n00:04:55.928\r\nkeep big Tech little Tech\r\n00:04:58.698\r\nand all other developers on\r\n00:05:00.433\r\na level. Playing Field.\r\n00:05:03.336\r\nnow, the president's recent\r\n00:05:04.437\r\nexecutive order on AI\r\n00:05:06.038\r\nwe're developing an AI\r\n00:05:06.806\r\naction plan that avoids\r\n00:05:08.541\r\nan overly precautionary.\r\n00:05:10.510\r\nregulatory regime. while\r\n00:05:12.211\r\nensuring that all Americans\r\n00:05:13.546\r\nbenefit from the technology\r\n00:05:14.747\r\nand its transformative\r\n00:05:16.115\r\npotential. and we invite\r\n00:05:17.717\r\nyour countries to work with\r\n00:05:19.118\r\nus. and to follow that\r\n00:05:20.620\r\nmodel. if it makes sense\r\n00:05:21.821\r\nfor your Nations. However,\r\n00:05:24.557\r\nthe Trump Administration. is\r\n00:05:26.359\r\ntroubled by reports that\r\n00:05:27.627\r\nsome foreign governments.\r\n00:05:29.195\r\nare considering tightening\r\n00:05:30.530\r\nthe screws on US tech\r\n00:05:32.498\r\ncompanies with International\r\n00:05:34.000\r\nfootprints. Now America\r\n00:05:35.835\r\ncannot and will not accept\r\n00:05:37.837\r\nthat and we think it's a\r\n00:05:39.305\r\nterrible mistake not just\r\n00:05:40.540\r\nfor the United States of\r\n00:05:41.641\r\nAmerica.

It will\r\n00:07:47.333\r\ncertainly make our health\r\n00:07:48.701\r\ncare providers better at\r\n00:07:50.102\r\ntreating diseases. but\r\n00:07:51.537\r\nit will also depend on the\r\n00:07:54.040\r\ndata produced by those\r\n00:07:54.974\r\nhealth care providers by\r\n00:07:55.841\r\nthose doctors. and nurses.\r\n00:07:58.311\r\nI believe it will help us\r\n00:07:59.445\r\ncreate. and store. new modes\r\n00:08:02.014\r\nof power. In the future.\r\n00:08:04.617\r\nbut right now ai cannot\r\n00:08:06.619\r\ntake off. unless the world\r\n00:08:08.721\r\nbuilds the in energy\r\n00:08:10.423\r\ninfrastructure to support\r\n00:08:11.624\r\nit. Now, it's my view\r\n00:08:13.626\r\nthat Tech Innovation over\r\n00:08:14.593\r\nthe last 20 years. has\r\n00:08:16.729\r\noften conjured images. of\r\n00:08:18.331\r\nsmart. people Staring at\r\n00:08:19.899\r\ncomputer screens.\r\n00:08:21.233\r\nEngineering in the world of\r\n00:08:22.835\r\nbits. but the AI economy\r\n00:08:24.737\r\nwill promote primarily\r\n00:08:26.238\r\ndepend on and transform.\r\n00:08:28.641\r\nthe world of atoms. Now,\r\n00:08:31.610\r\nat this moment, we Face the\r\n00:08:33.044\r\nextraordinary Prospect of a\r\n00:08:34.246\r\nnew Industrial Revolution.\r\n00:08:36.982\r\n1 on par with the invention\r\n00:08:37.783\r\nof the steam engine or\r\n00:08:40.019\r\nBessemer Steel. But it\r\n00:08:41.220\r\nwill never. come to pass.\r\n00:08:43.422\r\nif overregulation deters\r\n00:08:45.424\r\ninnovators from taking the\r\n00:08:46.626\r\nrisks necessary. to advance\r\n00:08:48.260\r\nthe ball. Nor will it\r\n00:08:50.363\r\noccur, if we allow AI to\r\n00:08:52.531\r\nbecome dominated by Massive\r\n00:08:54.433\r\nplayers looking to use the\r\n00:08:56.736\r\ntech to censor. or control\r\n00:08:58.904\r\nusers thoughts. And I'd ask\r\n00:09:00.906\r\nif you, step back\r\n00:09:02.541\r\na moment. And ask yourself.\r\n00:09:08.147\r\nMeaning, political leaders\r\n00:09:09.315\r\ngathered here today to do\r\n00:09:10.215\r\nthe most aggressive\r\n00:09:11.617\r\nregulation It is very\r\n00:09:13.319\r\noften The people who already\r\n00:09:14.720\r\nhave an incumbent advantage\r\n00:09:16.422\r\nin the market and when a\r\n00:09:18.390\r\nmassive incumbent comes to\r\n00:09:19.825\r\nus, asking us for safety\r\n00:09:22.328\r\nregulations. we ought to\r\n00:09:23.629\r\nask whether that safety\r\n00:09:25.131\r\nregulation is for the\r\n00:09:26.332\r\nbenefit of our people. or\r\n00:09:28.134\r\nwhether it's for the benefit\r\n00:09:29.068\r\nof the incumbent.

And\r\n00:10:05.004\r\nwhat we take from it, is\r\n00:10:06.138\r\nthat the Trump\r\n00:10:07.139\r\nAdministration will ensure\r\n00:10:09.008\r\nthe AI systems developed in\r\n00:10:10.743\r\nAmerica. are free from\r\n00:10:12.878\r\nideological bias. and never\r\n00:10:14.747\r\nrestrict our citizens,\r\n00:10:16.015\r\nright?

But as I know, and\r\n00:11:40.833\r\nI think some of this think\r\n00:11:42.234\r\nof us in this room have\r\n00:11:43.803\r\nlearned from experience.\r\n00:11:46.005\r\nPartnering with them means\r\n00:11:47.306\r\nchaining your nation to\r\n00:11:48.407\r\nan authoritarian master.\r\n00:11:50.342\r\nthat seeks to infiltrate\r\n00:11:51.610\r\ndig in and Seize your\r\n00:11:53.913\r\ninformation. infrastructure.\r\n00:11:56.448\r\nShould a deal seemed too\r\n00:11:57.316\r\ngood to be true, just\r\n00:11:58.317\r\nremember the old adage that\r\n00:11:59.718\r\nwe learned in Silicon\r\n00:12:00.719\r\nValley? if you aren't\r\n00:12:02.254\r\npaying for the product, you\r\n00:12:04.023\r\nare the product. Finally.\r\n00:12:07.626\r\nthis Administration wants\r\n00:12:08.427\r\nto be very clear about 1\r\n00:12:09.829\r\nlast point. We will\r\n00:12:11.330\r\nalways Center American\r\n00:12:12.832\r\nworkers. in our AI policy\r\n00:12:15.301\r\nWe refuse to view AI as\r\n00:12:17.937\r\na purely disruptive\r\n00:12:19.004\r\ntechnology. that will\r\n00:12:20.639\r\ninevitably automate away,\r\n00:12:21.941\r\nour labor force.

I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to President McCrone for hosting this event\u2014and for the lovely dinner last night. During dinner, President McCrone asked if I would speak, and I replied, \u201cMr. President, I'm here for the good company and free wine, but I have to earn my keep today.\u201d I also want to thank Prime Minister Modi for being here and for co-hosting this summit for everyone in attendance.\n\nI\u2019m not here this morning to discuss AI safety\u2014the title of a conference we held a couple of years ago. Today, I want to talk about the tremendous opportunity that AI represents. In discussions about cutting-edge technology, it\u2019s common to become overly cautious or risk averse. Yet never before has a breakthrough called us to act with such boldness.\n\n---\n\n**The Promise of AI and Our Four Key Points**\n\nThe Trump Administration firmly believes that AI will revolutionize our economy, enhance national security, drive innovation, and bolster free expression\u2014among many other benefits. Restricting AI\u2019s development now would not only unfairly benefit established players but also stifle one of the most promising technologies of our generation.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019d like to outline four main points:\n\n1. **Maintaining American Excellence:**  \n   We will ensure that American AI technology remains the global gold standard. Our goal is for the United States to be the partner of choice for countries and businesses as they expand their AI capabilities.\n\n2. **Avoiding Overregulation:**  \n   Excessive regulation could kill a transformative industry just as it is emerging. We will encourage pro-growth, deregulatory policies that foster innovation rather than stifle it.\n\n3. **Upholding Ideological Neutrality:**  \n   AI must remain free from ideological bias. American AI will never be used as a tool for authoritarian censorship.\n\n4. **Centering the American Worker:**  \n   We are committed to a pro-worker approach. AI should be a catalyst for job creation, making workers more productive and leading to higher wages, better benefits, and safer, more prosperous communities.\n\n---\n\n**Leadership, Partnership, and the American Advantage**\n\nI appreciate Prime Minister Modi\u2019s point that AI will not replace human beings. In fact, we believe AI will make us more productive, prosperous, and free. The United States leads in AI\u2014and we intend to keep it that way. The U.S. controls every component of the full AI stack, from advanced semiconductor design and frontier algorithms to transformational applications. The immense computing power needed to run these systems is essential to advancing AI and preserving our competitive advantage. That\u2019s why this Administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in America with American-designed and manufactured chips.\n\nYet leadership does not mean isolation. America is eager to partner with other nations and work together on this AI revolution. To build trust, we need international regulatory regimes that nurture innovation rather than strangle it. I especially call on our European friends to approach this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.\n\n---\n\n**Fostering Innovation and Global Competitiveness**\n\nThe success of U.S. AI innovation is no accident. By maintaining an open regulatory environment, we have spurred American innovators to experiment and invest in research and development. Of the roughly $700 billion projected to be spent on AI by 2028, over half will likely be invested in the United States.\n\nThis Administration will not stifle startups or graduate students creating groundbreaking AI applications. Our laws will keep big tech and small tech on a level playing field. With our recent executive order on AI, we\u2019re developing an action plan that avoids an overly precautionary regulatory regime while ensuring that every American benefits from AI\u2019s transformative potential. We invite your countries to consider similar models if they suit your national needs.\n\n---\n\n**Addressing International Regulatory Concerns**\n\nWe are deeply troubled by reports that some foreign governments plan to tighten restrictions on U.S. tech companies with international operations. America cannot\u2014and will not\u2014accept such measures. These policies are not only a mistake for us; they will hurt your own nations as well.\n\nU.S. innovators already struggle with onerous international rules. Many top tech companies face the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, which imposes massive regulations on content removal and the policing of \u201cmisinformation.\u201d While it\u2019s crucial to keep the Internet safe\u2014protecting children from predators, for example\u2014it is entirely different to restrict access to opinions simply because they are deemed \u201cmisinformation.\u201d For smaller firms, complying with the GDPR means endless legal costs or the risk of heavy fines. Some companies have chosen to block EU users altogether. Is that the future we want? I think not.\n\nWe stand at the frontier of an AI industry hungry for reliable power and high-quality semiconductors. Yet many of our friends are deindustrializing or seeking power beyond their national borders. The future of AI will be built\u2014from reliable power plants to advanced chip manufacturing facilities.\n\n---\n\n**The Physical Economy and a New Industrial Revolution**\n\nWhat excites me most about AI is that it is grounded in the real, physical economy. Success in this sector isn\u2019t just about brilliant people coding behind computer screens\u2014it depends on transforming our factories, enhancing healthcare, and gathering the vital data produced by doctors and nurses. AI can help us create and store new forms of power, but it cannot thrive unless we build the energy infrastructure to support it.\n\nFor too long, tech innovation has conjured images of a digital world. The coming AI economy, however, will transform the world of atoms. We now face the extraordinary prospect of a new industrial revolution\u2014on par with the invention of the steam engine or the advent of Bessemer steel. Yet this revolution will not materialize if overregulation stifles innovation or if massive incumbents use AI to censor or control thought.\n\nWhen leaders push for aggressive regulation, we must ask whether such measures truly benefit our people or merely serve those already entrenched in the market. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen government and nonprofit organizations use AI to push questionable social agendas\u2014like image generators that claimed George Washington was black or that America\u2019s World War I Doughboys were women. While we now laugh at those absurdities, they remind us why American AI systems must remain free of ideological bias and why free speech must never be curtailed.\n\n---\n\n**Protecting Our Technology and National Security**\n\nWe have seen hostile foreign adversaries weaponize AI to rewrite history, surveil citizens, and censor speech. Authoritarian regimes are using AI to boost military intelligence, capture private data, and produce propaganda designed to undermine national security. Let me be clear: this Administration will block such efforts\u2014full stop. We will safeguard American AI and chip technologies from theft and misuse and work with our allies to strengthen and extend these protections. We must also close any pathways that allow advertisers to gain AI capabilities that could threaten our society.\n\nI also urge our international friends to remember that partnering with authoritarian regimes chains your nation to an oppressive master. As the old Silicon Valley adage goes, \u201cif you aren\u2019t paying for the product, you are the product.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**A Worker-Centric Future in the Age of AI**\n\nThis Administration will always place American workers at the center of our AI policy. We refuse to view AI as a technology that will simply automate away our labor force. Instead, we believe\u2014and will fight for\u2014policies that make our workers more productive, ensuring they reap the benefits through higher wages, better benefits, and safer, more prosperous communities.\n\nFrom law and medicine to manufacturing, the most immediate applications of AI are designed to supplement American work, not replace it. With our worker-first approach, even businesses that have offshored roles will be drawn back to a U.S. labor force that is fully prepared to harness AI\u2019s potential. Our schools will train students to manage, supervise, and interact with AI as it becomes an integral part of everyday life. And as AI creates new jobs and industries, our government, businesses, and labor organizations have an obligation to empower workers\u2014not only here in the United States but around the world. For every major federal AI policy decision, American workers will have a seat at the table, and we are very proud of that.\n\n---\n\n**Closing Story and Call to Action**\n\nBefore I conclude, allow me to share a personal story. Yesterday, while touring the state with General Graet and my three children, I was shown a sword that once belonged to America\u2019s dearest international friend from our revolution\u2014the Marquis de Lafayette. Though I was allowed to hold the sword, I had to put on white gloves first. This small ceremony made me think of the rich heritage of France, the United States, and the beautiful civilization we have built together.\n\nJust as a saber is dangerous in the wrong hands but a powerful tool for liberty and prosperity in the right ones, so too can AI be either a threat or a tremendous opportunity. If we choose the wrong approach and hold ourselves back, we risk not only our economic output but the very future envisioned by Lafayette and the American Founders. This is not to say that safety concerns should be ignored; rather, we must focus on seizing the opportunity to \u201ccatch lightning in a bottle,\u201d unleash our most brilliant innovators, and use AI to improve the well-being of our nation and its people.\n\nI am confident that this is an opportunity the Trump Administration will not squander. I hope everyone here feels the same.\n\nThank you, and God bless you all.\n\n---"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"acee613d-7367-4841-ad98-144feaad8a2e","request_id":"91081866a9196041-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"acee613d-7367-4841-ad98-144feaad8a2e","children":[]}}}
