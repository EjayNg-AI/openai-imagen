This stance aligns with the Trump administration's hands-off approach, in contrast to Europe's tighter regulatory framework and China's state-backed expansion of AI technology. The U.S. and the UK both declined to sign an international pledge for responsible AI development, which China did sign, highlighting a growing global divide over AI governance. European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron, advocated for balanced regulation to maintain public trust in AI while fostering innovation.

While other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, advocated for common principles to ensure safe and equitable AI, the U.S. and U.K. refrained from endorsing the summit's joint declaration on those goals. Vance's stance drew contrasts with European efforts to balance competition with collaboration and safety in AI development.
