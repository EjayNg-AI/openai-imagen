Find the **smallest** possible value of \\(f(x)\\) and **justify**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(f(x)=2(x-2)^2+3\\). Since \\((x-2)^2\\ge0\\), \\(f(x)\\ge3\\).  \nSmallest value \\(=3\\) (at \\(x=2\\)).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Range of values\n**Q2.** Given \\(y=-3x^2+12x-7\\). Find the **range of possible values of \\(y\\)**. Justify.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(y=-3(x-2)^2+5\\). Since \\((x-2)^2\\ge0\\), \\(-3(x-2)^2\\le0\\), so \\(y\\le5\\).  \nRange: \\(\\boxed{y\\le5}\\) (maximum \\(5\\) at \\(x=2\\)).\n\n---\n\n## 3) \u201cShow that \u2026\u201d inequality (lower bound)\n**Q3.** Show that for all real \\(x\\),  \n\\[\n5x^2-20x+18\\ge -2.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(5x^2-20x+18=5(x-2)^2-2\\ge -2\\) since \\((x-2)^2\\ge0\\).

Minimum \\(=k-12\\).  \nSo \\(k-12=5\\Rightarrow \\boxed{k=17}\\). Range: \\(\\boxed{y\\ge5}\\).\n\n---\n\n## 9) Minimum then reciprocal range\n**Q9.** Find the **least value** of \\(x^2-4x+7\\). Hence find the **range** of  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2-4x+7}.\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(x^2-4x+7=(x-2)^2+3\\ge3\\). Least value \\(=3\\).  \nSo \\(0<\\dfrac{1}{x^2-4x+7}\\le \\dfrac13\\).  \nRange: \\(\\boxed{0<\\frac{1}{x^2-4x+7}\\le \\frac13}\\).\n\n---\n\n## 10) Range + solving an inequality\n**Q10.** Given \\(g(x)=2x^2-5x+4\\).  \n(i) Find the **range** of \\(g(x)\\).  \n(ii) Hence solve \\(2x^2-5x+4\\le1\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n(i) \\(g(x)=2\\left(x-\\tfrac54\\right)^2+\\tfrac78\\ge \\tfrac78\\).
