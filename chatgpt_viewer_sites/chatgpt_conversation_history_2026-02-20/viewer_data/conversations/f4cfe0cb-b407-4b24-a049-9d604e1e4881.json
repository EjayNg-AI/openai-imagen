Since the arrangement of these introduced impurities is crucial, the team provided a \u201crecipe\u201d for making the material, X-ray diffraction data on its structure and a chemical formula for the final product: Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O, where x is the concentration of copper atoms and is between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\n### First replication attempts come up short\n\nArmed with this information, many research groups (and at least one technically-knowledgeable \u301066\u2020amateur\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with access to good equipment) began synthesizing their own samples. \u201cThe possibilities within the claims of Lee, Kim et al. would be a game-changer for society if they would turn out to be true, so we of course wanted to be part of the history in case of a real breakthrough,\u201d says \u301067\u2020Ross Colman\u2020www.mff.cuni.cz\u3011, who participated in a \u301068\u2020live online replication attempt\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with colleagues at Charles University in Prague, Czechia.\n\n[Image 1]Superconductivity or bust: The starting materials in the \u201crecipe\u201d for synthesizing LK-99 include lead oxide. (Courtesy: Ross Colman)\n\nInitial experiments did not produce any breakthroughs. In one of the first \u301069\u2020reports\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301070\u2020V P S Awana\u2020awanavps.webs.com\u3011 and colleagues at India\u2019s \u301071\u2020CSIR-National Physical Laboratory\u2020www.nplindia.org\u3011 (NPL) synthesized a sample that became weakly magnetic when placed on a strong magnet, rather than expelling magnetic field like a superconductor would. Another \u301072\u2020early replication attempt\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, this one by \u301073\u2020Zhiqi Liu\u2020scholar.google.com.sg\u3011 and colleagues at Beihang University in Beijing, China, yielded a sample that behaved like a semiconductor, with a large room-temperature resistance.\n\nColman says these inconsistencies are partly due to the \u201cmessy\u201d nature of the instructions for synthesizing LK-99. \u201cWhilst the synthesis recipe is presented very simply, there are a number of inaccuracies or missing information,\u201d he says. Examples include the dimensions of the equipment used, how the temperature should change during different synthesis stages, and even the fact that the material becomes molten at 925 \u00b0C. \u201cA more detailed description would have prevented a lot of guesswork,\u201d he says.\n\n### A door opens a crack\u2026\n\nOn the theoretical side, things were slightly more encouraging. A team led by \u301074\u2020Xing-Qiu Chen\u2020english.synl.ac.cn\u3011 of China\u2019s Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science \u301075\u2020calculated\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 that a material with the formula Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O would contain electronic structures known as flat bands at the Fermi level, which is the highest energy level that an electron can occupy at 0 K. These flat bands can be a hallmark of superconductivity.\n\nIndependently, \u301076\u2020Sin\u00e9ad Griffin\u2020foundry.lbl.gov\u3011, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, came to a \u301077\u2020similar conclusion\u2020arxiv.org\u3011: swapping copper for lead in the appropriate place within Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O produces flat bands. Less promisingly, Griffin calculated that an experimentally easier substitution has no such effect. \u201cThis result hints to the synthesis challenge in obtaining Cu substituted on the appropriate site,\u201d she wrote.\n\n### \u2026and then slams shut\n\nDespite this caveat, the flat-band results were greeted with elation among LK-99\u2019s growing army of fans on social media. When Griffin \u301078\u2020posted her paper on Twitter/X\u2020twitter.com\u3011, accompanied by a \u201cmic drop\u201d GIF featuring former US president Barack Obama, the responses included \u201cThis is so badass\u201d and \u201cIncredibly based tweet\u201d.\n\nOver the next fortnight, though, the replication failures continued, and the air began to leak out of the hype bubble. A \u301079\u2020second effort\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 by the Indian NPL team used purer precursor materials and produced a sample with X-ray diffraction peaks that more closely matched those in the original arXiv papers. Alas, this new sample was not a superconductor either. It was diamagnetic, becoming magnetized in the opposite direction to the applied field.\n\n[Image 2: Superconductivity]Textbook case: A standard, low-temperature superconducting material levitates above a magnet. (Courtesy: iStock/ktsimage)\n\nThis is important, because one of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 was the material\u2019s ability to levitate when placed atop a strong magnet under ambient conditions. The Korean team interpreted this as being due to the Meissner effect, but diamagnetic objects (including \u301080\u2020frogs and strawberries\u2020www.ru.nl\u3011) will also levitate if the magnetic field is strong enough.\n\nAnother \u301081\u2020alternative explanation\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 for LK-99\u2019s levitation came from \u301082\u2020Shuang Jia\u2020icqm.pku.edu.cn\u3011 and colleagues at Peking University in Beijing. Although they persuaded \u201csome small flaky fragments\u201d of their synthesized sample to levitate, these levitating fragments \u201cubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft ferromagnetic components\u201d. Ferromagnetism, they wrote, can explain levitation in LK-99 without recourse to superconductivity.\n\n### A fuller picture emerges\n\nFor \u301083\u2020Andrei Bernevig\u2020phy.princeton.edu\u3011, a condensed-matter theorist at Princeton University, US, the varying results and associated hype are a source of frustration. \u201cA lot of the stuff early on was rushed and statements from all sides were unchecked,\u201d he tells Physics World. \u201cThe social media, memes, etc., have been completely detrimental to progress in this field in my view\u2026I hope we never do science like this again.\u201d\n\nTo provide concrete answers, Bernevig and his Princeton colleague \u301084\u2020Leslie Schoop\u2020chemistry.princeton.edu\u3011, together with collaborators in Spain, Germany and the University of Oregon, US, focused on a different question. Rather than investigating whether LK-99 exhibited signs of superconductivity, they began by asking: just what is LK-99, anyway?\n\nAfter synthesizing their own sample, the team performed X-ray diffraction measurements on the best crystal in the batch. This crystal turned out to \u301085\u2020contain at least three different components\u2020arxiv.org\u3011. \u201cThe","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":8,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":986,"end_ix":996,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Daily briefing: Spectacular new claim of room-temperature superconductivity","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00765-z","text":"\n\u301026\u2020Nature | 6 min read\u3011\n\n## \u301027\u2020A shot of sobriety\u2020gizmodo.com\u3011\n\nDrunk mice sobered up quickly when given a dose of the hormone FGF21.

Since the arrangement of these introduced impurities is crucial, the team provided a \u201crecipe\u201d for making the material, X-ray diffraction data on its structure and a chemical formula for the final product: Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O, where x is the concentration of copper atoms and is between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\n### First replication attempts come up short\n\nArmed with this information, many research groups (and at least one technically-knowledgeable \u301066\u2020amateur\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with access to good equipment) began synthesizing their own samples. \u201cThe possibilities within the claims of Lee, Kim et al. would be a game-changer for society if they would turn out to be true, so we of course wanted to be part of the history in case of a real breakthrough,\u201d says \u301067\u2020Ross Colman\u2020www.mff.cuni.cz\u3011, who participated in a \u301068\u2020live online replication attempt\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with colleagues at Charles University in Prague, Czechia.\n\n[Image 1]Superconductivity or bust: The starting materials in the \u201crecipe\u201d for synthesizing LK-99 include lead oxide. (Courtesy: Ross Colman)\n\nInitial experiments did not produce any breakthroughs. In one of the first \u301069\u2020reports\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301070\u2020V P S Awana\u2020awanavps.webs.com\u3011 and colleagues at India\u2019s \u301071\u2020CSIR-National Physical Laboratory\u2020www.nplindia.org\u3011 (NPL) synthesized a sample that became weakly magnetic when placed on a strong magnet, rather than expelling magnetic field like a superconductor would. Another \u301072\u2020early replication attempt\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, this one by \u301073\u2020Zhiqi Liu\u2020scholar.google.com.sg\u3011 and colleagues at Beihang University in Beijing, China, yielded a sample that behaved like a semiconductor, with a large room-temperature resistance.\n\nColman says these inconsistencies are partly due to the \u201cmessy\u201d nature of the instructions for synthesizing LK-99. \u201cWhilst the synthesis recipe is presented very simply, there are a number of inaccuracies or missing information,\u201d he says. Examples include the dimensions of the equipment used, how the temperature should change during different synthesis stages, and even the fact that the material becomes molten at 925 \u00b0C. \u201cA more detailed description would have prevented a lot of guesswork,\u201d he says.\n\n### A door opens a crack\u2026\n\nOn the theoretical side, things were slightly more encouraging. A team led by \u301074\u2020Xing-Qiu Chen\u2020english.synl.ac.cn\u3011 of China\u2019s Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science \u301075\u2020calculated\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 that a material with the formula Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O would contain electronic structures known as flat bands at the Fermi level, which is the highest energy level that an electron can occupy at 0 K. These flat bands can be a hallmark of superconductivity.\n\nIndependently, \u301076\u2020Sin\u00e9ad Griffin\u2020foundry.lbl.gov\u3011, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, came to a \u301077\u2020similar conclusion\u2020arxiv.org\u3011: swapping copper for lead in the appropriate place within Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O produces flat bands. Less promisingly, Griffin calculated that an experimentally easier substitution has no such effect. \u201cThis result hints to the synthesis challenge in obtaining Cu substituted on the appropriate site,\u201d she wrote.\n\n### \u2026and then slams shut\n\nDespite this caveat, the flat-band results were greeted with elation among LK-99\u2019s growing army of fans on social media. When Griffin \u301078\u2020posted her paper on Twitter/X\u2020twitter.com\u3011, accompanied by a \u201cmic drop\u201d GIF featuring former US president Barack Obama, the responses included \u201cThis is so badass\u201d and \u201cIncredibly based tweet\u201d.\n\nOver the next fortnight, though, the replication failures continued, and the air began to leak out of the hype bubble. A \u301079\u2020second effort\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 by the Indian NPL team used purer precursor materials and produced a sample with X-ray diffraction peaks that more closely matched those in the original arXiv papers. Alas, this new sample was not a superconductor either. It was diamagnetic, becoming magnetized in the opposite direction to the applied field.\n\n[Image 2: Superconductivity]Textbook case: A standard, low-temperature superconducting material levitates above a magnet. (Courtesy: iStock/ktsimage)\n\nThis is important, because one of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 was the material\u2019s ability to levitate when placed atop a strong magnet under ambient conditions. The Korean team interpreted this as being due to the Meissner effect, but diamagnetic objects (including \u301080\u2020frogs and strawberries\u2020www.ru.nl\u3011) will also levitate if the magnetic field is strong enough.\n\nAnother \u301081\u2020alternative explanation\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 for LK-99\u2019s levitation came from \u301082\u2020Shuang Jia\u2020icqm.pku.edu.cn\u3011 and colleagues at Peking University in Beijing. Although they persuaded \u201csome small flaky fragments\u201d of their synthesized sample to levitate, these levitating fragments \u201cubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft ferromagnetic components\u201d. Ferromagnetism, they wrote, can explain levitation in LK-99 without recourse to superconductivity.\n\n### A fuller picture emerges\n\nFor \u301083\u2020Andrei Bernevig\u2020phy.princeton.edu\u3011, a condensed-matter theorist at Princeton University, US, the varying results and associated hype are a source of frustration. \u201cA lot of the stuff early on was rushed and statements from all sides were unchecked,\u201d he tells Physics World. \u201cThe social media, memes, etc., have been completely detrimental to progress in this field in my view\u2026I hope we never do science like this again.\u201d\n\nTo provide concrete answers, Bernevig and his Princeton colleague \u301084\u2020Leslie Schoop\u2020chemistry.princeton.edu\u3011, together with collaborators in Spain, Germany and the University of Oregon, US, focused on a different question. Rather than investigating whether LK-99 exhibited signs of superconductivity, they began by asking: just what is LK-99, anyway?\n\nAfter synthesizing their own sample, the team performed X-ray diffraction measurements on the best crystal in the batch. This crystal turned out to \u301085\u2020contain at least three different components\u2020arxiv.org\u3011. \u201cThe","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":8,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"cfa695bb-43f7-45b2-8162-730dc4dde852","request_id":"89d64abe0ea58336-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","content_references":[{"matched_text":"\u30107\u2020source\u3011","start_idx":574,"end_idx":584,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"Daily briefing: Spectacular new claim of room-temperature superconductivity","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00765-z","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\n\u301026\u2020Nature | 6 min read\u3011\n\n## \u301027\u2020A shot of sobriety\u2020gizmodo.com\u3011\n\nDrunk mice sobered up quickly when given a dose of the hormone FGF21.

Since the arrangement of these introduced impurities is crucial, the team provided a \u201crecipe\u201d for making the material, X-ray diffraction data on its structure and a chemical formula for the final product: Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O, where x is the concentration of copper atoms and is between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\n### First replication attempts come up short\n\nArmed with this information, many research groups (and at least one technically-knowledgeable \u301066\u2020amateur\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with access to good equipment) began synthesizing their own samples. \u201cThe possibilities within the claims of Lee, Kim et al. would be a game-changer for society if they would turn out to be true, so we of course wanted to be part of the history in case of a real breakthrough,\u201d says \u301067\u2020Ross Colman\u2020www.mff.cuni.cz\u3011, who participated in a \u301068\u2020live online replication attempt\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with colleagues at Charles University in Prague, Czechia.\n\n[Image 1]Superconductivity or bust: The starting materials in the \u201crecipe\u201d for synthesizing LK-99 include lead oxide. (Courtesy: Ross Colman)\n\nInitial experiments did not produce any breakthroughs. In one of the first \u301069\u2020reports\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301070\u2020V P S Awana\u2020awanavps.webs.com\u3011 and colleagues at India\u2019s \u301071\u2020CSIR-National Physical Laboratory\u2020www.nplindia.org\u3011 (NPL) synthesized a sample that became weakly magnetic when placed on a strong magnet, rather than expelling magnetic field like a superconductor would. Another \u301072\u2020early replication attempt\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, this one by \u301073\u2020Zhiqi Liu\u2020scholar.google.com.sg\u3011 and colleagues at Beihang University in Beijing, China, yielded a sample that behaved like a semiconductor, with a large room-temperature resistance.\n\nColman says these inconsistencies are partly due to the \u201cmessy\u201d nature of the instructions for synthesizing LK-99. \u201cWhilst the synthesis recipe is presented very simply, there are a number of inaccuracies or missing information,\u201d he says. Examples include the dimensions of the equipment used, how the temperature should change during different synthesis stages, and even the fact that the material becomes molten at 925 \u00b0C. \u201cA more detailed description would have prevented a lot of guesswork,\u201d he says.\n\n### A door opens a crack\u2026\n\nOn the theoretical side, things were slightly more encouraging. A team led by \u301074\u2020Xing-Qiu Chen\u2020english.synl.ac.cn\u3011 of China\u2019s Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science \u301075\u2020calculated\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 that a material with the formula Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O would contain electronic structures known as flat bands at the Fermi level, which is the highest energy level that an electron can occupy at 0 K. These flat bands can be a hallmark of superconductivity.\n\nIndependently, \u301076\u2020Sin\u00e9ad Griffin\u2020foundry.lbl.gov\u3011, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, came to a \u301077\u2020similar conclusion\u2020arxiv.org\u3011: swapping copper for lead in the appropriate place within Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O produces flat bands. Less promisingly, Griffin calculated that an experimentally easier substitution has no such effect. \u201cThis result hints to the synthesis challenge in obtaining Cu substituted on the appropriate site,\u201d she wrote.\n\n### \u2026and then slams shut\n\nDespite this caveat, the flat-band results were greeted with elation among LK-99\u2019s growing army of fans on social media. When Griffin \u301078\u2020posted her paper on Twitter/X\u2020twitter.com\u3011, accompanied by a \u201cmic drop\u201d GIF featuring former US president Barack Obama, the responses included \u201cThis is so badass\u201d and \u201cIncredibly based tweet\u201d.\n\nOver the next fortnight, though, the replication failures continued, and the air began to leak out of the hype bubble. A \u301079\u2020second effort\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 by the Indian NPL team used purer precursor materials and produced a sample with X-ray diffraction peaks that more closely matched those in the original arXiv papers. Alas, this new sample was not a superconductor either. It was diamagnetic, becoming magnetized in the opposite direction to the applied field.\n\n[Image 2: Superconductivity]Textbook case: A standard, low-temperature superconducting material levitates above a magnet. (Courtesy: iStock/ktsimage)\n\nThis is important, because one of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 was the material\u2019s ability to levitate when placed atop a strong magnet under ambient conditions. The Korean team interpreted this as being due to the Meissner effect, but diamagnetic objects (including \u301080\u2020frogs and strawberries\u2020www.ru.nl\u3011) will also levitate if the magnetic field is strong enough.\n\nAnother \u301081\u2020alternative explanation\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 for LK-99\u2019s levitation came from \u301082\u2020Shuang Jia\u2020icqm.pku.edu.cn\u3011 and colleagues at Peking University in Beijing. Although they persuaded \u201csome small flaky fragments\u201d of their synthesized sample to levitate, these levitating fragments \u201cubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft ferromagnetic components\u201d. Ferromagnetism, they wrote, can explain levitation in LK-99 without recourse to superconductivity.\n\n### A fuller picture emerges\n\nFor \u301083\u2020Andrei Bernevig\u2020phy.princeton.edu\u3011, a condensed-matter theorist at Princeton University, US, the varying results and associated hype are a source of frustration. \u201cA lot of the stuff early on was rushed and statements from all sides were unchecked,\u201d he tells Physics World. \u201cThe social media, memes, etc., have been completely detrimental to progress in this field in my view\u2026I hope we never do science like this again.\u201d\n\nTo provide concrete answers, Bernevig and his Princeton colleague \u301084\u2020Leslie Schoop\u2020chemistry.princeton.edu\u3011, together with collaborators in Spain, Germany and the University of Oregon, US, focused on a different question. Rather than investigating whether LK-99 exhibited signs of superconductivity, they began by asking: just what is LK-99, anyway?\n\nAfter synthesizing their own sample, the team performed X-ray diffraction measurements on the best crystal in the batch. This crystal turned out to \u301085\u2020contain at least three different components\u2020arxiv.org\u3011. \u201cThe","attribution":"physicsworld.com","icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u30107\u2020source\u3011","start_idx":986,"end_idx":996,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"Daily briefing: Spectacular new claim of room-temperature superconductivity","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00765-z","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\n\u301026\u2020Nature | 6 min read\u3011\n\n## \u301027\u2020A shot of sobriety\u2020gizmodo.com\u3011\n\nDrunk mice sobered up quickly when given a dose of the hormone FGF21.

Since the arrangement of these introduced impurities is crucial, the team provided a \u201crecipe\u201d for making the material, X-ray diffraction data on its structure and a chemical formula for the final product: Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O, where x is the concentration of copper atoms and is between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\n### First replication attempts come up short\n\nArmed with this information, many research groups (and at least one technically-knowledgeable \u301066\u2020amateur\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with access to good equipment) began synthesizing their own samples. \u201cThe possibilities within the claims of Lee, Kim et al. would be a game-changer for society if they would turn out to be true, so we of course wanted to be part of the history in case of a real breakthrough,\u201d says \u301067\u2020Ross Colman\u2020www.mff.cuni.cz\u3011, who participated in a \u301068\u2020live online replication attempt\u2020twitter.com\u3011 with colleagues at Charles University in Prague, Czechia.\n\n[Image 1]Superconductivity or bust: The starting materials in the \u201crecipe\u201d for synthesizing LK-99 include lead oxide. (Courtesy: Ross Colman)\n\nInitial experiments did not produce any breakthroughs. In one of the first \u301069\u2020reports\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301070\u2020V P S Awana\u2020awanavps.webs.com\u3011 and colleagues at India\u2019s \u301071\u2020CSIR-National Physical Laboratory\u2020www.nplindia.org\u3011 (NPL) synthesized a sample that became weakly magnetic when placed on a strong magnet, rather than expelling magnetic field like a superconductor would. Another \u301072\u2020early replication attempt\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, this one by \u301073\u2020Zhiqi Liu\u2020scholar.google.com.sg\u3011 and colleagues at Beihang University in Beijing, China, yielded a sample that behaved like a semiconductor, with a large room-temperature resistance.\n\nColman says these inconsistencies are partly due to the \u201cmessy\u201d nature of the instructions for synthesizing LK-99. \u201cWhilst the synthesis recipe is presented very simply, there are a number of inaccuracies or missing information,\u201d he says. Examples include the dimensions of the equipment used, how the temperature should change during different synthesis stages, and even the fact that the material becomes molten at 925 \u00b0C. \u201cA more detailed description would have prevented a lot of guesswork,\u201d he says.\n\n### A door opens a crack\u2026\n\nOn the theoretical side, things were slightly more encouraging. A team led by \u301074\u2020Xing-Qiu Chen\u2020english.synl.ac.cn\u3011 of China\u2019s Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science \u301075\u2020calculated\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 that a material with the formula Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O would contain electronic structures known as flat bands at the Fermi level, which is the highest energy level that an electron can occupy at 0 K. These flat bands can be a hallmark of superconductivity.\n\nIndependently, \u301076\u2020Sin\u00e9ad Griffin\u2020foundry.lbl.gov\u3011, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, came to a \u301077\u2020similar conclusion\u2020arxiv.org\u3011: swapping copper for lead in the appropriate place within Pb 10\u2212x Cu_{x}(PO_{4})_{6}O produces flat bands. Less promisingly, Griffin calculated that an experimentally easier substitution has no such effect. \u201cThis result hints to the synthesis challenge in obtaining Cu substituted on the appropriate site,\u201d she wrote.\n\n### \u2026and then slams shut\n\nDespite this caveat, the flat-band results were greeted with elation among LK-99\u2019s growing army of fans on social media. When Griffin \u301078\u2020posted her paper on Twitter/X\u2020twitter.com\u3011, accompanied by a \u201cmic drop\u201d GIF featuring former US president Barack Obama, the responses included \u201cThis is so badass\u201d and \u201cIncredibly based tweet\u201d.\n\nOver the next fortnight, though, the replication failures continued, and the air began to leak out of the hype bubble. A \u301079\u2020second effort\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 by the Indian NPL team used purer precursor materials and produced a sample with X-ray diffraction peaks that more closely matched those in the original arXiv papers. Alas, this new sample was not a superconductor either. It was diamagnetic, becoming magnetized in the opposite direction to the applied field.\n\n[Image 2: Superconductivity]Textbook case: A standard, low-temperature superconducting material levitates above a magnet. (Courtesy: iStock/ktsimage)\n\nThis is important, because one of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 was the material\u2019s ability to levitate when placed atop a strong magnet under ambient conditions. The Korean team interpreted this as being due to the Meissner effect, but diamagnetic objects (including \u301080\u2020frogs and strawberries\u2020www.ru.nl\u3011) will also levitate if the magnetic field is strong enough.\n\nAnother \u301081\u2020alternative explanation\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 for LK-99\u2019s levitation came from \u301082\u2020Shuang Jia\u2020icqm.pku.edu.cn\u3011 and colleagues at Peking University in Beijing. Although they persuaded \u201csome small flaky fragments\u201d of their synthesized sample to levitate, these levitating fragments \u201cubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft ferromagnetic components\u201d. Ferromagnetism, they wrote, can explain levitation in LK-99 without recourse to superconductivity.\n\n### A fuller picture emerges\n\nFor \u301083\u2020Andrei Bernevig\u2020phy.princeton.edu\u3011, a condensed-matter theorist at Princeton University, US, the varying results and associated hype are a source of frustration. \u201cA lot of the stuff early on was rushed and statements from all sides were unchecked,\u201d he tells Physics World. \u201cThe social media, memes, etc., have been completely detrimental to progress in this field in my view\u2026I hope we never do science like this again.\u201d\n\nTo provide concrete answers, Bernevig and his Princeton colleague \u301084\u2020Leslie Schoop\u2020chemistry.princeton.edu\u3011, together with collaborators in Spain, Germany and the University of Oregon, US, focused on a different question. Rather than investigating whether LK-99 exhibited signs of superconductivity, they began by asking: just what is LK-99, anyway?\n\nAfter synthesizing their own sample, the team performed X-ray diffraction measurements on the best crystal in the batch. This crystal turned out to \u301085\u2020contain at least three different components\u2020arxiv.org\u3011. \u201cThe","attribution":"physicsworld.com","icon_type":null}],"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cfa695bb-43f7-45b2-8162-730dc4dde852","children":["aaa22dc2-1230-417d-878b-8727d09d10c4"]},"aaa22dc2-1230-417d-878b-8727d09d10c4":{"id":"aaa22dc2-1230-417d-878b-8727d09d10c4","message":{"id":"aaa22dc2-1230-417d-878b-8727d09d10c4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720003696.530397,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What are the main technological and scientific hurdles that must be overcome?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"89d64d5bfa74823b-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b0bf557c-9988-41f2-93d2-5e581de74306","children":["e81ae724-bd65-4dab-b193-668bee035cb7"]},"e81ae724-bd65-4dab-b193-668bee035cb7":{"id":"e81ae724-bd65-4dab-b193-668bee035cb7","message":{"id":"e81ae724-bd65-4dab-b193-668bee035cb7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720003714.154059,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Achieving room-temperature superconductivity faces several significant technological and scientific hurdles:\n\n1. **Material Stability**:\n   - **Hydrogen-Rich Compounds**: Many promising superconductors require extremely high pressures to remain stable, such as hydrogen sulfide, which becomes superconducting at around 203 K but under pressures above 150 GPa. Developing materials that are stable at ambient pressures while maintaining superconducting properties is a major challenge\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Synthesis and Reproducibility**:\n   - **Consistency**: The synthesis of new superconducting materials often results in inconsistencies. For example, LK-99\u2019s replication attempts failed due to \"messy\" instructions and the sensitive nature of the synthesis process, leading to different results across various laboratories\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Understanding Mechanisms**:\n   - **Electronic Structure**: A detailed understanding of the electronic mechanisms that lead to superconductivity at higher temperatures is still developing.

Alas, this new sample was not a superconductor either. It was diamagnetic, becoming magnetized in the opposite direction to the applied field.\n\n[Image 2: Superconductivity]Textbook case: A standard, low-temperature superconducting material levitates above a magnet. (Courtesy: iStock/ktsimage)\n\nThis is important, because one of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 was the material\u2019s ability to levitate when placed atop a strong magnet under ambient conditions. The Korean team interpreted this as being due to the Meissner effect, but diamagnetic objects (including \u301080\u2020frogs and strawberries\u2020www.ru.nl\u3011) will also levitate if the magnetic field is strong enough.\n\nAnother \u301081\u2020alternative explanation\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 for LK-99\u2019s levitation came from \u301082\u2020Shuang Jia\u2020icqm.pku.edu.cn\u3011 and colleagues at Peking University in Beijing. Although they persuaded \u201csome small flaky fragments\u201d of their synthesized sample to levitate, these levitating fragments \u201cubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft ferromagnetic components\u201d. Ferromagnetism, they wrote, can explain levitation in LK-99 without recourse to superconductivity.\n\n### A fuller picture emerges\n\nFor \u301083\u2020Andrei Bernevig\u2020phy.princeton.edu\u3011, a condensed-matter theorist at Princeton University, US, the varying results and associated hype are a source of frustration. \u201cA lot of the stuff early on was rushed and statements from all sides were unchecked,\u201d he tells Physics World. \u201cThe social media, memes, etc., have been completely detrimental to progress in this field in my view\u2026I hope we never do science like this again.\u201d\n\nTo provide concrete answers, Bernevig and his Princeton colleague \u301084\u2020Leslie Schoop\u2020chemistry.princeton.edu\u3011, together with collaborators in Spain, Germany and the University of Oregon, US, focused on a different question. Rather than investigating whether LK-99 exhibited signs of superconductivity, they began by asking: just what is LK-99, anyway?\n\nAfter synthesizing their own sample, the team performed X-ray diffraction measurements on the best crystal in the batch. This crystal turned out to \u301085\u2020contain at least three different components\u2020arxiv.org\u3011. \u201cThe","attribution":"physicsworld.com","icon_type":null}],"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa22dc2-1230-417d-878b-8727d09d10c4","children":[]}}}
