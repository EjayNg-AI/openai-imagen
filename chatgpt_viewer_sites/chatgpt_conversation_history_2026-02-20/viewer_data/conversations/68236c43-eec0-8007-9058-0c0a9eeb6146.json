Developed as a specialized form of CBT, it integrates the principles of sleep medicine with behavioral therapy to address insomnia by changing sleep-related behaviors and thought patterns. Over the past 15 years, Michael Perlis and Donn Posner have trained providers in CBT-I, and the demand for this training has significantly increased.\n\nCBT-I involves two main components: Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) and Stimulus Control Therapy (SCT). These techniques aim to improve sleep efficiency and reinforce the association between the bedroom environment and sleep. Additional elements include sleep hygiene and cognitive therapy to address habits and thoughts detrimental to sleep.\n\nCBT-I has shown success in about 70-80% of individuals with chronic insomnia, and its benefits extend to conditions like chronic pain and anxiety co-morbidities. Compared to other treatments like medication, CBT-I is durable and lacks adverse side effects.\n\nDespite its effectiveness, CBT-I is underutilized due to limited access to trained providers and the initial difficulties experienced by some patients. It is recommended as the first-line treatment by leading medical institutions. Individuals struggling with sleep issues should seek out qualified CBT-I providers and consider interim solutions like apps or self-help tools if immediate access to a therapist is not available.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1727107200.0,"attribution":"The Guardian"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68236c5bb6d48007a4dccb580c85606d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"ebbf0601-52ed-4ba1-9004-ea1a6021f616","request_id":"93f35c47ad07fe1d-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ebbf0601-52ed-4ba1-9004-ea1a6021f616","children":["3c97e7f1-23fb-45f8-ada3-6eec77c6f14a"]},"3c97e7f1-23fb-45f8-ada3-6eec77c6f14a":{"id":"3c97e7f1-23fb-45f8-ada3-6eec77c6f14a","message":{"id":"3c97e7f1-23fb-45f8-ada3-6eec77c6f14a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1747151976.277672,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating sleep suggestions","content":"Your friend\u2019s insomnia might be due to several factors like anxiety, caffeine sensitivity, or even medical issues like sleep apnea.

Men in their 40s are a peak-incidence group even if not obese. | Overnight home polygraph or in-lab polysomnography ordered by a sleep physician. |\n| **Restless-legs / periodic-limb-movement disorder** | Causes sudden cortical arousal at sleep onset. | Look for urge to move legs at night; lab study confirms. |\n| **Hyper- or hypo-thyroidism, late-evening cortisol surges, low testosterone** | Endocrine hyper-arousal can sabotage sleep despite perfect hygiene. | Basic 8 a.m. labs: TSH, free T4/T3, fasting cortisol, total & free testosterone. |\n| **Slow caffeine metabolism (CYP1A2 polymorphism)** | Even 7:30 a.m. coffee can leave >25 % caffeine in plasma 16 h later in slow metabolisers. | Temporary 2-week caffeine holiday. |\n| **Circadian mis-timing (delayed phase)** | If natural DLMO (dim-light melatonin onset) is after 23:00, you\u2019ll fight biology. | Salivary melatonin kit or actigraphy; look for \u201csecond wind\u201d in late evening. |\n\n---\n\n## 2  Treat the **hyper-arousal / performance-anxiety** loop directly\n\nModern insomnia models see chronic insomnia as a conditioned *fear of not sleeping* that keeps the cortex vigilant even when the body is ready.  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) therefore names **Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)** the first-line treatment, ahead of any drug \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0news30\ue201.\n\nKey CBT-I modules (even if you already practise \u201csleep restriction\u201d)  \n\n| Module | What it targets | Self-help option while you wait for a therapist |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Stimulus-control rules refined** | Breaks the bed-wake association (\u201cbed = performance test\u201d) | Follow the \u201c15-minute rule\u201d strictly; get out of bed *every* time your mind re-lights, even at 3 a.m. |\n| **Cognitive restructuring** | Catastrophic thoughts (\u201cIf I don\u2019t sleep I\u2019ll be useless tomorrow\u201d) amplify arousal | Write a *worry log* at 20:00, list worst-case + rational counter; keep it **out** of the bedroom. |\n| **Paradoxical Intention (PI)** | Reduces sleep performance anxiety by instructing you to *stay awake on purpose* in the dark | A 2024 RCT revived PI and showed significant reductions in sleep-onset worry \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.

These techniques aim to improve sleep efficiency and reinforce the association between the bedroom environment and sleep. Additional elements include sleep hygiene and cognitive therapy to address habits and thoughts detrimental to sleep.\n\nCBT-I has shown success in about 70-80% of individuals with chronic insomnia, and its benefits extend to conditions like chronic pain and anxiety co-morbidities. Compared to other treatments like medication, CBT-I is durable and lacks adverse side effects.\n\nDespite its effectiveness, CBT-I is underutilized due to limited access to trained providers and the initial difficulties experienced by some patients. It is recommended as the first-line treatment by leading medical institutions. Individuals struggling with sleep issues should seek out qualified CBT-I providers and consider interim solutions like apps or self-help tools if immediate access to a therapist is not available.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6350,"end_idx":6350,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia","url":"https://aasm.org/digital-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-insomnia-platforms-and-characteristics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"AASM"},{"title":"Trouble sleeping?

Supplements should complement healthy sleep habits, not replace them, and should only be used after establishing good sleep hygiene. Common supplements like melatonin can have side effects and are not recommended for long-term use or for certain individuals, such as those with dementia or those taking specific medications. Other sleep aids, like magnesium, lavender, CBD oil, and chamomile, have shown mixed results in studies, and more research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety.

Chronic insomnia, which lasts for over three months and occurs multiple nights a week, can be highly debilitating and is linked with serious health risks like hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment involving sleep restriction therapy and new habit formation around sleep. This method includes keeping a sleep diary and adjusting sleep schedules to consolidate sleep periods. Though initially exhausting, it can significantly improve sleep efficiency. CBT-I also emphasizes good sleep hygiene, like reducing screen time before bed, managing stress, and avoiding stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. Additionally, while medications can sometimes be necessary, especially in severe cases, reliance on over-the-counter sleep aids is discouraged.
