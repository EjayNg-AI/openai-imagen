The \u201cultraviolet\u201d in physics\n\nIn physics, \u201cultraviolet\u201d (UV) is a metaphor for **high energies or short wavelengths**.  \nLikewise, \u201cinfrared\u201d (IR) refers to **low energies or long wavelengths**.\n\nWhen we say a theory is \u201cUV complete,\u201d we mean that **it does not break down when probed at arbitrarily high energies** \u2014 it continues to give finite, physically meaningful results without requiring additional new physics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why most theories are *not* UV complete\n\nMany quantum field theories (QFTs) are only **effective theories** \u2014 they are valid up to some cutoff energy \u039b, beyond which new degrees of freedom or interactions must appear.  \n\nFor example:\n\n- The **Fermi theory of weak interactions** (four-fermion interaction) works well at low energies but diverges at energies above about 100 GeV \u2014 replaced by the **Standard Model** with W and Z bosons.\n- The **Standard Model itself** might not be UV complete, because:\n  - Gravity is not included.\n  - Running couplings might blow up (Landau poles).\n  - It may cease to make sense above some scale, e.g. the Planck scale.\n\nThus, we call the Standard Model an **effective field theory** (EFT), valid up to a cutoff scale (~10\u00b9\u2079 GeV at best).\n\n---\n\n### 3. What \u201cUV completion\u201d means mathematically\n\nA theory is **UV complete** if:\n\n- All coupling constants remain finite as energy \u2192 \u221e (no Landau poles),\n- The renormalization group (RG) flow approaches a **fixed point** at high energy \u2014 meaning the theory becomes scale-invariant (asymptotic freedom or asymptotic safety),\n- Or equivalently, no new degrees of freedom need to be introduced to make sense of the theory at arbitrarily small length scales.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Examples\n\n| Theory | UV Complete? | Notes |\n|--------|---------------|-------|\n| Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) | \u274c No | Has a **Landau pole** at ~10\u00b2\u2078 eV \u2014 not UV complete. |\n| Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) | \u2705 Yes | **Asymptotically free** \u2014 couplings vanish at high energies. |\n| General Relativity (GR) | \u274c No | Becomes non-renormalizable at the Planck scale. |\n| String Theory | \u2705 (conjectured) | Provides a finite high-energy completion of QFT + gravity. |\n| Standard Model | \u274c (likely not) | Effective up to the Planck scale or GUT scale. |\n| Asymptotically Safe Gravity | \u2705 (if true) | Hypothetical fixed-point completion of quantum gravity. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Two main mechanisms for UV completion\n\n1. **Asymptotic freedom**  \n   \u2013 Couplings \u2192 0 as E \u2192 \u221e (e.g. QCD).  \n   The theory becomes non-interacting in the UV.\n\n2. **Asymptotic safety**  \n   \u2013 Couplings approach a **finite nonzero fixed point** under the RG flow.  \n   Proposed for gravity and some scalar theories.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Relation to Effective Field Theories (EFTs)\n\nMost of modern physics uses EFTs, where you **don\u2019t need** UV completeness for accurate predictions within accessible energy ranges.  \nEFTs capture the correct low-energy behavior while leaving open what happens at higher energies.\n\nBut a UV complete theory serves as the *ultimate completion* of an EFT \u2014 defining the physics at all scales and preventing infinities from creeping in at high energies.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Why physicists care\n\nUV completeness ensures **predictivity and consistency** of a theory across all scales.  \nWithout it, a theory requires **arbitrary cutoffs**, losing explanatory power as one approaches high energies.  \nThus, finding a UV complete theory of **quantum gravity** \u2014 such as string theory or asymptotically safe gravity \u2014 is one of the great goals of theoretical physics.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to illustrate this concept with a **renormalization group flow diagram** showing how coupling constants behave for asymptotically free vs. non-free theories?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98aaab13ecfbce7e-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"90689203-6d7a-45a3-9da4-92852cffc10e","turn_exchange_id":"6a0db6ad-f159-4cb5-9dd8-e38aa8a87800","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"90689203-6d7a-45a3-9da4-92852cffc10e","children":["e889a554-68a4-4b66-8737-7afafe55388c"]},"e889a554-68a4-4b66-8737-7afafe55388c":{"id":"e889a554-68a4-4b66-8737-7afafe55388c","message":{"id":"e889a554-68a4-4b66-8737-7afafe55388c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759811783.501,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If QED is needed to frame the electroweak unification, wouldn't that mean the unification is still not complete?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98aab27f1e32ce7e-BOM","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"05301abf-5b86-45aa-8f6c-3ec7fcedae84","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"16cdf8ff-9040-421d-9134-dd0ae37f05d5","children":["e1bd985f-f410-4d1f-a403-752bba2898f6"]},"e1bd985f-f410-4d1f-a403-752bba2898f6":{"id":"e1bd985f-f410-4d1f-a403-752bba2898f6","message":{"id":"e1bd985f-f410-4d1f-a403-752bba2898f6","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759811788.6600034,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"98aab27f1e32ce7e-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"e889a554-68a4-4b66-8737-7afafe55388c","turn_exchange_id":"05301abf-5b86-45aa-8f6c-3ec7fcedae84","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e889a554-68a4-4b66-8737-7afafe55388c","children":["8952d1ff-7938-4958-a007-b6e0668e6451"]},"8952d1ff-7938-4958-a007-b6e0668e6451":{"id":"8952d1ff-7938-4958-a007-b6e0668e6451","message":{"id":"8952d1ff-7938-4958-a007-b6e0668e6451","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759811788.6834514,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"98aab27f1e32ce7e-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"e1bd985f-f410-4d1f-a403-752bba2898f6","turn_exchange_id":"05301abf-5b86-45aa-8f6c-3ec7fcedae84","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e1bd985f-f410-4d1f-a403-752bba2898f6","children":["140f0902-2c21-4086-a433-85645fe97dae"]},"140f0902-2c21-4086-a433-85645fe97dae":{"id":"140f0902-2c21-4086-a433-85645fe97dae","message":{"id":"140f0902-2c21-4086-a433-85645fe97dae","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759811788.820803,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Explaining electroweak unification","content":"The electroweak unification uses the SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge theory.

But also **yes**\u2014if by \u201ccomplete\u201d you mean *UV-complete*, then the electroweak sector (because it contains an Abelian factor) is **not** UV complete.\n\nHere\u2019s the precise picture.\n\n## 1) What electroweak unification actually is\n- The EW theory is a single gauge theory with group  \n  \\[\n  SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y\n  \\]\n  with couplings \\(g\\) and \\(g'\\).\n- After the Higgs gets a vacuum expectation value \\(v\\), the symmetry breaks to\n  \\[\n  SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y \\;\\longrightarrow\\; U(1)_{\\text{em}} .\n  \\]\n- The physical photon \\(A_\\mu\\) and \\(Z_\\mu\\) are mixtures of the weak-isospin \\(W^3_\\mu\\) and hypercharge \\(B_\\mu\\):\n  \\[\n  \\begin{pmatrix} A_\\mu \\\\ Z_\\mu \\end{pmatrix}\n  =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\cos\\theta_W & \\sin\\theta_W \\\\\n  -\\sin\\theta_W& \\cos\\theta_W\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\begin{pmatrix} B_\\mu \\\\ W^3_\\mu \\end{pmatrix},\n  \\qquad\n  e = g\\sin\\theta_W = g'\\cos\\theta_W.\n  \\]\n- Electric charge is \\(Q = T_3 + \\tfrac{Y}{2}\\).  \n  **QED is just the unbroken \\(U(1)_{\\text{em}}\\) that *falls out* of the EW theory.** You don\u2019t bolt QED on; it\u2019s the low-energy remnant.\n\nSo in the *model-building/unification* sense, electroweak unification is self-contained and \u201ccomplete\u201d: it explains the photon, the W/Z, and their couplings within one Higgsed gauge framework.\n\n## 2) But in the *UV-completeness* sense, it\u2019s not the end of the story\n- The \\(SU(2)_L\\) piece is asymptotically free (its coupling decreases at high energies), but the **Abelian** factor (\\(U(1)_Y\\)) has a **Landau pole**: its coupling grows and would blow up at some exponentially high scale. This is the same pathology that makes pure QED non-UV-complete.\n- Because \\(U(1)_Y\\) is part of the electroweak theory, the **EW sector as a whole is not UV complete**. It\u2019s an **effective field theory** expected to be replaced by new physics before any Landau-pole scale is reached (well below the Planck scale in most estimates, but still fantastically high).\n\n## 3) What would \u201ccomplete the completion\u201d?\n- **Grand Unification (GUTs)**: Embed \\(SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y\\) into a non-Abelian group (e.g., \\(SU(5), SO(10)\\)).

What \u201cgaps\u201d might still matter physically\n\n- **Non-perturbative ambiguities:** confinement, \u03b8-vacuum structure, glueball spectrum, etc.  \n- **Chiral limit subtleties:** exact formulation of the theory with massless quarks is delicate.  \n- **Coupling to gravity:** QCD by itself is UV complete, but *not a theory of everything* \u2014 coupling to quantum gravity introduces new UV physics at \\(M_{\\rm Pl}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Summary\n\n| Sense of \u201ccomplete\u201d | QCD\u2019s status |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n| **Perturbative renormalization** | \u2705 Fully controlled; asymptotically free. |\n| **UV finiteness / absence of Landau pole** | \u2705 Yes. |\n| **Effective field theory validity range** | \u2705 Valid up to arbitrarily high energies (no cutoff needed). |\n| **Mathematical rigor / constructive definition** | \u26a0\ufe0f Open problem (Yang\u2013Mills mass gap). |\n| **Empirical completeness (matches experiment)** | \u2705 Outstanding success. |\n| **Inclusion of gravity** | \u274c Not included. |\n\nSo in short:\n\n> **QCD is UV complete as a quantum field theory in the physicist\u2019s sense \u2014 but not yet fully complete in the mathematician\u2019s sense.**\n\nWould you like me to outline *why asymptotic freedom* ensures UV completeness via the renormalization-group flow (i.e., sketch the beta-function argument explicitly)?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98aabb2ef861ce7e-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"d69d87b9-5ff1-42ec-a086-6d44d6429114","turn_exchange_id":"3f67c9e5-1b9c-4504-bf59-448082b4539d","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d69d87b9-5ff1-42ec-a086-6d44d6429114","children":["80d60cbb-dfa7-4339-80a0-015528836810"]},"80d60cbb-dfa7-4339-80a0-015528836810":{"id":"80d60cbb-dfa7-4339-80a0-015528836810","message":{"id":"80d60cbb-dfa7-4339-80a0-015528836810","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759812387.365,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what research has been done into making QED or the Electroweak framework UV complete?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98aac13d5c78ce32-BOM","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"82c48362-92e5-4dd7-9038-e03dfb61c34b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ae69f124-9b3f-42e6-b08d-6896182b6c70","children":["c4dc1dd8-4ebf-493f-b089-c74dd9049d55"]},"c4dc1dd8-4ebf-493f-b089-c74dd9049d55":{"id":"c4dc1dd8-4ebf-493f-b089-c74dd9049d55","message":{"id":"c4dc1dd8-4ebf-493f-b089-c74dd9049d55","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759812392.3246775,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"98aac13d5c78ce32-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"80d60cbb-dfa7-4339-80a0-015528836810","turn_exchange_id":"82c48362-92e5-4dd7-9038-e03dfb61c34b","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"80d60cbb-dfa7-4339-80a0-015528836810","children":["e175efe9-9bcc-452e-8838-20e3a8372c20"]},"e175efe9-9bcc-452e-8838-20e3a8372c20":{"id":"e175efe9-9bcc-452e-8838-20e3a8372c20","message":{"id":"e175efe9-9bcc-452e-8838-20e3a8372c20","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759812392.3310504,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"98aac13d5c78ce32-BOM","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"c4dc1dd8-4ebf-493f-b089-c74dd9049d55","turn_exchange_id":"82c48362-92e5-4dd7-9038-e03dfb61c34b","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c4dc1dd8-4ebf-493f-b089-c74dd9049d55","children":["ee3cdaeb-7f4d-46d4-b375-40b1e7215a8c"]},"ee3cdaeb-7f4d-46d4-b375-40b1e7215a8c":{"id":"ee3cdaeb-7f4d-46d4-b375-40b1e7215a8c","message":{"id":"ee3cdaeb-7f4d-46d4-b375-40b1e7215a8c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759812392.515001,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring QED and asymptotic safety","content":"There's a lot of literature connecting QED, fermions, and the potential for UV fixed points and asymptotic safety, like papers from Palombi and the 1981 Holdom one on techniquarks.

Even if nature never reaches trans-Planckian energies, there are **strong scientific reasons** to care about UV completeness that *do* affect physics we can test or at least reason about rigorously.\n\n# Why chase UV completeness?\n\n1) **Logical consistency (existence of the theory).**  \nA QFT with a Landau pole or non-renormalizable growth is, strictly speaking, *undefined* without extra UV data. UV completeness answers: *what theory are we actually talking about in the continuum limit?* This is not aesthetic\u2014without a consistent definition, you don\u2019t know whether the framework is self-contradictory.\n\n2) **IR constraints from UV consistency (positivity/analyticity/unitarity).**  \nVery general UV principles\u2014Lorentz invariance, causality, locality, unitarity\u2014imply **nontrivial inequalities** on low-energy EFT coefficients (dispersion relations, positivity bounds). These give *testable* constraints in colliders, flavor, and gravitational-wave EFTs. In short: **good UV \u21d2 inequalities the IR must satisfy.** If data ever violate them, your UV assumptions are wrong.\n\n3) **Unitarity restoration dictates new physics scales.**  \nAmplitudes that grow with energy (e.g., longitudinal \\(W W\\to W W\\)) violate unitarity at some scale unless *something* happens. This logic predicted **a Higgs or equivalent new dynamics** below ~TeV\u2014confirmed by the LHC. Similar arguments set bounds in many EFTs (e.g., dark sector, gravity EFT).\n\n4) **Anomaly cancellation and charge quantization.**  \nUV-consistent gauge theories must cancel gauge and gravitational anomalies. That requirement *fixes* charge assignments and even predicts new states (historically: existence of the top quark\u2019s role in anomaly cancellation across generations). Again: UV logic constrains IR content.\n\n5) **Naturalness and hierarchy structure.**  \nWhether a parameter is \u201cfine-tuned\u201d depends on how the UV regulates divergences and organizes symmetries (SUSY, compositeness, classical scale invariance, etc.). Different UV ideas lead to **different, testable IR spectra** (sparticles, top partners, extra vectors), even if those aren\u2019t at Planckian scales.\n\n6) **Cosmology uses the UV through initial conditions and EFT control.**  \nInflation, reheating, baryogenesis, neutrino masses (seesaw), dark matter portals\u2014all are modeled with **EFTs matched to plausible UV completions**. You don\u2019t need Planck energies to see their footprints: e.g., leptogenesis can sit at \\(10^9\\!-\\!10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}\\); neutrino mass patterns and CP phases in the IR are shaped by that UV.\n\n7) **Gravity: black holes and quantum consistency.**  \nWe *observe* black holes. Their thermodynamics (entropy, evaporation) forces the question of high-energy unitarity/information. A UV-complete quantum gravity (string theory, asymptotic safety, etc.) is about making those statements precise\u2014not about building a collider to \\(10^{19}\\) GeV.\n\n8) **Explanatory compression (unification).**  \nEmbedding \\(SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)\\) into a simple group explains charge quantization and suggests coupling unification. It\u2019s not necessary for day-to-day phenomenology, but it\u2019s a powerful explanatory win\u2014with low-energy implications (proton decay limits, neutrino mass structures).\n\n9) **Mathematical existence & rigor.**  \nEven if no experiment ever reaches some scale, constructing the theory (\u00e0 la constructive QFT, lattice limits, or string backgrounds) answers a clear scientific question: *does a consistent model of nature with these axioms exist?* That\u2019s comparable in spirit to proving the Yang\u2013Mills mass gap\u2014hard, but unquestionably scientific.\n\n# \u201cIf the condition can\u2019t be encountered, is it beyond science?\u201d\nTwo clarifications:\n\n- **Science is not only about reachability of raw energies**; it is about **testable implications** of hypotheses. UV completion hypotheses **do** imply IR constraints and correlations (points 2\u20135). Those are testable.\n- **The Planck scale isn\u2019t where \u201cphysics ceases to have meaning\u201d;** it\u2019s where *our current* tools (local QFT + classical GR) likely fail. A UV-complete theory is precisely what replaces them and, via matching, governs the lower-energy EFTs we actually use.\n\n# Concrete examples where UV thinking paid off\n- **Fermi theory \u2192 Electroweak**: unitarity violation in \\( \\nu e \\) scattering implied new mediators \\(W,Z\\) ~100 GeV.  \n- **WW scattering \u2192 Higgs**: unitarity forced new scalar/vector dynamics below ~TeV; Higgs found at 125 GeV.  \n- **Anomalies \u2192 spectrum**: anomaly cancellation shaped the SM generation structure and charges.  \n- **Positivity bounds**: rule out swathes of IR parameter space in Higgs EFTs, dark-energy/modified-gravity EFTs, and graviton-photon couplings.\n\n# Bottom line\nEven if we never access trans-Planckian energies, **UV completeness isn\u2019t metaphysics**. It\u2019s a demand for a logically consistent theory whose **high-energy axioms impose predictive, testable constraints** on the physics we *can* observe. The pursuit is justified by consistency, explanatory power, and the very real IR fingerprints that UV assumptions leave behind.\n\nIf you want, I can list the standard positivity/dispersion constraints for a specific EFT you care about (e.g., SMEFT dimension-6 operators, or the EFT of inflation) and show how different UV assumptions tighten or relax those bounds."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

In brief, a \u201cfully rigorous interacting construction of 4D QED\u201d would mean **building QED as a mathematically complete quantum field theory on 3+1-dimensional Minkowski space**\u2014*without* recourse to formal perturbation theory\u2014and proving it satisfies a standard set of QFT axioms. No one has achieved this. Below is what such a construction would entail and why QED is uniquely hard.\n\n# What \u201crigorous construction\u201d means (checklist)\n\nThere are two equivalent targets people usually aim for.\n\n## (A) Wightman / Osterwalder\u2013Schrader (constructive QFT route)\nYou must **construct the Schwinger functions** (Euclidean Green\u2019s functions) non-perturbatively and prove:\n\n1) **OS axioms** (Euclidean side):  \n   - Euclidean invariance, symmetry, clustering.  \n   - **Reflection positivity** (crucial for reconstructing a physical Hilbert space).  \n   - Existence of a **continuum limit** from a regulated theory (e.g., lattice) with **nontrivial** interactions (not just a free Gaussian measure).\n\n2) **Reconstruction to Minkowski**:  \n   Use OS reconstruction to obtain Wightman functions that satisfy the **Wightman axioms**:  \n   - Tempered distributions on Minkowski space.  \n   - **Locality (microcausality).**  \n   - **Poincar\u00e9 covariance** and **spectrum condition** (energy\u2013momentum in forward light cone).  \n   - **Unique vacuum** and **cyclicity**.  \n   - A nontrivial **S-matrix** (not identically the identity).\n\n## (B) Haag\u2013Kastler (algebraic QFT route)\nConstruct a **net of local C\\(^*\\) or von Neumann algebras** \\(\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})\\) for each spacetime region \\(\\mathcal{O}\\), with:\n\n- **Isotony, locality, covariance, spectrum condition, vacuum**.  \n- **Gauge symmetry** implemented (possibly only on a bigger unphysical space with BRST, but with a **positive-metric physical subspace**).  \n- **Superselection sectors** for charge (DHR/infrared-adapted variants) that implement the **Gauss law** properly.  \n- **Scattering theory**: existence of asymptotic states and an S-matrix for appropriate inclusive observables.\n\nEither route must deliver the **same physical content** (charged particles, photons, scattering, etc.).\n\n# Why QED is especially hard\n\nEven compared to Yang\u2013Mills, QED faces *both* UV and IR obstacles:\n\n1) **Gauge + reflection positivity tension.**  \n   - In covariant gauges the Euclidean measure isn\u2019t reflection-positive (ghosts, indefinite metric), so OS reconstruction fails *as stated*.  \n   - You\u2019d need a **gauge-invariant** Euclidean construction (e.g., in terms of Wilson loops/fields \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\)) and then show you can still recover the physical charged sector.\n\n2) **Charged fields are intrinsically nonlocal (Gauss law).**  \n   - Local, gauge-invariant operators are built from \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and Wilson loops; but **electron fields** must be **dressed** (Dirac strings, Wilson lines) to be gauge invariant.  \n   - This leads to **string-like localization** of charged fields; encoding that rigorously in either Wightman or AQFT is nontrivial.\n\n3) **Infraparticles and soft photons (IR problem).**  \n   - Because of long-range forces, a charged \u201cone-particle state\u201d is **not** a sharp mass eigenstate; the electron has a **continuous mass spectrum near the mass shell** (infraparticle).  \n   - Standard LSZ scattering theory breaks; you need a **modified scattering framework** (dressed asymptotic states, inclusive cross-sections) and must prove it exists.\n\n4) **Inclusive scattering & asymptotic completeness.**  \n   - Must show *inclusive* IR-safe observables are well defined non-perturbatively and that the theory has sensible asymptotics (some analogue of asymptotic completeness).\n\n5) **BRST/Gupta\u2013Bleuler vs positivity.**  \n   - Covariant quantization uses an **indefinite metric**; you must rigorously construct a **physical, positive-definite Hilbert space** (BRST cohomology) and prove locality/covariance descend correctly.\n\n6) **UV continuum limit and (non-)triviality.**  \n   - A full construction would show that 4D QED admits a **nontrivial continuum limit** (i.e., not Gaussian) as the regulator is removed.  \n   - The **Landau-pole/triviality** scenario suggests pure QED may become free in the UV; a rigorous result one way or the other would settle this. To date, no proof.\n\n# What a successful construction would actually look like\n\nConcrete deliverables a mathematician would accept:\n\n- A **lattice formulation** (with e.g., Wilson gauge action and a chosen fermion discretization) together with a **proof that the continuum limit exists** and yields non-Gaussian, reflection-positive **gauge-invariant correlators** (e.g., of \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\), Wilson loops).  \n- A **gauge-invariant construction of charged fields** (e.g., Dirac-dressed electrons) with precise localization properties (possibly string-localized) and **nontrivial two-point spectral measure** (infraparticle structure proven).  \n- **OS \u2192 Wightman reconstruction** (or an algebraic net) giving a **Poincar\u00e9-covariant, local** (for observables), **positive-metric** QFT obeying the spectrum condition.  \n- A **modified scattering theory** (Kulish\u2013Faddeev / Dollard-type) built non-perturbatively that yields well-defined **inclusive cross-sections** and, ideally, **asymptotic completeness** in the appropriate sense.  \n- A theorem clarifying the **UV fate**: either  \n  - (i) **Triviality**: any continuum limit is free (no interacting 4D QED), or  \n  - (ii) **Nontriviality**: existence of a genuine interacting continuum theory with specified renormalized parameters (and proof that correlation functions depend nontrivially on them).\n\n# Current status (sober view)\n\n- In **2D/3D**, many interacting models have been constructed rigorously; in **4D**, none with all of the above QED features.  \n- For **non-Abelian 4D** (Yang\u2013Mills), even *existence with a mass gap* is open (Clay problem).  \n- For **QED**, the **IR** (infraparticles, dressed states) and the **UV** (possible triviality) make a complete construction even tougher.\n\n# Bottom line\n\nA \u201cfully rigorous interacting construction of 4D QED\u201d would be a **nonperturbative, continuum, gauge-invariant, positive-metric, Poincar\u00e9-covariant** QFT with **charged sectors and photons**, satisfying a recognized axiom system, and with a **sound (modified) scattering theory**\u2014*proved* to exist. Achieving that requires simultaneously solving:\n\n- reflection positivity for a gauge theory,  \n- Gauss-law\u2013induced nonlocality of charged fields,  \n- infraparticle/soft-photon IR issues, and  \n- the UV continuum limit question (triviality vs. interaction).\n\nThat combination is why it remains open."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6602,"end_idx":6602,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"98af9f880ecdfdf2-SIN","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"2e8b1370-089a-4f9c-8045-1f34d2602ed9","turn_exchange_id":"10a7914c-b8f4-473e-bf5b-595274e6c32e","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"2e8b1370-089a-4f9c-8045-1f34d2602ed9","children":["b0a2f605-7550-48f4-94a5-9df7f09e3a59"]},"b0a2f605-7550-48f4-94a5-9df7f09e3a59":{"id":"b0a2f605-7550-48f4-94a5-9df7f09e3a59","message":{"id":"b0a2f605-7550-48f4-94a5-9df7f09e3a59","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759863673.098,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How much progress has been made in this front?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98afa5552a59fdf2-SIN","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"a87ddce1-42c5-42a0-bd30-2217c8573141","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ea49a158-181f-45f0-b366-62a66c6bc32b","children":["71e64145-6b98-44c1-8d41-5fd271c93133"]},"71e64145-6b98-44c1-8d41-5fd271c93133":{"id":"71e64145-6b98-44c1-8d41-5fd271c93133","message":{"id":"71e64145-6b98-44c1-8d41-5fd271c93133","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759863676.3017468,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"98afa5552a59fdf2-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"b0a2f605-7550-48f4-94a5-9df7f09e3a59","turn_exchange_id":"a87ddce1-42c5-42a0-bd30-2217c8573141","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b0a2f605-7550-48f4-94a5-9df7f09e3a59","children":["28f9c92c-e430-422f-a665-268ea5fb82b3"]},"28f9c92c-e430-422f-a665-268ea5fb82b3":{"id":"28f9c92c-e430-422f-a665-268ea5fb82b3","message":{"id":"28f9c92c-e430-422f-a665-268ea5fb82b3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759863676.449645,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Summarizing 4D QED progress","content":"The topic of 4D QED is stable with slow progress, but recent developments may include papers and reviews on charged fields, infraparticles, and QED scattering.

This underpins the idea that at least the **observable sector** of gauge theories admits a sound Euclidean definition. It does **not**, by itself, construct the **charged sector** in the continuum. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n**Precise understanding of IR structure (infraparticles and dressing).**  \n- Gauss\u2019 law \u21d2 *charged one-particle states are infraparticles* (no sharp mass shell). This is a rigorous obstruction you must build around. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201  \n- The Faddeev\u2013Kulish (coherent) dressing of asymptotic states cures IR divergences at the S-matrix level; modern work relates this to asymptotic symmetries and gives refined constructions. These advances sharpen *how* scattering should look in a rigorous QED. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search17\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n**Localization beyond points (string-localized fields).**  \nTo reconcile gauge invariance, Gauss\u2019 law, and positivity, progress has been made on **string-localized** covariant fields\u2014promising for constructing charged sectors without violating locality of *observables*. This is conceptually significant, though not yet a full QED construction. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search24\ue201\n\n# What still isn\u2019t done\n\n1) **Non-perturbative continuum limit with charges.**  \nA proof that 4D QED (with electrons and photons) exists as an interacting, positive-metric, Poincar\u00e9-covariant QFT (satisfying OS/Wightman or Haag\u2013Kastler axioms), including a construction of **gauge-invariant charged fields** and their correlation functions, is still missing.\n\n2) **Rigorous scattering theory for *relativistic* QED.**  \nWe don\u2019t yet have a full, non-perturbative, relativistic scattering framework that handles infraparticles and proves existence of inclusive cross-sections *in the interacting continuum theory* (there is substantial progress, especially in algebraic and non-relativistic models, but the flagship relativistic case remains open).
