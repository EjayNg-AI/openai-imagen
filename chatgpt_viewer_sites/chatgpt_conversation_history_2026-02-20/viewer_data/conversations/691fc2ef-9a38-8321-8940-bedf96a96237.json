Here\u2019s a single, detailed prompt you can drop into an image generator:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt**\n\n*A futuristic starship observation lounge in the style of a Starfleet lecture hall. A Starfleet officer in a sleek duty uniform stands in front of a large curved holographic display wall filled with detailed diagrams explaining the transformer architecture. The environment has classic LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) interfaces: pastel-colored panels, rounded rectangles, thin status bars, and elegant futuristic typography running along the walls and side consoles.*\n\n*The main focus is on the lecture content: clearly rendered diagrams of a transformer model pipeline, showing token embeddings flowing through multiple stacked layers, attention blocks, and feedforward networks. Include labeled components such as \u201cmulti-head attention,\u201d \u201cquery,\u201d \u201ckey,\u201d \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201cpositional encoding,\u201d \u201cresidual connection,\u201d and \u201clayer normalization,\u201d connected by arrows that show information flow. Show parallel attention heads with separate weight matrices, a sequence of tokens entering on the left, and output logits on the right, with a small softmax diagram. Add small inset panels zooming into one attention head, with a heatmap-like matrix illustrating attention weights between tokens.*\n\n*The officer gestures toward the diagrams with a confident, teaching posture, while a few officers and cadets sit at curved lounge tables, watching attentively. Large panoramic windows behind them reveal a serene starfield, a nearby nebula, and a distant planet, giving a sense of depth and scale. Lighting is soft and cinematic: cool starlight from the windows balanced by warm indirect interior lighting along the floor and ceiling arcs. Ultra-detailed, high resolution, crisp line work on all diagrams, legible technical labels, realistic reflections on the polished floor, optimistic and analytical mood, cinematic, 8k, hyper-detailed sci-fi illustration.*\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me which model you\u2019re using (for example Midjourney, DALL\u00b7E, Stable Diffusion), I can tweak this further into that model\u2019s preferred prompting style (weights, aspect ratios, extra negative prompts, etc.)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","request_id":"b4dd6101-37cc-405b-b18a-3d7a3508619b","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"2f90e704-f9e6-4c6d-8178-2a19b3a962fa","turn_exchange_id":"fcc29ce5-6672-4187-b989-cca63ca95ba6","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"2f90e704-f9e6-4c6d-8178-2a19b3a962fa","children":["0542f2e1-55f1-4186-b762-868ce399a8a3"]},"0542f2e1-55f1-4186-b762-868ce399a8a3":{"id":"0542f2e1-55f1-4186-b762-868ce399a8a3","message":{"id":"0542f2e1-55f1-4186-b762-868ce399a8a3","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763690506.305,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://file_00000000f6807206a4c38eee57506d88","size_bytes":1005462,"width":1408,"height":768,"fovea":null,"metadata":{"dalle":null,"gizmo":null,"generation":null,"container_pixel_height":null,"container_pixel_width":null,"emu_omit_glimpse_image":null,"emu_patches_override":null,"lpe_keep_patch_ijhw":null,"lpe_delta_encoding_channel":null,"sanitized":true,"asset_pointer_link":null,"watermarked_asset_pointer":null,"is_no_auth_placeholder":null}},"I am testing Nano Banana Pro.

Reflections on the polished alloy deck show accurate soft-shadow gradients and volumetric light scattering from the holograms.*\n\n*Behind them, a transparent observation wall reveals cultured bio-orb vessels\u2014floating spherical habitats containing engineered cells undergoing synthetic evolution. Inside each orb, RNA helicases, ribosomal complexes, and protein assemblies can be seen forming in slow, luminous motion.*\n\n*Every component is rendered with extreme detail: molecular textures, subsurface scattering in organic structures, diffraction in holographic layers, chromatic dispersion in lens surfaces, and physically correct reflections from nanomaterial interfaces. Cinematic 8K clarity, hyperreal, ultra-precise scientific visualization, deep-future biotech aesthetic.*\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can produce next:\n\n- **A darker, more cyber-biotech variant (e.g., altered humanity, transhuman genomics)**  \n- **A clean Federation-style Starfleet genomics deck**  \n- **A wetlab-oriented version (ribosomes, ATP synthase, quantum biology hints)**  \n- **A version focusing on AI\u2013DNA co-design (GAN-based genome synthesis, neural-symbolic gene optimization)**  \n\nJust tell me your preferred direction."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"95fab4ec-2b76-4eaf-9faa-27cdc359da2d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1","parent_id":"9016003e-ea67-4ff7-bc1a-a8b7c7f79b19","turn_exchange_id":"e63e9321-cc2d-4f34-81af-2854f5a347a9","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"9016003e-ea67-4ff7-bc1a-a8b7c7f79b19","children":[]}}}
