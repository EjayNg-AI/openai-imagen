Leguizamo criticized Trump and his former adviser Stephen Miller, calling Miller a racist and the architect of harsh deportation policies. Maher responded by blaming the current immigration crisis partly on President Biden\u2019s mismanagement, asserting that immigration must be controlled due to resource limitations. Leguizamo argued that the U.S. has enough space to welcome more immigrants and blamed U.S. policies for problems in Latin America. The conversation turned personal as Leguizamo recalled meeting Trump before his political career, describing him as \"meek\" and mocking an incident where Trump labeled him \"articulate,\" which Leguizamo found racially insensitive. Maher countered that Trump, though egotistical, was charismatic and engaging. Despite Maher having recently met Trump and finding him \u201cgracious,\u201d he reiterated his intent to remain critical. The debate culminated in a discussion on whether Trump was racist or simply a \"product of his time,\" with Leguizamo arguing that people should overcome outdated views. Leguizamo currently hosts \"Leguizamo Does America\" on MSNBC, highlighting Latino communities and culture.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752528902.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/07/14/ice-trump-undocumented-immigrants-bond-hearings/","title":"ICE declares millions of undocumented immigrants ineligible for bond hearings","snippet":"The Trump administration has significantly altered U.S. immigration policy by declaring that undocumented immigrants are no longer eligible for bond hearings while fighting deportation proceedings. A July 8 memo from ICE acting director Todd Lyons orders the mandatory detention of millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, expanding a legal standard traditionally applied only to recent border crossers. Immigrants may only be released on parole in rare cases at the discretion of immigration officers, not judges. This change eliminates the previous opportunity for detained individuals to request release based on their unique circumstances. The policy is expected to face legal challenges, with critics citing due process violations and expanded detention\u2019s impact on long-term U.S. residents with ties to the country. The shift coincides with a $45 billion Congressional budget increase allowing ICE to double detention capacity to 100,000 daily. Legal advocates warn that those affected, including individuals with clean records and longstanding community ties, now face indefinite detention under harsh conditions, impairing their ability to mount legal defenses. The American Immigration Lawyers Association and others highlight the policy\u2019s human toll and potential to escalate nationwide detention practices.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752536815.968,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/07/04/trump-deportations-gop-tax-bill/","title":"GOP tax bill bets big on Trump's immigration agenda despite poll ...","snippet":"The GOP tax bill stands to deliver a $170 billion windfall to turbocharge immigrant detentions and deportations.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751587200.0,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/14/donald-trump-us-politics-latest-live-news-updates","title":"Supreme court clears way for Trump to gut education department - as it happened","snippet":"The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education, enabling the immediate dismissal of 1,400 employees.

The administration also drew criticism for freezing deportation protections for Afghans, although a court issued a temporary stay.\n\nDomestically, Trump continued to clash with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and confirmed his first second-term judicial appointment. He approved a plan to send U.S.-made Patriot missiles to Ukraine, backed by European allies, while issuing vague threats of \u201csecondary tariffs\u201d on Russia.\n\nControversy erupted over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, sparking outrage among Trump\u2019s base and causing friction within his administration, including potential resignations.
