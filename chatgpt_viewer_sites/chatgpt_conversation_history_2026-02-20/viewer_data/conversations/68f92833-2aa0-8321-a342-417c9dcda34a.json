The company's shares rose over 4% in extended trading, lifting its stock market value by $128 billion. Revenue rose 17% to $61.9 billion, with earnings per share at $2.94, surpassing targets of $60.80 billion and $2.82, respectively. The growth was primarily attributed to Microsoft's investments in AI, especially through its partnership with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. The company's Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, saw a 31% revenue increase. Despite higher-than-expected capital expenditures, customer demand continued to grow, prompting further scaling of capacity.

The company's e-commerce and cloud divisions performed well, with online store sales rising 11% to $61.49 billion, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue increasing 18% to $30.9 billion, both exceeding analyst forecasts.\n\nDespite these strong results, Amazon's stock dropped over 7% in after-hours trading. Market analysts attribute the decline to investors' heightened expectations following Microsoft Azure's strong performance, suggesting AWS growth was underwhelming by comparison. Looking ahead, Amazon projects third-quarter revenue between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, with operating income forecasted at $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion, both slightly above consensus estimates. Despite Thursday's decline, Amazon shares were up 7% for the year through the close.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1753993643.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/f72da2deff83510987a0017e61eac335","title":"Nvidia sales surge in the fourth quarter on demand for AI chips","snippet":"Nvidia has reported a significant increase in its fourth-quarter sales due to high demand for its Blackwell chips, which are used in artificial intelligence systems. The company's revenue reached $39.3 billion, a 12% rise from the previous quarter and a 78% increase from the previous year. Nvidia's net income for the quarter was $22.06 billion, surpassing analysts' predictions. Data center sales, a major contributor to Nvidia's revenues, saw a remarkable 93% growth compared to the previous year, accounting for $35.6 billion of the revenue. Nvidia's involvement in the Stargate project, a joint venture to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure, is expected to further drive growth. The company's forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 anticipates continued revenue growth, predicting around $43 billion. Nvidia's market value has surged, making it the second-largest company on Wall Street, valued at over $3 trillion. Despite the success, Nvidia faces uncertainties related to potential tariffs from the Trump administration.

This surge was driven by strong demand for AI tools, particularly through Azure, which saw a 39% revenue rise\u2014beating the expected 34.75%. Azure's annual revenue exceeded $75 billion, outperforming estimates and closing the gap with Amazon Web Services' $107.56 billion in 2024.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock rose over 6% in after-hours trading, bolstered by investor optimism around Azure's role in supporting AI workloads, especially those linked to OpenAI. Despite growing competition\u2014such as Alphabet's expanded cloud investment and capacity warnings related to AI chip shortages\u2014Microsoft continues to innovate. It diversified its AI strategy by collaborating with companies like xAI, Meta, and Mistral, and enhancing services like Copilot and GitHub with autonomous agents.\n\nThe exclusive partnership with OpenAI is under scrutiny as the startup diversifies its infrastructure partners. To mitigate dependency, Microsoft is strengthening its Azure core services and expanding its model offerings. The broader tech sector faces pressure to deliver returns on substantial AI investments, projected to top $330 billion in 2025.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1753906212.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/716191/microsoft-q4-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface","title":"Microsoft reports strong cloud earnings, with Windows and Xbox up too","snippet":"In its Q4 fiscal 2025 earnings report, Microsoft announced strong financial results, with $76.4 billion in revenue (up 18%) and $27.2 billion in net income (up 24%). Cloud services were the primary growth driver, with Azure revenue rising 39% year-over-year, reaching $75 billion annually. Microsoft 365 also saw gains, with 18% commercial cloud growth and 20% growth in consumer cloud revenue, now totaling 89 million subscribers. \n\nDespite recent layoffs (9,000 positions), total employment remained steady at 228,000 employees. In the Windows division, OEM and device revenue rose 3%, while PC shipments increased 4% thanks to a Windows 11 refresh, though Surface performance remains unclear. Microsoft expects a revenue decline in OEM and devices next quarter.\n\nGaming revenue climbed 10% year-over-year, led by a 13% rise in Xbox content and services (including Game Pass), but Xbox hardware revenue fell 22%. Microsoft\u2019s strategy to release Xbox titles on other platforms proved effective, positioning the company as the top publisher on both PlayStation and Xbox. \n\nLooking ahead, Microsoft plans to invest over $30 billion in AI infrastructure next quarter and will showcase new products at Gamescom, including the Xbox Ally handheld.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1753906325.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wsj.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/microsoft-earnings-q4-2025-msft-stock-fc2e5c59","title":"Microsoft's Cloud Unit, Bolstered by AI Demand, Supercharges Earnings","snippet":"Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing division continues to thrive, significantly boosting the company's earnings in its fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, largely driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services. The tech giant reported $76.4 billion in revenue, with Azure cloud services growing 39% and annual Azure revenue surpassing $75 billion for the first time. Operating income rose by 22% to $34.3 billion, and net income hit $27.2 billion ($3.65 per share), all surpassing Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe company\u2019s embrace of AI technologies has spurred its growth and increased customer adoption of Azure for analytics and data services. Microsoft has invested heavily in AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures rising 27% year-over-year to $24.2 billion, and expects spending to exceed $30 billion next quarter. Its AI assistant, Copilot, is being integrated more deeply into Microsoft products like the Edge browser.\n\nDespite its AI success, Microsoft has laid off roughly 15,000 employees due in part to AI automation. The company\u2019s strong performance pushed shares up over 9% in after-hours trading, potentially raising its market value to $4 trillion. It is also in critical negotiations with OpenAI over future AI technology access and control.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1753917360.0,"attribution":"www.wsj.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f92883d6f88324b373c02bd34a5b66","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Azure growth details and CFO comments","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"3625f876-780f-4236-a1bb-06146191f8b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ad906aec-0877-480b-a57a-18ecf64bc206","turn_exchange_id":"7cc66e32-4107-41be-b911-01ebea2d3e0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ad906aec-0877-480b-a57a-18ecf64bc206","children":["7b6510db-1e81-424a-80cf-134ce23505ff"]},"7b6510db-1e81-424a-80cf-134ce23505ff":{"id":"7b6510db-1e81-424a-80cf-134ce23505ff","message":{"id":"7b6510db-1e81-424a-80cf-134ce23505ff","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761159325.251886,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering Apple as a pick","content":"We have solid Azure growth info for Microsoft, which is great.

Apple experienced a significant 17% decline in its annual shipments, marking its worst performance in China since 2016. Vivo captured 17% of the market share, followed by Huawei with 16% and Apple with 15%. This decline has been attributed to several factors, including the lack of artificial intelligence capabilities in the latest iPhones sold in China. Apple also faces stiff competition from Huawei's premium phones and other domestic manufacturers offering innovative technologies. To counteract the sales slump, Apple has offered rare discounts and promotional campaigns. Despite the overall market growth in China, Apple's struggled performance highlights the intense competition and evolving consumer preferences in one of its largest markets.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1737099106.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/611992/apple-intelligence-ai-china-alibaba-iphone","title":"iPhone AI features will be powered by Alibaba in China","snippet":"Apple has partnered with Alibaba to enable artificial intelligence features on iPhones in China, aiming to address the company's decline in local smartphone sales attributed to the lack of such features.

Apple continues collaboration with Baidu on AI-powered search and Siri enhancements. Regulatory approval is essential, and both companies have submitted necessary materials.

UBS analysts, led by David Vogt, further reduced their iPhone sales forecasts below Wall Street's consensus, predicting a 5% revenue decline for the December quarter. This follows an 8% drop in iPhone sales in November, driven by a 28% decrease in China. The discounts are available from January 4 to January 7 on various models, including a 500 yuan ($68) reduction for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. China's sluggish economy, impacted by a property crisis and low consumer spending, contributes to Apple's challenges, alongside increased competition from local firms.

The store, located in Dalian City's Parkland Mall, will shut down on August 9, 2025, due to the broader decline in consumer spending in China and the exodus of other major retailers from the mall. Despite this closure, Apple emphasized its continued commitment to the Dalian community, assuring that all staff from the store will be retained.\n\nApple has faced persistent challenges in the Chinese market, with falling sales for six consecutive quarters and a significant revenue drop of nearly 10% from its 2022 peak of $74.2 billion. Its smartphone market share declined from 17.9% to 15.5% last year amid increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo. The Parkland Mall closure follows a broader downturn affecting the luxury sector in China, despite government efforts to stimulate spending. Nevertheless, Apple maintains a presence in Dalian through another store and plans to open a new outlet in Shenzhen, keeping its total number of Chinese stores steady at 58.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1753802151.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f92883d6f88324b373c02bd34a5b66","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Apple Intelligence rollouts and iPhone data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"3625f876-780f-4236-a1bb-06146191f8b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"940d79dd-b257-4039-a1fb-fccce101ceb8","turn_exchange_id":"7cc66e32-4107-41be-b911-01ebea2d3e0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"940d79dd-b257-4039-a1fb-fccce101ceb8","children":["15eaadb9-b4c3-415a-99ef-9e33ab52e09a"]},"15eaadb9-b4c3-415a-99ef-9e33ab52e09a":{"id":"15eaadb9-b4c3-415a-99ef-9e33ab52e09a","message":{"id":"15eaadb9-b4c3-415a-99ef-9e33ab52e09a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761159337.501154,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering Alphabet's potential","content":"I\u2019m leaning away from picking Alphabet but need to analyze why.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that Google Cloud's annual revenue run-rate surpassed $50 billion, with an increase in large contracts, including several valued at over $1 billion.\n\nMajor organizations such as Wayfair, Mattel, Target, Capgemini, BBVA, and OpenAI are utilizing Google Cloud infrastructure, the latter to support ChatGPT across multiple countries.

However, the announcement coincided with Alphabet missing its cloud revenue target for the fourth quarter, a factor contributing to a 9% drop in its shares during extended trading. Cloud revenue was $11.96 billion, below the forecasted $12.16 billion. Digital advertising revenue, comprising a significant portion of Alphabet's overall income, grew by 10.6% to $72.46 billion.

Alphabet's overall fourth-quarter revenue climbed 12% to $96.47 billion, with a profit of $2.15 per share, slightly beating expectations.

More permits from both the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) are still needed for Tesla to launch a commercial autonomous robotaxi service.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has not granted Tesla permission to operate a robotaxi service, highlighting ongoing regulatory obstacles. Currently, Tesla's service includes human-driven vehicles and involves friends, family of employees, and select public participants. The CPUC emphasized that Tesla must first complete a pilot program without charging passengers and follow established procedures for autonomous vehicle permits. Tesla only has DMV authorization to test self-driving cars with safety drivers and lacks approval to collect fares using autonomous vehicles. The ride-hailing service also operates in Austin, Texas, and the coverage in California includes San Francisco, San Jose, and Berkeley. The rollout reflects Tesla\u2019s attempt to expand services amidst declining electric vehicle sales, but regulatory challenges could delay Musk\u2019s broader goal to deploy robotaxis nationwide by the end of the year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1753955020.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-q3-earnings-report-live-updates-tsla-stock-2025-10","title":"Tesla Q3 Earnings Today, Stock up 10% in 2025","snippet":"1 hour ago \u2014 Adjusted EPS estimate 54c (Bloomberg Consensus) \u00b7 EPS estimate 42c \u00b7 Revenue estimate $26.36 billion \u00b7 Gross margin estimate 17.2% \u00b7 Operating ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1761158002.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"finance.yahoo.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-rollout-san-francisco-193417428.html","title":"Tesla's Robotaxi Rollout in San Francisco Sparks ...","snippet":"Sep 22, 2025 \u2014 Tesla's Robotaxi Rollout in San Francisco Sparks Regulator Pushback.

The company posted $1.17 billion in net income on $22.5 billion in revenue\u2014a 12% drop from $25.5 billion year-over-year. Automotive revenues fell 16.6%, and net profits declined by 16%. Vehicle deliveries dropped 14% to 384,122 units. Operating income plummeted 42% year-over-year, with nearly half reliant on regulatory credit sales\u2014revenue that is expected to vanish due to changes in federal policy under President Trump.\n\nTesla also experienced a $200 million decrease in its cash reserves, with free cash flow dwindling to $100 million. Analysts warn it could turn negative by year-end. The company plans to ramp up production of lower-cost versions of the Model 3 and Model Y in late 2025 and aims to release the Tesla Semi and Cybercab in 2026. However, market confidence is waning, partly due to CEO Elon Musk's increasing political involvement and public controversies.\n\nFalling sales, reduced regulatory credits, and the end of EV federal incentives under Trump\u2019s budget are compounding the situation.

Reback lowered his price target from $515 to $475, still maintaining a Buy rating, implying a 20% increase from its current price. The market is cautious until it sees that Azure and other commercial cloud revenue growth can outpace capital expenditure increases. Microsoft plans to invest $80 billion in AI in 2025, with its recent quarterly capex reaching $15.8 billion. Azure revenue grew by 31%, down from 33% previously. Investors seek stronger revenue to justify spending increases. Microsoft's stock, down 11.4% since its January earnings announcement, faces challenges due to disappointing revenue guidance and overall economic uncertainty.

This decline occurred after Google announced a substantial increase in AI-related spending, amounting to $75 billion in 2025, compared to $52.5 billion last year. The announcement comes amid investor concerns over escalating AI expenditure, especially following Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s development of an efficient AI model with minimal costs. Despite a growth in revenue by 12% to $96.5 billion, it reflected the slowest rate since 2023, with cloud-computing growth also falling short of expectations. Pichai defended the investments, emphasizing ongoing reductions in AI-related costs. However, the market reacted negatively, fearing overspending in comparison to competitors like Meta and Microsoft, who also affirmed their heavy AI investments recently.","ref_id":{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1738777072.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f92883d6f88324b373c02bd34a5b66","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching data center capex outlook for 2025","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"3625f876-780f-4236-a1bb-06146191f8b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"d71f9b66-b138-420c-af10-6b1019c077e2","turn_exchange_id":"7cc66e32-4107-41be-b911-01ebea2d3e0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d71f9b66-b138-420c-af10-6b1019c077e2","children":["a5db545c-d65e-4a1c-bc00-59a1b7c8b39a"]},"a5db545c-d65e-4a1c-bc00-59a1b7c8b39a":{"id":"a5db545c-d65e-4a1c-bc00-59a1b7c8b39a","message":{"id":"a5db545c-d65e-4a1c-bc00-59a1b7c8b39a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761159380.089636,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating Amazon's metrics","content":"We\u2019ve got the capex context in mind, and now for Amazon.

This performance was driven by growth in its user base and an increase in advertising sales. As a result, Roku's shares rose 8% in after-hours trading. The company's platform segment, which includes advertising and subscriptions, grew 18% to $975 million, boosted by video advertising and the acquisition of Frndly. Roku is expected to benefit significantly from the growing shift in ad spending from traditional TV to streaming platforms. In June, Roku further strengthened its advertising prospects by partnering with Amazon, combining their reach to 80 million U.S. households. Additional growth drivers for Roku in the second half of the year include third-party programmatic advertising, home screen monetization, and subscriptions. For the third quarter, Roku forecasts revenue of $1.2 billion, slightly above analysts' estimate of $1.17 billion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1753992935.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-earnings-q2-fy2025-11782701","title":"Amazon's Earnings Topped Wall Street's Estimates.

The company's e-commerce and cloud divisions performed well, with online store sales rising 11% to $61.49 billion, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue increasing 18% to $30.9 billion, both exceeding analyst forecasts.\n\nDespite these strong results, Amazon's stock dropped over 7% in after-hours trading. Market analysts attribute the decline to investors' heightened expectations following Microsoft Azure's strong performance, suggesting AWS growth was underwhelming by comparison. Looking ahead, Amazon projects third-quarter revenue between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, with operating income forecasted at $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion, both slightly above consensus estimates. Despite Thursday's decline, Amazon shares were up 7% for the year through the close.","ref_id":{"turn_index":8,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1753993643.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"m.economictimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/industry/services/advertising/e-commerce-platforms-see-ad-revenues-cross-rs-15000-crore-in-fy25/articleshow/124018219.cms","title":"E-commerce platforms see ad revenues cross Rs 15,000 crore in FY25","snippet":"In the fiscal year 2025, leading Indian e-commerce platforms\u2014Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra\u2014have collectively generated \u20b915,573 crore in advertising revenues, marking a substantial 26% year-over-year increase.

The platform generated $433 million in ad revenue in 2024 and is experiencing rapid growth due to a broad consumer base. By the end of 2025, Amazon is expected to have around 128 million Prime subscribers, with approximately 75% accessing Prime Video\u2014equating to about 90.5 million users. Only 5.48 million of these users are on the ad-free tier, making a large majority of viewers accessible to ad-based monetization.

These new chips reportedly offer four times the computing power of the previous generation and are performance-competitive with Nvidia\u2019s HGX B200 GPUs from its Blackwell platform. HSBC highlighted that the notable performance gains allow AMD to command a higher pricing premium, potentially boosting earnings in 2025 and 2026. Additionally, HSBC sees further upside potential for AMD shares with the upcoming MI400 chip series, set to debut next year and expected to rival Nvidia's forthcoming Vera Rubin platform. OpenAI has already committed to using the MI400 chips. Following the news, AMD shares rose over 4% to $144, continuing their upward trajectory in 2025. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares remained steady, despite briefly becoming the world's most valuable company with a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":62},"pub_date":1752163470.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-ceo-unveils-new-ai-chips-2025-06-12/","title":"AMD unveils AI server as OpenAI taps its newest chips","snippet":"On June 12, 2025, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the MI350 and MI400 series AI chips during the \"Advancing AI\" conference in San Jose, California. The MI400 series will power a new AI server named \"Helios,\" set for release in 2026, featuring 72 chips per unit to rival Nvidia's NVL72 servers. The announcement positions AMD to compete directly with Nvidia by offering open networking standards, in contrast to Nvidia\u2019s proprietary NVLink technology. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined Su onstage, announcing OpenAI will adopt AMD\u2019s latest chips and collaborate on improving MI450 chip design. Industry leaders from Meta, Oracle, xAI, and Crusoe expressed support, with Crusoe planning to spend $400 million on AMD chips. Despite the announcement, AMD shares fell 2.2%, and analysts remain cautious about an immediate shift in market dynamics. The company has recently strengthened its AI capabilities through acquisitions, including ZT Systems and talent from Untether AI and Lamini, bolstering its competitive edge. AMD aims for strong AI chip growth despite export restrictions to China, while continuing efforts to enhance its ROCm software to rival Nvidia's CUDA.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":63},"pub_date":1749768223.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/998e15cc-bf46-46ab-ab04-934286f0923b","title":"AMD rolls out new AI chip to rival Nvidia","snippet":"AMD has announced the release of its new MI325X AI chip, claiming industry-leading performance to rival Nvidia's H200 AI chips. The MI325X will be available to customers in Q4 2024, with the next-generation MI350 chip set to compete with Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell system and expected to ship in the second half of 2025. Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD has become a significant challenger in the AI chip market, despite trailing Nvidia. AMD projects $4.5 billion in AI chip sales for 2024, compared to Nvidia's $26.3 billion for Q2 alone. The company targets a $400 billion AI chip market by 2027, focusing on comprehensive infrastructure solutions, including new networking technology and software updates. Having secured clients like Microsoft and Meta, and with Amazon likely to follow, AMD continues to invest and expand, including a $4.9 billion acquisition of server builder ZT Systems. This strategy aims to position AMD as a leading AI infrastructure provider over the next decade.","ref_id":{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":64},"pub_date":1728583227.857,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f92883d6f88324b373c02bd34a5b66","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Nvidia architecture, competitors, and AI chip updates","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"3625f876-780f-4236-a1bb-06146191f8b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8a45ec4a-406f-4dbf-9c2b-7a7b849db79e","turn_exchange_id":"7cc66e32-4107-41be-b911-01ebea2d3e0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8a45ec4a-406f-4dbf-9c2b-7a7b849db79e","children":["9a11fbf0-81c8-4b7d-a474-3428c21a965a"]},"9a11fbf0-81c8-4b7d-a474-3428c21a965a":{"id":"9a11fbf0-81c8-4b7d-a474-3428c21a965a","message":{"id":"9a11fbf0-81c8-4b7d-a474-3428c21a965a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761159407.848311,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering Microsoft\u2019s Copilot metrics","content":"For Microsoft, I\u2019ll focus on Copilot adoption, particularly GitHub Copilot revenue numbers.

Customers will have the option to choose subscription plans with or without Copilot AI features, and subscription prices in the U.S. will increase by $3. Copilot will assist users with various applications in the Microsoft 365 suite, such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, and Designer. The use of Copilot will be limited by monthly credits, sufficient for most users, and users can enable or disable Copilot as needed, especially in academic settings. Microsoft emphasized that user-inputted prompts won\u2019t be used to train its models.

This customer already holds over a million Microsoft 365 licenses.

The news reflects Microsoft\u2019s drive to expand adoption of its AI tools amidst mixed feedback on Copilot's functionality and monetization. Microsoft is also streamlining its AI offerings to improve client engagement. Although Amazon is a potential candidate due to its large workforce and recent $1 billion Microsoft 365 deal, the company has explicitly denied plans to adopt Copilot, citing previous caution against using external AI tools.

In its latest report, the IEA highlights that the U.S., China, and the EU are expected to drive 80% of the projected growth in data centre demand by 2030, largely fueled by AI applications. However, in a \"headwind scenario\" influenced by trade conflicts, electricity consumption by data centres could fall to 670 TWh from the projected 945 TWh. In the U.S., data centres are predicted to account for nearly half of electricity demand growth through 2030. The surge in demand has prompted tech companies to overwhelm power utilities with capacity requests, possibly overestimating future power needs. Additionally, the IEA notes that 20% of planned data centre projects face delays due to grid strain and shortages of essential infrastructure. Notably, 50% of U.S. data centres under development are clustered in existing hubs, raising concerns about localized bottlenecks. The IEA aims to collaborate with tech firms to understand and manage the electricity needs crucial for AI expansion.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1744258099.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.selc.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LEI-Data-Center-Final-Report-07072025-2.pdf","title":"are inherent in data center electricity demand projections","snippet":"Jul 7, 2025 \u2014 The uncertainty and upward bias in data center electricity demand projections create the risk that new energy infrastructure (including ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":1751471531.0,"attribution":"www.selc.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"enkiai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://enkiai.com/ai-market-intelligence/nvidia-ai-2025-10gw-gambit-reshapes-energy-markets","title":"NVIDIA AI 2025: 10GW Gambit Reshapes Energy Markets","snippet":"Oct 8, 2025 \u2014 NVIDIA's AI plan for 2025 includes 10GW data centers, reshaping energy markets.

In 2024, datacentre electricity usage totaled 415 terawatt hours, with AI possibly already responsible for 20% of that. De Vries-Gao considers factors such as data centre efficiency and cooling energy needs in his analysis. The International Energy Agency (IEA) also projects that AI could require nearly as much power by 2030 as Japan currently consumes. While hardware demand might slow due to factors like reduced interest in applications or geopolitical restrictions, sovereign AI efforts and infrastructure expansions\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s Stargate project\u2014are likely to drive energy use higher. Such growth raises sustainability concerns, with datacentre reliance on fossil fuels and insufficient industry transparency. Experts, including UK\u2019s Alan Turing Institute\u2019s Prof Adam Sobey, stress the need for clearer data and potential AI benefits in reducing carbon emissions in other sectors.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1747926435.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/7c241e6f-e9c1-4f45-883a-8d46e6bf8cd8","title":"AI poses threat to North American electricity grid, watchdog warns","snippet":"La demanda de electricidad en Am\u00e9rica del Norte est\u00e1 creciendo de manera cr\u00edtica debido al incremento en el uso de inteligencia artificial (IA), lo que presenta desaf\u00edos significativos para la confiabilidad de la red el\u00e9ctrica, advierte la North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).

This shortfall was attributed to an unexpected $619 million expense due to a tax dispute in Brazil. While revenues met forecasts at $11.5 billion (a 17% increase year-over-year), earnings per share came in at $5.87 versus the projected $6.96. Despite this, profit rose 8% to $2.5 billion. The stock fell about 6% in after-hours trading, signaling investor concern.\n\nAnalyst opinions were mixed: some, like Investing.com's Thomas Monteiro, speculated that Netflix might be masking a slowdown in growth, while others, like Jeremy Mullin of Zacks, remained confident in the company\u2019s fundamentals. Netflix has shifted focus from subscriber counts to broader financial metrics and reportedly now has over 302 million subscribers, with a global audience nearing 1 billion.\n\nTo maintain its lead, Netflix has expanded into live sports, video games, and plans to offer video podcasts via Spotify. There\u2019s also speculation about a potential bid for assets from Warner Bros. Discovery. The company's ad-supported tier is growing, with ad revenue estimated to reach $1.1 billion in 2025. Analysts caution that too much diversification could risk diluting Netflix's core identity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20},"pub_date":1761079174.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"static.poder360.com.br","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://static.poder360.com.br/2025/07/FINAL-Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf","title":"FINAL-Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf","snippet":"Jul 17, 2025 \u2014 Our business continues to perform well.

With over 300 million global subscribers overall, Netflix continues to see robust spending across all tiers and has reassured investors that there are no significant declines in consumer streaming habits, despite concerns stemming from U.S. trade policy changes. The ad-supported plan now represents 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available. To further expand its global reach, Netflix enhanced language accessibility by offering more dubbing and subtitle options. This move supports the popularity of its foreign-made series such as South Korea\u2019s \"Squid Game\" and Spain\u2019s \"Money Heist.\" However, the company faces potential challenges from a proposed 100% tariff on foreign-made films by President Donald Trump, which could affect its internationally produced content and future growth strategy.","ref_id":{"turn_index":12,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1747254290.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68f92883d6f88324b373c02bd34a5b66","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Netflix Q2 2025 ad-tier growth data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"3625f876-780f-4236-a1bb-06146191f8b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"924f94a0-e275-456d-9639-4848565a10ca","turn_exchange_id":"7cc66e32-4107-41be-b911-01ebea2d3e0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"924f94a0-e275-456d-9639-4848565a10ca","children":["5385eb14-09da-412c-8dbc-7daf891e795c"]},"5385eb14-09da-412c-8dbc-7daf891e795c":{"id":"5385eb14-09da-412c-8dbc-7daf891e795c","message":{"id":"5385eb14-09da-412c-8dbc-7daf891e795c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761159430.864385,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Selecting 3 FAANG+M7 picks","content":"For FAANG+M7, I\u2019m narrowing it down to Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

Latest quarter: **$46.7B revenue** (+56% YoY), **Data Center $41.1B**, **gross margin ~72%**, and **Blackwell** shipments ramping; management commentary and industry checks still point to demand that, in many regions, exceeds supply.

Strengths: search + YouTube + Cloud (Cloud **+32% YoY**; operating margin expansion) and massive AI spend (**$75\u2013$85B 2025 capex**).

The MI400 series will power a new AI server named \"Helios,\" set for release in 2026, featuring 72 chips per unit to rival Nvidia's NVL72 servers. The announcement positions AMD to compete directly with Nvidia by offering open networking standards, in contrast to Nvidia\u2019s proprietary NVLink technology. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined Su onstage, announcing OpenAI will adopt AMD\u2019s latest chips and collaborate on improving MI450 chip design. Industry leaders from Meta, Oracle, xAI, and Crusoe expressed support, with Crusoe planning to spend $400 million on AMD chips. Despite the announcement, AMD shares fell 2.2%, and analysts remain cautious about an immediate shift in market dynamics. The company has recently strengthened its AI capabilities through acquisitions, including ZT Systems and talent from Untether AI and Lamini, bolstering its competitive edge. AMD aims for strong AI chip growth despite export restrictions to China, while continuing efforts to enhance its ROCm software to rival Nvidia's CUDA.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"AI is set to drive surging electricity demand from data ...","url":"https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Apr 10, 2025 \u2014 It projects that electricity demand from data centres worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to around 945 terawatt-hours (TWh).","attribution":"IEA"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":63},{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Amazon Web Services, Inc."}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200finance\ue202turn13finance0\ue201","start_idx":2414,"end_idx":2438,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"finance","ref_index":0}],"alt":"## Stock market information for NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)\n- NVIDIA Corp is a equity in the USA market.\n- The price is 178.13 USD currently with a change of -3.03 USD (-0.02%) from the previous close.\n- The latest open price was 181.16 USD and the intraday volume is 122826754.\n- The intraday high is 183.4 USD and the intraday low is 176.9 USD.\n- The latest trade time is Thursday, October 23, 02:41:46 +0800.\n","prompt_text":"NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a equity in the USA market.

This decline has been attributed to several factors, including the lack of artificial intelligence capabilities in the latest iPhones sold in China. Apple also faces stiff competition from Huawei's premium phones and other domestic manufacturers offering innovative technologies.

Currently, Tesla's service includes human-driven vehicles and involves friends, family of employees, and select public participants. The CPUC emphasized that Tesla must first complete a pilot program without charging passengers and follow established procedures for autonomous vehicle permits. Tesla only has DMV authorization to test self-driving cars with safety drivers and lacks approval to collect fares using autonomous vehicles. The ride-hailing service also operates in Austin, Texas, and the coverage in California includes San Francisco, San Jose, and Berkeley.

The ad-supported plan now represents 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available. To further expand its global reach, Netflix enhanced language accessibility by offering more dubbing and subtitle options.

The MI400 series will power a new AI server named \"Helios,\" set for release in 2026, featuring 72 chips per unit to rival Nvidia's NVL72 servers. The announcement positions AMD to compete directly with Nvidia by offering open networking standards, in contrast to Nvidia\u2019s proprietary NVLink technology. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined Su onstage, announcing OpenAI will adopt AMD\u2019s latest chips and collaborate on improving MI450 chip design. Industry leaders from Meta, Oracle, xAI, and Crusoe expressed support, with Crusoe planning to spend $400 million on AMD chips. Despite the announcement, AMD shares fell 2.2%, and analysts remain cautious about an immediate shift in market dynamics. The company has recently strengthened its AI capabilities through acquisitions, including ZT Systems and talent from Untether AI and Lamini, bolstering its competitive edge. AMD aims for strong AI chip growth despite export restrictions to China, while continuing efforts to enhance its ROCm software to rival Nvidia's CUDA.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":63}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null}],"safe_urls":["https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/07/30/microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-fuels-fourth-quarter-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q4/performance?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q4/press-release-webcast?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q4?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/microsoft-q3-fy25-earnings-what-enterprises-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://futurumgroup.com/insights/nvidia-q2-fy-2026-earnings-networking-steals-the-spotlight/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/_gallery/download_pdf/68af69043d6332f1d02dec91/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-ceo-unveils-new-ai-chips-2025-06-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/AMZN-Q2-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.marketingdive.com/news/amazons-ad-business-stays-strong-as-ctv-dsp-offerings-improve/756562/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazons-expansive-advertising-breaks-new-records?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ahrefs.com/blog/ai-overviews-reduce-clicks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/2025q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/google-parent-alphabet-surprises-with-capital-spending-boost-after-earnings-beat-2025-07-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-intelligence-comes-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-starting-next-month/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-smartphone-shipments-china-fell-25-q4-canalys-says-2025-01-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/META-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/no-mention-robotaxi-tesla-launches-ride-hailing-san-francisco-2025-07-31/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://static.poder360.com.br/2025/07/FINAL-Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-says-ad-supported-service-has-94-million-subscribers-2025-05-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-ceo-unveils-new-ai-chips-2025-06-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"citations":[],"request_id":"3625f876-780f-4236-a1bb-06146191f8b0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"f931ceb3-d1ff-42eb-b896-a13d36b33dcd","turn_exchange_id":"7cc66e32-4107-41be-b911-01ebea2d3e0c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"f931ceb3-d1ff-42eb-b896-a13d36b33dcd","children":[]}}}
