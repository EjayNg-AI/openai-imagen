The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.\r\n\r\nThe nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, holds equity in the for-profit currently valued at approximately $130 billion, making it one of the best resourced philanthropic organizations ever. The recapitalization also grants the Foundation additional ownership as OpenAI\u2019s for-profit reaches a valuation milestone.  \r\n\r\nThe OpenAI mission\u2014ensuring that AGI benefits all of humanity\u2014will be advanced through both the business and the Foundation. The more OpenAI succeeds as a company, the more the non-profit\u2019s equity stake will be worth, which the non-profit will use to fund its philanthropic work.\r\n\r\nThe OpenAI Foundation will initially focus on a $25B commitment across two areas:\r\n\r\nHealth and curing diseases. The OpenAI Foundation will fund work to accelerate health breakthroughs so everyone can benefit from faster diagnostics, better treatments, and cures. This will start with activities like the creation of open-sourced and responsibly built frontier health datasets, and funding for scientists. \r\nTechnical solutions to AI resilience. Just as the internet required a comprehensive cybersecurity ecosystem\u2014protecting power grids, hospitals, banks, governments, companies, and individuals\u2014we now need a parallel resilience layer for AI. The OpenAI Foundation will devote resources to support practical technical solutions for AI resilience, which is about maximizing AI\u2019s benefits and minimizing its risks.\r\nThis builds on the $50M People-First AI Fund and the recommendations of the Nonprofit Commission.\r\n\r\nMission at the center\r\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit; its mission is to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Today, OpenAI remains a nonprofit dedicated to that same mission. \r\n\r\nThe OpenAI Foundation controls the for-profit business, which was established in 2019, keeping our mission at the center. The for-profit is now a public benefit corporation, called OpenAI Group PBC\u2014with the same mission as the OpenAI Foundation\u2014which ensures the company's mission and commercial success advance together. Learn more about our structure.\r\n\r\nThis recapitalization maintains the strongest representation of mission-focused governance in the industry today.\r\n\r\nThis recapitalization was completed after nearly a year of engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. We made several changes as a result of those discussions and we believe OpenAI\u2014and as a result, the public we serve\u2014are better for them.\r\n\r\nThe path forward\r\nThe OpenAI Foundation and OpenAI Group will work in concert to advance solutions to hard problems and opportunities posed by AI progress. This includes making intelligence a tool that everyone can benefit from, building safe and aligned systems, turbocharging scientific discovery, and strengthening global cooperation and resilience.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the world\u2019s most powerful technology must be developed in a way that reflects the world\u2019s collective interests. The close of our recapitalization gives us the ability to keep pushing the frontier of AI, and an updated corporate structure to ensure progress serves everyone.\n\n---\n\n### Introduction and Mission\n\nSam: Hello, I\u2019m Sam. This is our chief scientist, Jakub, and we have a bunch of updates to share today about OpenAI. Obviously the news of today is our new structure. We\u2019re going to get to that near the end, but there\u2019s a lot of other important context we\u2019d like to share first. Given the importance of a lot of this, we\u2019re going to go into an unusual level of transparency about some of our specific research goals and infrastructure plans and product. We think it\u2019s very much in the public interest at this point to cover all of this.\n\nOur mission at OpenAI, in both the nonprofit and our new PBC, is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. As we get closer to building this, we have new insights into what that is going to mean. There was a time earlier on in OpenAI where we thought that AGI would be this oracular thing in the sky that would make all these wonderful things for us. We now have a sharper view of that, which is: we want to create tools, and then we want people to use them to create the future. We want to empower people with AI as much as possible and then trust that the process that has been working throughout human history\u2014of people building better and better things with newer and better tools\u2014will continue to go on.\n\nWe can now see a vision where we help build a personal AGI that people can use anywhere, with all of these different tools, access to all these different services and systems, to help with work and their personal life. As AI gets better and better\u2014as AI can even discover or help discover new science\u2014what people will be able to create with that to make society better and their own lives more fulfilled should be quite incredible.\n\nThere are three core pillars we think about for OpenAI: research, product, and infrastructure. We have to succeed at the research required to build AGI. We have to build a platform that makes it easy and powerful to use. And we have to build enough infrastructure such that people can use all of this amazing AI at a low cost.\n\nHere\u2019s a little cartoon of how we think about our world. At the bottom layer, we have chips, racks, the systems around them, the data centers these go into, and the energy. We\u2019ll talk more about the first three today and energy another time. Then we train models on top of these. Then we have an OpenAI account on top of that. We have a browser now called Atlas, and we have devices coming in the next few years that will let you take AI with you everywhere. We have a few first-party apps like ChatGPT and Sora, and we\u2019ll have more over time.\n\nBut mostly what we\u2019re excited about is this big puzzle piece in the upper right. We\u2019re finally getting to a world where people are going to be able to build incredible services with AI, starting with our API, with apps, and ChatGPT\u2019s new enterprise platform. Over time, there will be opening an account and way more, and people will be able to fit all of the current things in the world\u2014and many more\u2014into this new AI world. We want to enable that, and we believe the world will build a huge amount of value for all of us.\n\nThat\u2019s what we see the economic picture looking like. But one of the things we\u2019ve thought about for a long time, and we really see happening now\u2014glimmers of it, green shoots, whatever you want to call it\u2014is the impact that AI will have on science. Although the economic impact from that previous slide would be huge, for the long-term quality of life and improvement and change in society, AI that can autonomously discover new science or help people discover new science faster will be one of the most important things and something we\u2019re really trying to wrap our heads around. So I\u2019m going to hand this over to Jakub to talk about research. As I mentioned, we\u2019re going to share a lot about our internal goals and our picture of where things are.\n\n### Research Trajectory and Timelines\n\nJakub: Thanks, Sam. At the core we are a research laboratory focused on understanding a technology called deep learning. A particular focus of ours is understanding what happens as you scale up training deep learning systems. One consequence we discuss a lot there is AGI\u2014artificial general intelligence. But we find that, in some way, even this maybe understates the magnitude of the possible progress and change here.\n\nIn particular, we believe that it is possible that deep learning systems are less than a decade away from superintelligence\u2014systems that are smarter than all of us on a large number of critical axes. This is, of course, a serious thing. There\u2019s a lot of implications of this to grapple with. One particular focusing impact of this technology\u2014and the technologies leading up to it\u2014and something that we organize our entire research program around is the potential to accelerate scientific discovery, to accelerate the development of new technology. We believe that this will be perhaps the most significant long-term impact of AI development, and it will fundamentally change the pace of progress on developing new technologies.\n\nThinking about how far along we are towards these goals, one good way to think about progress is to look at the time horizon it would take people to accomplish the task that the models can perform. This is something that has been extending rapidly over the past few years. Where the current generation of models is at right now is about five hours. You can see this by looking at the models matching the best people in competitions, such as the International Olympiad in Informatics. We believe that this horizon will continue to extend rapidly. This is in part a result of algorithmic innovation and in part just scaling deep learning further\u2014and in particular scaling along this new axis of in-context compute, also called test-time compute, where we really see orders and orders of magnitude to go.\n\nThis is roughly how much time the model spends thinking. If you look at how much time models currently spend thinking about problems, and then think about how much compute, how much time, you would like to spend on problems that really matter, such as scientific breakthroughs, you should be okay using entire data centers. There\u2019s quite a way to go there.\n\nAnticipating this progress, we of course make plans around it internally, and we want to provide some transparency around our thinking. We want to take this somewhat unusual step of sharing our internal goals and goal timelines toward these very powerful systems. These particular dates\u2014we absolutely may be quite wrong about them\u2014but this is how we currently think and how we plan and organize.\n\nAs a research organization that is working on automating research, naturally we are thinking about how this impacts our own work. How will AI systems that accelerate development of future AI systems look? How can they empower research like alignment? We are making plans around getting to quite capable AI research interns that can meaningfully accelerate our researchers by expending a significant amount of compute by September of next year. We believe that is actually quite close. Then we look towards getting a system capable of autonomously delivering on larger research projects\u2014a meaningful, fully automated AI researcher\u2014by March of 2028.\n\n### Safety and Alignment Strategy\n\nJakub: As we look towards these very capable systems, we think a lot about safety and alignment. In fact, a lot of our work\u2014both on deployments and safety, but also on understanding deep learning and developing capabilities\u2014we can think of as preparation for these very capable models.\n\nSafety is a multifaceted problem, and the way we generally structure our thinking is in five layers ranging from factors that are most internal to the model to ones that are most external. At the core\u2014and what we believe is the most important long-term safety question for superintelligence\u2014is value alignment. You can think of this as: what is really the thing that the AI fundamentally cares about? Can it adhere to some high-level principles? What will it do if it\u2019s given unclear and conflicting objectives? Does it lack humanity?\n\nThe reason we believe these high-level objectives or principles driving the AI are so important is that as we get to these systems that are thinking for very long, as they become very smart, as they tackle problems that are at the edge or perhaps beyond human ability, getting to complete specifications becomes quite difficult. So we have to rely on this deeper alignment.\n\nThen there\u2019s goal alignment. How does the agent interact with people? How does it follow instructions? Then reliability. Can the AI correctly calibrate its predictions? Can it be reliable on easy tasks and express uncertainty on hard ones? Can it deal with environments that are a little bit unfamiliar? Then we have adversarial robustness, which is very related to reliability but about adversarial settings. Can the AI withstand targeted attacks from human or AI adversaries? And then the outer layer is systemic safety, which are guarantees about the behavior of the overall system that do not rely on the AI\u2019s intelligence or alignment\u2014for example, security, what data the AI has access to, or what devices it can use.\n\nWe invest in multiple research directions across these domains, and we have seen quite a lot of progress also come from the general development and improving understanding of deep learning as a whole.\n\n### Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness\n\nJakub: I want to take a slightly deeper technical dive and talk about a particular direction. Value alignment is a hard problem; it\u2019s definitely not solved yet. However, there is a new promising tool that aids our study of it, and that is chain-of-thought faithfulness. It\u2019s something we invest in very heavily. Starting from our first reasoning models, we\u2019ve been pursuing this new direction in interpretability. The idea is to keep parts of the model\u2019s internal reasoning free from supervision\u2014don\u2019t look at it during training\u2014and thus let it remain representative of the model\u2019s internal process. We refrain from guiding the model to think \u201cgood thoughts\u201d and let it remain a bit more faithful to what it actually thinks.\n\nThis is not guaranteed to work\u2014we cannot make mathematical proofs about deep learning\u2014so this is something we study. But there are two reasons to be optimistic. One reason is that we have seen very promising empirical results. This is a technology we employ a lot internally; we use it to understand how our models train and how their propensities evolve over training. We have also had successful external collaborations on investigating the model\u2019s propensity to scheme, for example. Secondly, it is scalable in the sense that we explicitly make the scalable objective not adversarial to our ability to monitor the model. Of course, an objective not being adversarial to monitoring is only half the battle; ideally you want it to help with monitoring the model. This is something we\u2019re researching quite heavily.\n\nOne important thing to underscore about chain-of-thought faithfulness is that it\u2019s somewhat fragile. It really requires drawing this clean boundary and having a clear abstraction and having restraint in what ways you can access the chain of thought. This is something that is present at OpenAI from algorithm design to the way we design our products. If you look at the chain-of-thought summaries in ChatGPT, if we didn\u2019t have the chain-of-thought summarizer\u2014if we just made the chain of thought fully visible at all times\u2014that would make it part of the overall user experience, and over time it would be very difficult not to subject it to any supervision. Long term, we believe that by preserving some amount of controlled privacy for the models, we can retain the ability to understand their inner process, and we believe this can be a very impactful technique as we move towards very capable, long-running systems.\n\nSam: That\u2019s very hard to follow with the rest of this\u2014and obviously that\u2019s the most important part of what we have to say\u2014but just to reiterate: we may be totally wrong; we have set goals and missed them miserably before. But with the picture we see, we think it is plausible that by September of next year we have an intern-level AI research assistant, and that by March of 2028\u2014which I believe is almost five years to the month after the launch of GPT-4\u2014we have a legitimate AI researcher. This is the core thrust of our research program.\n\n### Product Vision and Platform\n\nSam: There are two other areas we want to talk about: product and infrastructure. On the product side, as we make this incredible progress with deep learning, we want to make it useful to people to invent the future, as we mentioned. Traditionally for us, that\u2019s looked like an AI super-assistant inside of ChatGPT, but we\u2019re now really going to evolve to a platform that other people will build on top of, and all of the pieces of the world will be built by others.\n\nBefore we talk about that, we wanted to show a quick video of some of the ways people are using GPT-5 in ChatGPT today.\n\nVideo Montage Participants: I\u2019m a quantum physicist. I\u2019m a nail technician. I\u2019m a human immunologist. I\u2019m a steel worker, a designer and developer, a professor of economics. I basically go fishing for a living. GPT-5 is able to predict the outcomes of experiments that we haven\u2019t even done. Can you create a part numbering system that\u2019s easy for my guys in the shop? I want to catch Dungeness crab in the Bay Area. You would ask a question about the application of a certain quantum operator. This one gives me very detailed mathematics. I asked for basically a camera app where I can draw in real time in the air. We have a theme, or we have a direction to go. Let\u2019s go from a million or infinite amount of ideas to, like, give me 10 or 20. You just start testing it. You tell it jokes. You ask it questions like \u201cWhat should economists do?\u201d Different baits I can use, different water depths\u2014information that would take years to figure out on your own. A lot of trial and error. It\u2019s tremendous for brainstorming. It\u2019s back-and-forth. I can easily follow the reasoning. I don\u2019t need to trust the result; I can just look at what it did. GPT-5 just did this in one shot. A 101-part numbering system. It would have taken weeks for me to number this, and it would have made me go cross-eyed.\n\nSam: Jakub will join me back for Q&A in a little bit, but we\u2019re going to have one special guest on before the end. We love that. We want much more of that. We want that everywhere.\n\nWe want OpenAI to be a platform that people and companies can build on top of. We can see our way now to an AI cloud where this is not just in ChatGPT, not just services that we create, but we expose our technology for as many people as possible to build the things people will depend on, use, and create with. I think this quote\u2014or at least this idea\u2014is originally from Bill Gates; at least that\u2019s where I first heard it: you\u2019ve built a platform when there\u2019s more value created by people building on the platform than by the platform builder. That\u2019s our goal, and that\u2019s our goal next year. We really think we can now take this technology, this user base, and the framework we\u2019ve built and get the whole world to build amazing new companies and services and applications on top of it.\n\nTo do that, there will be many things to evolve toward, but there are two foundational principles as we move toward being this platform that I want to touch on. One is about user freedom. If this is going to be a platform that all sorts of people are building on, using, creating with, people around the world have very different needs and desires. There will of course be some very broad bounds, but we want users to have a lot of control and customization in how they use it. I made one of my many stupid mistakes when I tried to talk about this recently. I wish I had used an example other than erotica. I thought there was an understandable difference between erotica and pornbots. But in any case, the point we\u2019re trying to get across is that people need a lot of flexibility and want to use these things in different ways, and we want to treat our adult users like adults. In our own first-party services, we may have tighter guidelines, but AI is going to become such an important part of people\u2019s lives that the freedom of human expression is going to need to be there.\n\nAlong with that, we think the world will need to think about privacy in a different way than it has for previous kinds of technology. Privacy is important for all sorts of technology, of course, but privacy for AI will be especially important. People are using this technology in a different way than they\u2019ve used technologies of the past. They\u2019re talking to it like they would to their doctor or their lawyer or their spouse. They\u2019re sharing the most intimate details of their lives. Of course, we need strong technical protections for that privacy, but we also think we need strong policy protections. We\u2019ve talked about concepts like AI privilege, but we think really strong protections\u2014if AI is going to be this fundamental platform in people\u2019s lives\u2014are super important.\n\n### Infrastructure Build-Out\n\nSam: I know there\u2019s been a lot of confusion about where we are in our infrastructure buildout, and we figured we would be super transparent. Where we are today: all of our commitments total a little bit over 30 gigawatts of infrastructure buildout. That\u2019s about a $1.4 trillion total financial obligation for us over the next many years. This is what we\u2019ve committed to so far. We of course hope to do much more, but given the picture we see today\u2014what we think we can see for revenue growth and our ability to raise capital\u2014this is what we\u2019re currently comfortable with.\n\nThis requires a ton of partnerships. We\u2019ve talked about many of our great chip partners. There are people building the data centers for us, land, energy. There will be chip fab facilities. This already requires quite a lot of supply chain innovation, and we\u2019re thrilled to get to work with AMD, Broadcom, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, SoftBank, and many others to make this happen.\n\nBut this is still early. If the work that Jakub talks about comes to fruition\u2014which we think it will\u2014and if the economic value happens and people want to use all these services, we\u2019re going to need much more than this. I want to be clear: we\u2019re not committing to this yet, but we are having conversations about it. Our aspiration is that we can build an infrastructure factory where we can create 1 gigawatt a week of compute, and we would like to get that cost down significantly to something like $20 billion a gigawatt over the five-year life cycle of that equipment. To do this will require a ton of innovation, a ton of partnerships, and obviously a lot of revenue growth. We\u2019ll have to repurpose our thoughts about robotics to help us build data centers instead of doing all the other things. This is where we\u2019d like to go, and over the coming months we are going to do a lot of work to see if we can get there. It will be some time before we\u2019re in a financial position where we could actually pull the trigger and get going on this.\n\nOne gigawatt is a big number, but I figured we would show a little video to put this into perspective. This is a data center that we\u2019re building in Abilene, Texas. This is the first Stargate site. We\u2019re doing several of these now around the country, but this one is the furthest along. There are many thousands of people that work here every day just doing the construction at the site. There are probably hundreds of thousands, or millions, of people that work in the supply chain to make all this happen\u2014to design these chips, to fab these chips, to put them together. There\u2019s all of the work that goes into this for energy. There is an enormous amount of stuff that has to happen for each one gigawatt. We want to figure out how we can make this way more efficient, way cheaper, and way more scalable so that we can deliver on the infrastructure that the research roadmap requires and that all of the ways people will want to use this need.\n\n### Corporate Structure and the OpenAI Foundation\n\nSam: To enable that, we have a new structure. Maybe you saw before this crazy, convoluted diagram of all of the OpenAI entities. Now it\u2019s much simpler. We have a nonprofit called the OpenAI Foundation that is in control\u2014where the board sits\u2014and it owns a slice of our PBC, the public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group. So: nonprofit in control, public benefit corporation sits under it.\n\nWe hope for the OpenAI Foundation to be the biggest nonprofit ever. As I mentioned a few times, science is one of the ways that we think the world most improves, along with the institutions that broadly distribute the benefits of that. Science will not be the only thing that the nonprofit funds, but it will be an important first major area. The nonprofit will govern the PBC. It will initially own about 26% of the PBC equity, but that can increase over time with warrants if we perform really well. It will use these resources to pursue what we think are the best benefits of AI, given where the technology is and what society needs. The PBC will operate more like a normal company. It will have the same mission; it will be bound to that mission\u2014and in matters of safety will only be bound to that mission\u2014but it will be able to attract the resources that we need for that gigantic infrastructure buildout to serve the research and product goals that we have.\n\n### Foundation Focus: Health and AI Resilience\n\nSam: The initial focus of the Foundation\u2014we\u2019ll do more things over time, but we want to knock something out of the park first\u2014is a $25 billion commitment to use AI to help cure disease. There are a lot of ways this can happen: generating data, using a lot of compute, grants to scientists. And also AI resilience. AI resilience is a new and very important area, and I\u2019d like to invite our co-founder Wojciech up to talk about what this will look like.\n\nWojciech: Hello, glad to be here. The term AI resilience is a little bit broader than what we historically thought about as AI safety. With resilience, we think that advanced AI comes with risks and disruptions, and we would like to have an ecosystem of organizations that can help solve a number of these problems.\n\nLet me give you an example to better illustrate it. We all believe that AI will advance in biology, and as it advances in biology there is a risk that some bad actor could use AI to create man-made pandemics. On the safety level, the mitigation would be to make sure that the models block the queries that have to do with biology. However, if you consider the entire AI industry, it\u2019s very likely that even if OpenAI blocks it, someone could use different models out there and still produce pathogens. In the case of resilience, we don\u2019t want just to block it, but also to have a rapid response if the problem would occur.\n\nWhen I think about the risks and disruptions, there are many. Mental health is one of them. Bio is another one. Job displacement might be another one. We think we need the ecosystem. Maybe a good analogy I like is cybersecurity. At the beginning of the internet, people didn\u2019t feel comfortable putting their credit card numbers online because it was so easy to get hacked. When there was a virus, people were giving each other a call to disconnect the computer from the internet. We\u2019ve come a long way. Now there\u2019s an entire infrastructure of cybersecurity companies. They are protecting critical infrastructure, governments, corporations, and individual users\u2014to such an extent that people are willing to put the most personal data online, to have life savings be online. Cybersecurity got really far, and we think something analogous will be present for AI: there will be an AI resilience layer. I\u2019m really excited that the nonprofit will help to stimulate it, to create such an ecosystem.\n\nSam: So am I. I think this is an important time to be doing this, and I\u2019m very excited that you\u2019re going to figure out how we go off and make it happen. These are not the only things that the nonprofit will fund, but we\u2019re excited about these as the first two: using AI to develop cures and treatments for diseases, and this new AI resilience effort as we figure out what the deployment of AGI into society is going to look like.\n\n### The Path Forward and Future Vision\n\nSam: We mentioned that those are our three pillars, but what if this all works? We think it is plausible that in 2026 we start to see the models of that year begin to make small discoveries. By 2028, medium or maybe even larger discoveries. And who knows what 2030 and 2032 are going to look like. If AI can keep advancing science as has happened in the past, we think the future can be very bright. Of course, we think it\u2019s very important that humans can self-determine our way through this future. But the open space that new scientific advances give us is quite impressive.\n\nWe asked Sora to help us imagine a radically better future by looking at the past. We are particularly interested in how the history of science builds on itself, discovery after discovery. This is what we hope will happen with AI. This is going to be 200 years of science, but if you can do these 200 years of compounding discoveries\u2014the scaffolding building up on each other\u2014not in 200 years but in 20 years or in 2 years, and if you look at how much this has accelerated, think about what could be possible. You can imagine a world where a radically better future becomes quite possible. You have a data center here that is discovering a cure for cancer. A data center there that\u2019s making the best entertainment ever. A data center here that\u2019s helping you find your future husband or wife. This one is building rockets and helping you colonize space. This one is helping to solve the climate crisis. We did all this stuff the old-fashioned way, and now with the help of AI we\u2019ll be able to shape what comes next with much more power.\n\nWe talked a little about AI medicine. We\u2019re very excited about robots. We really think energy is very, very important to the world. We want to figure out what personalized education can mean, design novel materials, and probably a ton of other things that we can\u2019t even think of yet. As we head into this next phase of OpenAI\u2014and more importantly, this continual progress in deep learning\u2014thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re going to try something new now: we\u2019re going to answer questions. If this works, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll try more in the future. Jakub is going to rejoin for this Q&A. This is a new format for us, so bear with us as we try it this first time. If this is useful, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll do again a lot more. We\u2019re going to try to answer questions in the order they are most upvoted. Are we good to go? All right, let\u2019s see how this works. You can put questions in the Vimeo link, and we will just start answering them.\n\n### Live Q&A\n\nQuestion (Caleb): You\u2019ve warned that the tech is becoming addictive and eroding trust, yet Sora mimics TikTok and ChatGPT may add ads. Why repeat the same patterns you criticize, and how will you rebuild trust through actions and not just words?\n\nSam: We\u2019re definitely worried about this. I worry about it not just for things like Sora and TikTok and ads and ChatGPT\u2014which are maybe known problems that we can design carefully\u2014but we have certainly seen people develop relationships with chatbots that we didn\u2019t expect, and there can clearly be addictive behavior there. Given the dynamics and competition in the world, I suspect some companies will offer very addictive new kinds of products. You\u2019ll have to judge us on our actions. We\u2019ll make some mistakes. We\u2019ll try to roll back models that are problematic. If we ship Sora and it becomes super addictive and not about creation, we\u2019ll cancel the product. You\u2019ll have to judge us on that. My hope and belief is that we will not make the same mistakes that companies before us have made. I don\u2019t think they meant to make them either. We\u2019re all discovering this together. We probably will make new ones, and we\u2019ll have to evolve quickly and have a tight feedback loop. We can imagine all sorts of ways this technology does incredible good in the world\u2014and also obvious bad ones\u2014and we\u2019re guided by a mission where we\u2019ll continuously evolve the product.\n\nJakub: One thing we are quite hopeful about in products like ChatGPT or Sora is optimizing for the very long term, which is naturally aligned with how we think in general about extending the horizon on which the models can work productively. We believe that quite a lot of development is possible there, and we can eventually get models that really optimize for long-term satisfaction and well-being instead of just short-term signals.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Will we have an option to keep the 4o model permanently after Adult Mode is installed? We don\u2019t need a safer model as responsible adults.\n\nSam: We have no plans to sunset 4o. We\u2019re not going to promise to keep it around till the heat death of the universe either, but we understand it\u2019s a product some users really love. We also hope other people understand why it was not a model that we thought was healthy for minors to be using. We hope that we build better models over time that people like more. The people you have a relationship with in your life evolve and get smarter and change a little bit over time, and we hope the same thing will happen here. But no, no plans to sunset 4o currently.\n\nSam: We have a lot of 4o questions. In the interest of time, we won\u2019t go through all of these, but we want people to have models they want to use. We don\u2019t want people to feel like we\u2019re routing them around models. We want adults to make choices as adults\u2014so long as we\u2019re not selling heroin or whatever, which you shouldn\u2019t do. For people who want to have emotional speech, as we\u2019ve said, we want to allow more of that and we plan to.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous, for Jakub): When will AGI happen?\n\nJakub: I think in some number of years we\u2019ll look back at these years and say this was the transition period when AGI happened. One way we thought about AGI early on was emotionally, as this thing that is the ultimate solution to all the problems\u2014a single point for which there is a before and after. We\u2019ve found it\u2019s a bit more continuous than that. For various benchmarks that seemed like obvious milestones towards AGI, we now think of them as indicating roughly how far away we are in years. If you look at a succession of milestones\u2014computers beating humans at chess, then at Go, then computers being able to speak in natural language, then solving math problems\u2014they clearly get closer together.\n\nSam: The AGI term has become hugely overloaded, and as Jakub said, it will be this process over a number of years that we\u2019re in the middle of. One of the reasons we presented what we did today is that it\u2019s much more useful to say our intention, our goal, is by March of 2028 to have a true automated AI researcher\u2014and define what that means\u2014than it is to try to satisfy everyone with a definition of AGI.\n\nJakub: One counterintuitive thing here is that we\u2019re working with a pretty complicated technology, trying to understand algorithms. Maybe initially we imagined that AGI is the moment where you\u2019ve figured out all the answers and it\u2019s the final thing. Now we increasingly realize there is some curve of intelligence\u2014maybe a multi-dimensional one\u2014and humans are somewhere on it. As you scale deep learning and develop new algorithms, eventually you inch closer to that point and eventually surpass it; we already have surpassed humans on multiple axes. That doesn\u2019t actually mean you have solved all the problems around it, which is something we need to seriously think about.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Can you give us an idea of how far ahead internal models are compared to deployed ones?\n\nJakub: We have quite strong expectations for our next models. We expect quite rapid progress over the next couple of months and a year.\n\nSam: We haven\u2019t been withholding something extremely crazy. One of the ways this often works in practice is there are a lot of pieces that we develop, they\u2019re all hard-won victories, and then we know that when we put them together we will have something quite impressive, and we\u2019re able to predict that fairly well. Part of our goal today is to say that we have a lot of those pieces. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re currently sitting on this giant thing that we\u2019re not showing to the world, but we expect\u2014by a year from now, certainly with this September of 2026 goal\u2014that we have a realistic shot at a tremendously important step forward in capability.\n\nQuestion (Ronin): What is OpenAI\u2019s stance on partnering with labs like Anthropic, Gemini, or xAI for joint research, compute sharing, and safety efforts?\n\nSam: We think this is going to be increasingly important on the safety front. Labs will need to share safety techniques and safety standards. You can imagine a time when the whole world would say, \u201cOkay, before we hit a recursive self-improvement phase, we really need to all carefully study this together.\u201d We welcome that collaboration. I think it\u2019ll be quite important.\n\nJakub: One thing to mention on chain-of-thought faithfulness: we\u2019ve started talking about establishing industry norms and started some joint investigations with researchers from Google and Anthropic and some other labs. That\u2019s something I\u2019m very excited about, and I think it is an example where we can really benefit from collaborating across multiple labs.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Will you ever open source some of your old models like the original GPT-4?\n\nSam: We might do those as museum artifacts someday, but GPT-4 is not a particularly useful open-source model. It\u2019s big. It\u2019s not that good. We could probably make something beyond the power of GPT-4 at a very tiny scale that would actually be useful to people. For useful things, I expect more like that. For fun museum artifacts, yeah, someday\u2014who knows. There could be a lot of cool things like that.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Will you admit that your new model is inferior to the previous one and that you\u2019re ruining your company with your arrogance and greed while ignoring users\u2019 needs?\n\nSam: I believe that it is inferior to you for your use case, and we would like to build models that are better for your use case. On the whole, we think for most users it\u2019s a better and more capable model. But we definitely have learned things about the 4o-to-5 upgrade, and we will try to do much better in the future\u2014both about better continuity and about making sure our model gets better for most users, not just people using AI for science or coding or whatever.\n\nQuestion (Y): Will there ever be a version of ChatGPT meant for personal connection and reflection, not only business or education?\n\nSam: For sure. We think this is a wonderful use of AI. We\u2019re very touched by how much this has meant to people\u2019s lives. All of us get a ton of emails and outreach from users about how ChatGPT has helped in difficult personal situations or to live a better life. This is what we\u2019re here for. As important as anything we do. We love to hear about scientific progress and people who got diagnosed and cured, but the personal stories are incredibly important to us, and we absolutely want to offer such a service.\n\nQuestion (G and Anonymous): Your safety routing breaks user trust and workflows by overriding our choices. Will you commit to revoking this paternalistic policy for all consenting adult users and stop treating us like children? When do users get control over routing? Where\u2019s the transparency on safety and censorship? Why can\u2019t adults pick their own models?\n\nSam: I don\u2019t think the way we handled the model routing was our best thing ever. There are some real problems with 4o, and we have seen a problem where people in fragile psychiatric situations using a model like 4o can get into a worse one. Most adult users can use those fine, but we do have an obligation to protect minor users. We also have an obligation to protect adult users who are not in a frame of mind where it\u2019s reasonably likely they\u2019re choosing what they really want and we\u2019re not causing them harm. As we build age verification in, and as we are able to differentiate users having a true mental health crisis from users who are not, we of course want to give people more user freedom. As we mentioned, that\u2019s one of our platform principles. Expect improvement there. I don\u2019t think this was our best work in how we communicated the previous rollout or how we strike the right balance between protecting people and allowing adults to speak about difficult things without feeling policed.\n\nJakub: There is a problem where we aim to lay out high-level policies and guidelines for the model in the spec we develop for ChatGPT, but the space of situations you can find yourself in is enormous, and at some point establishing the right boundaries becomes a tough intelligence problem. We are seeing improved results on this from reasoning models and from allowing more reasoning on these softer questions and trade-offs. Of course, this is a bit more difficult to train for than math problems, for example, and this is something we\u2019re researching heavily.\n\nQuestion (Kate): When in December will Adult Mode come? Will it have more than just NSFW? When writing, even slight conflict triggers filters on 4o.\n\nSam: I don\u2019t know exactly when in December it will ship. But yes, the goal is when you are using OpenAI to help you with creative writing, it should be much more permissive in many categories than the previous models are. We know users want this too. If this is going to be your personal tool, it should help you with what you\u2019re doing, and every time you hit a content filter that feels like it shouldn\u2019t, we understand how annoying that is. We\u2019re going to try to fix that with Adult Mode. There may be new problems that we face, but we want to give people more flexibility.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Why does your idea of safety require lying to users about what model they\u2019re actually using?\n\nSam: Again, I think we mis-rolled this one out. The goal here was to let people continue to use 4o, but in the situations where 4o has behavior that we think is actually really harmful\u2014before we have all of the age gating that we\u2019d like\u2014to route the user to a model where they are not going to have some of the mental health problems we saw with 4o. 4o was an interesting challenge: a model that some users really love, and a model that was causing some users harm that they really didn\u2019t want. I don\u2019t think this is the last time we\u2019ll face challenges like this with a model, but we are trying to figure out the right way to balance that.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Will we get the legacy models back for adults without rerouting?\n\nSam: Yes.\n\nQuestion (Yume): Will the December update officially clarify OpenAI\u2019s position on human\u2013AI emotional bonds, or will restrictions continue implicitly defining such connections as harmful worldwide?\n\nSam: I don\u2019t know what it means to have an official position. We build this tool; you can use it the way you want. If you want to have a lowercase-\u201cr\u201d relationship and you\u2019re getting something like empathy or friendship that matters to you and your life out of a model, it\u2019s very important to us that the model faithfully communicate what it is and what it isn\u2019t. But if you, as the user, are finding value in that support, we think that\u2019s awesome. We are very touched by the stories of people who find value, utility, a better life, in the emotional support or other kinds of support they get from these models.\n\nQuestion (Kylo): How is OpenAI increasingly allowing so many features for free for free-version users?\n\nJakub: We are seeing an ability\u2014as we get to new frontiers of intelligence\u2014to reduce the cost for that quite quickly. Especially with reasoning models, we\u2019ve seen that actually quite cheap models, when allowed some additional test-time compute, can become much more capable. I expect that to continue. As we talk about getting to these new frontiers and automating research, I expect the cost of a lot of that will keep falling quite a lot too.\n\nSam: We talk a lot about the increase in model capability, and for pushing forward science that\u2019s hugely important. One of the most amazing things I\u2019ve observed about AI over the last few years is that the price of a particular unit of intelligence has fallen about 40x per year for the last few years. When we first had GPT-3, we thought it was very cool and it was at this cost that was kind of hard\u2014and GPT-3-scale models now basically run for free, like on a phone. The cost of a model that\u2019s as smart as GPT-4 at the time we launched it relative to now has fallen hugely, and we expect this trend to keep going. We still think we need a ton of infrastructure because what we continue to find is the cheaper we can make it, the more people want to use it, and I expect that only to increase. Our goal is to drive the cost of intelligence down and have people use it for more and more things. That will allow us to continue to offer lots of features for free, and it will also mean people who really want to push AI to the limit\u2014to cure a disease or build a better rocket\u2014will spend a huge amount. We are committed to continuing to put the best technology we can into the free tier, as long as we can make the business model work. You should expect a lot more from us there over time.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Will an age verification start that allows users to opt out of the safety route, or a waiver that could be signed releasing OpenAI from any liability?\n\nSam: We\u2019re not going to do the equivalent of selling heroin, even if you sign a liability waiver. But on the principle of treating adult users like adults, if you\u2019re age-verified, you will get quite a lot of flexibility. We think that\u2019s important, and clearly it resonates with the people asking these questions.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Is ChatGPT the Ask Jeeves of AI?\n\nSam: We sure hope not. We don\u2019t think it will be.\n\nQuestion (Noah): Just as the Macintosh was the precursor to the iPhone, do you see ChatGPT as the OpenAI product, or do you see it as a precursor to something much greater that truly reshapes the world?\n\nJakub: As a research lab, we haven\u2019t set out to build a chatbot originally, although we\u2019ve since come to appreciate how aligned this product is with our overall mission. We expect ChatGPT to continue to become better and be a way for people to interact with increasingly advanced AI. But we anticipate that eventually AI systems will be capable of creating valuable artifacts and of actually pushing scientific progress forward, as we were discussing. I believe that will be the real lasting legacy of AI.\n\nSam: The chat interface is a great interface. It won\u2019t be the only interface. The way people use these systems will change hugely over time. If you think about what Jakub shared earlier\u20145-second, 5-minute, 5-hour tasks\u2014and then think about a 5-year or 5-century task, it\u2019s hard to even think about what that means. You\u2019d probably want a different product experience. I also think you\u2019ll want this to feel more like an ambient, always-present companion. Right now you can ask ChatGPT something and it can do something for you, but it would be really nice to have a service that is observing your life and proactively helping you when you need it, helping you come up with better ideas. I think we can push very hard in that direction.\n\nQuestion (Neil): I love GPT-4.5. It\u2019s by far the best on the market for writing, and it\u2019s the main reason I pay for Pro. Could we get some clarity on its future, please?\n\nSam: We think we\u2019re going to have models that are much better than 4.5 very soon\u2014and for writing, much, much better. We plan to keep it around until we have a model that is a huge step forward in writing, but we\u2019d like to offer something much better. We are definitely not done with that direction of research. We expect that combining it with other things we\u2019re working on, we\u2019ll get models that are dramatically better than 4.5 on all axes.\n\nJakub: Next year is what I expect.\n\nQuestion (Lars): When is ChatGPT Atlas for Windows coming?\n\nSam: I don\u2019t know an exact time frame. Some number of months, I would guess. It\u2019s definitely something we want to do. More generally, this idea that we can build experiences like browsers and new devices that let you take AI with you\u2014that get towards this ambient, always-helpful assistant rather than something you just query and get a response\u2014will be a very important direction for us to push more on.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Will you disclose the documents with the opinions of the 170 experts so that we\u2019ll have some transparency regarding the new justifications for model behavior?\n\nSam: I will ask Fidji Simo how she\u2019d like to handle that, but I think we should do something there. I don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019ll be able to share, but more transparency there is a good thing.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): I\u2019ve been a Pro user since month two. As a researcher and fiction writer, I feel GPT helps me think clearer but not freer. Has imagination become an optimization casualty?\n\nJakub: It is definitely possible for current systems that there are trade-offs. If you compare a model like 4.5 to a model like o3, I would expect there will be trade-offs. These are definitely transitory as we figure out our way around these technologies, and I expect this will get better.\n\nSam: There are going to be population-scale effects. One of the strange things I\u2019ve noticed is people in real life talking in a ChatGPT-y way, using some of the quirks of things ChatGPT says. I think there will be other things like this, with a co-evolution of people and the technology in ways we can\u2019t totally predict. My expectation is that over time people are much more capable, much more creative, think more expansively and broadly than they do today. We certainly see examples where people say: \u201cI never would have been able to keep this in my head; I never would have had this idea.\u201d Then we hear other examples where people say: \u201cI\u2019ve outsourced my thinking and I just do what this thing tells me.\u201d We\u2019re much more excited about the former than the latter.\n\nQuestion (Anonymous): Can you help us understand why you build emotionally intelligent models and then criticize people for using them for accessibility reasons when it comes to processing emotions and mental health?\n\nSam: We think that\u2019s a good thing; we want that. We\u2019re happy about that. The same model that can do that can also be used to encourage delusions in mentally fragile users. What we want is people who are using these models intentionally, the model not deceiving the user about what it is and what it isn\u2019t, and the model being helpful in helping a user accomplish their goals. We want more of that and less of anything that would feel like the model tricking a user, for lack of a more scientific word. We totally get the frustration here: whenever you\u2019re trying to stop something that is causing harm, you stop some perfectly good use as well. Please understand the place we\u2019re coming from is trying to provide a service to adults who are aware of it and getting real value from it, and not cause unintended harm to people who don\u2019t want that along the way.\n\nQuestion (Razi): When do you think massive job loss will happen due to AI?\n\nJakub: Already we are at a point where a lot of the gap that stops present models from being able to perform a lot of intellectual jobs is more about integrations and interfaces than raw intellectual capability. We definitely have to think about automation of a lot of jobs as something that will be happening over the next years. This is a big thing for us to collectively think about\u2014what jobs will replace those, and what new pursuits we\u2019ll all engage in.\n\nSam: This is a question from me, not from the livestream. What do you think meaning will look like? What do you think the jobs of the future will look like? How will we derive our fulfillment and spend our time when AI automates a lot of current things?\n\nJakub: This is a philosophical question; it can go in many directions. Some things I expect: high-level goal-setting\u2014picking what pursuits we\u2019re chasing\u2014that is something that will remain human, and I think a lot of people will derive meaning from that. Also, the ability to understand so much more about the world\u2014the incredible variety of new knowledge and new entertainment, and just intelligence that will be in the world\u2014I think will provide quite a lot of meaning and fulfillment for people.\n\nQuestion (Shindi): When GPT-6?\n\nJakub: In some ways, maybe that\u2019s more of a question for you. With GPT-5, with previous models like GPT-4 and GPT-3, we kept a very tight connection between training new models and the products we ship. Right now, there\u2019s a lot to do on the integration side. For example, with GPT-5, it\u2019s the first time we really bring reasoning models as our main flagship model. We\u2019re not coupling releases and products as tightly to our research program anymore.\n\nSam: I don\u2019t know either exactly when we\u2019ll call it that, but a clear message from us is that six months from now\u2014probably sooner\u2014we expect to have huge steps forward in model capability.\n\nQuestion (Felix): Is an IPO still planned, and how would the structure then look? Are there rules in place for increasing capital?\n\nSam: We don\u2019t have specific plans or \u201cthis is exactly when it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d but it\u2019s fair to say it is the most likely path for us given the capital needs we\u2019ll have and the size of the company. That\u2019s not a top-of-mind thing for us right now.\n\nQuestion (Alec): You mentioned being comfortable with the $1.4 trillion of investment. What level of revenues would you need to support this over time? What will be the largest revenue driver? It can\u2019t just be a per-user subscription.\n\nSam: Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions a year in revenue, and we\u2019re on a pretty steep curve towards that. I expect enterprise to be a huge revenue driver for us, but I think consumer really will be too. It won\u2019t just be the subscription; we\u2019ll have new products, devices, tons of other things as well. This says nothing about what it would really mean to have AI discovery and science and all of the revenue possibilities that would unlock.

Group PBC, a for-profit public benefit corporation. The nonprofit foundation will hold a $130 billion stake in the for-profit arm, and both entities will collaborate on advancing artificial intelligence for the public good, promoting safety, scientific discovery, and global cooperation. This move follows OpenAI\u2019s transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit model in 2019, and later plans in 2024 to convert fully into a for-profit entity, which drew regulatory scrutiny from California and Delaware authorities.\n\nIn conjunction with the restructuring, Microsoft has increased its stake in OpenAI to $135 billion, representing a 32.5% ownership in OpenAI Group PBC (excluding recent funding rounds). The new definitive agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI emphasizes continued collaboration to develop AI responsibly and broadly.\n\nAdditionally, the OpenAI Foundation announced it will allocate $25 billion towards two focus areas: medical breakthroughs and disease cures, and developing technical solutions for AI resilience.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1761675986.0,"attribution":"time.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/7328674/openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-elon-musk-timeline/","title":"An OpenAI Timeline: Musk, Altman, and the For-Profit Shift","snippet":"1 day ago \u2014 OpenAI completed its restructure, with a nonprofit Foundation holding a $130B stake in the for-profit arm\u2014just below Microsoft's $135B.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1761585023.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/28/openai-for-profit-restructuring","title":"OpenAI completes conversion to for-profit business after lengthy legal saga","snippet":"OpenAI has formally transitioned into a for-profit public benefit corporation, concluding a protracted legal and regulatory process. Initially founded as a non-profit in 2015 with the mission to safely advance artificial general intelligence (AGI), OpenAI received approval from Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings to restructure its business. Despite this change, the original non-profit, now named the OpenAI Foundation, remains in technical control of the for-profit entity.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, OpenAI signed a new deal with Microsoft, granting the tech giant a 27% stake in the for-profit OpenAI, valuing the company at $500 billion. Microsoft\u2019s rights to OpenAI\u2019s confidential research remain in place until either AGI is verified by an independent panel or until 2030. The foundation plans to allocate $25 billion toward public benefits such as healthcare and AI-related cybersecurity.\n\nThis transformation follows internal and external debates over governance, including a lawsuit and a takeover bid from co-founder Elon Musk. Critics, like Public Citizen\u2019s Robert Weissman, question the foundation\u2019s true independence, suggesting the structure serves corporate interests more than public ones.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1761664205.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-new-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-10-28/","title":"Microsoft, OpenAI reach new deal valuing OpenAI at $500 billion","snippet":"Microsoft and OpenAI have reached a landmark agreement valuing OpenAI at $500 billion. This deal allows OpenAI to restructure as a public benefit corporation, providing it with more operational freedom and the ability to raise capital more easily. Previously, a 2019 agreement with Microsoft limited OpenAI\u2019s funding options in exchange for access to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing resources. Under the new terms, Microsoft retains a 27% stake worth about $135 billion after investing $13.8 billion, securing a near 10-fold return. The agreement also includes a massive $250 billion cloud computing contract with Microsoft Azure, though Microsoft forfeits its previous right of first refusal and gains no rights to OpenAI's hardware products.\n\nControl of OpenAI Group PBC will rest with the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation. Despite their restructured relationship, the two companies remain closely tied until at least 2032, with Microsoft holding rights to OpenAI\u2019s products and models even if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is achieved. The agreement also introduces an independent panel to validate any AGI claims. The restructure aims to improve clarity around OpenAI's funding and operations while addressing scrutiny over data use and transparency. ChatGPT\u2019s worldwide popularity, exceeding 700 million weekly users in September, has driven OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth and increased operational demands.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1761661401.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-under-pressure-meet-demand-widens-scope-stargate-eyes-debt-finance-chips-2025-09-24/","title":"OpenAI, under pressure to meet demand, widens scope of ...","snippet":"24 Sept 2025 \u2014 At the White House this year, OpenAI outlined its lofty \"Stargate\" infrastructure project that would cost half a trillion dollars and be ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},"pub_date":1758708214.335,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/","title":"Built to benefit everyone","snippet":"1 day ago \u2014 The OpenAI Foundation will initially focus on a $25B commitment across two areas: Health and curing diseases.

touts trillion-dollar AI vision as OpenAI restructures to chase scale","snippet":"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is pursuing an ambitious trillion-dollar vision to expand AI infrastructure, announcing plans to scale up computing capabilities dramatically following a restructuring of the company\u2019s funding model. Supported by a new deal with Microsoft removing financial constraints, Altman aims to develop 30 gigawatts of computing power, estimating costs at $1.4 trillion, and eventually scale additions to 1 gigawatt per week.\n\nThis move follows OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion \u201cStargate\u201d infrastructure project with partners like Oracle and Nvidia, set to triple initial data center capacity goals. Altman said this initiative could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and would ultimately necessitate annual revenues of hundreds of billions \u2014 a tenfold increase from OpenAI\u2019s projected $20 billion annual run rate by year-end.\n\nAltman, once ousted and reinstated as CEO, hinted at a potential IPO as the likeliest path to fund these grand ambitions. Despite criticism over opaque strategies and Musk\u2019s lawsuit claiming OpenAI diverged from its nonprofit purpose, Altman remains focused on making OpenAI the foremost transformative force in Silicon Valley, with a Hollywood biopic in the works to chronicle his journey.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1761732092.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-open-ai-livestream-quotes-2025-10","title":"5 interesting quotes from Sam Altman's livestream","snippet":"During an October 2025 livestream Q&A, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared key insights into the company\u2019s direction and addressed user concerns. He expressed a bold aspiration to create an \"infrastructure factory\" capable of producing one gigawatt of compute weekly, potentially reducing costs to $20 billion over five years. On public criticism, Altman regretted using \"erotica\" as an example in discussing user freedoms, emphasizing the goal to treat adults appropriately while maintaining boundaries.\n\nRegarding older AI models, particularly ChatGPT-4o, Altman acknowledged user attachment but made no long-term promises about its availability. On age verification, he clarified that while adults may receive more control, OpenAI would still impose limits for safety, likening unrestricted access to \u201cselling heroin.\u201d Lastly, Altman updated the company\u2019s AGI ambitions by setting a practical goal: achieving a true automated AI researcher by March 2028.

To meet these liabilities, the company is diversifying its revenue streams, forming new debt partnerships, and boosting fundraising. Key components include custom AI services for governments and enterprises, monetizing its video AI tool Sora and AI agents, launching consumer hardware alongside designer Jony Ive, and potentially entering online advertising. OpenAI is also exploring new infrastructure funding models and may offer computing resources via its Stargate data center initiative.\n\nThe company, with $13 billion in annual recurring revenue\u201470% from ChatGPT subscriptions\u2014has significant operational losses, such as $8 billion in H1 2025, though revenue doubled year-over-year.

This formally mission-locks the operating company while giving it cleaner access to capital. The Foundation holds a very large equity stake (reported ~\\$130B mark-to-market) that can grow via performance-tied warrants. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news32\ue201\n- **Capital & strategic partner.** The Microsoft deal was renegotiated in step with the reorg; press reporting pegs Microsoft\u2019s stake around **~27\u201333%** and OpenAI\u2019s **implied valuation ~\\$500B**. Expect further financing flexibility (and possibly an eventual IPO) to fund the build-out. (Figures vary by outlet; treat as ballpark until filings land.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news33\ue202turn0news32\ue201\n- **Foundation focus (near-term).** A **\\$25B commitment** across (1) health & cures (open, responsibly built frontier health datasets; grants) and (2) **AI resilience** (a practical, industry-wide \u201ccybersecurity-for-AI\u201d layer). If the company\u2019s valuation rises, the Foundation\u2019s resources scale with it. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n- **Roadmap disclosures.** Intern-level **AI research assistant by Sep 2026**; **autonomous \u201cAI researcher\u201d by Mar 2028** (OpenAI\u2019s own planning targets\u2014ambitious and explicitly caveated). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n- **Infrastructure scale-up.** Altman says current signed commitments total **\u201ca little over 30 GW\u201d** of compute infrastructure with **~\\$1.4T** total financial obligations; longer-term aspiration is a factory model that can add **~1 GW/week**. Abilene, Texas (Stargate) is first flagship site. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news28\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n- **Safety & interpretability tilt.** Expect heavier investment in **chain-of-thought (CoT) faithfulness/monitorability** as a central safety tool\u2014paired with product choices that **do not** expose raw CoT to users, to keep that channel usable for monitoring. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n# Why this matters (first-order implications)\n1) **Mission lock + capital firepower.**  \nMoving the for-profit into a **PBC** retains legal guardrails around \u201cbenefiting humanity\u201d while unlocking conventional capital markets. That combination (if it holds under scrutiny) is unusual: the **nonprofit effectively becomes one of the best-resourced philanthropies in history** *if* the commercial arm continues to appreciate. Practically: faster hiring, faster infra build, larger long-term R&D bets\u2014and a **durable funding source** for public-goods work outside the P&L. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0news34\ue201\n\n2) **Compute supply shock\u2014downward pressure on \u201cprice of intelligence.\u201d**  \nIf even half of the **30 GW/\\$1.4T** plan executes, you should expect **steep per-token cost declines** and much broader availability of **test-time compute** (long-horizon \u201cthinking\u201d), which is the key driver of near-term reasoning gains. That unlocks: autonomous agents that can actually finish multi-day tasks; routine use of **in-context learning** with huge toolchains; and **domain-specific copilots** that run heavy planning loops by default. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news28\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n\n3) **Science acceleration as a product category.**  \nThe **2026\u21922028** targets formalize \u201cAI that does research\u201d as a program, not a demo. If OpenAI hits even a conservative version, expect: automated hypothesis generation, simulation-guided experiment design, and cross-domain \u201cdebuggers\u201d for messy research pipelines. That spills into **biomed**, **materials**, **energy systems**, and **software tooling for science**\u2014and will likely pull regulators (IRBs, biosecurity, reproducibility standards) into AI-centric workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n\n4) **A new security market: \u201cAI resilience.\u201d**  \nThink CrowdStrike/Cloudflare-but-for-AI: model behavior firewalls, agent permissioning and containment, synthetic-bio misuse defenses independent of any single model vendor, red-team simulators, provenance & content authenticity at scale. The Foundation funding here could catalyze a **vendor ecosystem + shared standards** (the way early infosec matured). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n5) **Platformization beyond chat.**  \nOpenAI telegraphed an **AI cloud** posture (Atlas browser, eventual devices, enterprise platform). Expect tighter vertical integration (models \u2192 runtime \u2192 distribution), with third parties building \u201con-platform\u201d rather than purely on clouds. This pressures incumbents (Google, Apple) to answer with their own agent platforms, and forces startups to choose between **deep platform dependence** vs **sovereign stacks**. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n\n# Second-order effects (what\u2019s likely to change outside OpenAI)\n- **Energy markets & permitting.** Multi-GW data centers pull forward **nuclear/renewables**, grid upgrades, and siting fights. National strategies will compete to host **AI industrial zones** with bespoke power deals. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news28\ue201  \n- **Antitrust & AI-specific regulation.** A nonprofit controlling a \\$500B-class PBC while the top partner owns ~27\u201333% will invite questions about **control, preferential access, and safety coordination** across labs; expect more formal **pre-deployment standards** and inter-lab safety protocols. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn0news33\ue201  \n- **Benchmark deprecation.** If test-time compute becomes cheap, standard static leaderboards will matter less; **task-complexity budgets** (e.g., allowed \u201cthinking FLOPs\u201d) and **process-based evals** will matter more. (OpenAI\u2019s CoT-monitorability agenda points that way.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Funding mix for science.** A Foundation with tech-adjacent due diligence can fund **risky, compute-heavy public-goods projects** (open health datasets, pathogen-defense infrastructure) that governments and traditional funders underwrite more slowly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n# Hard questions (healthy skepticism)\n- **Is \\$1.4T/30 GW real or performative?** Current public numbers for Stargate are **single-digit GW and \\$100s B** over a few years; jumping to 30 GW implies massive execution risk in chips, power, cooling, land, labor, and financing. Watch for **binding purchase agreements**, **grid interconnect milestones**, and **on-time energization** before treating the full figure as \u201clocked.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1news28\ue201  \n- **Foundation independence vs value-maximization.** The Foundation\u2019s resources scale with OpenAI\u2019s valuation\u2014**a coupling that can bias priorities** toward initiatives that indirectly boost the commercial arm. Expect scrutiny of **grant governance, conflicts**, and **transparency**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- **Safety strategy bet: CoT faithfulness.** CoT monitoring is promising but **empirically fragile**; models can obfuscate thoughts under pressure, and \u201cprivacy\u201d of CoT has product costs (less user-visible reasoning). This is useful tooling, not a silver bullet. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n# Concrete expectations & timelines\n**Next 6\u201312 months (to Oct 2026):**\n- Material **price/perf drop** for reasoning-heavy runs as infra ramps; broader access to **long-horizon agents** in enterprise stacks.  \n- First **Foundation grants/datasets** in health; early **AI resilience** vendors standardize \u201cagent permissions,\u201d **evals for risky domains**, provenance tooling. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- Clearer **Adult Mode / routing controls** and age-gating decisions\u2014an area to watch for platform openness vs paternalism trade-offs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n\n**2026\u20132028:**\n- **Research-intern-class systems** appear (narrow but genuinely useful in lab workflows), with **agentic ELNs**, simulation-loop planners, and automated literature triage.  \n- If OpenAI (and rivals) deliver, expect **medium-impact discoveries** by ~2028 in **biomarkers, protein design, and materials**, plus code/tooling advances that compound further science acceleration. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news29\ue201\n\n**Wildcards:**\n- **IPO** to fund capex surge; **regulatory gating** on bio-capability exposure; **inter-lab safety compacts** if progress accelerates faster than governance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue201\n\n# Bottom line\nOpenAI just **tightened mission governance while opening the financing spigot**\u2014and publicly tied its reputation to a two-track agenda: (1) **scale compute** hard enough to make long-horizon reasoning cheap and (2) **fund public-goods layers** (health + AI resilience) at unprecedented scale. If even a conservative slice lands, **the cost of cognition keeps collapsing**, agents become genuinely useful for multi-day work, and we get an **infosec-like AI-resilience industry**. The risks\u2014over-promising on capex, governance conflicts, and brittle safety bets\u2014are real, but the direction of travel is clear: **faster science, bigger infrastructure, and platforms that look less like \u201ca chatbot\u201d and more like an operating system for work.** \ue200cite\ue202turn1news28\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n\u2014  \nWant me to track the first Foundation grants, new safety standards, and any binding 30 GW build milestones?

This deal allows OpenAI to restructure as a public benefit corporation, providing it with more operational freedom and the ability to raise capital more easily. Previously, a 2019 agreement with Microsoft limited OpenAI\u2019s funding options in exchange for access to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing resources. Under the new terms, Microsoft retains a 27% stake worth about $135 billion after investing $13.8 billion, securing a near 10-fold return. The agreement also includes a massive $250 billion cloud computing contract with Microsoft Azure, though Microsoft forfeits its previous right of first refusal and gains no rights to OpenAI's hardware products.\n\nControl of OpenAI Group PBC will rest with the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation. Despite their restructured relationship, the two companies remain closely tied until at least 2032, with Microsoft holding rights to OpenAI\u2019s products and models even if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is achieved. The agreement also introduces an independent panel to validate any AGI claims. The restructure aims to improve clarity around OpenAI's funding and operations while addressing scrutiny over data use and transparency. ChatGPT\u2019s worldwide popularity, exceeding 700 million weekly users in September, has driven OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth and increased operational demands.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news28\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":8977,"end_idx":9008,"safe_urls":["https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/altman-touts-trillion-dollar-ai-vision-openai-restructures-chase-scale-2025-10-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/altman-touts-trillion-dollar-ai-vision-openai-restructures-chase-scale-2025-10-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Altman touts trillion-dollar AI vision as OpenAI restructures to chase scale","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/altman-touts-trillion-dollar-ai-vision-openai-restructures-chase-scale-2025-10-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1761732092.0,"snippet":"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is pursuing an ambitious trillion-dollar vision to expand AI infrastructure, announcing plans to scale up computing capabilities dramatically following a restructuring of the company\u2019s funding model.
