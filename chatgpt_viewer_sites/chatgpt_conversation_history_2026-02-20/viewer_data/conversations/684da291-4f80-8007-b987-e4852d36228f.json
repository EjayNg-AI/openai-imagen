in reality, multiple sources of strife often coexist and overlap.\n- There is a clear pattern of **recurring themes**: racial justice, economic anxiety, political legitimacy, and cultural conflict.\n- The degree of *public trust in institutions* appears to decline with each decade.\n- Some strife is unique to its era (e.g., Vietnam, 9/11), while others (race, inequality) are perennial, taking new forms over time.\n\nIf you wish to drill deeper into *any specific decade* or expand on *secondary sources of strife*, specify and I\u2019ll provide a more granular breakdown."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"4c47850f-660d-4a6d-91b8-93ecb5c02ecb","request_id":"94fb2fab1991fdac-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4c47850f-660d-4a6d-91b8-93ecb5c02ecb","children":["d279e37c-c8b1-4b53-a7e7-a6e9b995aab3"]},"d279e37c-c8b1-4b53-a7e7-a6e9b995aab3":{"id":"d279e37c-c8b1-4b53-a7e7-a6e9b995aab3","message":{"id":"d279e37c-c8b1-4b53-a7e7-a6e9b995aab3","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1749918410.22,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["great.
