An ellipse is a convex set, so the whole line segment joining \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(-\\mathbf{x}\\) lies inside \\(F\\), and therefore so does its midpoint.\n\n   The midpoint of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(-\\mathbf{x}\\) is\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{y} + (-\\mathbf{x})}{2}\n   = \\frac{\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}}{2}\n   = \\frac{(2a,2b)}{2}\n   = (a,b).\n   \\]\n\n   Hence the point with position vector \\((a,b)\\) lies inside \\(F\\).\n\n---\n\n## 8(b)(i)\n\n**Statement.**  \nUse part (a) to prove that any ellipse centred on the origin with area at least \\(4\\) has a point with integer coordinates, other than the origin, inside the ellipse.\n\nLet \\(E\\) be such an ellipse, centred at the origin, with area at least \\(4\\).\n\n1. **Cutting into \\(2\\times 2\\) squares and translating.**\n\n   Draw the grid of vertical and horizontal lines with equations \\(x=2k\\), \\(y=2\\ell\\) for all integers \\(k,\\ell\\). This divides the plane into \\(2\\times 2\\) squares of the form\n   \\[\n   S_{k,\\ell} = \\{(x,y): 2k \\le x \\le 2k+2,\\; 2\\ell \\le y \\le 2\\ell+2\\}.\n   \\]\n\n   Only finitely many of these squares meet \\(E\\).

This moves \\(S_{k,\\ell}\\) exactly onto the standard square\n   \\[\n   S = \\{(x,y): 0\\le x\\le 2,\\; 0\\le y\\le 2\\}.\n   \\]\n\n   Translation preserves area, so the sum of the areas of the translated pieces is still the area of \\(E\\), at least \\(4\\).\n\n2. **Pigeonhole argument.**\n\n   The translated pieces all lie inside \\(S\\), which has area \\(4\\).    \n   If all these pieces were disjoint (no overlapping), then the total area inside \\(S\\) covered by them would be at most the area of \\(S\\), that is at most \\(4\\).  \n   Since the total area of the pieces is at least \\(4\\), they cannot all be disjoint; at least two translated pieces must overlap.\n\n   So there exist two different squares, say \\(S_{k_1,\\ell_1}\\) and \\(S_{k_2,\\ell_2}\\), and points\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{x}\\in P_{k_1,\\ell_1}, \\quad \\mathbf{y}\\in P_{k_2,\\ell_2},\n   \\]\n   such that after translation into \\(S\\) they coincide:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{x} + (-2k_1,-2\\ell_1) =\n   \\mathbf{y} + (-2k_2,-2\\ell_2).\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging,\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x} = (2(k_1-k_2),\\,2(\\ell_1-\\ell_2)) = (2a,2b),\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = k_1-k_2\\) and \\(b = \\ell_1-\\ell_2\\) are integers.  \n   The squares are different, so \\((a,b)\\ne(0,0)\\); hence \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are distinct points of \\(E\\).\n\n3. **Apply part (a).**\n\n   We now have two distinct points \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) inside \\(E\\) such that\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{x} + (2a,2b)\n   \\]\n   for some integers \\(a,b\\), not both zero.  \n   By part (a), the point \\((a,b)\\) lies inside \\(E\\).\n\n   Since \\((a,b)\\neq(0,0)\\), it is a non-zero point with integer coordinates inside the ellipse, as required.\n\n---\n\n## 8(b)(ii)\n\n**Statement.**  \nLet \\(p\\) and \\(u\\) be positive integers and let \\(C\\) be the circle centred on the origin with radius \\(2\\sqrt{p/\\pi}\\).
