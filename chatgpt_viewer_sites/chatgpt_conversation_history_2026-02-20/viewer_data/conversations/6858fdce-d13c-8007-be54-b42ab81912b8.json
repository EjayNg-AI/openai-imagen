Brazil, etc.), and across continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, South America).\n\n**Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign would not have been \u201cunprecedented\u201d globally, but would have been historic for the US.** The world had already seen numerous female national leaders by 2016\u2014both in developing and developed
