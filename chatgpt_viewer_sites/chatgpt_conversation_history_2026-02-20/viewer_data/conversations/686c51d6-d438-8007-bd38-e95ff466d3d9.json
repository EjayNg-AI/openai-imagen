Here\u2019s a concise but comprehensive **introduction to SageMath**, focused on what it is, its core design philosophy, typical use cases, and how to get started\u2014including a few hands-on examples relevant to mathematics and computational research.\n\n---\n\n## What is SageMath?\n\n**SageMath** (also called \u201cSage\u201d) is an open-source mathematical software system built to provide a **comprehensive, unified environment** for mathematical computation\u2014covering everything from algebra, calculus, number theory, combinatorics, and discrete math to numerical analysis, cryptography, and more. It aims to be a *viable free alternative* to systems like Mathematica, Maple, or Magma.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Unified interface:** Sage integrates dozens of specialized open-source math libraries (like NumPy, SymPy, GAP, PARI/GP, Maxima, FLINT, and others) under a single Python-based interface.\n- **Python syntax:** All code in Sage is written in (or extends) Python, which means you can use standard Python idioms alongside mathematical commands.\n- **Open source:** 100% free, with full access to the source code, suitable for academic, commercial, or personal use.\n\n---\n\n## Why Use SageMath?\n\n- **Research-grade mathematics:** Offers functionality found in commercial systems, but free and transparent.\n- **Reproducible research:** Not a black box\u2014full code is visible, and you can cite exact computations.\n- **Rich notebook and scripting environment:** Interactive web notebooks (Jupyter-based) and command-line modes.\n- **Huge mathematical scope:** Symbolic, algebraic, numeric, discrete, combinatorial, and statistical computations.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. **Installation and Access**\n- **Local install:** Download from [sagemath.org](https://www.sagemath.org/). Binaries exist for Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or SageWin).\n- **Online:** Use [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) or [SageCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) for instant web-based computation.\n- **Jupyter notebook:** SageMath notebooks use the Jupyter interface but run a Sage kernel.\n\n### 2. **Basic Workflow**\n- Launch with `sage` in a terminal, or open a Sage/Jupyter notebook.\n- Write Python-like code with Sage\u2019s enhanced mathematical objects.\n\n---\n\n## Essential Examples\n\n### 1. **Arithmetic and Algebra**\n\n```python\n# Basic arithmetic and symbolic variables\nx, y = var('x y')\nf = x^3 + 2*x^2 - x + 1\ng = expand((x + 1)^3)\nh = factor(x^3 + 3*x^2 + 3*x + 1)\nsolve(f == 0, x)\n```\n\n### 2. **Linear Algebra**\n\n```python\nA = Matrix([[1,2], [3,4]])\nA.eigenvalues()\nA.inverse()\n```\n\n### 3. **Calculus**\n\n```python\nf = sin(x)*exp(x)\ndiff(f, x)          # derivative\nintegrate(f, x)     # indefinite integral\nintegrate(f, (x, 0, pi))  # definite integral\nlimit(f/x, x=0)\n```\n\n### 4. **Number Theory**\n\n```python\nis_prime(97)\nfactor(123456)\nnext_prime(1000)\n```\n\n### 5. **Finite Fields**\n\n```python\nF = GF(7)           # Finite field with 7 elements\na = F(3)\nb = F(5)\na * b\nK.<alpha> = GF(7^2) # Extension field with generator alpha\nalpha^15\n```\n\n### 6. **Plotting**\n\n```python\nplot(sin(x)*exp(-x/5), (x, 0, 10))\n```\n\n### 7. **Interfacing with Other Systems**\n\nYou can call Maxima, GAP, PARI/GP, and more directly:\n```python\nmaxima('integrate(sin(x)^2,x)')\ngap('Factorial(100)')\n```\n\n---\n\n## What Makes SageMath Different?\n\n- **Python is the core language:** Unlike Mathematica or Maple, Sage doesn\u2019t invent a new language\u2014it extends Python.\n- **Integration:** Instead of reinventing every algorithm, Sage wraps best-of-breed libraries and glues them together, so you get the combined power of many systems.\n- **Community-driven:** Hundreds of contributors, frequent updates, strong academic support.\n\n---\n\n## SageMath Resources\n\n- **Official site:** [https://www.sagemath.org/](https://www.sagemath.org/)\n- **Documentation:** [https://doc.sagemath.org/](https://doc.sagemath.org/)\n- **Tutorial:** [SageMath Quickstart](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/index.html)\n- **Reference manual:** [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/)\n- **Q&A / Support:** [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/)\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Critique\n\n- **Performance:** Pure Python layer is slower than low-level C/C++ (but most heavy-lifting is done by fast libraries).\n- **Installation can be heavy:** Full install is multi-GB due to many included libraries.\n- **GUI is basic:** No full-featured GUI like Mathematica\u2019s, though Jupyter notebooks suffice for most research/teaching use cases.\n\n---\n\n## When Should You Use SageMath?\n\n- For **research** or **teaching** that demands transparency, reproducibility, and power across many math domains.\n- When you need to script or automate mathematical workflows, especially with Python interoperability.\n- If you want access to a wide ecosystem (algebra, combinatorics, numerical math, crypto, etc.) in one tool.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nSageMath is the open-source hub for mathematical computation. If you already know Python, it is a natural environment for experimental math, symbolic computation, algebra, and more.

However, integration is possible in several ways, with some caveats and practical workarounds.\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n### 1. **SageMath as Its Own Python Environment**\n\n- **SageMath runs its own, customized Python interpreter** (usually invoked via the `sage` command).\n- In the Sage shell or notebook, you have access to all Sage features *and* can use regular Python libraries.\n- You can launch a Jupyter notebook *with the SageMath kernel* (`sage -n jupyter`) and then use Sage commands alongside standard Python.\n\n### 2. **Using Sage in Jupyter Notebooks**\n\n- **SageMath can be a kernel in Jupyter**, but you must launch Jupyter from within the Sage environment:\n    ```bash\n    sage -n jupyter\n    ```\n  - In the Jupyter notebook launcher, select the **SageMath kernel**.\n  - Now your code can mix Python and Sage constructs seamlessly.\n\n### 3. **Cannot Simply `import sage` in a Standard Python Environment**\n\n- If you open your system\u2019s default Python or a Jupyter notebook with the default kernel,  \n  ```python\n  import sage\n  ```\n  will **not work** (unless you\u2019ve done advanced integration or hacking).\n\n### 4. **Interfacing Regular Python and SageMath**\n\nThere are some advanced workarounds:\n- **Using `sage` as a library**:  \n  - There is an [experimental \u201cPython library mode\u201d for SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/library_python.html), allowing you to import Sage from an external Python, but this is *not* the standard workflow and is fragile.\n- **Calling SageMath from Python subprocesses**:\n  - You can script SageMath computations from regular Python by launching Sage as an external process and exchanging data via files, pipes, or sockets. This is common in research but not as convenient as a direct import.\n\n### 5. **Mixing SageMath and Python Libraries**\n\n- In Sage\u2019s Python environment, you can usually install and import standard Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy).\n- So, if you need both Sage\u2019s math features and standard data science tools, **run your code inside Sage\u2019s environment**.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Use-case                                           | Solution                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Regular Python, want Sage features                 | Not possible via `import sage`; see below           |\n| Jupyter notebook with Sage features                | Launch Sage as Jupyter kernel (`sage -n jupyter`)   |\n| Sage environment, want Python libraries            | Use `pip` inside Sage, import as usual              |\n| Interop between Python and Sage                    | Use subprocess, file I/O, or [experimental library mode](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/library_python.html) |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice**\n\n- **For seamless SageMath functionality, always use Sage\u2019s own environment**\u2014either the command-line shell, or a Jupyter notebook launched by Sage.\n- If you need \u201chybrid\u201d workflows (mixing heavy Sage math and regular Python libraries), do everything inside Sage\u2019s Python, not the other way around.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n\n- [SageMath FAQ: Can I import Sage into my existing Python installation?](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html#import-sage-into-my-existing-python-installation)\n- [SageMath as a Python Library (experimental)](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/library_python.html)\n- [Using Jupyter with SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/notebook.html)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou can\u2019t drop SageMath into any Python script or notebook via `import sage`\u2014**the flow is the reverse**: you run your code *inside SageMath*, which gives you both the Sage environment and regular Python libraries.

There is no official, fully-supported, stable \"Sage API\" for direct in-process calls from arbitrary Python installations. However, **there are several practical strategies for integrating Sage as a computational engine**:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **SageMath as an External Process (Subprocess/CLI Interface)**\nYou can invoke SageMath scripts or commands from a regular Python script using the `subprocess` module, sending code to Sage and capturing the result:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Example Sage code to execute\nsage_code = \"print(factor(x^8-1))\"\n\n# Write to a temporary file, or pass via command line\nwith open(\"temp.sage\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(sage_code)\n\n# Call SageMath\nresult = subprocess.check_output([\"sage\", \"temp.sage\"])\nprint(result.decode())\n```\n\nYou can also use `subprocess.Popen` for more advanced interactivity (pipes, passing input/output).\n\n---\n\n## 2. **SageMath as a Python Library (Experimental/Advanced)**\nSage has a [**library mode**](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/library_python.html) that allows you to `import sage.all` in a regular Python session, provided you use Sage\u2019s Python interpreter and properly set the environment variables (`SAGE_LOCAL`, `SAGE_SRC`, etc).\n\n- This is **fragile and not recommended for production** (may break between Sage versions).\n- Example:\n    ```python\n    import sage.all as sage\n    x = sage.var('x')\n    f = x**5 + 2*x + 1\n    print(sage.factor(f))\n    ```\n  **But:** you must run this using Sage\u2019s Python interpreter (`sage -python yourscript.py`).\n\n---\n\n## 3. **SageCell Server: HTTP API**\nThere is an **experimental HTTP API** called [SageCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/), which lets you send Sage code and receive results via HTTP POST.\n\n- Useful for web applications, but **limited to stateless computations**.\n- Example using `requests` in Python:\n    ```python\n    import requests\n\n    code = \"factor(x^8-1)\"\n    data = {\"code\": code}\n    response = requests.post(\"https://sagecell.sagemath.org/service\", data=data)\n    print(response.json()['stdout'])\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Jupyter Kernel Gateway (Advanced Use)**\nIf you use Sage as a Jupyter kernel, you can interact with it via Jupyter\u2019s messaging protocol or through [nbclient](https://nbclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or other tools. This is **non-trivial** and best suited for batch automation or research infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Direct Cython/Shared Library Embedding (Experimental/Not Recommended)**\nIt is theoretically possible to use parts of Sage\u2019s core (written in Cython) as libraries, but this is highly experimental and rarely worth the effort unless you are developing Sage itself.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Method                            | Use-case / Comments                                        |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Subprocess / CLI calls**         | Most reliable, language-agnostic, works everywhere         |\n| **Library mode (`import sage.all`)** | Only with Sage\u2019s Python, fragile, not standard Python      |\n| **SageCell HTTP API**              | Good for stateless web requests, limited for large jobs    |\n| **Jupyter Kernel Gateway**         | Advanced, for workflow automation                         |\n| **Direct embedding**               | Not practical except for Sage core devs                    |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice Recommendation**\n\n- For **most integration tasks**, treat Sage as a powerful, scriptable external process. Write Sage code to files or strings, invoke SageMath with `subprocess`, and parse the output in your Python code.\n- If you need to embed Sage into a larger Python program, use **Sage\u2019s own Python interpreter** (i.e., always run your main program using `sage -python ...`).\n\n---\n\n### **What about true function calling / \"tool calling\"?**\n\n- There is no standard RPC or \u201cfunction call\u201d API (like Python\u2019s `import` for NumPy), unless you stay *within* the Sage environment.\n- If you want more \u201cAPI-like\u201d behavior (e.g., REST or RPC), you can build a thin SageMath microservice using Flask/FastAPI (with Sage as the backend), but this requires extra setup.\n\n---\n\n## **Further Reading**\n- [SageMath as a Python Library (official docs)](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/library_python.html)\n- [SageCell API Docs](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/)\n- [SageMath FAQ](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html)\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line**\n**You can use SageMath as a computational \u201ctool\u201d in your Python workflow, but not via direct Python function calls from outside Sage.** The subprocess/CLI or HTTP API approach is robust and recommended for most purposes. For deep integration, run your Python scripts inside Sage\u2019s Python interpreter.\n\nLet me know if you want concrete code examples for any of these integration patterns."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"a1032723-6e71-48bf-a239-9a80cb473b7a","request_id":"95bb076519766002-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a1032723-6e71-48bf-a239-9a80cb473b7a","children":["24d7a888-74a6-4ce9-911d-a75182d223ca"]},"24d7a888-74a6-4ce9-911d-a75182d223ca":{"id":"24d7a888-74a6-4ce9-911d-a75182d223ca","message":{"id":"24d7a888-74a6-4ce9-911d-a75182d223ca","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751930098.456,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Is it possible to make Sage available as a tool in ChatGPT or the API?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95bb0a8b99ec6002-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b8b542dc-847d-4145-ad22-8e275a5d1c8c","children":["c62c9253-069b-46c6-b654-3195537df304"]},"c62c9253-069b-46c6-b654-3195537df304":{"id":"c62c9253-069b-46c6-b654-3195537df304","message":{"id":"c62c9253-069b-46c6-b654-3195537df304","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751930110.792249,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"24d7a888-74a6-4ce9-911d-a75182d223ca","request_id":"95bb0a8b99ec6002-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"24d7a888-74a6-4ce9-911d-a75182d223ca","children":["f7126599-b499-441f-890c-cfd7066f2ef7"]},"f7126599-b499-441f-890c-cfd7066f2ef7":{"id":"f7126599-b499-441f-890c-cfd7066f2ef7","message":{"id":"f7126599-b499-441f-890c-cfd7066f2ef7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751930110.792429,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering Sage integration","content":"To answer whether it's possible to make Sage available within ChatGPT, it seems like a matter of integrating it through function calling or using a custom GPT setup.

Wrap that proxy as the tool.  \n**Trade-off:** rate limits (~10 s default execution), no state between calls, public service may throttle.\n\n---\n\n## 5 \u00b7 Operational issues & limitations\n\n| Concern | Mitigation |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Security / code-injection** | Strictly validate or template the Sage code you execute; run Sage in a container with resource limits. |\n| **Latency** | A cold Sage start is seconds; keep the service warm or use a worker pool. |\n| **Statefulness** | Each request should be stateless or you need session IDs and a persistent Sage process per session. |\n| **Concurrency & scaling** | Containerise; autoscale replicas; impose per-request CPU/VM limits. |\n| **Large outputs** | Trim, summarise, or paginate before sending back via the API (models have context limits). |\n| **Cost** | You pay infra for Sage + OpenAI tokens for model plus function-call content. |\n\n---\n\n## 6 \u00b7 When _not_ to bother\n\n- **One-off interactive use**: It may be simpler to copy Sage\u2019s answer manually into ChatGPT.\n- **Symbolic manipulations already in SymPy**: ChatGPT can often invoke SymPy tools (available in some OpenAI toolchains) without Sage.\n- **Heavy numeric linear algebra**: Use NumPy / SciPy kernels that are already exposed in many tool stacks.\n\n---\n\n## 7 \u00b7 Take-away recipe\n\n1. **Host Sage** (Docker + FastAPI).  \n2. **Define REST endpoints** that wrap the subset of Sage you need.  \n3. **Publish an OpenAPI schema** describing those endpoints.  \n4. **Register schema** as a tool/action in ChatGPT or add to `functions` list in the OpenAI API.  \n5. **Write a small runner** that relays tool calls to your Sage service.  \n\nOnce that glue is in place, you can ask ChatGPT:\n\n> \u201cFactor \\(x^{8}-1\\) over \u211a.\u201d\n\n\u2026and the model will autonomously call your `factor_polynomial` action, get Sage\u2019s answer, and cite it back in the chat.\n\n---\n\n### References & starting points\n\n- **SageMath as a Python library** (for embedding): <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/library_python.html>  \n- **SageCell API docs**: <https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/wiki/SageCell-API>  \n- **OpenAI function-calling guide**: <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling>  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nOpenAI provides the plumbing; Sage doesn\u2019t\u2014but you can supply it. Host Sage behind a secure, JSON-speaking microservice, register that service as a function/action, and ChatGPT will happily treat Sage as just another tool."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5848,"end_idx":5848,"type":"hidden"}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"6fb6f1ee-6b88-42ce-9993-ec146de79285","request_id":"95bb0a8b99ec6002-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"6fb6f1ee-6b88-42ce-9993-ec146de79285","children":["099482be-5645-4bf1-b308-bb11aa898736"]},"099482be-5645-4bf1-b308-bb11aa898736":{"id":"099482be-5645-4bf1-b308-bb11aa898736","message":{"id":"099482be-5645-4bf1-b308-bb11aa898736","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751931183.482,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How do I build an MCP server which makes available Sage's various functionalities?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95bb2508f882447c-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"526f20b8-0dda-48fe-81b5-3a190afabd86","children":["8334796e-bd79-4aad-abc0-49974fbd641d"]},"8334796e-bd79-4aad-abc0-49974fbd641d":{"id":"8334796e-bd79-4aad-abc0-49974fbd641d","message":{"id":"8334796e-bd79-4aad-abc0-49974fbd641d","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751931195.952875,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"099482be-5645-4bf1-b308-bb11aa898736","request_id":"95bb2508f882447c-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"099482be-5645-4bf1-b308-bb11aa898736","children":["ba25cb47-f7f2-44c7-9ad7-ebdba0a4574f"]},"ba25cb47-f7f2-44c7-9ad7-ebdba0a4574f":{"id":"ba25cb47-f7f2-44c7-9ad7-ebdba0a4574f","message":{"id":"ba25cb47-f7f2-44c7-9ad7-ebdba0a4574f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751931195.952975,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for MCP server details","content":"The user is asking how to build an MCP server for Sage's functionalities, which I'm interpreting as potentially a multi-callable plugin or model-calling pipeline, or something like a Model Control Proxy.

Prerequisites & high-level architecture\n\n| Layer | What you run | Why |\n|-------|--------------|-----|\n| **Compute layer** | A Docker image (or VM) that contains a full SageMath install **and** a Python runtime | Keeps Sage + server code in the same sandbox, avoids cross-process marshalling cost |\n| **Server layer** | A lightweight MCP server built with the **FastMCP** Python SDK | FastMCP hides the wire protocol and gives you decorators for declaring tools \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201 |\n| **Tool layer** | Thin Python functions that call `sage.all` APIs (symbolic, numeric, finite-field, etc.) | Each function is surfaced to the LLM as a tool with an auto-generated JSON Schema |\n| **Gateway** *(optional)* | Reverse proxy / auth (e.g. Cloud Run \u201crun-as-service account\u201d or Caddy + mTLS) | Adds rate-limiting, auth, logging |\n\n> **MCP endpoints you must implement**\n> ```\n> POST /.well-known/mcp/init        # server metadata (FastMCP does this for you)\n> POST /tools/list                  # returns list of tool definitions\n> POST /tools/call                  # executes a tool\n> ```\n> \u2026FastMCP wires these routes automatically; you only register Python call-backs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Set up the runtime\n\n```dockerfile\n# Sage + FastMCP image  (sage:10.3 is  \u2248 6 GB, but slimmed images exist)\nFROM sagemath/sagemath:10.3\n\n# Install FastMCP and ASGI server\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir fastmcp uvicorn\n\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY server.py .\n\n# Launch with Sage\u2019s own Python so Cython extensions work\nCMD [\"sage\", \"-python\", \"-m\", \"uvicorn\", \"server:mcp_app\", \\\n     \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8000\"]\n```\n\nBuild & run:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t sage-mcp .\ndocker run -p 8000:8000 sage-mcp\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Write `server.py`\n\n```python\n# server.py\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP\nfrom sage.all import var, factor, integrate, solve, GF\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"sage-tools\", version=\"0.1.0\")   # MCP server instance\nmcp_app = mcp.asgi()                           # Uvicorn will serve this\n\n# ---------- tool 1 : factor a polynomial ----------\n@mcp.tool(\n    annotations={\"title\": \"Factor Polynomial\", \"readOnlyHint\": True}\n)\ndef factor_polynomial(polynomial: str, variable: str = \"x\") -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Factor a univariate polynomial over \u211a.\n\n    Args:\n        polynomial: e.g. \"x^8 - 1\"\n        variable:   main symbol name (default 'x')\n    \"\"\"\n    x = var(variable)\n    f = factor(eval(polynomial, {variable: x}))\n    return str(f)\n\n# ---------- tool 2 : symbolic integration ----------\n@mcp.tool(\n    annotations={\"title\": \"Integrate Symbolically\", \"readOnlyHint\": True}\n)\ndef integrate_expr(expr: str, varname: str, lower: float | None = None,\n                   upper: float | None = None) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Integrate an expression. If bounds given, returns definite integral.\n    \"\"\"\n    v = var(varname)\n    f = eval(expr, {varname: v})\n    return (integrate(f, (v, lower, upper)) if lower is not None and upper is not None\n            else integrate(f, v))._repr_()\n\n# ---------- tool 3 : solve equation ----------\n@mcp.tool(\n    annotations={\"title\": \"Solve Equation\", \"readOnlyHint\": True}\n)\ndef solve_eqn(equation: str, varname: str = \"x\") -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solve f(var) == 0  for var.\n    \"\"\"\n    v = var(varname)\n    sol = solve(eval(equation, {varname: v}) == 0, v)\n    return str(sol)\n\n# ---------- tool 4 : primitive irreducible over GF(q) ----------\n@mcp.tool(\n    annotations={\"title\": \"Primitive Polynomial GF(q)\", \"readOnlyHint\": True}\n)\ndef primitive_poly(q: int, degree: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a Conway / primitive polynomial of given degree over GF(q).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not q.is_prime():\n        raise ValueError(\"q must be prime for GF(q)\")\n    K.<a> = GF(q**degree, modulus='primitive')\n    return str(K.modulus())\n```\n\n### Why this works\n\n* **FastMCP** converts each decorated function into a **tool definition** with a JSON Schema describing the parameters.  \n  \u2013 see \u201cTool definition structure\u201d in the spec \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \n* SageMath is available in-process because we launched the ASGI app with `sage -python`, so Cython extensions load correctly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Test locally with the MCP reference client\n\n```bash\npip install fastmcp[cli]\nmcp ping http://localhost:8000            # sanity check\nmcp tools list http://localhost:8000      # see JSON schemas\nmcp tools call http://localhost:8000 factor_polynomial \\\n   --polynomial \"x^8 - 1\" --variable x\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Register the server with ChatGPT / OpenAI API\n\n1. **Custom GPT UI**:  \n   * \u201cActions \u2192 Add remote server\u201d \u2192 enter `https://<your-host>:8000`.\n   * ChatGPT pulls `/tools/list` and shows your Sage tools for approval.\n2. **OpenAI API** `functions` array:  \n   * Instead of static JSON, supply  \n     ```json\n     {\"type\": \"mcp\", \"url\": \"https://<your-host>:8000\"}\n     ```  \n   * Your orchestration code must then handle `tool_call` requests by POSTing them to `/tools/call` and piping the result back to the model.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Operational hardening checklist\n\n| Concern | Mitigation |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Arbitrary code execution** | Validate/sanitize string inputs (`sage_eval` with `locals`), or whitelist safe functions.|\n| **Resource abuse** | Put CPU / memory limits on the Docker container; implement FastMCP\u2019s built-in timeout & rate-limit decorators.|\n| **Long-running calculus** | Return a `progressId` and stream chunks via MCP progress notifications.|\n| **Concurrency** | Uvicorn + `--workers N` or use Gunicorn/UVLoop inside the container.|\n| **Scaling** | Deploy behind an autoscaling layer (Cloud Run, K8s HPA).|\n\n---\n\n## 7. Reference implementations & docs\n\n* **FastMCP** PyPI / GitHub \u2013 installation & decorator syntax \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue201  \n* **Model-Context-Protocol spec (tools section)** \u2013 request / response format, annotations, error handling \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \n* **`jalehman/mcp-sage`** \u2013 real-world MCP server (Node JS) that routes to large-context models; shows multi-tool pattern \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n1. Install Sage + FastMCP in the same Python environment.  \n2. Decorate thin wrapper functions around `sage.all` calls with `@mcp.tool`.  \n3. Run the ASGI app (`uvicorn server:mcp_app`).  \n4. Point ChatGPT/your agent at the server URL\u2014your Sage functionality is now available as first-class tools."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201","start_idx":737,"end_idx":754,"safe_urls":["https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp"],"refs":[],"alt":"([github.com](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"GitHub - jlowin/fastmcp:  The fast, Pythonic way to build MCP servers and clients","url":"https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"github.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201","start_idx":4191,"end_idx":4208,"safe_urls":["https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools"],"refs":[],"alt":"([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Tools - Model Context Protocol","url":"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"modelcontextprotocol.io"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue201","start_idx":5898,"end_idx":5917,"safe_urls":["https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"fastmcp - PyPI","url":"https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"FastMCP is the standard framework for working with the Model Context Protocol.
