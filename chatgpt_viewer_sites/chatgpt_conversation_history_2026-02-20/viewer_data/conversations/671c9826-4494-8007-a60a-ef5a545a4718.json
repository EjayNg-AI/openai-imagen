Here are some guidelines:\n\n1. **Separate User Accounts**:  \n   Create separate Linux user accounts for each third party, isolating their files from one another. This prevents them from seeing or modifying each other's data and limits the impact of any security breach to their own account.\n\n2. **Limited sudo Access (if Necessary)**:  \n   Avoid giving users root access or broad sudo privileges. If they require access to some admin commands (e.g., for managing plugins or updates), consider using `sudo` to allow specific commands only. For example, you can use `visudo` to allow only commands they absolutely need.\n\n3. **Database Privileges**:  \n   Grant each user access only to their own database(s). Each WordPress instance should have a unique database user with privileges limited to their specific database.\n\n4. **FTP/SFTP Access**:  \n   Provide FTP/SFTP access limited to the WordPress directory for each user. This allows them to upload themes, plugins, and content without touching server-level files.\n\n5. **WordPress Admin Roles**:  \n   Within WordPress itself, they should have the Administrator role on their own site. This gives them full control over their WordPress settings, plugins, and themes without server-level access.\n\n6. **Security Measures**:\n   - **chroot Jail**: For additional security, consider chroot jail for each user, limiting their access to a virtualized directory structure.\n   - **Monitoring and Logs**: Implement monitoring and maintain logs to detect and manage any unauthorized access attempts.\n\n7. **Resource Isolation**:\n   If your server allows it, consider using containers or virtual machines to isolate each WordPress instance entirely, granting users freedom without risking cross-contamination between sites.\n\nThis approach grants them sufficient control over their WordPress instance without exposing your server's critical configuration."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"77b003d9-8c3f-4d57-bfd4-b613d8f2add2","request_id":"8d88ae8cad3d833d-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"77b003d9-8c3f-4d57-bfd4-b613d8f2add2","children":["aaa21f73-77ef-40e4-9bad-01e45e20d4e9"]},"aaa21f73-77ef-40e4-9bad-01e45e20d4e9":{"id":"aaa21f73-77ef-40e4-9bad-01e45e20d4e9","message":{"id":"aaa21f73-77ef-40e4-9bad-01e45e20d4e9","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1729927636.085501,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what functionality does plesk provide?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8d88b90aac6e4487-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0bc57d79-c57e-49bc-becc-4de87e150d8f","children":["e7aa4f3c-bf74-4a14-bbb4-c661859a89b5"]},"e7aa4f3c-bf74-4a14-bbb4-c661859a89b5":{"id":"e7aa4f3c-bf74-4a14-bbb4-c661859a89b5","message":{"id":"e7aa4f3c-bf74-4a14-bbb4-c661859a89b5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1729927647.346683,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Plesk is a popular web hosting control panel that simplifies server management tasks, making it easier to handle hosting multiple websites, manage domains, and control server resources.

Here\u2019s a list of recommended hardening measures to improve your server\u2019s security:\n\n### 1. **SSH Security**\n   - **Disable Root Login**: Prevent direct root login by requiring users to log in as a non-root user and then switch to root if needed.\n   - **Change Default SSH Port**: Move SSH from the default port 22 to a less common port to reduce the number of brute-force attacks.\n   - **Use SSH Key Authentication**: Disable password authentication and use SSH key pairs for login, ensuring only those with the private key can access the server.\n   - **Limit SSH Access**: Restrict SSH access to specific IP addresses using the firewall or SSH configurations.\n\n### 2. **Firewall Configuration**\n   - **Use a Firewall (UFW or iptables)**: Configure a firewall to only allow necessary traffic, blocking all other ports by default. Open only essential ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS for web traffic, SSH for admin access).\n   - **Fail2Ban**: Install and configure Fail2Ban to detect and block IPs that show signs of malicious behavior, such as repeated failed login attempts.\n   - **DDoS Protection**: Use a DDoS protection solution if you anticipate high traffic or potential attacks. Many hosting providers offer basic DDoS protection by default.\n\n### 3. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n   - Install a WAF, such as ModSecurity, to monitor and filter HTTP requests. It helps block SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web-based attacks.\n   - Configure WAF rules specifically for applications like WordPress if you host them, as they can have unique vulnerabilities.\n\n### 4. **Secure Access Control**\n   - **Create Unique User Accounts**: Each user or third party should have their own user account, with permissions limited to what they need.\n   - **Use Role-Based Access**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to define permissions precisely for each user.\n   - **Sudo Privileges**: Only grant `sudo` privileges to trusted users and restrict it to specific commands if possible.\n\n### 5. **Regular Updates and Patch Management**\n   - Keep the operating system, software, and libraries updated regularly to apply security patches.\n   - Use automated patch management tools or schedule regular patching windows.\n\n### 6. **Intrusion Detection and Monitoring**\n   - Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), like OSSEC or Tripwire, to monitor system files and detect unauthorized changes.\n   - Enable logging for access and security events, storing logs in a centralized location for analysis. Consider tools like Splunk or ELK for log management and analysis.\n\n### 7. **Secure Database Configuration**\n   - Disable remote access to your databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) if it\u2019s not needed. If remote access is required, restrict it to specific IPs.\n   - Use strong database user passwords, and only grant necessary privileges to each database user.\n   - Regularly back up databases and store backups securely.\n\n### 8. **Application Hardening (WordPress, etc.)**\n   - Secure CMS installations (like WordPress) by removing unused plugins, themes, and users.\n   - Ensure all CMS installations are updated, and use security plugins like Wordfence for WordPress.\n   - Disable or limit PHP execution in directories that don\u2019t need it, such as the uploads directory in WordPress.\n\n### 9. **Network and Port Scanning**\n   - Regularly scan the server for open ports and detect any unexpected or unnecessary services running.\n   - Use tools like `nmap` or server security services to periodically audit open ports.\n\n### 10. **Secure DNS and HTTPS**\n   - Use DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) and secure your domain\u2019s DNS records to prevent spoofing and cache poisoning.\n   - Enforce HTTPS for all websites hosted on the server. Use certificates from trusted authorities (e.g., Let\u2019s Encrypt for free SSL certificates).\n\n### 11. **Email Security and Anti-Spam**\n   - Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to secure outgoing mail against spoofing.\n   - Use anti-spam solutions on email servers to filter inbound emails and reduce phishing risks.\n\n### 12. **Backups and Disaster Recovery**\n   - Regularly back up data and store it in a secure, offsite location.\n   - Ensure you have a tested disaster recovery plan that includes the steps for restoring server configurations and data in case of an attack.\n\n### 13. **Disable Unused Services**\n   - Review and disable any services or daemons that aren\u2019t needed, reducing the server\u2019s attack surface.\n   - Disable unused modules in the web server (Apache, Nginx) or other software that could expose vulnerabilities.\n\n### 14. **Kernel and OS-Level Security**\n   - Consider enabling kernel-level security modules like SELinux (CentOS) or AppArmor (Ubuntu) to provide mandatory access controls.\n   - Use secure configurations for shared memory (disable `SHMEXEC`) and limit core dumps to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive data in memory.\n\n### 15. **Consider Virtualization or Containerization**\n   - If hosting multiple users or applications, consider isolating each in a virtual machine or container to limit the impact of any compromise.\n\nImplementing these measures can significantly improve the security of a dedicated server, providing a layered defense approach against unauthorized access and potential attacks."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa25813-bdaf-4148-b288-ca1aaca10229","request_id":"8d89c3ccb8c9471b-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa25813-bdaf-4148-b288-ca1aaca10229","children":[]}}}
