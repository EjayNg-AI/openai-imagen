However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement.

Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

Quantum Brilliance developed this system using nitrogen-vacancy centers in synthetic diamonds, which allow qubits to function at room temperature.

A number of techniques, such as magnetic or electric fields, microwave radiation, or light (Quantum Brilliance uses a green laser technology for this purpose) can be used to directly manipulate the nitrogen-vacancy center's qubits. Quantum Brilliance's qubits are described by the company as being in the \"middle of the pack\" for coherence times and performance, being slower than superconducting qubits, but faster than the trapped-ion approach of some other providers.\n\nAndrew Horsley, CEO of Quantum Brilliance, painted the field trial as a significant step for the company on its journey to achieve a quantum technology that's smaller, compatible, more flexible, and ultimately able to operate in any environment.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to take quantum from mainframe to mainstream \u2014 running your mobile phone, your car, your work platforms, or anywhere close to the application where it is needed,\" said Horsley. \"This collaboration is our first step toward achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre aims to supercharge the pairing of quantum and classical systems by establishing initial, hybrid environments that could diagnose bottlenecks and possible improvements towards the quantum-classical integration.\n\nWhile nowadays most quantum computing work is done in a simulated environment in platforms such as \u301055\u2020IBM's Quiskit\u3011 and \u301056\u2020Nvidia's cuQuantum initiative\u3011, the deployment of a room-temperature quantum computer within a supercomputing centre will allow researchers to truly leverage on-site computing, maintenance and integration.

However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement. As a result, it is usually only possible to achieve quantum coherence at liquid nitrogen level temperatures.\n\n#### Innovative Approach to Quantum Coherence \n\nTo suppress the molecular motion and achieve room-temperature quantum coherence, the researchers introduced a chromophore based on pentacene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five linearly fused benzene rings) in a UiO-type MOF. \u201cThe MOF in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate chromophores. Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

A number of techniques, such as magnetic or electric fields, microwave radiation, or light (Quantum Brilliance uses a green laser technology for this purpose) can be used to directly manipulate the nitrogen-vacancy center's qubits. Quantum Brilliance's qubits are described by the company as being in the \"middle of the pack\" for coherence times and performance, being slower than superconducting qubits, but faster than the trapped-ion approach of some other providers.\n\nAndrew Horsley, CEO of Quantum Brilliance, painted the field trial as a significant step for the company on its journey to achieve a quantum technology that's smaller, compatible, more flexible, and ultimately able to operate in any environment.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to take quantum from mainframe to mainstream \u2014 running your mobile phone, your car, your work platforms, or anywhere close to the application where it is needed,\" said Horsley. \"This collaboration is our first step toward achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre aims to supercharge the pairing of quantum and classical systems by establishing initial, hybrid environments that could diagnose bottlenecks and possible improvements towards the quantum-classical integration.\n\nWhile nowadays most quantum computing work is done in a simulated environment in platforms such as \u301055\u2020IBM's Quiskit\u3011 and \u301056\u2020Nvidia's cuQuantum initiative\u3011, the deployment of a room-temperature quantum computer within a supercomputing centre will allow researchers to truly leverage on-site computing, maintenance and integration.

However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement. As a result, it is usually only possible to achieve quantum coherence at liquid nitrogen level temperatures.\n\n#### Innovative Approach to Quantum Coherence \n\nTo suppress the molecular motion and achieve room-temperature quantum coherence, the researchers introduced a chromophore based on pentacene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five linearly fused benzene rings) in a UiO-type MOF. \u201cThe MOF in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate chromophores. Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

A number of techniques, such as magnetic or electric fields, microwave radiation, or light (Quantum Brilliance uses a green laser technology for this purpose) can be used to directly manipulate the nitrogen-vacancy center's qubits.

However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement. As a result, it is usually only possible to achieve quantum coherence at liquid nitrogen level temperatures.\n\n#### Innovative Approach to Quantum Coherence \n\nTo suppress the molecular motion and achieve room-temperature quantum coherence, the researchers introduced a chromophore based on pentacene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five linearly fused benzene rings) in a UiO-type MOF. \u201cThe MOF in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate chromophores. Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement. As a result, it is usually only possible to achieve quantum coherence at liquid nitrogen level temperatures.\n\n#### Innovative Approach to Quantum Coherence \n\nTo suppress the molecular motion and achieve room-temperature quantum coherence, the researchers introduced a chromophore based on pentacene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five linearly fused benzene rings) in a UiO-type MOF. \u201cThe MOF in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate chromophores. Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

A number of techniques, such as magnetic or electric fields, microwave radiation, or light (Quantum Brilliance uses a green laser technology for this purpose) can be used to directly manipulate the nitrogen-vacancy center's qubits. Quantum Brilliance's qubits are described by the company as being in the \"middle of the pack\" for coherence times and performance, being slower than superconducting qubits, but faster than the trapped-ion approach of some other providers.\n\nAndrew Horsley, CEO of Quantum Brilliance, painted the field trial as a significant step for the company on its journey to achieve a quantum technology that's smaller, compatible, more flexible, and ultimately able to operate in any environment.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to take quantum from mainframe to mainstream \u2014 running your mobile phone, your car, your work platforms, or anywhere close to the application where it is needed,\" said Horsley. \"This collaboration is our first step toward achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre aims to supercharge the pairing of quantum and classical systems by establishing initial, hybrid environments that could diagnose bottlenecks and possible improvements towards the quantum-classical integration.\n\nWhile nowadays most quantum computing work is done in a simulated environment in platforms such as \u301055\u2020IBM's Quiskit\u3011 and \u301056\u2020Nvidia's cuQuantum initiative\u3011, the deployment of a room-temperature quantum computer within a supercomputing centre will allow researchers to truly leverage on-site computing, maintenance and integration.

A number of techniques, such as magnetic or electric fields, microwave radiation, or light (Quantum Brilliance uses a green laser technology for this purpose) can be used to directly manipulate the nitrogen-vacancy center's qubits. Quantum Brilliance's qubits are described by the company as being in the \"middle of the pack\" for coherence times and performance, being slower than superconducting qubits, but faster than the trapped-ion approach of some other providers.\n\nAndrew Horsley, CEO of Quantum Brilliance, painted the field trial as a significant step for the company on its journey to achieve a quantum technology that's smaller, compatible, more flexible, and ultimately able to operate in any environment.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to take quantum from mainframe to mainstream \u2014 running your mobile phone, your car, your work platforms, or anywhere close to the application where it is needed,\" said Horsley. \"This collaboration is our first step toward achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre aims to supercharge the pairing of quantum and classical systems by establishing initial, hybrid environments that could diagnose bottlenecks and possible improvements towards the quantum-classical integration.\n\nWhile nowadays most quantum computing work is done in a simulated environment in platforms such as \u301055\u2020IBM's Quiskit\u3011 and \u301056\u2020Nvidia's cuQuantum initiative\u3011, the deployment of a room-temperature quantum computer within a supercomputing centre will allow researchers to truly leverage on-site computing, maintenance and integration.

However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement. As a result, it is usually only possible to achieve quantum coherence at liquid nitrogen level temperatures.\n\n#### Innovative Approach to Quantum Coherence \n\nTo suppress the molecular motion and achieve room-temperature quantum coherence, the researchers introduced a chromophore based on pentacene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five linearly fused benzene rings) in a UiO-type MOF. \u201cThe MOF in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate chromophores. Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

However, at room temperature causes the quantum information stored in qubits to lose quantum superposition and entanglement. As a result, it is usually only possible to achieve quantum coherence at liquid nitrogen level temperatures.\n\n#### Innovative Approach to Quantum Coherence \n\nTo suppress the molecular motion and achieve room-temperature quantum coherence, the researchers introduced a chromophore based on pentacene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of five linearly fused benzene rings) in a UiO-type MOF. \u201cThe MOF in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate chromophores. Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable the chromophore to rotate, but at a very restrained angle,\u201d says Yanai.\n\nThe MOF structure facilitated enough motion in the pentacene units to allow the electrons to transition from the triplet state to a quintet state, while also sufficiently suppressing motion at room temperature to maintain quantum coherence of the quintet multiexciton state. Upon photoexciting electrons with microwave pulses, the researchers could observe the quantum coherence of the state for over 100 nanoseconds at room temperature. \u201cThis is the first room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled quintets,\u201d remarks an excited Kobori.\n\n#### Future Implications for Quantum Computing \n\nWhile the coherence was observed only for nanoseconds, the findings will pave the way for designing materials for the generation of multiple qubits at room temperatures. \u201cIt will be possible to generate quintet multiexciton state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable MOF structures,\u201d speculates Yanai. \u201cThis can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control and quantum sensing of various target compounds.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cRoom-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework\u201d by Akio Yamauchi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masaaki Fuki, Saiya Fujiwara, Nobuo Kimizuka, Tomohiro Ryu, Masaki Saigo, Ken Onda, Ryota Kusumoto, Nami Ueno, Harumi Sato, Yasuhiro Kobori, Kiyoshi Miyata and Nobuhiro Yanai, 3 January 2024, Science Advances.  \n\u301030\u2020DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\u2020doi.org\u3011\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT \u301031\u2020 EMAIL \u3011 SHARE \n\n  * \u301032\u2020Previous post\u3011\n  * \u301033\u2020Next post\u3011\n\n####  More on SciTechDaily\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Physics\u3011\n\n###  \u301034\u2020 Quantum Breakthrough: How To Transform Vacancies Into Quantum Information \u3011\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Health\u3011\n\n###  \u301035\u2020 Chronic Inflammation?

A number of techniques, such as magnetic or electric fields, microwave radiation, or light (Quantum Brilliance uses a green laser technology for this purpose) can be used to directly manipulate the nitrogen-vacancy center's qubits. Quantum Brilliance's qubits are described by the company as being in the \"middle of the pack\" for coherence times and performance, being slower than superconducting qubits, but faster than the trapped-ion approach of some other providers.\n\nAndrew Horsley, CEO of Quantum Brilliance, painted the field trial as a significant step for the company on its journey to achieve a quantum technology that's smaller, compatible, more flexible, and ultimately able to operate in any environment.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to take quantum from mainframe to mainstream \u2014 running your mobile phone, your car, your work platforms, or anywhere close to the application where it is needed,\" said Horsley. \"This collaboration is our first step toward achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre aims to supercharge the pairing of quantum and classical systems by establishing initial, hybrid environments that could diagnose bottlenecks and possible improvements towards the quantum-classical integration.\n\nWhile nowadays most quantum computing work is done in a simulated environment in platforms such as \u301055\u2020IBM's Quiskit\u3011 and \u301056\u2020Nvidia's cuQuantum initiative\u3011, the deployment of a room-temperature quantum computer within a supercomputing centre will allow researchers to truly leverage on-site computing, maintenance and integration.
