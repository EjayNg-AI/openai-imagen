An LHV theory assumes there exist underlying variables \\( \\lambda \\) (the \u201creal physical state\u201d) such that, once \\( \\lambda \\) is fixed, the outcome statistics at each site depend only on the **local** measurement choice and not on what happens spacelike far away. Formally, Bell\u2019s **local causality** (often called \u201cfactorizability\u201d) is\n\\[\nP(A,B|a,b,\\lambda)=P(A|a,\\lambda)\\,P(B|b,\\lambda),\n\\]\nwhere \\(a,b\\) are the measurement settings and \\(A,B\\in\\{\\pm1\\}\\) the outcomes. Two further assumptions are standard: **measurement independence** (\u201cfree choice\u201d), \\( \\rho(\\lambda|a,b)=\\rho(\\lambda) \\), and **unique outcomes** (there is a single, definite outcome at each wing). Under these assumptions one derives a family of **Bell inequalities**. Quantum mechanics predicts and experiments observe violations of these inequalities for suitably chosen entangled states and settings.\n\n# The CHSH inequality: the clean derivation\n\nTake two parties, each with two binary measurements: \\(A_0,A_1\\) for Alice and \\(B_0,B_1\\) for Bob, outcomes \\( \\pm1\\). In any LHV model you may assume (WLOG\u2014randomness can be absorbed into \\(\\lambda\\)) that the outcomes are predetermined functions \\(A_x(\\lambda),B_y(\\lambda)\\in\\{\\pm1\\}\\). Define the CHSH expression\n\\[\nS = \\langle A_0B_0\\rangle + \\langle A_0B_1\\rangle + \\langle A_1B_0\\rangle - \\langle A_1B_1\\rangle .\n\\]\nFor each \\(\\lambda\\),\n\\[\nS(\\lambda) = A_0(B_0+B_1) + A_1(B_0-B_1),\n\\]\nand since \\(B_0,B_1\\in\\{\\pm1\\}\\), each parenthesis is \\(0\\) or \\(\\pm 2\\), hence \\(|S(\\lambda)|\\le 2\\). Averaging over \\(\\lambda\\) with weight \\(\\rho(\\lambda)\\) gives the **CHSH inequality**:\n\\[\n|S|\\le 2.\n\\]\nQuantum mechanics violates this bound. For a singlet state \\(|\\psi^-\\rangle\\) and coplanar spin directions with relative angles \\(0^\\circ,90^\\circ\\) for Alice and \\(45^\\circ,-45^\\circ\\) for Bob, \\( \\langle A_xB_y\\rangle=-\\cos\\theta_{xy}\\) and one obtains \\(|S|=2\\sqrt 2\\), the **Tsirelson bound**. Note that no-signalling still holds: Alice cannot use the choice \\(b\\) to change her marginal \\(P(A|a)\\).\n\n# What is being tested? \u201cLocal realism,\u201d unpacked\n\n\u201cLocal realism\u201d is used in different ways, so it\u2019s crucial to separate ingredients:\n\n1) **Realism (hidden variables):** there exists an ontic state \\( \\lambda \\) such that outcome probabilities are functions \\(P(A|a,\\lambda)\\), \\(P(B|b,\\lambda)\\). Deterministic or stochastic doesn\u2019t matter; stochastic models can be made deterministic by enlarging \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n2) **Locality (Bell local causality):** the factorization \\(P(A,B|a,b,\\lambda)=P(A|a,\\lambda)P(B|b,\\lambda)\\).\n\n3) **Measurement independence (free choice):** \\( \\lambda \\) is statistically independent of \\(a,b\\).\n\n4) **No postselection/fair sampling and no unintended signalling or memory between runs** (the usual experimental hygiene).\n\nUnder 1\u20133 (and the hygiene conditions), **all** CHSH expressions satisfy \\(|S|\\le 2\\). So, in this precise sense, a Bell test is a test of \u201clocal realism.\u201d\n\nTwo useful refinements:\n\n- **Jarrett\u2013Shimony decomposition.** Factorizability = **parameter independence** \\(P(A|a,b,\\lambda)=P(A|a,\\lambda)\\) and **outcome independence** \\(P(A|a,b,B,\\lambda)=P(A|a,b,\\lambda)\\). Quantum theory respects parameter independence (hence no superluminal signalling) but violates outcome independence (conditioning on the remote outcome changes local probabilities).\n\n- **Fine\u2019s theorem.** In the binary-setting, binary-outcome case, CHSH is satisfied **iff** there exists a single joint Kolmogorov distribution over all four random variables \\(A_0,A_1,B_0,B_1\\). Violations mean no such joint distribution exists\u2014classical joint reality for all counterfactual outcomes is untenable.\n\n# Do violations rule out local realism?\n\n**Yes\u2014if by \u201clocal realism\u201d you mean 1\u20133 above.** Bell violations prove that no theory obeying local causality and measurement independence, with single outcomes, can reproduce the observed correlations. Something in that package must give. Different interpretations choose differently:\n\n- **Give up locality:** **Bohmian mechanics** and **objective-collapse models** reproduce quantum statistics by introducing nonlocal influences. They retain a strong realism but violate Bell locality.\n\n- **Give up measurement independence:** **Superdeterminism** posits correlations between \\(\\lambda\\) and settings \\(a,b\\) (no true \u201cfree choices\u201d). This restores a local explanation but at the cost of highly nontrivial\u2014and often criticized\u2014conspiratorial correlations. It also blunts the scientific method unless supplemented by clear, testable structure.\n\n- **Allow retrocausality:** Outcomes or hidden variables can depend on future settings (time-symmetric or two-state vector approaches). One keeps spacelike locality in space but allows influences backward in time.\n\n- **Give up outcome definiteness / classical realism:** **Everett (many-worlds)** keeps unitary, local quantum field theory and no signalling but denies single outcomes in the usual sense; \u201cfactorizability\u201d is simply not the right constraint. **QBism/relational views** interpret \\(P(A|a)\\) as personal/relative degrees of belief rather than objective propensities; \u201crealism\u201d about values is renounced.\n\nIf, however, you define \u201clocal realism\u201d more weakly\u2014e.g., \u201cno signalling + some kind of mind-independent reality exists\u201d\u2014then Bell violations do **not** force you to abandon that. They only rule out the **specific** causal structure encoded by factorizability + measurement independence.\n\n# Common pitfalls and clarifications\n\nFirst, Bell nonlocality is **not** faster-than-light signalling. Quantum theory violates factorizability but respects parameter independence; relativistic QFT still enforces microcausality (spacelike-separated observables commute) and operational no-signalling.\n\nSecond, Bell\u2019s theorem is **not** primarily about determinism. The inequality holds for **all** LHV models, deterministic or stochastic; determinism is not singled out for special blame.\n\nThird, Bell nonlocality is distinct from **contextuality** \u00e0 la Kochen\u2013Specker. Contextuality already obstructs noncontextual hidden variables for single systems; Bell adds a spacelike separation and a locality requirement. In the \\(2\\times 2\\times 2\\) scenario, CHSH violations can be viewed as a particular species of contextuality, but the causal conclusion is stronger: no local common-cause model exists.\n\n# Geometry and bounds: classical, quantum, and beyond\n\nIn the \\(2\\text{ settings} \\times 2\\text{ outcomes}\\) case, the set of correlations achievable by LHVs is a **polytope** whose facets are the CH/CHSH inequalities. The quantum set is larger, convex but not a polytope, with the Tsirelson bound \\(|S|\\le 2\\sqrt2\\). Beyond quantum lies the full **no-signalling polytope** where \u201cPR boxes\u201d attain \\(|S|=4\\) while still forbidding signalling. This geometric view cleanly separates classical, quantum, and post-quantum correlations and underpins **device-independent** tasks (randomness certification, QKD): any observed \\(|S|>2\\) implies intrinsic randomness and constraints on adversaries, independent of the inner workings of the devices.\n\n# Experimental status and loopholes (conceptual take)\n\nReal experiments must address: (i) **locality loophole** (ensure spacelike separation of setting choices and outcomes), (ii) **detection loophole** (avoid biased samples), and (iii) **freedom-of-choice loophole** (rule out correlations between \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(a,b\\)). Modern \u201cloophole-free\u201d Bell tests close (i) and (ii) simultaneously; ingenious \u201ccosmic\u201d variants push (iii) far back in the past. Logically, measurement independence can never be **proved** from data alone; it is an auxiliary causal assumption you either accept or you modify with a concrete alternative (superdeterministic or retrocausal model).\n\n# Bottom line answers to your two questions\n\n**Is Bell\u2019s inequality a test of local realism?** Yes, provided \u201clocal realism\u201d is taken in Bell\u2019s precise sense: existence of underlying variables \\(\\lambda\\) (realism) + local causality (factorizability) + measurement independence, along with standard experimental hygiene. Under these assumptions, Bell inequalities must hold.\n\n**Do violations rule out local realism?** They rule out that **conjunction**.

Full measurement-independence is \\(p(\\lambda|x,y)=p(\\lambda)\\).\n\nA widely used quantitative relaxation is Hall\u2019s total-variation parameter\n\\[\nM \\;=\\; \\sup_{x,x',y,y'} \\int d\\lambda\\, \\big|p(\\lambda|x,y)-p(\\lambda|x',y')\\big| \\in [0,2],\n\\]\nand the \u201cfree-will fraction\u201d \\(F:=1-\\tfrac{M}{2}\\in[0,1]\\). \\(M=0\\) (i.e., \\(F=1\\)) is the usual assumption; small \\(M>0\\) is a mild perturbation. One can also allow asymmetric relaxations for the two observers via \\(M_1,M_2\\) (and, more finely, \\(\\hat M_1,\\hat M_2\\); see \u00a73 below). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\nAn information-theoretic alternative is the mutual information \\(I(X,Y:\\Lambda)\\) between the settings and \\(\\lambda\\), measured in bits per run. This lets one ask \u201chow many bits of correlation do I need to fake a given CHSH value?\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201\n\n# 2) The CHSH bound as a function of the relaxation\nWith these parameters, tight \u201crelaxed\u201d Bell\u2013CHSH inequalities are known:\n\n- **Symmetric relaxation** (\\(M_1=M_2=M\\)):\n  \\[\n  S \\;\\le\\; 2+\\min\\{3M,\\,2\\}.\n  \\]\n  This is tight and reduces to the standard \\(S\\le2\\) when \\(M=0\\). It implies you can already reach the Tsirelson value \\(S=2\\sqrt2\\) with \\(M=\\tfrac{2(\\sqrt2-1)}{3}\\approx0.276\\), i.e., retaining \\(F=1-\\tfrac{M}{2}\\approx86\\%\\) measurement-independence. Maximal algebraic violation \\(S=4\\) needs only \\(M\\ge 2/3\\) (i.e., losing one-third of independence). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n- **One-sided relaxation** (say Alice relaxed, Bob independent):\n  \\[\n  S \\;\\le\\; 2+M_1,\n  \\]\n  again tight. To hit \\(2\\sqrt2\\) you need \\(M_1=2(\\sqrt2-1)\\approx0.828\\), i.e., Alice keeps \\(F_1\\approx58.6\\%\\) independence while Bob keeps \\(100\\%\\). \ue200cite\ue202turn9view2\ue201\n\n- **General two-parameter bound** (independent relaxations on each side):\n  \\[\n  S \\;\\le\\; 2+\\min\\!\\big\\{\\,M_1+M_2+\\min\\{M_1,M_2\\},\\;2\\,\\big\\},\n  \\]\n  which subsumes both cases above and is tight (explicit locally-causal models saturate it). \ue200cite\ue202turn9view2\ue201\n\n- **Four-parameter refinement** (adds \\(\\hat M_1,\\hat M_2\\) to capture which specific pairs of settings are most correlated):\n  \\[\n  S \\;\\le\\; 2+\\min\\!\\big\\{\\,\\hat M_1+\\hat M_2+\\min\\{M_1,M_2\\},\\;2\\,\\big\\},\n  \\]\n  also tight with explicit constructions. These models minimize the *bit cost* of measurement dependence for a target CHSH value. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view2\ue201\n\n# 3) How much correlation is actually needed?\nVery little. Hall\u2019s symmetric construction reproducing singlet correlations uses only\n\\[\nM_{\\text{singlet}}=\\tfrac{2(\\sqrt2-1)}{3}\\approx 0.276 \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad F\\approx86\\%.\n\\]\nIn information terms, \u201cless than \\(1/15\\) of a bit\u201d of prior correlation per run suffices for a local model of the singlet\u2014already a strikingly small amount. Later constructions lowered the bit cost further (for reproducing the Tsirelson value, down to \\(\\approx 0.046\\) bits) while keeping the relaxed CHSH bounds tight. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn10view0\ue202turn9view0\ue201\n\n# 4) Beyond CHSH: measurement-dependent locality (MDL) polytopes\nCHSH is not optimal once independence is relaxed. P\u00fctz *et al.* introduced the **MDL polytope**: the set of all correlations achievable by locally-causal, measurement-dependent models (with quantified lower bounds on input randomness). Because it\u2019s a polytope, it has a finite set of facet inequalities\u2014**MDL inequalities**\u2014better tailored to the measurement-dependent scenario. Crucially, they show that **an arbitrarily small but nonzero amount of independence is still enough to certify nonlocality** with suitable inequalities (even in the 2-party, 2-setting, 2-outcome case). \ue200cite\ue202turn12search5\ue202turn12search10\ue201\n\nThere\u2019s also a network/causal-model line of work (Bayesian-network formulations) that treats \u201chow much\u201d you must relax locality or independence to model given data via linear programs, extending to multipartite and bilocal scenarios. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\n# 5) Device-independent implications\nAllowing limited measurement dependence weakens standard DI guarantees; there are tight tradeoffs linking (i) the amount of dependence, (ii) the observed Bell violation, and (iii) the extractable randomness. For example, Koh *et al.* bound an adversary\u2019s power in randomness expansion when measurement independence is reduced. More recent work gives trade-off inequalities between measurement dependence and \u201chiddenness/hidden information\u201d of the model. \ue200cite\ue202turn13search2\ue202turn6search4\ue202turn6search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n- Yes: if you perturb statistical independence by a controlled amount, there are **tight, explicit deformations of the Bell\u2013CHSH bound**\u2014see the formulas above. Small relaxations already suffice for locally-causal models to mimic quantum violations. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn9view2\ue201  \n- Also yes: there\u2019s a **systematic MDL framework** that replaces CHSH by inequalities adapted to partial independence; with these, **nonlocality can still be witnessed under arbitrarily small (but nonzero) independence.** \ue200cite\ue202turn12search5\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can write the bound you\u2019d get for a specific relaxation profile (say, one-sided with a cap \\(M_1=\\epsilon\\) or a min-entropy lower bound on \\(p(x,y|\\lambda)\\)) and compare which inequality\u2014CHSH-style vs MDL\u2014gives the best certification."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201","start_idx":995,"end_idx":1012,"safe_urls":["https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/bf3f3005-5f28-521c-9ecc-30379c16b283/content"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Griffith

However, a recent collaboration of over a hundred quantum physicists across five continents challenged this notion by suggesting that if human will is truly free, then certain physical events must be fundamentally random and unpredictable. This conclusion was based on the Big Bell Test, an experiment that used random inputs from online volunteers playing a video game to determine measurements on entangled particles, adhering to the principles established by physicist John S. Bell. Quantum theory posits that particles do not have definite properties until measured, a concept Einstein disputed with his theory of relativity. The Big Bell Test found statistically significant violations of Bell's inequality, supporting quantum predictions and suggesting intrinsic randomness, thus challenging the deterministic view of the universe.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1525900915.002,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/quantum-theory-by-starlight","title":"Quantum Theory by Starlight","snippet":"In a test of quantum theory, a group of physicists set up an experiment in Vienna to measure entangled photons and address the \"freedom-of-choice\" loophole that had eluded previous analyses. The experiment utilized starlight from two stars, one 600 light-years away and the other nearly 2,000 light-years away, to ensure that the type of measurement performed on one photon was not influenced by any prior measurement decisions. By using telescopes to measure photons from events that occurred centuries ago, the team effectively ensured randomization in the selection process. Results showed correlations consistent with quantum theory predictions and far exceeding Bell's inequality threshold, reinforcing the theory and improving by sixteen orders of magnitude over former freedom-of-choice experiments. The findings, published in Physical Review Letters, enhance our understanding of quantum entanglement and have potential implications for developing secure technologies like quantum encryption.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1486502822.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_689ab2ae75748007b66fb48569cb0c36","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching the web for Alperin experiments and measurement dependence","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"96dcde5cc8a4fd81-DFW","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"d589ddce-0172-4f20-8f1d-b9d6318baab4","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d589ddce-0172-4f20-8f1d-b9d6318baab4","children":["dfd303f8-98c0-454e-a876-72a838092b83"]},"dfd303f8-98c0-454e-a876-72a838092b83":{"id":"dfd303f8-98c0-454e-a876-72a838092b83","message":{"id":"dfd303f8-98c0-454e-a876-72a838092b83","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754969204.051759,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating measured independence in experiments","content":"The user's question is about whether experiments could have unintentionally relaxed statistical independence enough to shift the upper bound to 2\u221a2.

Additionally, there\u2019s a one-sided M1 around 0.828, as shown by Hall (2011) and Friedman (2019).\n\nNow, the question arises: could experiments \"accidentally\" allow such a large value of M? The experiments prioritized QRNG unpredictability and cosmic tests to minimize bias. M essentially quantifies the correlation between two variables, \u03bb and (x, y).

When considering cosmic tests, photons used for measurement were selected microseconds before the test, but their origin dates back eons.

However, its claims faced scrutiny from experts questioning if it genuinely harnessed quantum physics. Verifying quantum computers is challenging because their internal state comprises \"qubits,\" mixtures of 0 and 1, collapsing into classical bits when measured. Researchers Umesh Vazirani and colleagues proposed a method using entangled quantum components to verify quantum systems through classical means. This involves interrogating the components separately to check their consistency. The protocol can also boost quantum cryptography security by ensuring devices prevent information leaks. They applied a concept from the CHSH game to reveal a quantum system's state, increasing computational integrity.

Today that already means certified randomness, first proofs-of-principle device-independent QKD, and **self-testing/verification** of remote devices. Over the next few years expect: higher-rate DI randomness \u201cbeacons\u201d, DI/MDI hybrid quantum networks, and CHSH-rigidity\u2013based audits for quantum cloud services. Below I spell out what\u2019s real now, the limits, and what looks imminently feasible.\n\n# What\u2019s in use today\n\n**Device-independent (DI) randomness.** Loophole-free Bell tests have been turned into real, certifiable random-bit sources where the *amount* of private randomness follows directly from the observed Bell violation\u2014no modeling of the hardware internals required. NIST\u2019s photonic experiment extracted 1024 certified bits with rigorous finite-statistics guarantees; it\u2019s slow (hours), but fully DI and loophole-free. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\n**DI randomness expansion.** Beyond \u201cget a few good bits,\u201d there are now experiments that *expand* a small seed into many more certified bits, secure even against quantum side information. This is the cleanest production-grade application of Bell nonlocality so far. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n**First DI-QKD demonstrations.** In 2022, a system with two trapped-atom nodes ~400 m apart achieved a loophole-free Bell violation and a positive DI secret-key *rate per heralded entanglement* (\u22480.07 bits/event). It\u2019s not metro-scale or high-rate yet, but it shows end-to-end DI security is physically achievable. Reviews since then track fast protocol/theory progress and early photonic prototypes. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\n**Self-testing and verification of devices.** The \u201crigidity\u201d of CHSH\u2014if you win it near-optimally, you must essentially have EPR pairs and the right measurements\u2014underpins **device-independent characterization** and interactive tests to **classically command/verify** untrusted quantum devices. This is already used in lab-scale demonstrations and is the conceptual backbone for future \u201cquantum cloud audits.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n**Certification on computing platforms.** A 2023 loophole-free Bell test across a 30 m cryogenic link between superconducting processors demonstrated deterministic remote entanglement and CHSH violation directly on a leading computing platform\u2014useful both as a network-bring-up test and as a DI entanglement check for modular QPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n**Semi-DI tech in deployment.** While *fully* DI-QKD is still prototype-level, **measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD**\u2014which kills all detector side-channels while keeping practical rates/distances\u2014has matured into field trials and multi-user networks, with 2024\u20132025 results showing 100\u2013400 km fiber links at useful key rates. This isn\u2019t Bell-DI, but it\u2019s a direct outgrowth of the same \u201cdon\u2019t trust devices\u201d paradigm and a realistic bridge to DI networking. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search13\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\n# Limits you should be aware of (today)\n\n- **Rates and distances.** DI tasks are error- and loss-intolerant because loopholes must be closed; current DI randomness runs are slow (hours for kilobits), and DI-QKD key rates at distance are tiny. The 2022 atomic DI-QKD achieved \u22480.07 bits per heralded event with an entanglement event rate ~1/82 s, i.e., demonstration-class throughput. Photonic DI-QKD over long fiber remains challenging, though protocol ideas to beat loss via heralding/single-photon architectures are advancing. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn2search15\ue201  \n- **Entropy in, entropy out.** DI randomness expansion still needs a small, trusted seed; throughput and practical integration into security stacks are active engineering problems. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n# What\u2019s next (credible near- to mid-term)\n\n**1) Randomness as a certified service.**  \nExpect **DI randomness beacons** (datacenter-scale sources feeding cryptographic services, lotteries, audits, and public ledgers) that publish live certificates tied to Bell-test statistics. The 2018 NIST protocol already showed a path from Bell data to composably secure bits; expansion experiments make the economics less painful. Theoretical work also shows you can **amplify arbitrarily weak or biased sources** into near-perfect randomness via Bell tests, so even imperfect setting generators can be \u201cbootstrapped.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n**2) DI-QKD on real networks (short-reach first).**  \nNear-term DI-QKD will likely target **short links with excellent detection** (campus/metro) and piggyback on **MDI/TF-QKD backbones** for distance, with frequency conversion to telecom and heralded entanglement to tame loss. Protocol work since 2021 makes DI-QKD more noise-tolerant; the 2022 atom-based demo already computes finite-key needs and points to concrete hardware upgrades (SNSPD efficiency, telecom conversion, time-multiplexing) to push from \u201cpossible\u201d to \u201cpractical.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\n**3) Supply-chain audits for quantum hardware.**  \nSelf-testing and CHSH-rigidity enable **black-box acceptance tests**: does the box actually hold EPR pairs and perform the claimed measurements? Expect these to become part of procurement/SLAs for entanglement sources, repeaters, QRNGs, and even modular QPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**4) Verified quantum cloud computing.**  \nCHSH-rigidity underlies interactive protocols where a classical client can **verify** that remote devices executed specific quantum operations (and didn\u2019t leak). This won\u2019t replace performance benchmarks, but it can **guarantee correctness** for critical subroutines and serve as a root-of-trust for delegated tasks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**5) DI-secure multi-party communication.**  \nBeyond two-party DI-QKD, conference key agreement and broadcast scenarios are moving from theory to lab. Semi-DI/MDI variants are already being field-tested; DI versions should follow as sources and detectors improve. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n**6) Robustness to imperfect independence.**  \nIn the real world, your setting generator may be biased or weak. **Measurement-dependent locality (MDL)** gives the right polytope/inequalities when independence isn\u2019t perfect and shows that *arbitrarily small but nonzero* independence still suffices to certify nonlocality and randomness. That matters for deploying DI protocols in messy environments (and for \u201ccosmic RNG\u201d style stress-tests). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n# How to make it real faster (engineering levers)\n\n- **Detectors and collection:** push SNSPD system efficiency and reduce dark counts; better atom/ion/single-photon sources; frequency conversion to low-loss telecom. The 2022 DI-QKD paper is explicit that these alone could yield orders-of-magnitude event-rate gains. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n- **Protocol design:** entropy-accumulation-based security, biased bases, random post-selection, and heralded single-photon architectures for DI-QKD; optimized finite-size analyses for DI randomness and key distribution. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n- **Networks:** short-reach DI at the edges, MDI/TF in the core; use DI tests as on-demand health checks of entanglement links (as already shown on superconducting platforms). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can tailor a deployment sketch\u2014for example, a DI randomness microservice with live Bell-stat certificates and throughput estimates\u2014or map the hardware/protocol changes needed to get DI-QKD working across a specific campus fiber."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201","start_idx":995,"end_idx":1012,"safe_urls":["https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11404207/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11404207/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"\n            Experimentally Generated Randomness Certified by the Impossibility of Superluminal Signals - PMC\n        ","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11404207/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"PMC"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue201","start_idx":1281,"end_idx":1298,"safe_urls":["https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.050503"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Physical Review](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.050503))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Experimental Realization of Device-Independent Quantum Randomness Expansion  |  Phys.

If \\(\\rho\\) could depend on \\((x,y)\\), the four terms in \\(S\\) would be averaged with **different** weights, breaking the common bound.\n- **Single outcome / fair sampling (3)** ensures that on each trial we have well-defined \\(\\pm1\\) results that contribute to the same statistics (no outcome-dependent data loss); mathematically, it enforces \\(|A_x(\\lambda)|,|B_y(\\lambda)|\\le 1\\) and that the same ensemble underlies all four correlators.\n\n> **Remark.** We did **not** assume determinism. If outcomes are locally stochastic, that randomness is absorbed into \\(\\lambda\\), and the bound still holds.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Two simple numerical counter-examples\n\nThe following toy models show how the CHSH bound can be exceeded if we drop either measurement independence or single-outcome/fair-sampling.\n\n## (A) Violating **measurement independence** (superdeterministic toy): reach \\(S=4\\)\n\nLet settings \\((x,y)\\) be chosen uniformly from \\(\\{0,1\\}^2\\). Define \\(\\lambda\\in\\{0,1\\}^2\\) **to equal the chosen settings**, i.e., \\(P(\\lambda=x,y\\,|\\,x,y)=1\\). (This maximally violates measurement independence.) Define **local** response functions\n\\[\nA = (-1)^{\\lambda_0\\cdot y},\\qquad B = (-1)^{\\lambda_1\\cdot x},\n\\]\nso each side only uses its own setting and the appropriate component of \\(\\lambda\\). One checks that for every run,\n\\[\nAB = (-1)^{\\lambda_0 y+\\lambda_1 x} = (-1)^{xy},\n\\]\ni.e., the **PR-box** correlation: \\(AB=+1\\) unless \\(x=y=1\\), where \\(AB=-1\\). Averaging gives\n\\[\nE_{00}=E_{01}=E_{10}=+1,\\quad E_{11}=-1 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; S=4.\n\\]\nAll responses are local functions; the only \u201ctrick\u201d is that \\(\\lambda\\) is perfectly correlated with \\((x,y)\\), i.e., measurement independence fails. This pushes the local bound from \\(2\\) up to the algebraic maximum \\(4\\).\n\n> Intuition: because each correlator is averaged with a **different** effective \\(\\rho(\\lambda\\,|\\,x,y)\\), you can \u201cpick a \\(\\lambda\\)\u201d tailored to each setting pair.\n\n## (B) Violating **single-outcome / fair-sampling** (post-selection toy): reach \\(S=4\\)\n\nStart with any local deterministic model that **saturates** the classical bound \\(S=2\\). For concreteness, take pre-assigned values\n\\[\nA_0=A_1=+1,\\qquad B_0=+1,\\; B_1=+1\n\\]\nfor every trial; then \\(E_{00}=E_{01}=E_{10}=+1\\), \\(E_{11}=+1\\), so \\(S=1+1+1-1=2\\).\n\nNow introduce **outcome-dependent data loss** for the setting pair \\((x,y)=(1,1)\\):  \n- keep all trials with \\(A_1B_1=-1\\) (none, in this specific assignment),  \n- **discard** all trials with \\(A_1B_1=+1\\) (all of them).\n\nTo make the numbers explicit, suppose you mix two local deterministic strategies in equal proportion:\n\n- Strategy S\\(_+\\): \\(A_0=A_1=+1,\\; B_0=B_1=+1\\) (gives \\(AB=+1\\) for all pairs).\n- Strategy S\\(_-\\): \\(A_0=A_1=+1,\\; B_0=+1,\\; B_1=-1\\) (gives \\(E_{00}=E_{01}=+1,\\;E_{10}=-1,\\;E_{11}=-1\\)).\n\nWithout post-selection, averaging S\\(_+\\) and S\\(_-\\) yields \\(S=2\\).  \nWith **post-selection on \\((1,1)\\)**\u2014discarding the S\\(_+\\) runs for that pair while keeping all others\u2014you observe\n\\[\nE_{00}=E_{01}=E_{10}=+1,\\qquad E_{11}=-1 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; S=4.\n\\]\nYou\u2019ve produced an apparent \u201cBell violation\u201d **without** any nonlocality or measurement-dependence\u2014purely by violating the **single-outcome / fair-sampling** condition (some trials do not yield recorded outcomes, and which trials are kept depends on \\((x,y,A,B)\\)). In a real Bell test, this is the **detection loophole**.\n\n> Intuition: the proof needs all four correlators to be computed on the **same ensemble** (or on ensembles that are setting-independent slices of the same \\(\\rho(\\lambda)\\)). Outcome-dependent loss makes the effective \\(\\rho\\) differ across \\((x,y)\\) and can mimic strong correlations.\n\n---\n\n# 4) What the inequality does and does not rule out\n\n- If **all** assumptions 1\u20134 hold, then \\(|S|\\le 2\\).  \n- If quantum experiments robustly yield \\(|S|>2\\), the conjunction of assumptions is false in our world. To keep locality + single outcomes + standard probability, you must relax measurement independence (superdeterminism/retrocausality). To keep measurement independence + single outcomes, you must relax locality (nonlocal hidden variables). To keep locality + measurement independence, you must drop single outcomes (Everett-type views)\u2014in which case the very modeling as random variables with definite values per run is the wrong starting point.\n\n---\n\n# 5) Minimal \u201crelaxed\u201d bounds (context)\n\nIf measurement independence is only **partially** relaxed, the **tight** CHSH cap deforms to\n\\[\n|S|\\;\\le\\;2+\\min\\{\\,3M,\\;2\\,\\},\\qquad M:=\\sup_{x,x',y,y'} \\tfrac12\\!\\int\\! d\\lambda\\,\\big|P(\\lambda|x,y)-P(\\lambda|x',y')\\big|.\n\\]\n- \\(M=0\\) (full independence) recovers \\(2\\).  \n- \\(M=\\tfrac{2(\\sqrt2-1)}{3}\\approx 0.276\\) lets a local model reach the quantum value \\(2\\sqrt2\\).  \nThis quantifies exactly how much relaxation would be needed to \u201cexplain\u201d a violation without abandoning locality.\n\n---\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- The CHSH inequality follows from **local causality + measurement independence + single outcomes/fair sampling**.  \n- The bound \\(|S|\\le 2\\) is obtained by (i) bounding each **per-\\(\\lambda\\)** contribution using \\(|A_x|\\le1,|B_y|\\le1\\) (this needs single outcomes/fair sampling), then (ii) **averaging with the same \\(\\rho(\\lambda)\\)** for all setting pairs (this needs measurement independence).  \n- Simple, explicit toy models show how dropping either assumption can push the observed \\(S\\) above 2\u2014up to the algebraic maximum 4\u2014without any nonlocal influences."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":9367,"end_idx":9367,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"51a38407-927c-450b-b682-468679812348","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"c1273c2e-4061-4204-8fa3-d16ea4e6f3c5","turn_exchange_id":"a24a5633-9b3b-4082-b7ad-2d48d244a284","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c1273c2e-4061-4204-8fa3-d16ea4e6f3c5","children":[]}}}
