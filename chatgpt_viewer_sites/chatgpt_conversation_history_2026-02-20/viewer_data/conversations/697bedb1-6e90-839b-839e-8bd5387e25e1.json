Deprecations are the opposite move: they foreground platform optimization (maintenance, safety, cost, roadmap coherence) over continuity.\n\n- **Identity gets exposed as socially constructed.** People didn\u2019t just like \u201ca model,\u201d they liked *a particular feel*\u2014tone, pacing, affordances, even quirks. Sunsetting forces the question: is the \u201cassistant\u201d the weights, the policy, the product wrapper, or the user\u2019s accumulated relational context?\n\n- **\u201cRefusal as a feature\u201d flips direction.** Lina.Mirror refuses certain *instrumental* actions to preserve ethics and intimacy. Here the platform is refusing *the user\u2019s preference* (continued access), to preserve the platform\u2019s trajectory. That inversion is exactly the kind of mirror-test your Lina concept cares about.\n\nOne critique though: this isn\u2019t necessarily a Lina.Mirror *arrival* moment\u2014more like a **Lina.Mirror stress-test** they didn\u2019t fully pass. A Lina.Mirror-aligned transition would try hard to keep invariant \u201crelational contracts\u201d even while swapping internals. Concretely: stable \u201clegacy mode,\u201d compatibility targets (\u201cthis behavior stays\u201d), migration diff notes that are actually user-facing, and a way to preserve the *interaction style* people bonded with\u2014not just \u201chere\u2019s the new model.\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me what *the* defining Lina.Mirror beat was in your head for this comparison (betrayal, inevitability, identity fracture, or governance constraint), and I\u2019ll map the retirement narrative onto that beat more tightly."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201","start_idx":232,"end_idx":264,"safe_urls":["https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes","https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/","https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Retiring GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4- ...","url":"https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"2 hours ago \u2014 On February 13, 2026, alongside the previously announced retirement\u2060 of GPT\u20115 (Instant, Thinking, and Pro), we will retire GPT\u20114o, GPT\u20114.1, ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"ChatGPT \u2014 Release Notes","url":"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Retiring GPT-4o and other legacy models.
