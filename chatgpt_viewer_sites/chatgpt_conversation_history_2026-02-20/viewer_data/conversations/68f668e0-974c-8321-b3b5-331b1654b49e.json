paper in your image \u2014 **\u201cReasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think\u201d** by *Aayush Karan* and *Yilun Du* (Harvard University) \u2014 is an important 2025 preprint arguing that **a large portion of the reasoning ability attributed to reinforcement-learning-fine-tuned models (like GPT-4 or o1-preview)** can actually be recovered **from the base model itself**, purely through improved *inference-time sampling*.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown and critical analysis:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Core Thesis\nThe authors argue that **post-training (e.g. RLHF or RLAIF) may not be introducing fundamentally new reasoning capabilities**, but rather that **the base model already contains much of the reasoning potential**, which can be unlocked by *sampling more intelligently*.\n\nThey introduce a **Markov Chain Monte Carlo\u2013inspired iterative sampler** that:\n- Draws multiple candidate completions.\n- Re-weights or resamples them according to the model\u2019s own likelihood.\n- Iterates to refine reasoning chains.\n\nThis is essentially \u201creasoning through sampling\u201d rather than reasoning through gradient updates.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Methodological Highlights\n1. **Pure Inference-Time Approach**  \n   No additional fine-tuning, datasets, or verifiers are used.  \n   The sampler leverages only the **base model\u2019s conditional probability distribution**.\n\n2. **MCMC-Inspired Algorithm**  \n   Each sample is viewed as a \u201cstate.\u201d The algorithm perturbs these states to explore high-likelihood regions of reasoning trajectories, avoiding mode collapse.\n\n3. **Benchmarks**  \n   Tested across:\n   - **MATH500** (mathematical reasoning)\n   - **HumanEval** (code synthesis)\n   - **GPQA** (graduate-level QA)\n   \n   The method achieved performance **approaching or even surpassing RL-trained models**.\n\n4. **Avoids Diversity Collapse**  \n   Unlike RL fine-tuning\u2014which tends to compress outputs toward \u201csafe,\u201d generic answers\u2014this method **preserves diversity** while still improving accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Implications\n- **Rethinking RL Post-Training:**  \n  Reinforcement learning may not be *creating* reasoning capacity but *selecting* and *re-weighting* it within the base model\u2019s latent structure.\n\n- **Efficiency & Transparency:**  \n  Since no additional training or human feedback is required, this offers a more interpretable and cost-effective alternative to RLHF/RLAIF.\n\n- **Probabilistic Framing:**  \n  Reasoning becomes a *sampling* problem rather than a *policy optimization* one \u2014 aligning with Bayesian perspectives on cognition and probabilistic inference.\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f Critical Perspective\n**Strengths**\n- Elegant demonstration that base models are already \u201csmarter\u201d than typically measured by one-shot prompting.  \n- The MCMC analogy is conceptually powerful and ties reasoning to probabilistic search dynamics.\n- Empirical evidence suggests meaningful gains without retraining \u2014 a practical breakthrough.\n\n**Limitations**\n- Computationally expensive: repeated sampling and likelihood evaluation scale poorly with model size.  \n- May still rely on implicit biases encoded by RLHF during pretraining (if the base model already contains such priors).\n- Does not directly address *verifiability* or *truthfulness*, which RLHF partially enforces.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Conceptual Context\nThis fits into a broader 2024\u20132025 movement emphasizing **inference-time computation over training-time alignment**, seen also in:\n- **Tree of Thoughts**, **Self-Consistency**, **ReAct**, and **Chain of Verification** frameworks.\n- **Reasoning loops** in OpenAI\u2019s *o1-series* models.\n- **Active sampling** in probabilistic program synthesis.\n\nThe philosophical takeaway:  \n> *The difference between a \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d model may lie more in how you sample it than in how you train it.*\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Write a **technical summary** (with algorithm pseudocode and formalism), or  \n2. A **comparative analysis** versus OpenAI\u2019s *o1-preview* and DeepMind\u2019s *AlphaReasoner* methods (which also exploit inference-time reasoning)?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"ea6f62cc-a780-413a-bd1b-ad6fc7eff151","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"9642b126-4bc4-439f-9cd7-4b57fbd3adc6","turn_exchange_id":"e0fb3337-a9c3-41d4-b172-c0dd44d5042a","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9642b126-4bc4-439f-9cd7-4b57fbd3adc6","children":[]}}}
