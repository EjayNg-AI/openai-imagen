This preliminary injunction was granted after the Democratic attorneys general from Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota, along with Colorado, sued the Trump administration. Trump's plan targeted institutions offering puberty blockers and hormone treatments, in addition to an unfounded threat of prosecuting medical professionals for providing this care. The lawsuit argues that such orders violate equal rights protections and states' rights. The judge emphasized the potential life-threatening consequences for transgender youth who might be denied essential care. The rulings challenge executive orders promoting gender ideology extremism and protecting children from medical procedures deemed unnecessary, questioning their validity and alignment with constitutional rights.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":1159,"end_idx":1160,"refs":[],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Executive Order 14187","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14187","pub_date":1741229198.0,"snippet":"Executive Order 14187, titled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\", is an executive order issued by Donald Trump on January 28, 2025.
