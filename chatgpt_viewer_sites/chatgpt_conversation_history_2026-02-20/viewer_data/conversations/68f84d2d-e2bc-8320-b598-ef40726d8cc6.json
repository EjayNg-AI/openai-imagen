A defining challenge is Japan\u2019s **demographic decline** \u2013 the population is both shrinking and rapidly aging, leading to labor shortages and straining the social welfare system\u301025\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Birth rates have plummeted to historic lows: in 2024 the country saw only **686,000 births**, the fewest since record-keeping began in 1899\u301013\u2020L172-L180\u3011. The fertility rate fell to just **1.15** (far below the 2.1 replacement level)\u301013\u2020L181-L189\u3011. This longtime trend of delayed marriage and smaller families was exacerbated by economic uncertainties and the pandemic, as many young people feel pessimistic about marrying or raising children amid poor job security and a rising cost of living\u301013\u2020L225-L233\u3011. Consequently, Japan\u2019s total population (about 124 million in 2025) has started shrinking faster than expected, a \u201c**silent emergency**\u201d in the words of former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u301013\u2020L212-L220\u3011. Projections warn it could fall to around **87 million by 2070**, with 40% of citizens over 65\u301013\u2020L205-L213\u3011. Such a dramatic demographic shift carries dire implications for the economy and even national security, as a smaller working-age base must support the elderly and the nation looks to maintain its military strength\u301013\u2020L210-L218\u3011.\n\nIn response, governments have launched numerous pro-family policies, especially post-COVID, but with limited success. Leaders from Fumio Kishida to Shigeru Ishiba have raised alarms that the low birthrate threatens Japan\u2019s ability \u201cto **function as a society**\u201d\u301013\u2020L219-L227\u3011. They expanded child allowances, made high school education free, and even guaranteed up to 100% of take-home pay for couples taking parental leave together\u301013\u2020L213-L221\u3011. These measures, however, have yet to reverse the decline\u301013\u2020L225-L233\u3011. Critics argue the focus on married couples overlooks root causes \u2013 many young Japanese remain single, discouraged by economic prospects and a corporate culture that is unfriendly to working mothers\u301013\u2020L225-L233\u3011. Indeed, surveys show few teens are confident they will marry at all. Post-pandemic, the **social impact** of these trends is becoming more visible: rural areas are emptying out as youth migrate to cities, elder care burdens are increasing, and schools are consolidating or closing due to lack of children. Japanese society is gradually adapting with changes such as higher senior workforce participation and discussions on accepting more foreign workers, but change is slow. The COVID-19 pandemic itself, while primarily a health and economic crisis, also influenced social behavior \u2013 for example, it normalized **remote work** and online services to a degree, challenging the long tradition of long commutes and in-office presence. Many companies introduced telework during 2020 out of necessity, and although Japan has partly reverted to old work styles, there is a lasting awareness of work-life balance and digital connectivity in everyday life. The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital tools in daily transactions (from e-commerce to cashless payments) and reduced some social stigma around flexible schedules\u301015\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301016\u2020L1-L4\u3011. These subtle shifts hint at a society cautiously modernizing under pressure \u2013 balancing its deep-rooted cultural norms with the need to address urgent demographic and social issues.\n\n## Economic Developments and Trends (2000\u20132025)  \nEconomically, Japan in the 2000s and 2010s struggled to emerge from the **\u201cLost Decades\u201d** of stagnation that began in the 1990s. After an asset bubble burst in the early \u201990s, growth remained anemic and deflation persisted for years\u30109\u2020L478-L486\u3011. Even by the late 2000s, prices and wages were stuck or declining. A succession of governments tried stimulus measures \u2013 notably **\u201cAbenomics\u201d** in the 2010s under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 which combined easy money, fiscal spending, and structural reforms to jolt the economy. Abe\u2019s policies did spur some growth and record stock market highs, and he famously promoted tourism and corporate investment as new drivers\u301022\u2020L56-L65\u3011\u301022\u2020L69-L77\u3011. However, fundamental challenges remained. One was the huge public debt: Japan\u2019s government debt swelled to about **260% of GDP** (by far the highest in the OECD) as of the early 2020s\u30109\u2020L481-L489\u3011\u30109\u2020L492-L499\u3011. Another was wage stagnation \u2013 remarkably, average pay in Japan only surpassed its 1997 level for the first time in 2024\u30108\u2020L179-L187\u3011. In other words, an entire generation saw nearly flat incomes, contributing to consumer caution and inequality. The aging population also hurt economic vitality: as the workforce shrinks, labor shortages in many industries limit growth\u301025\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Japan\u2019s population peaked in 2010 and has since lost roughly 6 million people, directly undermining domestic demand and innovation capacity\u30109\u2020L492-L499\u3011. In the long run, fewer workers and more retirees put heavy pressure on pension and healthcare systems, requiring either higher taxes or significant productivity gains to maintain living standards.\n\n**Post-COVID economic picture:** The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 delivered a sharp blow to Japan\u2019s economy, which contracted as lockdowns and supply chain disruptions hit. The government rolled out massive stimulus packages, adding to the debt but cushioning the fallout. By 2021\u201322, recovery was underway, but new issues emerged. For the first time in decades, **inflation** returned \u2013 consumer prices in recent years have risen about 2.5\u20133%, finally above the Bank of Japan\u2019s longstanding 2% target\u30108\u2020L177-L184\u3011. Global factors like supply shocks and the war in Ukraine pushed up energy and food costs, which Japan (as a major importer) felt acutely\u301011\u2020L743-L752\u3011. The central bank ended its experiment with negative interest rates in 2024, yet unlike other countries raising rates to tame inflation, Japan has cautiously kept rates low to ensure price rises are sustained after decades of deflation\u301011\u2020L743-L752\u3011\u301011\u2020L749-L757\u3011. One side effect has been a **weak yen** \u2013 the currency hit a 37-year low of around \u00a5160 per US dollar in 2024\u301011\u2020L749-L757\u3011. This yen weakness makes imports pricier (hurting consumers via higher gasoline and grocery costs) but has benefitted exporters and helped fuel a boom in **post-pandemic tourism**. After Japan fully reopened its borders in late 2022, inbound travel bounced back dramatically. By mid-2024, Japan was receiving over 3 million foreign visitors per month, exceeding pre-pandemic levels \u2013 a surge driven in part by the yen\u2019s depreciation making Japan a bargain destination\u301022\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301022\u2020L165-L173\u3011. Tourism has thus re-emerged as a vital economic sector, providing jobs and regional development, which was a strategic goal of pre-pandemic policy makers\u301022\u2020L56-L65\u3011.\n\nDespite these positive signs, the **standard of living** for many Japanese remains under strain. Inflation, though moderate, is outpacing wage growth, meaning real incomes are declining for consumers. Years of labor market liberalization have left many workers in non-regular jobs with lower pay and benefits, contributing to a poverty rate around 15% (one of the highest among developed nations). Inequality has inched up, especially between older, asset-rich Japanese and younger generations who have known only economic stagnation. The pandemic amplified some of these disparities \u2013 for instance, those in secure jobs weathered it well while many part-timers and small businesses suffered disproportionately. The government under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida acknowledged these issues and championed a \u201cNew Capitalism\u201d agenda to redistribute wealth (through higher corporate pay and social spending), but tangible results were limited. Heading into the mid-2020s, Japan\u2019s economic priorities have shifted to managing this delicate balance: **boosting growth and productivity** (through innovation, digitalization, and perhaps mild immigration) while also ensuring that ordinary people see the benefits in their wages and well-being. The new prime minister in 2025, Sanae Takaichi, has pledged continuity in pro-growth policies \u2013 such as **easy credit and big fiscal outlays** \u2013 even as she faces the reality that Japan\u2019s debt and demographic headwinds make long-term robust growth hard to achieve\u30108\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u30108\u2020L219-L227\u3011. Indeed, Takaichi is expected to follow her mentor Abe\u2019s playbook (\u201c**Sanaenomics**,\u201d as it\u2019s dubbed): keep interest rates ultra-low to spur investment, pour money into favored sectors like defense, and attempt structural fixes for the demographic crunch\u30108\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u30108\u2020L229-L237\u3011. How effectively these economic strategies can overcome the structural challenges remains an open question, but they will heavily influence Japanese society \u2013 determining job opportunities, social stability, and Japan\u2019s role in the global economy \u2013 in the years to come.\n\n## Political Landscape Since 2000  \nJapan\u2019s political scene since 2000 has been characterized by relative **stability of ruling parties** but frequent leadership changes, until recently. The conservative **Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)** has dominated governance for most of this period (as it has for most of the postwar era), with only a brief interruption. In the late 2000s, public frustration with economic stagnation and scandals allowed an opposition coalition (the DPJ) to take power from 2009 to 2012 \u2013 a historic moment ending decades of unbroken LDP rule. However, the DPJ government struggled (grappling with the 2011 earthquake/tsunami disaster and unpopular reforms), and by 2012 the LDP returned to power under Shinzo Abe. Abe\u2019s 2012\u20132020 tenure brought an unusual stretch of stability: he became Japan\u2019s longest-serving Prime Minister, implementing his economic agenda and taking a more assertive stance in foreign policy. Abe pushed for revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution to enable a stronger military, a goal supported by conservatives, though he never achieved a formal amendment. He also cultivated a close alliance with the U.S. and took a hard line on issues like North Korea\u2019s missile tests and China\u2019s maritime activities. Domestically, Abe\u2019s era saw a resurgence of LDP\u2019s confidence, but it was not without controversy \u2013 there were cronyism scandals and public debates over his nationalist rhetoric and handling of history issues. Nonetheless, the political opposition remained fragmented and weak, allowing LDP (in coalition with the smaller Komeito party) to handily win elections. \n\nAfter Abe abruptly resigned in 2020 (due to health reasons), Japan saw a rapid turnover of leaders during the COVID crisis. Yoshihide Suga (2020\u20132021) oversaw the initial pandemic response and the delayed Tokyo Olympics (held in summer 2021 without spectators), but his public approval plummeted over perceptions of a slow COVID response and he lasted only a year. **Fumio Kishida** took over LDP leadership and the premiership in late 2021 with a relatively moderate image. Kishida\u2019s government navigated Japan through the later pandemic stages and the global impacts of the Ukraine war. He notably improved relations with South Korea in 2023 by settling some historical disputes, and he committed Japan to a more robust defense posture (in 2022 his government announced plans to boost defense spending to 2% of GDP within five years, signaling a break from Japan\u2019s longstanding 1%-of-GDP norm). However, Kishida faced domestic headwinds. Inflation and the weak yen began hitting consumers in 2022\u20132023, undermining his pledge to create a more equitable economy. Moreover, a scandal involving LDP politicians\u2019 ties to the Unification Church (a controversial sect) \u2014 revealed after the shocking **assassination of Shinzo Abe in 2022** \u2014 tarnished the party\u2019s image and led to several cabinet resignations. By 2023, Kishida\u2019s approval ratings had fallen, and the LDP suffered setbacks in by-elections and local polls. \n\nPolitical developments came to a head in **2024\u20132025**. The LDP-led coalition lost its outright majority in the powerful Lower House of Parliament (possibly in a 2024 general election), weakening its grip on power\u30105\u2020L2196-L2204\u3011. Kishida either stepped down or was defeated in an internal party vote \u2013 in the turmoil, veteran LDP figure **Shigeru Ishiba** briefly assumed leadership. Ishiba, a one-time rival of Abe known for his own conservative views but reformist rhetoric, became prime minister. Under his short tenure, the LDP saw **\u201cdisastrous losses\u201d** in the July 2025 Upper House elections, prompting Ishiba\u2019s resignation in September 2025\u30104\u2020L25-L34\u3011. This paved the way for **Sanae Takaichi** to win the LDP presidency on October 4, 2025, and hence become Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister\u30104\u2020L29-L34\u3011. Notably, Takaichi is the first woman ever to hold Japan\u2019s top office, marking a historic moment in a country where politics has been overwhelmingly male-dominated. Her rise reflects a **rightward shift** within the LDP at this juncture: Takaichi is an \u201cultraconservative\u201d and security hawk, and her victory signaled the party\u2019s turn to a more hardline stance after the perceived centrism of Kishida and the turbulence under Ishiba\u30105\u2020L2191-L2199\u3011\u301024\u2020L61-L69\u3011. However, this shift had immediate consequences for coalition politics. The LDP\u2019s longtime junior partner, **Komeito** (a pacifist-leaning party backed by a Buddhist movement), split from the coalition in protest \u2013 ending a partnership that had lasted since 1999\u30105\u2020L2258-L2264\u3011\u301024\u2020L63-L71\u3011. Losing Komeito\u2019s 32 Lower House seats meant the LDP alone lacked a majority, creating an unprecedented scenario in modern Japanese politics: the dominant party needed a new ally or risk losing power.\n\nTakaichi responded by forging a new **coalition with the Japan Innovation Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai)**, a right-leaning, Osaka-based party that shares many of her nationalist and neoliberal views\u30105\u2020L2258-L2264\u3011\u301024\u2020L78-L86\u3011. Ishin\u2019s emergence as a \u201c**second LDP**\u201d in recent years \u2013 appealing to conservative voters disenchanted with the establishment \u2013 made it a logical partner once Komeito walked away\u301024\u2020L78-L86\u3011. Together, LDP and Ishin control 351 seats across both houses, which allowed Takaichi to win the parliamentary vote for Prime Minister in October 2025\u301024\u2020L69-L77\u3011. The opposition camp, while sizable in total, remains fragmented among multiple parties (ranging from the moderate Constitutional Democrats to the Japanese Communist Party), and they could not unite to offer a credible alternative\u30105\u2020L2248-L2255\u3011. This disunity among opposition forces once again enabled the LDP to remain in power by cobbling together a coalition, even after significant electoral losses. **Japanese society**, for its part, has shown mixed reactions to these political shifts. Voter turnout has been lukewarm in recent elections, reflecting a degree of apathy or disillusionment, especially among younger voters who feel their voices aren\u2019t heard. At the same time, there is a cautious hope that a new leader \u2013 particularly a historic female PM \u2013 might reinvigorate the political landscape. Many Japanese value stability and have defaulted to the LDP\u2019s long rule, but there is also evident frustration with the \u201cpolitical stagnation\u201d and an appetite for change\u30105\u2020L2238-L2244\u3011. Takaichi\u2019s ascent thus comes at a complex moment: her mandate is tenuous and Japan\u2019s electorate is watching to see if she can deliver results or if another rapid turnover is on the horizon. \n\n## Post-COVID Societal and Policy Shifts  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic (2020\u20132022) served as a **turning point** that prompted Japan to confront long-pending issues in new ways. In governance and business, it accelerated **digital transformation**. The crisis exposed how far behind Japan\u2019s bureaucratic systems were \u2013 for instance, health officials were initially faxing case reports, and schools struggled to move classes online\u301020\u2020L1980-L1988\u3011. Reacting to these shortcomings, the government created a dedicated **Digital Agency** in 2021 to modernize public services\u301020\u2020L1985-L1993\u3011. This agency embarked on streamlining antiquated procedures: moving more applications and records online, unifying local government IT systems, and promoting the use of Japan\u2019s \u201cMy Number\u201d digital ID for accessing services\u301020\u2020L1999-L2007\u3011\u301020\u2020L2004-L2012\u3011. The pandemic essentially jolted Japan into embracing e-governance and tech reforms that had been talked about for years. In the private sector, COVID-19 pushed many companies to adopt telework and flexible hours. While not all of these practices persisted (traditional work culture is deeply ingrained), a portion of the workforce has continued working remotely or in hybrid modes, a novelty in Japan\u2019s once rigid office culture. This has had subtle societal impacts: urban commuter congestion eased during the pandemic and has not fully returned to pre-2020 levels, and people have found more time for family or personal pursuits, potentially contributing to quality-of-life improvements. The pandemic period also saw **behavioral changes** such as ubiquitous mask-wearing, heightened public health awareness, and a big shift towards cashless payment and online shopping \u2013 habits that have, to an extent, lasted beyond the immediate crisis\u301015\u2020L130-L137\u3011\u301016\u2020L1-L4\u3011. These changes indicate a society that proved adaptable when pressured, and some of the efficiency gains (like digital services) are now helping Japan tackle its other challenges (for example, telemedicine trials to support healthcare in aging rural areas, or online grocery services for the elderly). \n\nEconomically, the pandemic\u2019s legacy is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it induced reforms and new growth areas (such as the boost in domestic tech solutions, and the eventual rebound in consumption once restrictions lifted). On the other, it left a heavier debt load and **widened disparities**. By 2025, analysts note that inequality has increased in many countries including Japan, as asset owners and large firms bounced back quickly, whereas many small businesses and low-income workers have not fully recovered\u301015\u2020L130-L137\u3011. The government\u2019s massive spending helped avoid a complete collapse, but now it faces the task of fiscal consolidation at some point without derailing the recovery. Socially, Japan managed the pandemic relatively well in terms of public health (its COVID death rate remained lower than most Western nations, partly thanks to cultural mask use and an obedient public response to guidelines), but at the cost of prolonged isolation \u2013 Japan kept its borders closed to tourists and even many foreign residents until late 2022. This isolation hurt sectors like tourism and entertainment severely; their comeback in 2023\u20132024 has been a relief but also a reminder of how globalized Japan\u2019s economy had become. Education, too, was impacted: students endured periods of remote learning, prompting renewed discussion on work-life balance and youth mental health. The government has since been investing in resilient infrastructure (like better broadband access nationwide) to ensure preparedness for any future crises. In summary, the post-COVID period in Japan is marked by a cautious recovery and a resolve to tackle long-term issues \u2013 from digitization to demographic decline \u2013 with a new urgency born from the lessons of the pandemic. Japanese society, often perceived as slow to change, demonstrated that it could adapt rapidly when necessary, and that momentum is now being directed toward modernizing the country for a post-pandemic world.\n\n## Factors Behind Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Election as Prime Minister (October 2025)  \n\n\u301028\u2020embed_image\u3011 *New Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi (center) during the Diet session that elected her in October 2025, following a tumultuous period for Japanese politics.*  \n\nTakaichi\u2019s rise to the premiership in October 2025 \u2013 as a hard-right candidate and Japan\u2019s first female prime minister \u2013 was the product of several converging factors. First, there was **political fallout from prior leadership**. The ruling LDP\u2019s popularity had been eroded by a \u201cseries of scandals in recent years\u201d that damaged public trust\u301024\u2020L58-L66\u3011. These included allegations of corruption, the Unification Church controversy, and missteps by Kishida\u2019s administration (such as his own son\u2019s impropriety and ministers resigning over gaffes). Voter dissatisfaction translated into **electoral setbacks**: the LDP \u201csuffered disastrous losses\u201d in the July 2025 upper house elections and had already lost its outright majority in the lower house in 2024\u30105\u2020L2196-L2204\u3011. Such defeats were unprecedented for the long-dominant party, and they forced the incumbent Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, to resign in order to take responsibility\u30104\u2020L17-L24\u3011\u30104\u2020L25-L34\u3011. In the LDP\u2019s October 4, 2025 leadership contest to replace Ishiba, party members gravitated toward Takaichi, signaling a decision to double-down on a more **ideologically right-wing course**\u301024\u2020L61-L69\u3011. This can be seen as a reaction to the LDP\u2019s losses \u2013 a belief that a more hawkish, decisive leader might shore up the conservative base and differentiate the party amid voter frustration. Takaichi, known as an **\u201cultraconservative\u201d and security hawk**, had long been a protege of the late Shinzo Abe and shared his agenda of a strong defense and traditionalist social policies\u30105\u2020L2202-L2209\u3011\u30105\u2020L2273-L2281\u3011. Her victory thus represented the LDP rank-and-file embracing Abe\u2019s legacy and a tougher image in hopes of regaining momentum.\n\nAnother crucial factor was the national **security environment and public sentiment**. By 2025, regional threats \u2013 North Korea\u2019s missile tests, China\u2019s military expansion \u2013 as well as global geopolitical shifts made security a top concern in Japan. Takaichi had been outspoken about bolstering Japan\u2019s defenses and standing firm in alliance with the United States\u30105\u2020L2191-L2199\u3011\u30105\u2020L2202-L2209\u3011. She even emphasized, in her first speech as LDP leader, the need to \u201cbuild a strong country\u201d and cited the U.S.\u2013Japan alliance as the cornerstone of foreign policy\u30105\u2020L2191-L2199\u3011\u30105\u2020L2202-L2209\u3011. This resonated with many conservative lawmakers (and voters) who felt Japan needed a tougher stance. The fact that the U.S. President by late 2025 is Donald Trump (per news context) may have also underscored the importance of having a like-minded, assertive Japanese leader to manage that alliance. Indeed, Takaichi\u2019s alignment with Trump-era politics \u2013 she planned to host President Trump soon after taking office \u2013 positioned her as someone who could navigate the relationship much as Abe did\u30105\u2020L2191-L2199\u3011\u30105\u2020L2207-L2215\u3011. Thus, **external pressures** likely bolstered her appeal: she promised a resolute approach to defense, which, given the worries about China and an aging population\u2019s effect on future security, seemed timely. One might say the electorate (or at least the LDP electorate) in 2025 was in a more hawkish mood, prioritizing national strength in uncertain times.\n\nAlso instrumental were **party dynamics and coalition math**. Takaichi did not lead the LDP to a landslide popular victory; rather, she was elevated by the party and then had to secure her position via a coalition deal. When the LDP\u2019s moderate ally Komeito defected due to her hardline stances, Takaichi swiftly reached out to the right-wing **Nippon Ishin no Kai** party. Embracing Ishin was crucial \u2013 without it, the LDP risked losing power. Ishin, which held 54 seats, actually gave the new bloc a larger combined seat count than the old LDP-Komeito pairing\u301024\u2020L73-L81\u3011\u301024\u2020L75-L83\u3011. Ideologically, this was a comfortable fit: Ishin shares Takaichi\u2019s enthusiasm for constitutional revision and a hawkish defense policy, and even opposes large immigration inflows similar to her views\u301024\u2020L78-L86\u3011. By agreeing to a policy platform with Ishin, Takaichi managed to present a viable government to parliament. Thus one can argue she was chosen *because* she could unite the right \u2013 both within her party and with an external partner \u2013 at a moment when the center had fallen out. In the parliamentary vote on Oct. 21, 2025, Takaichi won a majority in the Lower House (237 votes, just over the 233 needed) and prevailed in the Upper House in a run-off, defeating the opposition\u2019s candidate\u301024\u2020L44-L53\u3011. Notably, the **opposition\u2019s disarray** was a factor here: opposition parties, ranging from left to centrist, could not coordinate and thus split their votes, enabling Takaichi to secure the premiership even though her coalition was short of an absolute majority in the first round\u301024\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u30105\u2020L2248-L2255\u3011. In short, Takaichi\u2019s election was as much about the LDP staying in power through coalition-building as it was about any popular mandate for her personally.\n\nFinally, one cannot ignore the symbolic and strategic element of her being a **female leader**. While Takaichi herself is not a proponent of feminist policies (she is against measures like allowing married couples separate surnames or legalizing same-sex marriage\u30105\u2020L2214-L2222\u3011\u30105\u2020L2223-L2231\u3011), the fact that she is a woman breaking the highest glass ceiling in Japan could have slightly boosted the LDP\u2019s image. After decades of male premiers and a poor record on gender parity, the LDP choosing Takaichi signaled a desire to project a *new face* to the public without drastically changing its ideology. Some voters and lawmakers likely found the idea of the first female PM **\u201cepoch-making\u201d**, hoping it might refresh Japan\u2019s international image and appeal to voters craving something different\u30105\u2020L2229-L2237\u3011. This doesn\u2019t mean Takaichi was selected because of her gender \u2013 her credentials lie in her right-wing pedigree and Abe faction backing \u2013 but it was a *convenient* bonus for a party in need of rejuvenation. As one 62-year-old Tokyo resident noted while celebrating her win, he hoped that her premiership would at last \u201cstart to move\u201d the long-static politics and improve things in Japan\u30105\u2020L2237-L2244\u3011. Thus, the **convergence of internal LDP politics, public mood on security, coalition arithmetic, and a touch of reformist symbolism** all likely led to Sanae Takaichi\u2019s election as Prime Minister in October 2025. Her mandate now is to address the very social, economic, and political challenges described above \u2013 from the post-COVID economic recovery to the demographic crisis \u2013 under the scrutiny of a public that is eager to see results after years of drift. Whether her hard-right leadership will provide the solutions Japan needs, or simply the latest chapter in its revolving-door politics, remains to be seen, but the factors that brought her to power underscore a nation at a crossroads, seeking a path forward in decidedly uncertain times. \n\n**Sources:** Japan\u2019s declining birthrate and demographic measures\u301013\u2020L172-L181\u3011\u301013\u2020L214-L222\u3011; economic conditions and \u201cSanaenomics\u201d policies\u30108\u2020L177-L184\u3011\u30108\u2020L229-L237\u3011; political shifts and Takaichi\u2019s coalition deal\u30105\u2020L2196-L2204\u3011\u301024\u2020L69-L77\u3011; context on Takaichi\u2019s ideology and the LDP\u2019s rightward turn\u30105\u2020L2202-L2209\u3011\u301024\u2020L61-L68\u3011; quotes and details from Associated Press, *The Guardian*, and *TIME* reporting as cited above."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":430,"end_ix":440,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"What to expect for Japan's economy under Sanae Takaichi, its 1st female prime minister","url":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/world/article/what-to-expect-for-japan-s-economy-under-sanae-21111335.php#:~:text=Japan%E2%80%99s%20population%20has%20been%20shrinking,the%20country%E2%80%99s%20potential%20economic%20growth","text":"Japan\u2019s population has been shrinking and rapidly aging for years, leading to labor shortages and undermining the country\u2019s potential economic growth.","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":25,"cited_message_id":"98e7c50d-93ee-46a3-bd68-fcbd495713ee","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":1,"end_line_num":4,"connector_source":""},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":581,"end_ix":595,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Japan records lowest number of births in more than a century, as population fears grow | Japan | The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/japan-records-lowest-number-of-births-in-more-than-a-century-as-population-fears-grow#:~:text=Japan%E2%80%99s%20struggle%20to%20encourage%20couples,more%20than%20a%20century%20ago","text":"Japan\u2019s struggle to encourage couples to have more children has been given greater urgency after data showed the annual number of births dropped to below 700,000 for the first time since records began more than a century ago.","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":13,"cited_message_id":"8fcc4be7-a76f-4eaf-aa3e-5804a926dc5c","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":172,"end_line_num":180,"connector_source":null},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":675,"end_ix":689,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Japan records lowest number of births in more than a century, as population fears grow | Japan | The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/japan-records-lowest-number-of-births-in-more-than-a-century-as-population-fears-grow#:~:text=The%20fertility%20rate%20%E2%80%93%20the,from%20a%20year%20earlier","text":"The fertility rate \u2013 the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime \u2013 also fell to a record-low of 1.15, down from 1.20 in 2023, the health ministry said.
