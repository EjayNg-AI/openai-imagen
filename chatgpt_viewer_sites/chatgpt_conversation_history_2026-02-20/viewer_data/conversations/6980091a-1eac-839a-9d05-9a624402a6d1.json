Nvidia will contribute up to $10 billion and Microsoft up to $5 billion as part of the upcoming funding round, further aligning major players in AI infrastructure and model development. This agreement strengthens Anthropic's ability to compete with OpenAI, while also reducing the AI industry's reliance on a single dominant company. Microsoft will integrate Anthropic's Claude models into Azure and collaborate across development and market strategies, even while affirming OpenAI remains a key partner.\n\nAnthropic, which spun off from former OpenAI staff and is valued at $183 billion, is focusing on enterprise customers, reportedly serving over 300,000 businesses and aiming to triple revenue to $26 billion in 2026. The company will also partner with Nvidia on chip and infrastructure enhancements, including a commitment of up to 1 gigawatt of compute using Nvidia\u2019s advanced hardware. Despite the new Microsoft collaboration, Amazon will continue as Anthropic's primary cloud and training partner. Analysts view this consolidation as a sign of an increasingly concentrated AI landscape.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1763486938.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/798827/openai-broadcom-custom-ai-chips","title":"OpenAI partners with Broadcom to produce its own AI chips","snippet":"OpenAI has announced a strategic partnership with Broadcom to develop custom AI chips for its data centers. This marks a significant move to decrease reliance on Nvidia and secure the computing resources necessary to power applications like ChatGPT and Sora. The collaboration will enable OpenAI to create and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators\u2014an output equivalent to around ten nuclear reactors. These custom chips are expected to integrate insights from OpenAI\u2019s frontier model development, enhancing performance and intelligence capabilities.\n\nBroadcom is set to begin equipment deployments in the second half of 2026, with the project slated for completion by the end of 2029. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the initiative is crucial for building the infrastructure needed to realize AI\u2019s full potential. The announcement follows previous infrastructure deals OpenAI signed with AMD (six gigawatts) and Nvidia (ten gigawatts), made possible after modifying its exclusive computing agreement with Microsoft. This move reflects a broader industry trend in which major tech firms like Meta, Google, and Microsoft pursue custom chips to remedy AI chip shortages and reduce dependence on Nvidia, indirectly benefiting companies like Broadcom.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1760367584.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomshardware.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-signs-deal-with-google-cloud-to-expand-tpu-chip-capacity-ai-company-expects-to-have-over-1gw-of-processing-power-in-2026","title":"Anthropic signs deal with Google Cloud to expand TPU chip capacity - AI company expects to have over 1GW of processing power in 2026","snippet":"Anthropic has signed a major agreement with Google Cloud to significantly expand its use of Google's TPU chips, aiming to reach over a gigawatt of compute capacity by 2026. This deal will provide Anthropic access to up to a million TPUs as well as Google Cloud services, continuing a partnership that began in 2023. Anthropic, known for its Claude AI models, already employs Google's infrastructure for its services, serving clients like Figma, Palo Alto Networks, and Cursor.\n\nThe expansion supports Anthropic\u2019s ambitious growth goals, including a projected $26 billion in revenue by 2026. The company cites familiarity with Google\u2019s ecosystem and the strong price-performance of TPUs as key reasons for this deepened collaboration. While competitors such as OpenAI and xAI are investing heavily in building their own infrastructure, Anthropic opts for a cloud-based approach to avoid the risks of large upfront expenditures. However, this strategy may expose it to uncertainties in hardware costs and scalability. Nevertheless, the rapid global data center developments suggest that Anthropic sees this as a manageable risk while it continues focusing on AI innovation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1761310545.0,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698009c548d88328a71845edb4d63963","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for sources on blockchain, AI, and governance","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"bb996bfa-2eeb-444f-8117-eed6a261f7c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"7a9b1388-3d86-42a5-8b33-d225ef6069d9","turn_exchange_id":"bf9480d5-2098-43ed-83a4-2f53d446051c","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7a9b1388-3d86-42a5-8b33-d225ef6069d9","children":["5a2eb599-6d29-446f-a5b8-ba07c56786ed"]},"5a2eb599-6d29-446f-a5b8-ba07c56786ed":{"id":"5a2eb599-6d29-446f-a5b8-ba07c56786ed","message":{"id":"5a2eb599-6d29-446f-a5b8-ba07c56786ed","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769998814.899794,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering the use of sources and elements","content":"I\u2019ve got sources on AI concentration, Coase, and governance.

donated nearly $900,000 to the right-wing political group Advance, which opposes net zero climate policies and immigration. Her companies also contributed over $200,000 to different divisions of the Liberal Party. This comes amid record-high political donations during the 2025 Australian federal election cycle.\n\nClive Palmer was the largest individual donor, contributing $53.1 million to his new party, Trumpet of Patriots, along with over $300,000 to the United Australia Party\u2014neither of which won seats. Other significant donors included Pamela Wall ($5.2 million to South Australian Liberals), Anthony Pratt\u2019s company ($3 million split between Labor and Liberals), and Climate 200 ($9.45 million declared for independent candidates backed by pro-climate billionaires like Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes).\n\nThe Liberal and National parties outspent Labor overall, though Labor still secured a decisive electoral win. Meanwhile, new rules expected for the 2028 election will lower the donation disclosure threshold and impose stricter spending limits to reduce undue influence by major donors.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1769997540.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/big-oil-445m-trump-congress","title":"Big oil spent $445m in last election cycle to influence Trump and Congress, report says","snippet":"A new report by Climate Power reveals that major fossil fuel companies spent approximately $445 million during the 2023\u20132024 U.S. election cycle to influence political outcomes, particularly in support of Donald Trump and favorable Congressional candidates. This amount covered political donations, lobbying, and advertising, though the true figure is likely higher due to untraceable dark-money contributions. Of the total, $96 million was directed toward Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and affiliated PACs, heavily backed by wealthy oil magnates such as Harold Hamm, Kelcy Warren, and Jeffery Hildebrand.\n\nFossil fuel companies also spent $243 million lobbying Congress, aiming to benefit from energy policy leaders like Chris Wright (Department of Energy) and Lee Zeldin (Environmental Protection Agency), both strong industry allies. An additional $80 million funded advertisements largely targeting swing state voters and opposing pro-electric vehicle policies. Another $25 million supported GOP candidates in House, Senate, and gubernatorial races.\n\nThe report concludes that these investments are likely to yield significant policy rewards, with Republicans now controlling the executive and legislative branches. Trump has already enacted many pro-fossil fuel directives and plans further rollbacks of Biden-era environmental regulations. Climate Power highlights this as a critical moment to break the U.S. reliance on fossil fuels and transition to clean energy.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1737637243.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.pnas.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2016976118","title":"Experienced well-being rises with income, even above ...","snippet":"by MA Killingsworth \u00b7 2021 \u00b7 Cited by 385 \u2014 Experienced well-being rises with income, even above $75,000 per year.

In 2024, these elites contributed over $1 billion, accounting for 7.5% of total federal election spending. Court decisions like Citizens United (2010) enabled unlimited contributions via super PACs, further empowering the ultra-wealthy.\n\nPoliticians are increasingly dependent on billionaire donors, with Republicans receiving the lion's share\u201480% of billionaire contributions in 2024\u2014fueled by support for tax cuts, deregulation, and opposition to Democratic policies seen as anti-business. High-profile billionaires like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel played pivotal roles in shaping political outcomes, while Trump\u2019s administration embraced the billionaire class more openly than ever, assigning key roles and welcoming them into policymaking.\n\nCritics, including Bernie Sanders and President Biden, warn of rising oligarchy, where a small elite exerts disproportionate control. Many Americans are uneasy with this trend, believing it undermines democracy. Though some politicians voice resistance, it's difficult to escape the influence of vast wealth. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party faces internal tensions over how to address billionaire power, balancing ideological critiques with practical fundraising needs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1763719248.38,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698009c548d88328a71845edb4d63963","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Critiquing billionaires, hedonic adaptation, and wealth inequality","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"bb996bfa-2eeb-444f-8117-eed6a261f7c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"20c163e4-8591-473c-bf18-d7c71c9aa7f0","turn_exchange_id":"bf9480d5-2098-43ed-83a4-2f53d446051c","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"20c163e4-8591-473c-bf18-d7c71c9aa7f0","children":["924d6050-7523-4133-bcf3-4e96a309a999"]},"924d6050-7523-4133-bcf3-4e96a309a999":{"id":"924d6050-7523-4133-bcf3-4e96a309a999","message":{"id":"924d6050-7523-4133-bcf3-4e96a309a999","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769998935.513353,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Structuring response and critique of DS","content":"Let\u2019s unpack DS\u2019s claim from February 2, 2026.

Neuroscientist Sukhvinder Obhi's research supports this, demonstrating that power disrupts the brain's \"mirroring\" process\u2014vital for empathy. In an experiment, participants watched a video of someone squeezing a rubber ball. Normally, neurons associated with that action would activate, but those primed to feel powerful showed weaker neural responses in those regions.

Ryan examines phenomena like \u201cRich Asshole Syndrome\u201d (RAS), positing that excessive wealth can cause emotional isolation and a reduction in empathy, generosity, and social connection. Citing psychological and neurological research, the piece highlights how economic inequality distances the wealthy from others, making them less likely to empathize with the poor.\n\nThe article draws from personal anecdotes, such as Ryan\u2019s experiences in India, alongside experimental studies like rigged Monopoly games. These illustrate how unfair advantages can breed entitlement and reduce compassion. Research is presented to show that the rich are less likely to read human emotions, give charitably, or behave ethically in small-scale social interactions. However, it also offers hope\u2014findings show that the wealthy can regain empathy through small interventions and value shifts.\n\nUltimately, the article argues that extreme inequality harms everyone, including the wealthy, by undermining community, increasing isolation, and contradicting our evolutionary predispositions toward altruism and fairness.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1569499200.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698009c548d88328a71845edb4d63963","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Evaluating DS's Hedonic Adaptation and Coordination Claims","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"bb996bfa-2eeb-444f-8117-eed6a261f7c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"26abd99c-32fa-4831-9ab1-5778b9fcbc22","turn_exchange_id":"bf9480d5-2098-43ed-83a4-2f53d446051c","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"26abd99c-32fa-4831-9ab1-5778b9fcbc22","children":["edfb8628-c3e5-4058-97d6-2064a5794c14"]},"edfb8628-c3e5-4058-97d6-2064a5794c14":{"id":"edfb8628-c3e5-4058-97d6-2064a5794c14","message":{"id":"edfb8628-c3e5-4058-97d6-2064a5794c14","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1769998976.226994,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Citing and critiquing power and corruption research","content":"I have sources like Piff et al.

That\u2019s a different layer again.\n\nBelow is a critique of *his* layers and *yours*, then a synthesis.\n\n---\n\n## 1) The psychology claim: hedonic adaptation is real, but it doesn\u2019t carry his conclusion\n\n**Hedonic adaptation (the \u201chedonic treadmill\u201d)** is a real phenomenon in well-being research: people partly adapt to gains/losses and return toward baseline. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue201  \nBut DS\u2019s use of it (\u201ctherefore billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d) is a leap.\n\n### Where his argument is strongest\nThere *is* evidence that **power and high status can shift behavior** in ways that increase self-focus, reduce perspective-taking, and loosen internal brakes\u2014*sometimes*. For example, classic work links power to reduced perspective-taking. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search11\ue201  \nAnd one well-known paper reported higher social class predicting more unethical behavior in several studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search2\ue201\n\nSo the *direction* of DS\u2019s intuition (\u201cinsulation from consequences is dangerous\u201d) is not crazy.\n\n### Where his argument is weakest\n1) **The income \u2194 well-being literature is not \u201cmoney stops mattering\u201d in a simple way.**  \n   The famous Kahneman\u2013Deaton result suggested emotional well-being rises with income but plateaus around a threshold. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search7\ue201  \n   Later work found experienced well-being continuing to rise with income for most people, and the \u201cflattening\u201d mainly showing up for the least happy subgroup. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search1\ue201  \n   So \u201chedonic adaptation\u201d doesn\u2019t straightforwardly imply \u201cextreme wealth makes you neurologically unfit.\u201d\n\n2) **Power effects are conditional, not a law of nature.**  \n   Reviews explicitly discuss *boundary conditions* (\u201cpower corrupts\u2026 or does it?\u201d depends on context, accountability, norms, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search2\ue201  \n   And there are replication attempts that fail to find some of the original field effects tying socioeconomic status (SES) to unethical behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn7search4\ue201  \n   Even more, a very large meta-analysis on social class and prosociality reports a *slight* tendency for higher class to be more prosocial on average (small effect, but opposite sign to the crude \u201crich = worse\u201d story). \ue200cite\ue202turn7search5\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** DS\u2019s psychology story can support a narrower claim like  \n> \u201cextreme power needs stronger accountability and norm constraints,\u201d  \nbut it doesn\u2019t cleanly support  \n> \u201cbillionaires should not exist.\u201d\n\nIf he wants a hard \u201cshould not exist,\u201d he needs a **political-economy** argument (capture, monopoly rents, democratic distortion), not just a **neuro** argument.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The coordination claim: \u201cwe won\u2019t need elites\u201d underestimates *capital, enforcement, and governance*\n\nEven if internet + AI make coordination cheaper, that doesn\u2019t automatically remove elites\u2014it often just **moves the choke points**.\n\n### Coordination is not the whole problem\nIn economic terms: firms (and hierarchies) exist largely to reduce **transaction costs**\u2014the costs of coordinating through pure markets/contracts. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \nInternet and AI can reduce some transaction costs, so DS is directionally right that *some* hierarchical layers become less necessary.\n\nBut \u201cmega-projects\u201d require more than coordination:\n- **capital formation** (who fronts resources / bears risk),\n- **property rights & enforcement** (what happens when parties defect),\n- **security** (sybil attacks, fraud, coercion),\n- **governance** (dispute resolution, upgrades, rule changes).\n\nThose are precisely the places where \u201celite-like\u201d power reappears.\n\n### Blockchain/DAO reality check\nEmpirically and structurally, many crypto systems show:\n- significant **wealth concentration** among holders, \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n- multiple layers of **centralization** (governance, operational choke points, exchanges, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue201\n\nSo \u201cblockchain eliminates elites\u201d has a repeated failure mode: **token-weighted governance tends toward plutocracy** (rule-by-the-wealthy), unless carefully designed otherwise.\n\n### Open collaboration still has \u201celites,\u201d just different ones\nOpen-source projects often aren\u2019t flat democracies; many use a \u201cbenevolent dictator\u201d (or small maintainer core) governance model to make decisions and resolve conflicts. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search14\ue202turn1search10\ue201  \nThat\u2019s not necessarily bad\u2014it\u2019s just evidence that **effective coordination tends to create leadership bottlenecks**.\n\n**Bottom line:** DS\u2019s \u201ccoordination tech removes elites\u201d is not impossible, but historically it\u2019s na\u00efve unless he specifies governance designs that prevent new elites from forming.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Now: your view is plausible\u2014but too deterministic in two places\n\nYou said (paraphrasing):  \n1) elites have the power and will to prevent changes that would remove them, and  \n2) tech tends to enrich the rich even more.\n\n### Where you\u2019re right\n- **Distribution isn\u2019t automatic.** Tech often increases inequality via **skill-biased technological change** (new tech raising returns to high-skill labor and complementary capital), at least for long stretches. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search21\ue201  \n- **Incumbents defend rents.** Regulatory capture, lobbying, and institutional inertia are standard.\n\n### Where you\u2019re overconfident\n1) **\u201cElites\u201d aren\u2019t a single coordinated player.**  \n   Elites compete. New tech often creates *challenger elites* who ally with parts of the public to break old monopolies. That\u2019s how many elite turnovers happen. So \u201cthey will prevent it\u201d is often false\u2014some elites will *fund the disruption* if it helps them beat other elites.\n\n2) **\u201cTech makes rich richer\u201d is not the same as \u201csocietal change is blocked.\u201d**  \n   Two things can be true at once:\n   - median living standards improve,\n   - inequality widens,\n   - and the identity of elites changes.  \n   Your framing implicitly assumes elite **persistence**, but history often looks like elite **rotation**.\n\nSo your view is strong as a warning (\u201cexpect capture\u201d), but weak as a prediction (\u201ctherefore no major redistribution or structural change can happen\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Synthesis: what actually determines whether \u201celites become unnecessary\u201d?\n\nThe most predictive lens isn\u2019t \u201ctech\u201d or \u201cneurology.\u201d It\u2019s **where the bottlenecks sit**.\n\n### If bottlenecks stay scarce and ownable \u2192 elites intensify\nIf frontier AI remains constrained by **compute, proprietary data, and specialized talent**, the system tends to concentrate. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search17\ue201  \nRecent mega-deals and infrastructure plays also point in that direction (huge capital commitments, deep integration with a few cloud/chip ecosystems). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news44\ue202turn1news45\ue201\n\n### If bottlenecks commoditize + governance is designed well \u2192 elites can shrink (but probably not vanish)\nIf:\n- strong open ecosystems spread capability,\n- compute becomes cheap/abundant,\n- and ownership structures broaden (co-ops, public options, broad equity participation),\nthen \u201cbillionaire density\u201d could drop.

Nvidia will contribute up to $10 billion and Microsoft up to $5 billion as part of the upcoming funding round, further aligning major players in AI infrastructure and model development. This agreement strengthens Anthropic's ability to compete with OpenAI, while also reducing the AI industry's reliance on a single dominant company. Microsoft will integrate Anthropic's Claude models into Azure and collaborate across development and market strategies, even while affirming OpenAI remains a key partner.\n\nAnthropic, which spun off from former OpenAI staff and is valued at $183 billion, is focusing on enterprise customers, reportedly serving over 300,000 businesses and aiming to triple revenue to $26 billion in 2026. The company will also partner with Nvidia on chip and infrastructure enhancements, including a commitment of up to 1 gigawatt of compute using Nvidia\u2019s advanced hardware. Despite the new Microsoft collaboration, Amazon will continue as Anthropic's primary cloud and training partner. Analysts view this consolidation as a sign of an increasingly concentrated AI landscape.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"OpenAI partners with Broadcom to produce its own AI chips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/798827/openai-broadcom-custom-ai-chips?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI has announced a strategic partnership with Broadcom to develop custom AI chips for its data centers. This marks a significant move to decrease reliance on Nvidia and secure the computing resources necessary to power applications like ChatGPT and Sora. The collaboration will enable OpenAI to create and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators\u2014an output equivalent to around ten nuclear reactors. These custom chips are expected to integrate insights from OpenAI\u2019s frontier model development, enhancing performance and intelligence capabilities.\n\nBroadcom is set to begin equipment deployments in the second half of 2026, with the project slated for completion by the end of 2029. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the initiative is crucial for building the infrastructure needed to realize AI\u2019s full potential. The announcement follows previous infrastructure deals OpenAI signed with AMD (six gigawatts) and Nvidia (ten gigawatts), made possible after modifying its exclusive computing agreement with Microsoft. This move reflects a broader industry trend in which major tech firms like Meta, Google, and Microsoft pursue custom chips to remedy AI chip shortages and reduce dependence on Nvidia, indirectly benefiting companies like Broadcom.","attribution":"The

Whether extreme wealth is fair. Whether it is deserved. Whether it motivates innovation. These questions dominate the debate, but they are secondary.\r\nThe more important question is structural and biological:\r\ncan a human brain remain cognitively reliable when it holds extreme, uncorrectable power?\r\nThe evidence from psychology, neuroscience, and systems theory suggests it cannot.\r\nHuman Cognition Depends on Feedback\r\nHuman decision making evolved in environments with tight feedback loops. Actions produced visible consequences. Social groups were small enough that mistakes were noticed and corrected quickly. Status and influence were limited by proximity, reputation, and direct accountability.\r\nModern neuroscience shows that the brain relies on these feedback loops to calibrate judgment. Reward prediction, risk assessment, and empathy all depend on experiencing the consequences of one\u2019s actions in a concrete and emotionally meaningful way.\r\nWhen feedback weakens, cognition degrades. This is not a moral claim. It is a functional one.\r\nExtreme Power Breaks Feedback Mechanisms\r\nExtreme wealth fundamentally alters the feedback environment of the individual who holds it.\r\nFinancial loss becomes abstract.\r\nLegal consequences become negotiable.\r\nSocial disapproval becomes filtered or monetized.\r\nDecisions that would normally carry risk or resistance instead pass through layers of insulation. Over time, this changes how the brain evaluates outcomes. Research on power consistently shows reduced empathy, increased overconfidence, and impaired error correction when individuals are shielded from consequences.\r\nThis is not about corruption or intent. It is about neural adaptation to an abnormal environment.\r\nWhen being wrong is cheap, the brain stops updating accurately.\r\nEscalation Is a Predictable Outcome\r\nAs feedback weakens, escalation becomes likely. Normal incentives lose their effect. The brain compensates by seeking larger signals: bigger projects, greater control, higher stakes.\r\nThis explains why extreme wealth often leads not to stability but to increasingly risky behavior. Large-scale market bets, political interventions, and social experiments become normalized because the personal cost of failure remains low while the perceived reward remains high.\r\nFrom the individual\u2019s perspective, this feels rational.\r\nFrom the system\u2019s perspective, it is dangerous.\r\nIndividual Cognitive Limits Become Systemic Risk\r\nThe core problem is not the behavior of any one billionaire. It is that individual cognitive limitations are allowed to scale without constraint.\r\nWhen a small number of people can influence markets, media narratives, political outcomes, or technological trajectories, their cognitive distortions propagate outward. Errors are no longer local. They become global.\r\nAt that point, society is no longer governed by distributed intelligence but by concentrated judgment under degraded feedback conditions.\r\nThis is a fragile design.\r\nBiological Systems Avoid This for a Reason\r\nIn biological systems, control is distributed. No single neuron directs the brain. No single cell controls an organism. Redundancy and decentralization are not ideological choices; they are survival strategies.\r\nCentralized control creates single points of failure. When those points fail, recovery is difficult or impossible.\r\nHuman social systems that allow extreme concentrations of power violate this principle.\r\nWhy This Structure Persisted Until Now\r\nHistorically, concentrated power existed because coordination was expensive. Information moved slowly. Trust did not scale. Large projects required centralized authority to align behavior.\r\nIn that context, elites were a functional compromise.\r\nThat constraint is disappearing.\r\nCoordination No Longer Requires Permanent Power\r\nDigital networks, cryptographic systems, and AI-assisted coordination are reducing the cost of collective action. Complex projects can now be decomposed, simulated, audited, and executed by distributed actors without permanent central control.\r\nAuthority can be limited in scope, duration, and reversibility.\r\nThis makes extreme, persistent concentrations of power unnecessary.\r\nThe Issue Is Risk, Not Fairness\r\nThis argument does not require moral judgment about wealth. It is a risk assessment.\r\nPower that cannot be corrected is unstable.\r\nInfluence that cannot be challenged is unsafe.\r\nNo human brain, regardless of intelligence or intention, remains reliable when insulated from meaningful feedback at large scale.\r\nA resilient society does not eliminate success.

This phenomenon explains why people often find that new achievements or possessions\u2014like a new job, car, or home\u2014only produce temporary increases in happiness. Over time, the emotional effects fade, and satisfaction levels reset. \n\nResearchers differentiate between fleeting \u201cpleasures\u201d (quick, sensory joy) and more lasting \u201cgratifications\u201d (activities that fully engage us). Gratifications and meaningful acts, such as altruism or creative hobbies, are shown to be less vulnerable to hedonic adaptation and can foster long-term happiness and well-being. The article also discusses varying research findings on how much control individuals have over their happiness, with genetics playing a significant role (estimates range from 32%\u201380% heritability), while lifestyle and activities account for the rest.\n\nTo counteract hedonic adaptation, individuals are encouraged to pursue meaning-driven and engaging pursuits, practice gratitude, and incorporate a mix of both pleasures and gratifications to maintain a stable and fulfilling sense of happiness.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47},"pub_date":1516128976.0,"attribution":"www.verywellmind.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698077dd32448327a116cf46c2ec2599","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for sources on hedonic adaptation and feedback loops","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"33c555d1-5e5e-465f-b06d-91f92b70ed48","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"a4e92313-ef47-47d9-9e79-2e239ca938e8","turn_exchange_id":"1bcaf67d-c9e6-4040-8969-f2ad7eacc92d","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a4e92313-ef47-47d9-9e79-2e239ca938e8","children":["cc876505-d2c8-455a-8d7c-b1e9bfa7cbfd"]},"cc876505-d2c8-455a-8d7c-b1e9bfa7cbfd":{"id":"cc876505-d2c8-455a-8d7c-b1e9bfa7cbfd","message":{"id":"cc876505-d2c8-455a-8d7c-b1e9bfa7cbfd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770026993.64155,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Organizing key sources and critique","content":"I\u2019ve got hedonic treadmill sources like the Diener 2006 paper, and Brickman & Campbell 1971.

This bias often stems from factors such as upbringing, lack of experience, personality traits like high core self-evaluations, or the Dunning-Kruger effect. While overconfidence can boost self-esteem and reduce anxiety, it frequently leads to risky or poor decisions in areas like employment, parenting, and personal goals.\n\nExamples include overestimating job qualifications, underestimating parenting challenges, or setting unrealistic health goals. Overconfidence is reinforced by other cognitive biases like hindsight and optimism bias, causing people to ignore failures and believe they will succeed without proper preparation. It can impact relationships, cause burnout at work, and even contribute to the spread of misinformation and belief in conspiracy theories.\n\nProfessionals in high-stakes fields like medicine are particularly vulnerable to its consequences. Managing overconfidence involves gaining real-world experience, setting realistic (SMART) goals, accepting feedback, and possibly engaging in therapy to cultivate accurate self-awareness. Ultimately, while confidence is valuable, unchecked overconfidence can hinder growth and lead to significant errors.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1727614800.0,"attribution":"www.verywellmind.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698077dd32448327a116cf46c2ec2599","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching power, overconfidence, and information distortion studies","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"33c555d1-5e5e-465f-b06d-91f92b70ed48","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"898ecda5-9b25-4e19-8239-476906572215","turn_exchange_id":"1bcaf67d-c9e6-4040-8969-f2ad7eacc92d","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"898ecda5-9b25-4e19-8239-476906572215","children":["30d3bb79-907e-44f0-b17b-4d4664db8bf9"]},"30d3bb79-907e-44f0-b17b-4d4664db8bf9":{"id":"30d3bb79-907e-44f0-b17b-4d4664db8bf9","message":{"id":"30d3bb79-907e-44f0-b17b-4d4664db8bf9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770027018.36221,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing user\u2019s argument and shaping response","content":"The user posted the VraserX argument, likely influenced by the DS perspective.

Humans can update from:\n- abstract metrics (profit/loss, polls),\n- simulations and forecasts,\n- institutional feedback (audits, courts, elections),\n- and expert critique.\n\nAnd we have direct evidence that **feedback improves calibration** in normal settings (e.g., performance feedback improves accuracy of self-estimates). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  \nSo the *right* claim is: feedback matters; *which* feedback and how strong it must be is context-dependent.\n\n---\n\n## 2) \u201cExtreme power breaks feedback mechanisms \u2192 cognition degrades\u201d \u2014 supported in direction, not in certainty\n\nThere\u2019s decent social-psych evidence that **power can impair social inference** and increase \u201cI\u2019m right\u201d behavior:\n\n- Reduced perspective-taking / emotion-reading accuracy under power primes has been shown in experiments. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \n- Power can increase **overconfident decision-making**, especially when objective power makes people *feel* powerful. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search4\ue201  \n- Power can reduce **advice taking** and increase confidence in one\u2019s initial judgment. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search16\ue201  \n- Hierarchies also distort *incoming* feedback: subordinates often filter/distort information upward to please superiors. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue201  \n\nThat cluster supports the *mechanism* VraserX wants: feedback integrity can degrade around powerful actors.\n\nBut the post goes too far in two ways:\n\n### (a) It claims inevitability (\u201ccannot remain reliable\u201d)\nThe empirical literature shows *tendencies*, not a law of nature. Effects vary with:\n- accountability structures,\n- norms,\n- selection (who gets power),\n- and the type of power (coercive vs responsibility-framed, etc.).\n\nThere\u2019s even work complicating the simple \u201cpower reduces empathy\u201d story: one neural study found high power didn\u2019t straightforwardly lower empathic responding the way the pop narrative suggests. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n### (b) It treats \u201cbillionaire\u201d as a clean proxy for \u201cuncorrectable power\u201d\nWealth **often converts into power**, but not one-to-one. Someone can be very rich yet constrained by:\n- competitive markets,\n- boards,\n- regulators,\n- reputation,\n- or genuine countervailing institutions.\n\nSo the real target is **unaccountable, high-impact power**, not \u201cwealth\u201d per se.\n\n---\n\n## 3) \u201cEscalation is predictable\u201d \u2014 plausible story, thinly evidenced as stated\n\nVraserX says insulation leads to escalating stakes: bigger bets, political meddling, etc. That\u2019s plausible (and matches a lot of anecdotes), but as written it\u2019s mostly narrative.\n\nWhat *is* better supported: power states can increase **risk-taking** in controlled studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search20\ue201  \nAnd the \u201capproach/inhibition theory of power\u201d predicts more approach behavior (action orientation, reward pursuit) under power. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\nStill: \u201ctherefore billionaires predictably escalate into systemic danger\u201d is an inference, not a demonstrated general law.\n\n---\n\n## 4) \u201cBiological systems avoid centralization\u201d \u2014 catchy analogy, not actually decisive\n\nBiology *does* use redundancy and decentralization, but it also uses **centralized control** (brains, nervous systems, endocrine signaling). The existence of distributed control in biology doesn\u2019t prove \u201csociety should never allow concentrated control.\u201d\n\nThe useful takeaway isn\u2019t \u201cbiology forbids it,\u201d but:\n\n> Systems with huge blast radius need **redundancy, contestability, and fast error correction**.\n\nThat\u2019s an engineering principle more than a biology argument.\n\n---\n\n## 5) \u201cCoordination no longer requires permanent power\u201d \u2014 this is the weakest link\n\nEven if the internet + cryptography + artificial intelligence reduce coordination costs, mega-projects still require:\n- capital formation,\n- enforcement (what happens when parties defect),\n- security against manipulation,\n- and governance.\n\nDistributed systems don\u2019t magically eliminate elites; they often **recreate them** at new choke points (compute, platforms, governance tokens, infrastructure). The post asserts the constraint is \u201cdisappearing\u201d without grappling with those bottlenecks.\n\nSo if the claim is \u201celites become unnecessary,\u201d you\u2019d want to see:\n- concrete institutional designs that prevent plutocratic drift,\n- and evidence they work at scale under adversarial pressure.\n\nRight now, that\u2019s aspirational.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Critique of *your* stance (from your earlier reaction)\n\nYour view: \u201cNo way elites let themselves be removed; tech makes the rich richer.\u201d\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing correctly:\n- incumbents resist threats,\n- returns to capital + network effects often concentrate gains,\n- and the political system can be captured.\n\nWhere I\u2019d push back:\n1) **Elites aren\u2019t a monolith.** Elite-vs-elite competition is a big driver of change. Some elites finance disruptions that destroy *other* elites.  \n2) **\u201cRich get richer\u201d doesn\u2019t imply \u201cno structural change.\u201d** You can have rising inequality *and* major institutional change (including elite rotation).  \n3) Your view underweights **institution design**: accountability, antitrust, transparency, and competition policy can materially change outcomes even if nobody gets \u201cremoved.\u201d\n\nSo: your skepticism is a good prior, but \u201cno way\u201d is too absolute.\n\n---\n\n## A better synthesis frame: \u201cfeedback integrity\u201d and \u201ccontestable power\u201d\n\nBoth you and VraserX are circling the same core variable:\n\n**How easy is it for high-impact decision-makers to be wrong\u2026 and stay wrong?**\n\nA more precise version of the argument would be:\n\n- Concentrated influence is dangerous **when feedback is weak, delayed, filtered, or unenforceable**.  \n- The solution space is not only \u201cban billionaires,\u201d but \u201cmaximize feedback integrity\u201d:\n  - transparency (so errors are visible),\n  - accountability (so errors have teeth),\n  - contestability (so challengers can correct),\n  - and reversibility (so failures aren\u2019t irreversible).\n\nThat framing also explains your concern: elites fight reforms **because reforms restore feedback and reduce their insulation**.\n\n---\n\n## If we were to stress-test VraserX\u2019s thesis, the key question is this\n\n**Is the problem mainly \u201cthe brain can\u2019t handle it,\u201d or mainly \u201cthe system stops correcting it\u201d?**\n\n- If it\u2019s \u201cbrain can\u2019t handle it,\u201d then even benevolent elites are inherently unsafe \u2192 you favor hard caps.  \n- If it\u2019s \u201csystem stops correcting it,\u201d then the priority is designing institutions that *force correction* (and \u201cbillionaire\u201d is just one common route to insulation).\n\nThe evidence you can cite strongly supports *systemic feedback degradation around power*. It does **not** justify the confident biological claim that \u201cno human brain remains cognitively reliable\u201d under extreme wealth/power.\n\nIf you want, pick one concrete arena (media influence, political donations, corporate control, frontier AI labs). We can map the feedback loops, identify where correction fails, and ask: \u201cWould a wealth cap fix this, or would it just move the choke point?\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200entity\ue202[\"people\",\"VraserX\",\"x user\"]\ue201","start_idx":4,"end_idx":42,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"VraserX","prompt_text":"VraserX","type":"entity","name":"VraserX","category":"people","priority":1,"metadata":null,"entity_data":null,"extra_params":{"disambiguation":"x user"},"status":"done"},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search9\ue201","start_idx":932,"end_idx":964,"safe_urls":["https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3176615/","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3176615/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27069377/","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27069377/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27069377/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Dopamine reward prediction error coding","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27069377/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by W Schultz \u00b7 2016 \u00b7 Cited by 903 \u2014 Reward prediction errors consist of the differences between received and predicted rewards.
