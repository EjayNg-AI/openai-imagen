This makes it ideal for applications requiring exposure to high temperatures.\n  \n- **Low Thermal Expansion**: It has one of the lowest thermal expansion rates among industrial materials, which means it experiences minimal size change when exposed to temperature variations. This property is crucial for applications where dimensional stability across temperature changes is necessary.\n\n- **Excellent Chemical Resistance**: Fused quartz is highly resistant to most acids and bases, making it suitable for storing very concentrated acidic or alkaline solutions. It is notably resistant to water and acids, except for hydrofluoric acid (HF) and phosphoric acid at temperatures above 300\u00b0C, where its rate of dissolution increases.\n\n- **Optical Clarity**: In its pure form, fused quartz is transparent from the ultraviolet to the infrared spectrum, which is beneficial for applications requiring ultraviolet transparency or insulation while observing processes at high temperatures.\n\n- **Electrical Insulation**: It also provides excellent electrical insulation properties, making it useful in electronic applications where high-temperature resistance is coupled with the need for electrical isolation.\n\nGiven these properties, fused quartz is extensively used in high-temperature applications such as semiconductor and solar industries for wafer processing, in laboratory equipment that requires high thermal resistance and chemical inertness, in the production of specialty glassware, and in optical applications where its broad transparency range is essential.\n\nIts resistance to chemical corrosion, combined with its ability to endure high temperatures, makes fused quartz an excellent choice for containers and apparatus in both research and industrial applications dealing with aggressive chemical reagents or extreme processing conditions."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4","default_model_slug":"gpt-4","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2bba8-643a-4193-b9c6-6759dbb36c19","request_id":"867653b0eedd3f5e-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2bba8-643a-4193-b9c6-6759dbb36c19","children":[]}}}
