Under your mathematical definition, the altitude \\(h_P\\) at which curvature becomes \u201cdiscernible\u201d is a tiny fraction of the planet\u2019s radius, and being in orbit has nothing to do with altitude alone\u2014it requires enormous *horizontal speed*. At \\(h_P\\), an aircraft can fly aerodynamically and you will feel (almost) full weight; you will not \u201cmost likely enter orbit.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 1) Geometry: what is \\(h_P\\)?\n\nLet the planet have radius \\(R\\). Put the observer at radius \\(r=R+h\\). In the 2\u2011D cross\u2011section through the observer and the center, the line of sight to the horizon is tangent to the sphere at some point. The angle between:\n\n- the **local horizontal** (tangent at the point directly below), and  \n- the **line of sight to the horizon** (tangent from the eyes)\n\nis the horizon **dip angle**\n\\[\n\\Delta \\;=\\; \\arctan\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{r^2-R^2}}{R}\\right).\n\\]\n\nYour criterion is \\(\\Delta \\ge 0.01\\ \\text{rad}\\). Solving \\(\\Delta=0.01\\) gives\n\\[\n\\sqrt{r^2-R^2}=R\\tan(0.01) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad r=\\frac{R}{\\cos(0.01)} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\n\\boxed{\\,h_P=R\\!\\left(\\sec(0.01)-1\\right)\\approx \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}R\\,}\n\\]\nwith \\(\\theta=0.01\\). Numerically,\n\\[\n\\sec(0.01)-1 \\approx 5.0002\\times 10^{-5},\n\\]\nso\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,h_P \\approx 5.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,R.}\n\\]\n\n**Examples**\n- Moon (\\(R\\!\\approx\\!1{,}737\\) km): \\(h_P\\!\\approx\\!87\\) m  \n- Earth (\\(R\\!\\approx\\!6{,}371\\) km): \\(h_P\\!\\approx\\!319\\) m  \n- Jupiter (\\(R\\!\\approx\\!71{,}492\\) km): \\(h_P\\!\\approx\\!3.6\\) km\n\nSo by your metric, the needed height is modest: a few **hundred meters** on Earth, a few **kilometers** on Jupiter\u2014well within an atmosphere if one exists.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Dynamics: orbit versus \u201cfeeling gravity\u201d\n\n- **Orbit requires speed, not height.** The circular orbital speed at radius \\(r\\) is\n  \\[\n  v_{\\text{orb}}(r)=\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}.\n  \\]\n  At \\(h=h_P\\), \\(r=R/\\cos(0.01)\\), so \\(v_{\\text{orb}}(h_P)=\\sqrt{(GM/R)\\cos(0.01)}\\), essentially the same as near the surface.\n\n  On Earth this is \\(\\sim 7.9\\ \\text{km/s}\\). Airplanes fly at \\(0.2\\!-\\!1.0\\ \\text{km/s}\\), orders of magnitude too slow to be anywhere near orbit.\n\n- **What do you feel inside the aircraft?** In straight-and-level flight at speed \\(v\\) along a circle of radius \\(r\\), the lift per unit mass is\n  \\[\n  \\frac{L}{m}=g(r)-\\frac{v^2}{r}.\n  \\]\n  Your *felt* acceleration (proper acceleration) is \\(L/m\\). As a fraction of local gravity,\n  \\[\n  \\frac{L}{mg(r)}=1-\\left(\\frac{v}{v_{\\text{orb}}(r)}\\right)^2.\n  \\]\n  For a typical airliner (\\(v\\!\\approx\\!250\\ \\text{m/s}\\)) at \\(h_P\\) on Earth,\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{v}{v_{\\text{orb}}}\\right)^2 \\sim \\left(\\frac{0.25}{7.9}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.001 \\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\text{you feel } \\approx 0.999\\,g.\n  \\]\n  In other words, **you very much feel gravity**. Only as \\(v\\to v_{\\text{orb}}\\) does \\(L\\to 0\\) and you go weightless (free fall).\n\n- **Gravity strength at \\(h_P\\).** Since \\(h_P/R\\sim 5\\times 10^{-5}\\), the gravitational acceleration changes by \\(\\approx 2h_P/R \\sim 10^{-4}\\) (about **0.01%**). Gravity at \\(h_P\\) is essentially the same as on the ground.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Evaluating Alice vs. Bob\n\n- **Bob\u2019s claim** (\u201cat height \\(h_P\\) you\u2019d most likely enter orbit\u201d) is **wrong**. Orbit depends on having the required *horizontal velocity*. Altitude by itself does not put you in orbit, and \\(h_P\\) (by your definition) is a very low altitude on any plausible planet.\n\n- **Alice\u2019s first claim** (\u201cyou can fly at \\(h_P\\) and still feel gravity\u201d) is **correct**. At \\(h_P\\) the aircraft can easily fly on aerodynamic lift (if there\u2019s air), and occupants feel nearly 1 g.\n\n- **Alice\u2019s follow\u2011up (\u201cchoose a very large planet\u201d)** is **unnecessary and slightly misleading**. You don\u2019t need a large planet; even on Earth \\(h_P\\) is only \\(\\sim\\)300 m. Moreover, for similar composition/temperature, *larger* radius tends to increase surface gravity and orbital speed, making accidental orbit even **less** likely. (Practical caveat below.)\n\n**Verdict:** **Alice is more correct.** Bob confuses altitude with the orbital\u2011speed condition.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Practical caveats (do they change the conclusion? No.)\n\n1. **Atmospheric scale height.** If you keep temperature/composition similar, as \\(R\\) grows the scale height \\(H\\propto 1/g\\) shrinks, while \\(h_P\\propto R\\). For extremely large \\(R\\), \\(h_P/H\\) can become many scale heights\u2014i.e., the air could be very thin at \\(h_P\\). Then an \u201cairplane\u201d might not fly there. But even then, you still wouldn\u2019t be \u201cmost likely in orbit\u201d; you\u2019d simply **fall** unless you had rocket thrust *or* the orbital speed.\n\n2. **Planetary rotation.** Fast rotation slightly lowers the ground-relative orbital speed at the equator by the surface rotational speed (\\(\\le\\!0.5\\ \\text{km/s}\\) on Earth), still far from \\(v_{\\text{orb}}\\).\n\n3. **Different \u2018visibility\u2019 thresholds.** If you demanded a *much* bigger dip angle (say, clearly curved horizon across a wide field of view), you might need tens of kilometers of altitude. This doesn\u2019t change the physics: you still need \\(\\sim\\)orbital speed to be weightless.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Takeaways\n\n- Your geometric threshold implies \\( \\boxed{h_P \\approx 5\\times10^{-5}R} \\), e.g., **~319 m on Earth**.  \n- At \\(h_P\\), **gravity is essentially unchanged** and **orbit is nowhere in sight** unless you\u2019re traveling near orbital speed.  \n- **Alice\u2019s core point stands**; **Bob\u2019s is incorrect** as stated. The only realistic limit is **aerodynamics** (is there enough atmosphere to fly?), not an automatic slide into orbit."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"wfr_0199683d76b97c268975f8bbdd946071","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","parent_id":"1ff687fe-cf5c-40d8-8490-f864957ea902","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"1ff687fe-cf5c-40d8-8490-f864957ea902","children":["176380b5-e501-4c25-922c-71c7ee6ac51a"]},"176380b5-e501-4c25-922c-71c7ee6ac51a":{"id":"176380b5-e501-4c25-922c-71c7ee6ac51a","message":{"id":"176380b5-e501-4c25-922c-71c7ee6ac51a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758410630.208,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How would the numbers stack up if we used 0.1 radians as the treshold of visible curvature?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"982512a808fbf543-MAA","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e2bb9e9d-330f-4a3a-8804-5423156a29a4","children":["838272c3-bbbf-46ee-a08a-5629ded07092"]},"838272c3-bbbf-46ee-a08a-5629ded07092":{"id":"838272c3-bbbf-46ee-a08a-5629ded07092","message":{"id":"838272c3-bbbf-46ee-a08a-5629ded07092","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1758410634.002577,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Revisiting horizon dip angle derivation, ensuring geometric accuracy.
