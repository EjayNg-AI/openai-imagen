That\u2019s published, not hand-waving. But practically, you won\u2019t see an edge until there are fault-tolerant machines. Recent resource estimates for derivative pricing still want thousands of logical qubits and ~10\u2079 T-gates\u2014well beyond today\u2019s hardware\u2014so near-term \u201cproduction\u201d wins are hype. Roadmaps (e.g., IBM\u2019s) now talk about fault-tolerant systems late this decade, but until then, results are mainly prototypes and benchmarks. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn3search13\ue202turn0search13\ue201\n\n2) \u201cQuantum-like\u201d probability & decision models.  \nHere \u201cquantum\u201d means Hilbert-space probability (interference, contextuality) for human judgment, not particles. It has credible empirical wins in cognitive science and can illuminate order effects, preference reversals, etc., so it\u2019s a legitimate behavioral-finance modeling option. What it is not (so far): a reliable source of alpha or a superior asset-pricing theory. Use it, if at all, to model investor choice under context effects, not to forecast returns. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search6\ue202turn0search9\ue201\n\n3) Quantum field theory (QFT)\u2013style finance/economics.  \nThis is the \u201cpath integrals, fields on the forward-rate curve\u201d line of work (Baaquie and others). It\u2019s mathematically coherent and has shown some empirical fit advantages over vanilla HJM for specific datasets (e.g., Eurodollar forward-rate correlations), plus concrete pricing formulas for bond options. But uptake in the industry and macro-economics is niche; you\u2019re trading one sophisticated stochastic framework for another, not discovering hidden quantum phenomena in markets. Treat it as an alternative modeling technology, not a revolution. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search24\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\nBottom line by use-case\n- If you run a desk today: prioritize classical HPC/GPU Monte Carlo, variance reduction, adjoint methods, proxy/XVA tech. Keep QC on the radar for risk engines with massive scenario sets; the first real wins (if roadmaps hold) are likeliest in the late-2020s/early-2030s when fault tolerance arrives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- If you\u2019re a behavioral/experimental finance researcher: Hilbert-space models are worth exploring to capture context and sequence effects in choices; judge them by out-of-sample predictive accuracy, not metaphors. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue201  \n- If you\u2019re a rates/modeling theorist: QFT-inspired forward-curve dynamics are defensible and occasionally empirically sharper than standard factor HJM, but they remain a specialist tool; insist on head-to-head calibration/forecast comparisons and robust error analysis. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201\n\nWhat\u2019s hype to ignore vs. substance to track\n- Hype: claims of current trading outperformance \u201cbecause quantum,\u201d or \u201cquantum Black-Scholes\u201d that quietly collapses back to a classical PDE with no measurable market effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- Substance (future-leaning): concrete QC resource analyses narrowing the gap to practicality; methods that reduce state-preparation cost and total T-count; careful, falsifiable empirical studies where QFT-style rates models beat HJM on out-of-sample correlation structures. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search13\ue202turn3search17\ue202turn1search24\ue201\n\nIf you want a focused reading sampler (no fluff):  \nStamatopoulos et al., \u201cOption Pricing using Quantum Computers\u201d (quadratic speedup, but idealized); and their 2024 \u201cDerivative Pricing using Quantum Signal Processing\u201d (explicit resource counts). Busemeyer & Bruza, *Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision* (solid primer on quantum probability for behavior). Baaquie\u2019s *Quantum Finance* plus the 2001/2004 forward-rate papers for the field-theory approach; Coz (2024) for a modern revisit of the \u201celastic string\u201d interpretation. Together these show the real kernels\u2014and the current limits. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search13\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search24\ue201\n\nNet verdict: actual substance exists in all three strands\u2014but today, only the behavioral/decision-theory angle is practically deployable; the field-theory rates work is specialized and occasionally useful; and the quantum-computing edge is contingent on fault-tolerant hardware that the ecosystem is still building.
