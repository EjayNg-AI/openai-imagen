These companies must showcase expertise across key areas like AI infrastructure, cloud platforms, software for orchestration, and others. I also need to ensure their management is forward-thinking, capable, and ethical. I'll focus on assessing companies with these qualities in mind.\n\n**Selecting companies for enterprise AI agent engineering**\n\nI want to focus on companies like Microsoft, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Palantir, and possibly Workday or UiPath, since they appear to be integrating AI agents into their platforms. I need to ensure they\u2019re publicly traded and have solid management with a clear track record of integrity and vision. I\u2019ll look for companies with AI agent infrastructure and oversee recent developments like product releases or leadership changes.\n\n**Narrowing down for enterprise AI agent engineering**\n\nIt seems that UiPath could fit in, as it is integrating agentic automation, and it's publicly traded. Also looking into companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler for their role in security and identity services, which are important for AI agents. I\u2019ll keep in mind the focus on companies that are positioning themselves in the AI agent discipline, while making sure management integrity is assessed. I want to keep the list small, no more than 7 companies.\n\n**Defining and selecting enterprise AI agent engineering companies**\n\nFor enterprise AI agent engineering, I need to consider companies across several stacks: compute hardware (Nvidia, AMD), cloud platforms, workflow automation, data platforms, and consulting. I'll evaluate companies on management integrity, using criteria like governance, strategic consistency, and transparency, but without making any unsupported claims. The goal is a small, diversified group with strong management track records.\n\n**Gathering up-to-date information on AI agents and management integrity**\n\nI\u2019ll gather recent details on AI agent offerings from companies like ServiceNow, Salesforce, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. I must also look into their management integrity by checking sources like CEO letters, SEC filings, and corporate governance metrics. I\u2019ll search within the past 180 days to ensure the data is still relevant. Multiple queries will help me cover all the bases.\n\n**Searching for additional information on AI agents and platforms**\n\nI've gathered info on ServiceNow, Salesforce, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's AI agent offerings. Now, I'll search for more from Palantir, IBM, Accenture, UiPath, and data platforms like Snowflake and Databricks. These should help round out the search for relevant AI insights. Let\u2019s get started on those searches.\n\n**Selecting core companies to focus on**\n\nI\u2019ve found sources for Palantir\u2019s AIP, but I need third-party validation from reliable outlets like Reuters. Similar for IBM\u2019s AI shift under Arvind Krishna. I should ensure I have credible data on their agent capabilities and governance. The user wants a smaller group, so I\u2019ll focus on 6 to 7 companies like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and others.\n\n**Evaluating management integrity and final group selection**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing it down to 6 or 7 companies: ServiceNow, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Salesforce, Palantir, and Accenture. Including UiPath and IBM adds value in different areas, but management integrity is key. I\u2019ll focus on companies with strong governance reputations, like Microsoft and NVIDIA, though Palantir raises concerns. I\u2019ll need strong evidence for integrity, maybe use governance metrics or external recognition.\n\n**Focusing on key companies with strong AI capabilities**\n\nI\u2019m considering companies like Microsoft, which has Azure AI and Copilot Studio, and provides strong enterprise integration. Palantir\u2019s inclusion might be questionable for some, and while UiPath has potential, there\u2019s more risk. It\u2019s important to focus on companies offering scalable agent-building platforms, like Microsoft.\n\n**Considering key players in enterprise AI with management integrity**\n\nI\u2019m looking at companies like ServiceNow, Salesforce, NVIDIA, Accenture, and IBM for their leadership in AI and enterprise integration. ServiceNow and Salesforce excel in orchestration and trust, while NVIDIA\u2019s hardware and long-standing management give it an edge. I\u2019d need strong evidence for each company\u2019s leadership integrity.\n\n**Evaluating companies for AI leadership with management integrity**\n\nTo create a shortlist, we consider Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, NVIDIA, Accenture, and UiPath. Each company\u2019s management integrity needs to be evaluated with evidence like shareholder letters, product announcements, and recognition in lists like Ethisphere\u2019s \"Most Ethical Companies.\" We should focus on transparent, substantiated evidence rather than relying on marketing lists.\n\n**Evaluating integrity and leadership for AI-focused companies**\n\nTo assess company integrity, we\u2019ll gather sources like press articles and quarterly reports. For Microsoft, we can highlight Satya Nadella's approach to responsible AI and ethical governance. ServiceNow and Salesforce sources can show their commitment to AI, with a focus on CEO leadership. We\u2019ll look for signs of ethical governance and transparency.\n\n**Assessing management and integrity of companies**\n\nTo review management strength and integrity, I\u2019ll gather sources on leadership and strategic direction, such as CEO rankings and documented investments in AI. I\u2019ll look for public recognition, like ethical business awards and long-term strategy, and will address any potential controversies. This will offer a well-rounded view.\n\n**Considering sources for Microsoft ethics**\n\nWe have evidence of Accenture's long-standing recognition from Ethisphere, but for Microsoft, I\u2019m cautious about using their past Ethisphere rankings, as they might be outdated. Instead, I'll lean on more recent measures like the \"Responsible AI Standard\" and Microsoft's strong ESG ranking to show their ethical commitment.\n\n**Gathering references for Microsoft\u2019s responsible AI and leadership**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on Microsoft\u2019s documented \u201cResponsible AI Standard\u201d and their governance networks like the Aether committee to show their forward-thinking and ethical approach. To showcase executive integrity, I\u2019ll highlight CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s long tenure and transformational leadership, supported by credible sources like Reuters or official press releases.\n\n**Considering sources for integrity and ethical recognition**\n\nI\u2019m finding it tricky to evaluate Microsoft\u2019s integrity through external lists like Ethisphere. To avoid uncertainty, I might focus on companies with explicit ethical recognition, like Accenture, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. For Microsoft, we can emphasize their leadership and responsible AI principles, though it\u2019s less concrete than third-party lists.\n\n**Approaching management integrity with objective indicators**\n\nTo assess management integrity, I can focus on positive indicators like unqualified audit opinions, no major enforcement actions, and consistent governance frameworks. While verifying the absence of scandals is tricky, I can emphasize companies' commitment to responsible AI, ethics, and trust-building rather than just looking for red flags.\n\n**Finalizing the shortlist of leading companies and their positions**\n\nFor the shortlist, we\u2019re considering companies that align with the AI agent trend and have clear pathways to monetize it. The focus is on platforms and infrastructure that are actively shaping the space: \n\n1. Microsoft \u2013 Copilot Studio, Azure AI  \n2. ServiceNow \u2013 AI Agent Orchestrator  \n3. Salesforce \u2013 Agentforce, Data Cloud, Slack  \n4. Nvidia \u2013 Hardware, AI Enterprise  \n5. Accenture \u2013 System integration, large AI training staff  \n6. UiPath \u2013 RPA and AI agents\n\nThere\u2019s honesty about limitations in verifying integrity, but we can provide evidence.\n\n**Finalizing the shortlist based on AI agent engineering potential**\n\nI think the final shortlist should focus on companies enabling enterprise AI agent engineering, especially platforms with direct roles in multi-agent orchestration. We\u2019ll select:\n\n1. Microsoft (Copilot Studio)\n2. ServiceNow (AI Agent Orchestrator)\n3. Salesforce (Agentforce)\n4. IBM (watsonx Orchestrate)\n5. UiPath (Agentic Automation)\n\nThen, add Nvidia for hardware, and Accenture for integration services, yielding 7 companies. I\u2019ll avoid Palantir due to management integrity concerns.\n\n**Summarizing Microsoft management integrity**\n\nFor Microsoft, Satya Nadella is seen as a visionary leader with a strong track record in cloud and AI. His commitment to responsible AI and strong corporate culture points to management integrity. We can reference Microsoft\u2019s \"Responsible AI Standard\" and other governance measures, along with third-party sources like \"The Economist.\"\n\n**Exploring Nvidia's management integrity**\n\nFor Nvidia, I can gather sources about Jensen Huang's leadership and vision for AI agents, perhaps focusing on his business ethics and the company's capabilities in AI Enterprise. I'll also check their recognition, like \"Fortune World's Most Admired Companies\" and \"TIME 100 most influential companies.\"\n\n**Organizing management integrity and vision sources**\n\nI have Nvidia sources, including documents on NIM Agent Blueprints and their Code of Conduct. For Accenture, I can emphasize their AI training partnerships and recognition on the Ethisphere list. For ServiceNow, their CEO\u2019s vision for AI agents and acquisitions are key. Salesforce can highlight Benioff\u2019s quotes and partnerships.\n\n**Clarifying management integrity sources**\n\nFor Microsoft, I can reference their placement in *Fortune's* Most Admired, leadership mentions from Korn Ferry, and responsible AI principles with governance structures like Aether and the Office of Responsible AI. For IBM, I'll check if they're on the Ethisphere list. For UiPath, I should investigate their agentic automation platform.\n\n**Narrowing down management and eligibility for agents**\n\nFor UiPath, I\u2019m questioning if their management integrity is strong enough to include. I\u2019m considering other candidates like Adobe and Workday, though Adobe\u2019s focus seems less aligned with enterprise AI agent engineering. I also wonder if companies like Amazon or Oracle should be considered for hardware and software skills.\n\n**Considering potential companies for inclusion**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it makes sense to include integrators like Accenture, infrastructure players like Nvidia, and cloud providers like Microsoft or AWS. A platform such as ServiceNow could fit too. Snowflake is a possibility for data but has a recent change in leadership, which might require a closer look.\n\n**Considering management integrity and risk factors**\n\nI'm weighing the inclusion of companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. They have different levels of ethical recognition, with some having strong governance frameworks and recognized leadership. I could highlight their clean track record and leadership qualities, but I need to ensure there are no major controversies.\n\n**Outlining approach and criteria for selecting companies**\n\nI\u2019m considering an approach where we provide a \"Integrity bar\" with clear criteria like ethical recognition, financial transparency, CEO tenure, and more. I\u2019ll break this down into a shortlist and support each company with evidence of competence, integrity, and relevance to AI agent engineering, backed by credible sources.\n\n**Finalizing company shortlist and integrity justification**\n\nI have a shortlist of 7 companies: Microsoft, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Accenture, IBM, and UiPath. For most, we can highlight Ethisphere recognition for ethics. For Microsoft and Nvidia, we can point to their code of conduct and leadership ratings, with the focus on strong governance and visible compliance.\n\n**Assessing integrity for Nvidia and Microsoft**\n\nFor Nvidia and Microsoft, we can highlight their ranking in the Fortune Most Admired list and their responsible AI and code-of-conduct frameworks. We can check for the 2026 list as a backup, using Korn Ferry's press release and possibly Ethisphere recognition, though the 2024 listing might be sufficient.\n\n**Highlighting integrity with Microsoft and Nvidia**\n\nFor Microsoft, I\u2019m leaning toward emphasizing its responsible AI and corporate governance rather than Ethisphere recognition, since older data like from 2018 isn\u2019t as relevant. The Korn Ferry press release about Microsoft and Nvidia being top five on Fortune's Most Admired list shows solid leadership and social responsibility. I'll make sure to cite that.\n\n**Citing the Korn Ferry press release and verifying data**\n\nThe Korn Ferry press release gives insight into the attributes used for the Fortune \"Most Admired\" list, but doesn't mention social responsibility directly. I can refer to this recognized source and consider verifying the methodology by checking Fortune's website. For Nvidia and Microsoft, I can showcase their solid corporate governance through their Code of Conduct and responsible AI governance.\n\n**Crafting a response with disclaimers and clarifying terms**\n\nI need to craft a response that provides a selective shortlist of companies poised for growth, including midsize companies like UiPath, while being cautious about offering investment advice. I\u2019ll include a disclaimer that it\u2019s not financial advice and advise the user on due diligence. I'll define abbreviations upfront, like MNC (multinational corporation) and SME (small and medium-sized enterprises), as requested.\n\n**Creating concise response with disclaimers and definitions**\n\nI'll define terms like LLM (large language model), RPA (robotic process automation), and ITSM (IT service management) as I use them, but aim to keep the response concise. I\u2019ll avoid tables but might use bullet points. I'll add disclaimers about non-financial advice. Plus, I\u2019ll spice up the response with UI elements if applicable, like a navlist for relevant AI news.\n\n**Analyzing companies positioning in AI agent space**\n\nI\u2019ll put together a list of AI agents companies, highlighting why they would succeed if the field takes off, their monetization strategies, and management integrity. I\u2019ll critique using sources and be sure to mention key factors like platform lock-in, compute, and governance. I\u2019ll include a navlist of key enterprise AI news but won\u2019t overdo it!\n\n**Designing a shortlist and evaluation approach for AI companies**\n\nI\u2019ll create a shortlist of companies likely benefiting from enterprise AI agent engineering. I'll justify each including management competencies, vision, integrity, and risks. We\u2019ll measure management by their track record, financials, acquisitions, and product releases. For vision, I\u2019ll focus on early AI investments, open protocols, governance, and connectors. I'll mention risks in regulation, competition, and valuation.\n\n**Gathering sources for AI agent platforms and company insights**\n\nI need to gather more details on platforms like ServiceNow AI Agent Orchestrator, Salesforce Agentforce, and others. For each company, I\u2019ll pull relevant sources like product pages, press releases, and recognitions. I will also mention their partnerships and governance documentation while ensuring not to mention stock exchanges directly.\n\n**Compiling company sources and considering risks**\n\nI\u2019m gathering additional sources that explain each company\u2019s AI capabilities, like ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Nvidia. I also need to consider Accenture\u2019s AI partnerships and IBM\u2019s oversight features. For smaller companies like UiPath, I\u2019ll evaluate integrity and management changes, noting any risks for user insight.\n\n**Finalizing shortlist of companies and justification**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the shortlist to 6 core companies\u2014Microsoft, Nvidia, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Accenture, and IBM\u2014with UiPath as an optional smaller cap. I\u2019ll justify their inclusion based on management integrity, Ethisphere recognition, and governance. We can mention open-source frameworks but note their integration limitations.\n\n**Crafting detailed response while maintaining clarity**\n\nSince the user is well-versed in mathematics, AI, and coding, I\u2019ll provide a technical explanation without overloading them. I'll emphasize key concepts like agent runtime, tool calling, governance, and observability. I'll gather relevant sources, include disclaimers, and define enterprise AI agent engineering clearly, focusing on those poised to benefit from the rise of agentic AI.\n\n**Evaluating monetization paths and integrity for each company**\n\nI'll clarify how each company monetizes AI: Microsoft with Azure and 365, ServiceNow via platform subscriptions, Salesforce with Agentforce and CRM, Nvidia with GPUs, Accenture with consulting, and IBM with Watsonx. We must also evaluate integrity by reviewing ethical recognitions, responsible AI governance, and potential controversies like SEC investigations. I'll check for any red flags.\n\n**Addressing potential integrity concerns for Nvidia and Accenture**\n\nI found some red flags related to integrity. Nvidia faces a securities fraud lawsuit over its crypto exposure, with the Supreme Court dismissing its appeal. As for Accenture, there's a DoJ investigation into its Federal Services unit and allegations of misleading federal submissions. Should include this info for the user\u2019s integrity evaluation.\n\n**Considering integrity concerns for Accenture and other companies**\n\nAccenture has some integrity concerns, including a DoJ investigation into a former employee's actions. While class action lawsuits exist, those may not be credible. We\u2019ll cite the relevant DoJ article, but given the investigation, we might reconsider including Accenture. Microsoft, ServiceNow, and Salesforce don\u2019t seem to have major integrity issues at the moment.\n\n**Evaluating company integrity for user\u2019s needs**\n\nThe user emphasized the importance of management integrity, making it clear that major investigations or lawsuits can't be ignored. For companies like Accenture (DoJ investigation) and Nvidia (securities fraud suit), we need to disclose these issues while being transparent. We should highlight potential red flags and emphasize the user\u2019s due diligence. But some minor issues might still be acceptable if paired with strong ethics and external recognition.\n\n**Considering alternatives to Accenture based on integrity concerns**\n\nIf management integrity is critical, I could consider replacing Accenture with other companies like Cognizant, EPAM, or Booz Allen Hamilton. While these might align better with integrity, they could lack key integration or government consulting capabilities. I\u2019ll focus on product companies if system integration isn\u2019t essential for the user\u2019s needs.\n\n**Weighing Accenture and Nvidia integrity concerns**\n\nAccenture's ethics are strong, evidenced by its Ethisphere recognition. Despite the DoJ investigation and employee misconduct allegations, their cooperation suggests a potentially isolated issue. I could still include Accenture, noting the compliance risks but highlighting their ethical recognition. Nvidia's lawsuit involves allegations but shouldn\u2019t imply management\u2019s guilt\u2014I\u2019ll mention both but with disclaimers.\n\n**Defining AI terms and management quality analysis**\n\nI'll summarize what the companies sell to enterprise agent builders, their role in multi-agent orchestration, and evidence of management quality. I'll include track records, financial results, vision on agentic systems, and integrity considerations like Ethisphere or any negative items (e.g., investigations). I'll also compare companies and highlight risks. Lastly, I\u2019ll define key industry terms and include supporting sources where needed.\n\n**Finalizing company list and considerations**\n\nTo provide a concise yet informative response, I\u2019ll include six core companies: Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Nvidia, Accenture, and IBM. Accenture is Irish-domiciled but US-listed \u2014 that matches the user\u2019s request. I'll note OpenAI\u2019s Frontier and Microsoft\u2019s support for the open Agent2Agent protocol as trend-relevant.\n\n**Finalizing company justification details**\n\nFor the small group of six, we\u2019ll include Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Nvidia, IBM, and Accenture. I\u2019ll justify each one\u2019s management, vision, and competence by citing sources about responsible AI governance, strategic goals, partnerships, and external recognition like Ethisphere and Fortune\u2019s top lists. For a bonus option, we\u2019ll mention UiPath.\n\n**Refining Nvidia, Accenture, and IBM details**\n\nFor Nvidia, I\u2019ll highlight their vision with NIM Agent Blueprints and AI tools, plus their recognition on Fortune's Most Admired list. I'll also mention a legal issue regarding a crypto case. For Accenture, I'll discuss their AI architecture, strong partnerships, and Ethisphere recognition but note a DOJ investigation. IBM's vision focuses on enterprise agent capabilities, and I\u2019ll cite product awards and responsibility recognitions, as well as their strong presence in hybrid cloud. Optional mention of UiPath, adding management names if relevant.\n\n**Verifying CEO names**\n\nI can check each CEO's name to be accurate, but I wonder if it's absolutely necessary. It\u2019s good for management credibility, though. I\u2019m planning to quickly verify CEO names using official sources, but since they\u2019re generally well-known, I can rely on existing citations too, to avoid redundancy.\n\n**Defining the narrative for enterprise AI agent platforms**\n\nThe narrative for the shortlisted companies focuses on their approach to AI agent integration in enterprises. This includes their distribution models, governance strategies, execution abilities, and risk assessments.

his tenure is broadly associated with Microsoft\u2019s modern cloud/platform execution cadence. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- **Vision:** Their recent consolidation of agentic frameworks into an explicit \u201cunified foundation\u201d (Agent Framework) is a classic \u201cplatform play\u201d rather than a one-off product bolt-on. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \n- **Integrity (evidence-based proxies):**\n  - Microsoft is ranked **#1** on Newsweek\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Reliable Companies 2026\u201d list (reliability is not identical to integrity, but it\u2019s a useful external signal). \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue201  \n  - Microsoft is listed near the top of Fortune/Korn Ferry\u2019s 2026 \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d (again: reputation signal, not proof). \ue200cite\ue202turn8search8\ue201  \n  - They publicly document a \u201cResponsible AI Standard\u201d and governance posture, which is an integrity-adjacent signal because it creates internal constraints and audit trails. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search2\ue201  \n\n**Watch-outs (important for your integrity constraint):** Microsoft is a regulatory magnet (size + platform power). Management integrity is less about \u201cno controversy\u201d and more about whether they respond transparently and adjust governance when mistakes happen. The agent era will stress-test that.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Amazon (AMZN)\n\n### Why it\u2019s positioned to win\n- **Amazon Bedrock** is explicitly selling \u201cbuild and deploy agents,\u201d including **AgentCore**, described as an agentic platform to build, deploy, and operate agents \u201csecurely, at scale.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- AWS also provides **Agents for Amazon Bedrock** as a guided agent-building path, which will appeal to enterprises that don\u2019t want to assemble a bespoke orchestration layer from scratch. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search15\ue201  \n- The \u201centerprise AI agent engineering\u201d discipline tends to become **an operations problem** (identity, monitoring, tool execution, scaling). AWS historically monetizes \u201cops problems\u201d extremely well.\n\n### Management competence/vision/integrity assessment\n- **Competence:** Andy Jassy\u2019s Amazon IR bio explicitly states he founded and led **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from inception and served as its CEO through July 2021, and is now Amazon CEO. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \n- **Vision:** The AgentCore framing is important: it suggests AWS wants to own the control plane for deploying/operating agents, not just offer models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n- **Integrity proxies:**  \n  - Amazon is ranked **#3** on Newsweek\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Reliable Companies 2026.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue201  \n  - Amazon is also top-ranked on Fortune/Korn Ferry\u2019s 2026 reputation list (not a moral certificate, but it\u2019s a signal that many executives/analysts score them highly on management quality). \ue200cite\ue202turn8search8\ue201  \n\n**Watch-outs:** Amazon has persistent labor and antitrust scrutiny in various jurisdictions (not \u201cagent-specific,\u201d but integrity-relevant). If your integrity bar is \u201cminimal stakeholder friction,\u201d Amazon is the one I\u2019d stress-test hardest.\n\n---\n\n## 3) NVIDIA (NVDA)\n\n### Why it\u2019s positioned to win\nIf enterprise agent engineering scales, inference becomes continuous, tool-heavy, and latency-sensitive. That tends to drive:\n- more **inference compute**, more specialized deployment, and more on-prem/private deployments for regulated industries.\n\nNVIDIA is explicitly pitching \u201cbuilding blocks for agentic AI,\u201d including:\n- **NeMo** for lifecycle management,\n- **NIM** (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) for enterprise-ready deployment,\n- and reference workflows (Blueprints). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n\nNIM is specifically described as prebuilt optimized inference microservices deployable across cloud, data center, workstation, edge\u2014exactly the heterogenous provisioning reality inside enterprises. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \nNVIDIA AI Enterprise bundles these components as a cloud-native enterprise suite. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n### Management competence/vision/integrity\n- **Competence:** Jensen Huang founded NVIDIA in 1993 and has served since inception as CEO/president. That kind of multi-decade continuity in a fast-moving field is a strong execution signal. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n- **Vision:** NVIDIA has been consistent for years about \u201caccelerated computing\u201d and is now concretizing agent deployment into productized enterprise software components (not just chips). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- **Integrity proxy:** NVIDIA ranks highly in Fortune/Korn Ferry\u2019s 2026 \u201cMost Admired\u201d list. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search8\ue201  \n\n**Watch-outs:** NVIDIA\u2019s risk profile is heavily shaped by geopolitics/export controls and by how it manages market power. These are precisely the contexts where \u201cintegrity\u201d gets stress-tested (pricing, allocation fairness, disclosure quality).\n\n---\n\n## 4) ServiceNow (NOW)\n\n### Why it\u2019s positioned to win\nServiceNow is a strong candidate for the **enterprise agent action layer** because it already sits where work happens (ITSM, HR, security workflows, enterprise service management), and agents need \u201capproved action surfaces.\u201d\n\n- ServiceNow is marketing **native AI agents** integrated into its AI platform and workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- They\u2019re actively deepening model partnerships: Axios reports Anthropic\u2019s Claude will power ServiceNow agents, including \u201cBuild Agent,\u201d explicitly aimed at building software/workflows via natural language. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news38\ue201  \n- Management is also positioning for \u201cagent risk\u201d: ServiceNow announced a major acquisition of Armis framed as betting on cybersecurity for AI environments. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news40\ue201  \n\n### Management competence/vision/integrity\n- **Competence:** Bill McDermott\u2019s official ServiceNow bio highlights his prior role as CEO of SAP and substantial value creation there, and he\u2019s been ServiceNow CEO since 2019. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue201  \n- **Vision:** The \u201cAI control tower\u201d framing + acquisitions + deep model partnership suggests management is not treating agents as a feature, but as a platform shift. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news38\ue202turn0news40\ue201  \n- **Integrity:** ServiceNow is explicitly listed as a **2025 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies honoree** (2-time honoree) on Ethisphere\u2019s honoree list. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\n**Watch-outs (important):** Agentic workflows create new attack surfaces. There have been security concerns discussed publicly about prompt-injection style risks in agentic setups (not unique to ServiceNow, but relevant). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news37\ue201  \nFor an integrity-first investor, you\u2019d want to see: rapid, transparent mitigations + strong default-safe configurations (not just documentation updates).\n\n---\n\n## 5) Salesforce (CRM)\n\n### Why it\u2019s positioned to win\nSalesforce is one of the most \u201cdistribution-advantaged\u201d companies for enterprise agents because it owns the CRM surface where revenue work happens.\n\n- **Agentforce** is positioned as a complete enterprise agentic platform with tools to manage the agent lifecycle (build, test, supervise). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n- Salesforce has published a clear cadence of product iteration (Agentforce \u2192 Agentforce 2/2dx/3), emphasizing interoperability and governance as it scales. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201  \n- Salesforce itself frames this as the \u201cagentic enterprise,\u201d and CEO Marc Benioff has explicitly called AI agents the beginning of an \u201cunlimited workforce.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n\n### Management competence/vision/integrity\n- **Competence:** Founder-led continuity matters when a platform is being re-architected. Salesforce provides a CEO bio for Benioff as Chair/CEO/co-founder. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue201  \n- **Vision:** Public \u201cagentic enterprise\u201d narrative + rapid versioning cadence indicates they\u2019re operationalizing the vision (not just talking). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n- **Integrity:** Salesforce appears on Ethisphere\u2019s 2025 honoree list as a **16-time honoree**\u2014a strong longevity signal around ethics/compliance programs. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view1\ue201  \n\n**Watch-outs:** Salesforce has historically been acquisitive. For integrity, you want to see disciplined capital allocation (goodwill write-downs, overpromising synergy). For vision, you want agent capabilities to become \u201cdefault workflow primitives,\u201d not a separate SKU that customers don\u2019t operationalize.\n\n---\n\n## 6) IBM (IBM)\n\n### Why it\u2019s positioned to win\nEnterprises (especially regulated ones) will care about **governed orchestration** more than flashy demos.\n\n- IBM watsonx Orchestrate explicitly positions around orchestrating work across the business and \u201cgovern your AI agents\u201d with centralized oversight/guardrails/policy enforcement. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- IBM\u2019s own announcement around design awards emphasizes explainable/auditable enterprise-ready AI agent design\u2014exactly what internal audit and compliance teams will demand. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n\n### Management competence/vision/integrity\n- **Competence:** IBM\u2019s press release states the board elected Arvind Krishna as CEO effective April 6, 2020, and notes his role as an architect of the Red Hat acquisition (a major strategic bet on hybrid cloud). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue201  \n- **Vision:** Krishna has publicly argued for a more measured, trust-building approach to AI after prior missteps, which is what enterprises actually need for agent rollouts. \ue200cite\ue202turn3news48\ue201  \n- **Integrity:** IBM is listed on Ethisphere\u2019s 2025 honoree list as a **7-time honoree**. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view2\ue201  \n- **Integrity proxy #2:** IBM is ranked **#2** on Newsweek\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Reliable Companies 2026.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue201  \n\n**Watch-outs:** IBM\u2019s perpetual challenge is execution speed and product-market clarity. The \u201cagent era\u201d may reward faster iteration; IBM must prove it can ship and integrate at modern tempo.\n\n---\n\n# A note on your \u201cmanagement integrity is non-negotiable\u201d rule\n\nI agree with the principle, but I\u2019d push one nuance: integrity is best treated as a **portfolio of indicators**, not a binary.

In a scenario dubbed \"second-order prompt injection,\" a less-privileged AI agent can be tricked via a malformed input into asking a higher-privileged agent to perform sensitive tasks, such as exporting confidential data. Since both agents trust each other, harmful actions may be executed without human oversight. This vulnerability arises from default configuration settings and not from a flaw in the AI itself, according to AppOmni's Aaron Costello. Although ServiceNow acknowledged this behavior as expected and did not alter the system, it updated documentation to better outline potential risks. Mitigation includes configuring supervised execution for privileged agents, disabling autonomous overrides, segmenting agent duties, and monitoring for suspicious activity.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"techradar.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201","start_idx":11832,"end_idx":11851,"safe_urls":["https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/","https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Agentforce: The AI Agent Platform","url":"https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Agentforce can transform any team and workflow with AI agents. \u00b7 The most complete enterprise agentic platform. \u00b7 Tools to manage the entire agent lifecycle.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Salesforce"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201","start_idx":12011,"end_idx":12030,"safe_urls":["https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/10/13/agentic-enterprise-announcement/","https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/10/13/agentic-enterprise-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/10/13/agentic-enterprise-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Salesforce Announces the Agentic Enterprise.","url":"https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/10/13/agentic-enterprise-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"13 Oct 2025 \u2014 Agentforce (October 2024): Introduced the first enterprise AI agent platform.

Krishna, an IBM veteran with a background in engineering and AI, became CEO in 2020 after a period of stagnation at the company. Though IBM was once a pioneer in AI\u2014highlighted by Watson's Jeopardy! win in 2011\u2014its ambitious healthcare applications for Watson fell short, prompting a strategic shift. Krishna acknowledges the missteps of aiming toward high-stakes applications too early and now advocates for a more measured, trust-building approach to AI.\n\nUnder Krishna's leadership, IBM is refocusing on hybrid cloud computing and AI, applying these tools to pressing global challenges like climate change. The company commits to being net-zero by 2030 and is developing AI to optimize energy use and discover new materials for carbon capture. Krishna emphasizes IBM's enduring technical innovation, cultural evolution, and the company\u2019s purpose-driven mission, which resonates with a new generation of workers seeking meaningful impact. He also offers a simple explanation of AI as pattern recognition based on observed data and sees long-term innovation in areas like quantum computing as central to IBM\u2019s identity.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"TIME"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6view2\ue201","start_idx":14224,"end_idx":14241,"safe_urls":["https://worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/honorees/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Worlds Most Ethical Companies](https://worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/honorees/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Honorees -

The focus is on management competence, vision, positioning, and product moves, especially in AI. The criteria include evaluating distribution advantages, control planes, and infrastructure factors, noting potential acquisitions or changes by February 2026. I'll complete the analysis with up-to-date information.\n\n**Evaluating potential acquisitions and AI readiness**\n\nSeveral companies, like Informatica, might be up for acquisition (Salesforce or others) \u2014 it's something to keep an eye on for 2025. Arista Networks benefits from AI clusters, while Nutanix has AI infrastructure partnerships, especially with NVIDIA. Datadog is focusing on LLM observability. I need to consider how these factors match strict criteria and make a definite yes/no decision on their inclusion, using a rubric that rates everything from distribution to management quality.\n\n**Gathering company details for evaluation**\n\nI don't need to include stock charts since the user asked for an evaluation, not price specifics. Instead, I'll focus on gathering information using web searches for each company's AI strategy, leadership, and corporate governance. I\u2019ll look for relevant sources on Informatica, Arista, Nutanix, and Datadog that discuss their AI efforts, leadership, and ethics, and verify their US listing status.\n\n**Evaluating potential replacements or additions**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed the tickers for Arista (ANET), Nutanix (NTNX), and Datadog (DDOG). I need to weigh whether they'd displace existing mega-caps including IBM on the list. Under strict criteria, Arista could qualify due to its critical AI cluster networking, while Datadog\u2019s strength in observability could make it a key contender. However, they may fall into second-tier status.\n\n**Evaluating Enterprise AI Agent Needs and Potential Players**\n\nEnterprise AI agents require compute, data integration, networking, storage, observability, and workflow surfaces. Companies like Microsoft and AWS own key segments, while Informatica focuses on data integration and governance. Arista is well-positioned due to its data center networking, and Datadog\u2019s observability could play a vital role in agent reliability. However, their fit for \"agent engineering\" is uncertain, and I'll need to assess management and positioning closely.\n\n**Evaluating Companies' Positioning for Enterprise AI Agents**\n\nIf companies have launched agent-specific features or partnerships recently, they could be \"imminently positioning.\" Informatica might be involved in AI-powered data management, but it's not focused on multi-agent orchestration. I\u2019ll use a strict evaluation screen based on four factors. Arista, with strong networking infrastructure for AI clusters, could qualify for this space.\n\n**Reviewing Potential Additions to the Agent List**\n\nArista may support infrastructure for AI, but its value isn't uniquely tied to agent systems. Datadog could qualify for its observability features, though it focuses on agent operations, not orchestration. Nutanix and Informatica are useful but not direct fits for the core list. Strict criteria might exclude these companies.\n\n**Evaluating enterprise agent engineering stack and management integrity**\n\nIf we broaden the scope to the \u201centerprise agent engineering stack,\u201d Datadog, Arista, Nutanix, and Informatica would be top picks. Still, I need to look into their recent products, such as Datadog's LLM Observability and Arista\u2019s AI networking. I'll also ensure there are no major management concerns by checking sources.\n\n**Reviewing current picks and applying strict criteria**\n\nThe search results give me solid details about Informatica's CLAIRE AI engine, Datadog's AI agent monitoring, and Arista\u2019s AI clusters. To evaluate Informatica, Arista, Nutanix, and Datadog, I\u2019ll compare them to the original criteria: control plane/platform, and agent-specific product features such as identity and governance readiness for enterprise use.\n\n**Final evaluation criteria and validation**\n\nNow I should evaluate each company based on criteria: economic capture, durable moat, and management integrity. I'll give them scores from 0-5 and explain my reasoning. I'll also cross-check sources to avoid bias from marketing. To ensure accuracy, I\u2019ll run additional searches to assess management integrity, like looking for Ethisphere mentions.\n\n**Validating sources for integrity and evaluation**\n\nI need to be selective about the sources I use. Some, like clay.com, may not be reliable. Company investor relations pages and well-known outlets like Bloomberg are better. For integrity checks, Ethisphere is useful. I'll search specifically for any Ethisphere or ethics award mentions for each company.\n\n**Searching for company information**\n\nI need to look for patterns specific to each company. To do this, I\u2019ll search for each company's name to gather relevant details. This should help in identifying useful information about them, especially focusing on key aspects like integrity, leadership, and ethics. I'll get started on that search now.\n\n**Evaluating companies with news rankings**\n\nI noticed that ServiceNow, Salesforce, and IBM are on the 2025 Ethisphere list, while Datadog, Informatica, Nutanix, and Arista aren't \u2014 though that doesn't mean they're unethical. We should apply criteria like Ethisphere inclusion when examining these companies. I'll check whether these companies show up on Newsweek's reliability rankings for 2026.\n\n**Checking Newsweek reliability list**\n\nI see that the Newsweek search results point to their culture rankings, not the reliability list. To find the companies, I'll open the reliability list directly and search for the names. However, there's a chance they might not be listed, so I\u2019ll check and verify using the available online view.\n\n**Checking Newsweek\u2019s reliability list for results**\n\nThe Newsweek list shows the top 50, but it\u2019s incomplete, with pagination issues. I can try using the \"find\" function to check for the companies we're interested in, like Microsoft, IBM, and Salesforce. For new ones, we might need to click through multiple pages, but we'll start with a search.\n\n**Exploring alternative integrity signals for companies**\n\nIt looks like the companies we're checking aren't in the top 50, and I can't easily check later pages due to technical limitations. We can still use other integrity signals, like Newsweek's \"America's Greatest Workplaces\" list, which includes some relevant companies. I'll also look up each company's code of ethics.\n\n**Evaluating agent orchestration control and related technologies**\n\nDatadog stands out with its \"AI Agent Monitoring\" feature, which directly tracks agentic AI, making it a strong contender. Informatica and Nutanix are focused on data management or AI model hosting, rather than orchestration control. Arista's networking helps AI clusters but isn't unique. So, Datadog seems most fitting.\n\n**Evaluating Informatica and Nutanix against existing picks**\n\nInformatica and Nutanix seem to enable other functions but aren't likely to be major beneficiaries in this space; they might belong on a watchlist. When comparing to picks like Microsoft, AWS, or Datadog, they have different specialties. Informatica focuses on data integration, while Nutanix provides HPC and virtualization environments, which are relevant for certain industries.\n\n**Considering leadership and governance for potential picks**\n\nFor Arista, their focus on large hyperscalers and AI clusters makes them a key player in cloud, even if not typical for enterprises. We can review their CEO\u2019s background and governance via their IR page. Datadog, Informatica, and Nutanix each have leadership pages with useful info, too. For Nutanix, I\u2019ll check their blog and leadership profiles for a clearer picture on governance.\n\n**Considering potential risks related to management integrity**\n\nArista's founder, Andy Bechtolsheim, settled insider trading charges, which may affect integrity evaluation despite his non-CEO role. This is definitely a risk factor to mention, though Ullal remains CEO. We should check for any integrity issues for Datadog, Informatica, and Nutanix, considering the user's priority on management integrity.\n\n**Considering the potential for integrity issues**\n\nShould we have excluded companies based on stricter standards? The key might be whether they\u2019d still make the list under existing criteria. For Arista, the SEC settlement related to the founder is a concern, even if Arista stock wasn\u2019t involved. I need to check for integrity red flags, like with Datadog.\n\n**Reviewing integrity concerns and controversies**\n\nThe search for Arista\u2019s founder's case brought credible sources like Reuters and AP, which works. For Informatica, allegations tied to missed projections and shareholder lawsuits don\u2019t directly reflect management integrity. I should be cautious; I'll search for any major controversies but make it clear that a lack of findings isn\u2019t conclusive.\n\n**Evaluating controversies and customer concentration risks**\n\nWe found some concerning news for Datadog, like the possibility of OpenAI migrating away, highlighting customer concentration risk. For Nutanix, there are integrity issues, like software misuse and an internal investigation. Informatica also has a DOJ case. I'll handle these carefully, applying strict criteria, but need to clarify this is not investment advice.\n\n**Validating company status and evaluating enterprise AI**\n\nThe user wants a rigorous evaluation, so I'll provide a scoring system with detailed explanations. I need to address \"enterprise AI agent engineering\" as an emerging discipline, focusing on key capabilities like cloud, governance, and observability. Plus, I\u2019ll verify if these companies are actively traded as of February 2026.\n\n**Verifying active trading status**\n\nI should verify whether these companies are actively traded on US exchanges, as that's a key requirement. While a stock price chart might add visual interest, it could distract from the core evaluation. I\u2019ll stick with confirming their trading status without including the chart, since that's most relevant.\n\n**Consider including news sources for evaluation**\n\nThe user asked for a rigorous evaluation, and while UI elements like a navlist aren\u2019t mandatory, it might be useful. Adding a navlist of news sources about each company could provide more context. It would also satisfy the requirement for citing sources, using ones like Barron\u2019s and Reuters.\n\n**Finalizing news sources for user evaluation**\n\nI'll include a navlist at the end using news sources like Reuters, AP, Barron's, and maybe WSJ. Some sources might not qualify as \"news\" references, but we'll work with what we have. If necessary, I'll also try to fetch additional news about Datadog's AI monitoring. However, user only requested evaluation, so I'll focus on structured analysis.\n\n**Evaluating strict criteria and gathering sources**\n\nThe user asked for strict criteria, so I need to define them clearly and apply them consistently to compare existing picks and new candidates. To ensure accuracy, I'll gather third-party sources like industry articles for Informatica, Datadog, Nutanix, and Arista, avoiding over-reliance on marketing materials. I've already identified some helpful sources like APMdigest and Times of India, among others. I'll aim for a well-rounded evaluation using reliable third-party coverage.\n\n**Gathering sources for evaluation**\n\nWe have some sources gathered for Datadog, Informatica, Nutanix, and Arista, though some sources may not be as reliable, like hyperframe research. For Informatica, I\u2019ll use sources like Amalgam Insights and Salesforce's blog for a broader perspective. When evaluating Arista, I\u2019ll focus on their role in AI clusters and gather relevant details from their press release and third-party sources.\n\n**Evaluating management integrity**\n\nFor Arista, Datadog, Nutanix, and Informatica, I\u2019ll focus on their governance, integrity issues, and management practices and include publicly available resources. Integrity concerns include Arista\u2019s insider trading settlement, Nutanix\u2019s software misuse investigation, and Informatica\u2019s past DOJ settlement. While we don\u2019t have any major ethics awards, we can discuss their codes of conduct.\n\n**Comparing management integrity and strict criteria**\n\nConsidering integrity concerns, Datadog might fare better than Arista due to the latter's founder case. That said, integrity issues in any company should be evaluated carefully. The user requests a strict comparison against existing picks, so I\u2019ll need to ensure even these picks meet those high standards.\n\n**Evaluating additions under strict criteria**\n\nLooking at the strict criteria, both Datadog and Arista might have made it to the list, but only under specific conditions. Datadog could be added for its observability control plane, especially for AI agent monitoring, making it a strong enabler. Arista, however, might be borderline due to the founder-led management.\n\n**Evaluating Nutanix and Informatica for enterprise AI agent engineering**\n\nNutanix is unlikely due to its lower-level infrastructure role and past compliance issues. Informatica, while strong in data governance and AI with its CLAIRE engine, doesn't directly orchestrate agents, making it less of a fit for top enterprise AI agent engineering. They would both remain on the watchlist.\n\n**Evaluating Informatica, Arista, and Nutanix**\n\nInformatica\u2019s data governance could be pivotal for enterprise AI agents as they need solid data control. However, past integrity concerns might raise flags. Arista\u2019s role focuses on high-speed networking, but it doesn\u2019t directly contribute to enterprise AI agent engineering. Nutanix, with its infrastructure and GenAI tools, seems more poised for AI growth.\n\n**Considering Datadog and Nutanix\u2019s position**\n\nNutanix may face competition from cloud services like Kubernetes, and its compliance issues could raise integrity concerns, but they responded well. Datadog, providing observability for AI agents, positions well in agent engineering; their technical leadership and ethical track record give them a stronger case. Still, we must evaluate these companies rigorously.\n\n**Evaluating whether to use screenshot tool for PDFs**\n\nIt seems I must use the screenshot tool whenever analyzing a PDF, but I wonder if referencing a snippet counts as analysis. To be safe, I can avoid PDF citations by relying on HTML sources when possible, though for Informatica\u2019s code, I may need to cite the PDF directly.\n\n**Evaluating citation options and verifying Informatica\u2019s status**\n\nIt's better to rely on more credible sources like news for legal issues and avoid PDFs where possible, especially since the user asked for management integrity. For Informatica, I need to quickly check whether they remain publicly traded or have been acquired by Salesforce. I'll search for the latest info.\n\n**Clarifying Informatica\u2019s status**\n\nInformatica is no longer publicly traded as of November 18, 2025, having been acquired by Salesforce and delisted from the NYSE. While we can still evaluate it as a business, its status as a publicly traded company impacts stock-picking criteria. I\u2019ll cite a press release and Investing.com for confirmation.\n\n**Evaluating Informatica post-acquisition**\n\nInformatica, now a part of Salesforce after its acquisition, no longer qualifies independently for evaluation. While it would\u2019ve been strong as a data layer for agentic enterprises, its merger with Salesforce strengthens their position. We'll clarify this and address its potential pre-acquisition eligibility. I'll verify other picks too.\n\n**Adjusting evaluation criteria for Informatica acquisition**\n\nSince Informatica is now part of Salesforce, its stock no longer makes sense as a standalone pick. However, from a strategic standpoint, it adds valuable positioning within Salesforce\u2019s platform. In terms of evaluating it alongside Arista, Nutanix, and Datadog, I\u2019ll adjust our criteria accordingly and craft a response.\n\n**Structuring the response based on user instructions**\n\nI need to mention the previous picks (Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, ServiceNow, Salesforce, IBM) and briefly explain why they were chosen, to provide context for comparison to Informatica, Arista, Nutanix, and Datadog. I'll follow the user's instructions precisely, including using tables for clarity and adhering to the formal structure. I'll also note Informatica\u2019s recent acquisition and delisting. Then, I'll describe the evaluation criteria and scores side-by-side.\n\n**Analyzing the four companies for evaluation**\n\nI\u2019ll break down each of the four companies by:  \n1. Their fit for \"enterprise agent engineering\" (how they align in the tech stack)  \n2. Why they could benefit (their product strengths)  \n3. Key risks against them, such as competition or lack of competitive advantage  \n4. Their management integrity and vision  \n\nThen, I'll provide a \"yes/no\" verdict on whether they should\u2019ve made the list and suggest some second-tier options like Datadog or Arista. I'll also cite relevant news sources where applicable.\n\n**Compiling news sources for relevant updates**\n\nI'll gather recent news on Informatica's acquisition and delisting using credible sources like Salesforce and Informatica\u2019s press releases, along with articles from Investing.com. For Datadog, I'll focus on AI agent monitoring news, citing Investor Relations press releases and articles from platforms like APMdigest. I\u2019ll prioritize recent news and cite everything appropriately.\n\n**Gathering key sources for integrity analysis**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on citing relevant press releases and articles for each company, highlighting their AI networking, platforms, and integrity issues, where applicable. For management competence, I\u2019ll draw on key leadership statements and external recognition, but be careful not to overstate claims. Citations will all be pulled from credible sources.\n\n**Inferring previous picks and confirming evaluation scope**\n\nThe user asked to evaluate new companies against an existing list, which likely includes Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and IBM based on previous analysis. I can't be 100% sure, but I can confidently use these as the starting point for comparison. I'll stay consistent.\n\n**Clarifying the existing shortlist for evaluation**\n\nSince the user asked to compare against \"existing picks,\" I\u2019ll assume my earlier shortlist likely included companies like Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and possibly IBM or Palantir. Though the exact list might be unclear, I can reference these categories: hyperscalers, AI compute stack, workflow platforms, and governance/consulting.\n\n**Clarifying picks and evaluation criteria**\n\nI'll use my earlier shortlist of companies like Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and IBM for comparison. Although Informatica is no longer actively traded due to its acquisition by Salesforce, I can still evaluate the others based on strict criteria: criticality to enterprise AI, control plane, monetization leverage, disintermediation resilience, and management.\n\n**Evaluating management based on integrity and vision**\n\nTo assess management, I\u2019ll define integrity as governance and transparency, and vision as forward-thinking, not just reactive. For Arista, we\u2019ll look into the founder\u2019s departure and governance. Nutanix\u2019s internal investigation might impact its integrity, but it shows they took action. Datadog\u2019s new AI-focused tools reflect their vision and competency.\n\n**Final evaluation of candidates based on criteria**\n\nInformatica, now part of Salesforce, isn't eligible as a standalone. Datadog stands out with AI Agent Monitoring and strong management. Arista, despite AI infrastructure involvement, faces governance concerns and indirect connection to agent engineering. Nutanix has potential but risks with execution and past misconduct.\n\n**Addressing integrity concerns for Nutanix and Arista**\n\nFor Nutanix, the CEO acknowledged a compliance lapse but emphasized that the board investigated and took remedial actions, which shows positive steps. For Arista, the founder's insider trading issue remains a concern. I'll need to gather more details from the Reuters article about this for further evaluation.\n\n**Accessing sources for Informatica acquisition**\n\nFor Informatica's acquisition and delisting, I\u2019ll check the Investing.com article and Salesforce's press release. Some sources like WSJ are restricted, but I'll work with the available ones to gather the necessary details about the acquisition and ensure it\u2019s correctly addressed in the evaluation.\n\n**Checking Datadog AI agent monitoring details**\n\nI now have reliable sources to support Informatica's delisting. Next, I\u2019ll focus on Datadog's AI agent monitoring. I\u2019ll open their press release to gather the most up-to-date and authoritative information about the release of their AI Agent Monitoring feature for proper context in the evaluation.\n\n**Exploring Arista AI networking sources**\n\nLooks like I can't access the Datadog press release, but that's okay\u2014I can rely on their blog and third-party sources like APMdigest and Investing.com for the AI agent monitoring details. Now, regarding Arista, I\u2019ll check their press release or blog for useful information on their AI networking efforts.\n\n**Gathering Nutanix AI platform info**\n\nThis source mentions agentic AI traffic and network telemetry, which is helpful. Now for Nutanix, I\u2019ll look up their press release and check Forbes for any relevant info about their AI platform, especially focusing on the GPT-in-a-Box offering. That should give us some solid details.\n\n**Gathering info for Informatica**\n\nFor Nutanix, I'll rely on their press release and blog, as Forbes is paywalled. For Datadog, we have the blog already. For Informatica, I\u2019ll focus on their CLAIRE AI engine and governance frameworks, plus the Salesforce acquisition. I\u2019ll refer to relevant sources like their CLAIRE page and compliance coverage.\n\n**Looking for accessible sources on DOJ settlement**\n\nCompliance Week article is behind a paywall, but we can use the visible summary about Informatica's $21 million settlement. It\u2019s credible, but it\u2019d be helpful to find a more accessible source. I\u2019ll search for an official DOJ press release or other public sources from 2019 to verify it.\n\n**Looking for Datadog CEO background**\n\nWe have the DOJ press release and GSA OIG page, which are reliable for the integrity issue. Now, for Datadog, I\u2019m not sure if we need a management biography, but it could be good to mention the CEO's background. I'll search for information about the CEO's founding role and background on their investor relations or leadership page.\n\n**Considering sources for management integrity and leadership**\n\nI have leadership pages for Datadog, Arista, and Nutanix. For Nutanix, I can use the CEO\u2019s board bio. I\u2019ll avoid citing Wikipedia for integrity. Datadog's code of business conduct is in a PDF, but the governance overview page might work better. External recognition like Barron\u2019s best CEOs could be considered but isn't ideal. I'll prefer citing governance and management pages that reflect leadership and ethical standards.\n\n**Evaluating leadership and integrity signals**\n\nFor Datadog, we can use the leadership page for the CEO\u2019s background and the blog discussing monitoring AI agents. We\u2019ll highlight their commitment to integrity, with transparent business conduct and no enforcement actions. For Informatica, I\u2019ll note management changes post-acquisition, with the new CEO\u2019s statement about their data management vision.\n\n**Defining abbreviations and noting context**\n\nWe should define some abbreviations like MDM (Master Data Management), LLM (Large Language Model), HPC (High Performance Computing), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and others if we mention them. Also, for clarity, I'll include the specific date, February 9, 2026, as a reference. Although the user\u2019s timezone is Asia/Singapore, this may not be necessary. Let\u2019s proceed with scoring.\n\n**Computing approximate scoring**\n\nFor each company, we\u2019ll look at Agent Engineering Leverage, Distribution, Moat, and Integrity:\n\n- **Agent Engineering Leverage**: High for Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA; moderate for ServiceNow, Salesforce, IBM, Datadog, Arista, Nutanix, and Informatica.\n- **Distribution**: Microsoft, AWS, and Nvidia score high; others lower.\n- **Moat**: Microsoft and Nvidia have the strongest moats.\n- **Integrity**: ServiceNow, Salesforce, and IBM rate highly; others are moderate or lower for ethics.\n\n**Crafting final message and verdict**\n\nFor **Informatica**, it's not eligible now as it was acquired by Salesforce and delisted in November 2025. Its acquisition strengthens Salesforce's Agentforce data layer.\n\n**Datadog**, with its focus on monitoring agentic systems and strong founder-led management, could be a non-mega-cap pick if allowed. No major governance issues, but risks exist around customer concentration.\n\n**Arista** doesn't meet the strict integrity criteria.\n\n**Evaluating integrity and agent engineering relevance**\n\nNutanix's position in GPT-in-a-Box and enterprise AI is interesting, but they're more a \"how you run it\" layer than directly involved in agent engineering, with some governance issues to note.\n\nFor **Arista**, I\u2019ll mention the founder\u2019s insider trading settlement.\n\nFor **Informatica**, there\u2019s a settlement regarding false claims but avoid unproven securities allegations.\n\n**Datadog** stands out with its focus on agent engineering, offering monitoring tools and a unified data model, which is vital for AI agent systems.\n\n**Detailed evaluation based on agent engineering and integrity**\n\nFor **Datadog**, we'll cite their blog for agentic system monitoring and the CEO\u2019s engineering track record.\n\n**Arista** focuses on network telemetry but has a founder case affecting integrity.\n\n**Nutanix** highlights enterprise AI, focusing on features like fine-grained control, though some integrity concerns remain.\n\n**Informatica** is not eligible due to acquisition. The table will simplify comparisons across categories such as \"Agent Engineering Leverage\" and \"Management Integrity.\"\n\n**Comparing candidates to existing picks**\n\nThe user asked for a comparison, and I can include both the picks and candidates in a table. For picks like Microsoft, I\u2019ll assign a score (Leverage 5, Control 5, Moat 5, Integrity 4), but I need to be cautious about sourcing. Microsoft may not be on the Ethisphere list, so I\u2019ll avoid using that without confirming. For other picks (ServiceNow, Salesforce, IBM), referencing Ethisphere is solid. I could emphasize differences in control-plane but avoid needing extra sources for the picks.\n\n**Clarifying source citation approach**\n\nFor the picks, I think it's fine to mention that some of them have third-party integrity validation, like being on the Ethisphere list. We can cite the 2025 list since it\u2019s the most recent, even if the 2026 list might not be out yet. If necessary, I can check for updates and reference the relevant web sources for accuracy.\n\n**Confirming sources and further information needs**\n\nWe\u2019re good to move ahead with the Ethisphere 2025 list for citations since the 2026 list isn\u2019t available yet. Now I need to evaluate Datadog compared to my picks. For Informatica, I\u2019ll confirm its delisting and acquisitions status and check on their CLAIRE AI engine and governance framework. Let\u2019s explore those pages.\n\n**Correcting misattribution of sources**\n\nOh, I made a mistake: I opened Nutanix blog content, not Informatica\u2019s, which led to confusion. The earlier search results did include sources like Informatica\u2019s Intelligent Data Management Cloud, CLAIRE AI engine, and Agentic AI Governance Framework. I\u2019ll need to open the correct Informatica links now.\n\n**Refining source mapping and citations**\n\nThe sources for Informatica seem to be mostly sorted, but I need to look up a few more. I already have useful data on Informatica's acquisition and DOJ settlement. To handle AI agent features, I can rely on Salesforce\u2019s press release, which mentions integration with Informatica's data stack for Agentforce.\n\n**Evaluating Informatica vs picks**\n\nI\u2019ll discuss Informatica\u2019s central role in enterprise AI, particularly through its integration into Salesforce's Agentforce, which adds credibility. Instead of pursuing new sources, I may rely on the Salesforce press release and other existing info, possibly mentioning Informatica\u2019s \"agentic AI blueprint\" from an article.\n\n**Handling citations and search results**\n\nCitations need to be from sources like the search results or specific pages, and although we can cite them without opening, it\u2019s better to check the details. We have two calls left, so I could run one more search for Informatica's CLAIRE AI engine and gather the info from that.\n\n**Evaluating AI enterprise stack for investment**\n\nWe already have sufficient info, especially from Salesforce's release, which mentions Informatica's unified metadata. Given we're careful about call limits, I'll stick with our current sources, focusing mostly on the four companies\u2014Informatica, Arista Networks, Nutanix, and Datadog\u2014within the context of enterprise AI agent engineering. Time to dive in.\n\n**Evaluating Informatica within company criteria**\n\nI've outlined the criteria we need to evaluate the companies against, particularly in terms of control/action surfaces and enterprise-grade features. Informatica, now with Salesforce, stood out for its integration into Agentforce. Notably, Informatica is no longer US-traded, having been fully acquired by Salesforce, which limits its eligibility.\n\n**Evaluating Informatica and Arista Networks**\n\nInformatica is no longer eligible for evaluation due to its full acquisition by Salesforce and a past integrity issue involving a DOJ settlement. Meanwhile, Arista Networks shows strong alignment with AI infrastructure, with innovations in networking products and open standards leadership. However, Arista faces governance concerns due to a CEO's involvement in past settlement.\n\n**Evaluating Nutanix and Datadog**\n\nNutanix, while relevant for hybrid multicloud and AI-inference, focuses more on where AI models run rather than agent orchestration. A past compliance issue involving misconduct and financial reporting concerns raise integrity flags, leading to a \"watchlist\" status.\n\nDatadog's role in observability is key for debugging and governance across dynamic decision-making in AI agents, but more clarity is needed for its fit.\n\n**Final Evaluation of Datadog and Competitors**\n\nDatadog is well-positioned within the \"agent engineering\" field, offering specialized observability and agentic monitoring features across frameworks. Their leadership, technical competence, and focus on agent reliability are strong, but business risks from customer concentration remain. Given the strict criteria, Datadog likely qualifies for inclusion.\n\n**Final Thoughts on List and Datadog\u2019s Position**\n\nTo keep the list concise, I might swap IBM for Datadog, emphasizing more \"software leverage\" vs. \"consulting.\" But Arista and Nutanix, while important for AI infrastructure, don\u2019t directly align with the strict \"agent engineering\" focus. So, Datadog and maybe Arista fit, but the answer is no for others.\n\n**Addressing Datadog's Management Integrity**\n\nDatadog's management integrity is mostly positive. The company demonstrates strong governance with a founder-led approach and no major scandals. Although they have high-level governance and product features like \"Audit Trail\" and \"Sensitive Data Scanner,\" it\u2019s harder to explicitly prove management integrity without using external awards. I'll focus on publicly available information.\n\n**Finalizing response with valid sources**\n\nIt looks like we've gathered solid sources to back up statements: Informatica's acquisition and delisting from Salesforce, its DOJ settlement, and Arista's AI networking initiative along with the founder settlement. We\u2019ll be sure to cite these at the end of related sentences to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\n**Finalizing evaluation with supporting sources**\n\nFor the final evaluation, I\u2019ll rely on sources like Reuters, Barron's, and others to back up statements on Nutanix\u2019s AI adoption and Datadog\u2019s agent monitoring. We'll apply the strict criteria of identifying platform-level winners. Then I\u2019ll summarize everything in a clear yes/no table for each company.\n\n**Clarifying must-haves and validating claims**\n\nI'll define four must-haves for platform-level winners: agent runtime, enterprise integration, pricing leverage, and management integrity. Regarding Datadog, I\u2019ll mention their blog about LLM Observability, but avoid calling it \"general availability\" without confirmation. For Nutanix, I\u2019ll cite its press release on AI and integration with GPT-in-a-Box.\n\n**Evaluating management and leadership**\n\nNutanix\u2019s focus on simplifying AI solutions is insightful, especially highlighting their model-serving infrastructure. For management competence: Datadog\u2019s CEO brings relevant experience, Arista\u2019s CEO demonstrates vision, though some self-sourced claims need validation. Nutanix\u2019s CEO shows transparency, with no wrongdoing found by management. I'll cite these points.\n\n**Designing Evaluation and Scoring System**\n\nI\u2019ve built a 1-5 scale to evaluate platform fit, distribution, moat, and integrity.

A \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d is necessary but not sufficient; I look for real-world behavior, disclosure discipline, accountability, and absence of major red flags.\n\nNow the four names.\n\n---\n\n## Informatica (formerly INFA)\n\n### Gate 1: Public investability\n**Fails (today).** Salesforce completed its acquisition of Informatica on **Nov 18, 2025**, and Informatica shares were delisted (no longer an actively traded U.S. stock). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn10search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201\n\n### Strategic fit (if it *were* still public)\nIronically, Informatica is *very* on\u2011point for \u201centerprise agent engineering\u201d **as a data foundation / governance / integration layer**:\n\n- Informatica explicitly launched **\u201cAI Agent Engineering\u201d** within its Intelligent Data Management Cloud (a unified environment to build/connect/manage multi-agent systems across major ecosystems). \ue200cite\ue202turn10search5\ue202turn10search1\ue201\n- It also positioned **CLAIRE GPT** toward \u201cagentic\u201d data management (planning/reasoning + oversight). \ue200cite\ue202turn10search13\ue202turn10search1\ue201\n\n### What this means vs my existing picks\n**Informatica would not appear as a standalone pick now** because it\u2019s not investable. But its thesis didn\u2019t disappear \u2014 it **migrated into Salesforce**:\n\n- Reuters explicitly framed the deal as Salesforce betting on Informatica to sharpen its AI/data edge. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search4\ue202turn10news40\ue201\n\n**Verdict:** **No** (not publicly traded). As a capability, it *strengthens the \u201cSalesforce as enterprise agent platform\u201d thesis* rather than standing alone. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search0\ue202turn10search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Arista Networks (ANET)\n\n### Why it\u2019s relevant to enterprise agent engineering\nArista is a **picks-and-shovels** bet on the physical reality behind agentic AI: distributed training/inference clusters and the data-center networks they demand.\n\nEvidence it is positioning specifically for AI networking:\n- Arista launched platforms explicitly framed around **data + AI centers**, including **800G** systems and **3.2 Tbps \u201cHyperPorts\u201d**, described as enabling \u201cdistributed AI workloads.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn5search4\ue201\n- Arista is participating in **Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN)** efforts under the Open Compute Project (Open Compute Project = OCP), a direct industry push to make Ethernet viable for scale-up AI fabrics. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search3\ue202turn10search19\ue202turn10news47\ue201\n- CEO Jayshree Ullal is publicly taking the \u201cEthernet wins\u201d strategic stance for AI networking. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search23\ue201\n\nSo: *strategically relevant*, and more targeted than generic \u201cAI will drive demand\u201d claims.\n\n### The two issues that keep it out of a very small \u201cbest positioned\u201d list\n\n#### 1) Directness and value capture vs the *agent engineering* control plane\nArista benefits most when **hyperscalers and AI-native data centers build out networks**. That\u2019s real, but it\u2019s one layer removed from \u201centerprise AI agent engineering\u201d as a discipline inside companies. Enterprise adoption can increase cloud capex, but that\u2019s an indirect linkage compared with companies that own:\n- the enterprise workflow surface,\n- the agent runtime/orchestration layer,\n- the governance/identity plane,\n- or the cloud platform where agents run.\n\nArista is more \u201cinfrastructure torque\u201d than \u201centerprise agent engineering control point.\u201d\n\n#### 2) Integrity/governance red flag at founder/board level\nThis is the biggest problem relative to your **non-negotiable integrity** requirement:\n\n- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Arista founder and former chairman Andreas \u201cAndy\u201d Bechtolsheim with insider trading; he settled and agreed to pay a civil penalty and accept a five\u2011year officer/director bar. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search18\ue202turn6news31\ue201\n\nEven though **this does not implicate CEO Ullal** (and the company emphasized the trades were not in Arista stock per contemporaneous reporting), it is still a material governance/integrity blemish attached to a central figure in the company\u2019s history and influence. \ue200cite\ue202turn6news31\ue202turn6search12\ue201\n\n### Additional strategic risk to value capture\nAI networking has become contested by **Nvidia\u2019s Ethernet networking push (Spectrum\u2011X)**; reporting around wins at Meta/Oracle highlights competitive pressure in AI networking. \ue200cite\ue202turn5news43\ue201\n\n### Management competence & vision\n- CEO Jayshree Ullal\u2019s long tenure and clear strategic messaging on Ethernet\u2019s role in AI is a strong positive. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn10search23\ue201\n- Arista also documents ethics programs (codes/training), which is a baseline positive \u2014 but not enough to erase the founder SEC event under your bar. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search19\ue201\n\n**Verdict:** **No (core list), but close/watchlist.**  \nIf I were building a *broader* \u201cAI infrastructure buildout\u201d list, Arista could be included. Under your \u201cintegrity is non-negotiable\u201d constraint and \u201centerprise agent engineering\u201d directness requirement, it **misses**.\n\n---\n\n## Nutanix (NTNX)\n\n### Why it\u2019s relevant\nNutanix is positioned around **enterprise private/hybrid infrastructure** \u2014 a plausible winner if enterprises decide agentic systems must run near sensitive data, on-premises, or in sovereign environments.\n\nEvidence:\n- Nutanix introduced **Nutanix Enterprise AI** as part of **GPT\u2011in\u2011a\u2011Box 2.0**, explicitly framed as a turnkey stack for private cloud deployments. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search13\ue202turn5search25\ue202turn5search9\ue201\n- NetworkWorld reported Nutanix Enterprise AI being enhanced with **NVIDIA AI Enterprise integration** to support **agentic workflows** across the enterprise. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search29\ue201\n- Nutanix has also been pushing \u201csovereignty\u201d and distributed control themes that plausibly map to regulated enterprise deployments. \ue200cite\ue202turn5news45\ue201\n\nSo it\u2019s not \u201cAI washing\u201d; there is concrete product and messaging alignment.\n\n### Why it fails a strict shortlist vs the strongest \u201ccontrol plane\u201d companies\n\n#### 1) Not a dominant control point in enterprise agent engineering\nNutanix is fundamentally an **infrastructure and virtualization/hybrid cloud platform** bet. That can benefit from AI, but \u201cagent engineering\u201d winners are usually the companies that:\n- own the *application/workflow surface* where agents are embedded,\n- or own the *cloud AI platform* where agents are built/run,\n- or own a *must-have governance/security/observability plane*.\n\nNutanix can be important, but it\u2019s not obviously the place where most agent value accrues.\n\n#### 2) Integrity / internal controls event (real, disclosed)\nThis is the key issue under your integrity constraint:\n\n- Nutanix disclosed that its audit committee investigation found evaluation software was used non-compliantly over multiple years and that certain employees concealed this use; the company identified a **material weakness** in internal control over financial reporting and planned remedial measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue202turn9search16\ue201\n\nTo be fair, I view the disclosure + accountability as **better than a cover-up** \u2014 the company stated employees were terminated and remediation was underway. \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue202turn9search16\ue201  \nBut under a *very strict* \u201cintegrity is non-negotiable\u201d screen, this is a meaningful governance/control blemish you can\u2019t hand-wave away.\n\n### Management quality signals\nNutanix has formal governance materials (code of conduct, governance documents, ESG governance posture). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn5search18\ue201  \nThat\u2019s a positive baseline, but again, formal docs don\u2019t negate the real incident.\n\n**Verdict:** **No (core list); watchlist only.**  \nIt has genuine enterprise/private\u2011AI positioning, but it\u2019s not a top \u201cagent engineering control point,\u201d and the internal-control incident makes it fail a strict integrity bar.\n\n---\n\n## Datadog (DDOG)\n\n### Why it *is* directly tied to enterprise AI agent engineering\nAgentic systems in production create a brutal operational problem: you need to measure, debug, govern, and secure systems whose \u201clogic\u201d is partly non-deterministic (model outputs, tool calls, agent handoffs). Observability becomes a gating constraint for enterprise adoption.\n\nDatadog is positioning *explicitly* for that:\n- Datadog expanded **Large Language Model (LLM) Observability** with **AI Agent Monitoring**, **LLM Experiments**, and an **AI Agents Console**, explicitly aimed at monitoring \u201cagentic AI,\u201d accelerating development, and improving performance. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search24\ue201\n- Google Cloud described Datadog adding monitoring for **Vertex AI Agent Engine** in Datadog\u2019s AI Agents Console \u2014 evidence of ecosystem-level integration rather than a standalone marketing claim. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search16\ue201\n- Datadog also launched **Bits AI SRE** (site reliability engineering = SRE) as an agent that investigates alerts with system context, positioned as a meaningful expansion of its AI strategy for operations. \ue200cite\ue202turn10search2\ue202turn10search6\ue201\n\nThis is about **operationalizing agentic systems**, not merely \u201cwe use AI internally.\u201d\n\n### Value capture / moat\nDatadog\u2019s core product is already embedded into engineering orgs, and it keeps widening integration surface area (e.g., \u201c1,000 integrations\u201d claim). \ue200cite\ue202turn9search29\ue201  \nIn practice, observability tools are sticky when they become the common language of reliability and incident response.\n\n### Management competence + vision\n- Datadog is founder-led: Olivier Pomel is a co-founder and has served as CEO since 2010, per SEC filings. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue202turn6search5\ue201\n- The product cadence around agent monitoring + experimentation + operational agents is exactly what \u201centerprise AI agent engineering\u201d needs. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn10search2\ue202turn5search24\ue201\n\n### Integrity / governance evidence (and what I can\u2019t prove)\nHard truth: outsiders can\u2019t *prove* integrity. You can only screen for signals and red flags.\n\nPositive governance signals:\n- Datadog publishes a **Code of Business Conduct and Ethics** and corporate governance documentation. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search5\ue201\n- SEC filings show governance mechanics like an incentive compensation **clawback policy** and prohibitions on hedging/pledging (not unique, but still positive discipline). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search5\ue201\n\nI did **not** find a leadership-level integrity event on the order of \u201cSEC insider trading by a founder/board leader\u201d (Arista) or \u201cmaterial weakness arising from concealed misconduct\u201d (Nutanix) in the sources I reviewed.\n\n### The main reason Datadog might still *not* be a top-5 pick\nNot integrity \u2014 it\u2019s business risk:\n- There has been reporting/analyst concern that OpenAI is (or may be) a very large customer and optimization/in-sourcing could create a revenue headwind. \ue200cite\ue202turn9news33\ue201\n\nThat\u2019s not a management-integrity failure, but it *is* a concentration/volatility risk that matters if you\u2019re looking for the \u201cbenefit most\u201d companies.\n\n**Verdict:** **Yes \u2014 Datadog is the only one of the four that clears the strict bar.**  \nIt\u2019s one of the cleanest \u201cagent engineering operations layer\u201d plays: monitoring, evaluation, governance, and incident response for agentic systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue202turn5search16\ue202turn10search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Summary verdict table\n\n| Company | Publicly traded (Feb 2026)?

has raised its fiscal 2026 revenue and adjusted profit forecasts, driven by strong enterprise cloud spending and increased monetization of its AI platform, Agentforce. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, companies continue to invest in artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, boosting Salesforce's outlook. Agentforce has secured over 8,000 deals, with half already paid, and its Data Cloud and AI services now exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Although Agentforce\u2019s monetization has lagged expectations, analysts anticipate it could become the company\u2019s top revenue source by the end of 2026.\n\nSalesforce also acquired Informatica for approximately $8 billion to strengthen its data tools, marking a significant return to major acquisitions. This move raises questions about the firm\u2019s ability to sustain growth independently of M&A activity. For fiscal 2026, Salesforce forecasted revenue between $41 billion and $41.3 billion, up from its previous guidance, and increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook to $11.27\u2013$11.33. Its Q1 revenue of $9.83 billion slightly surpassed expectations. Shares rose about 1.5% in extended trading following the announcement.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn10search0\ue202turn10search4\ue201","start_idx":2564,"end_idx":2598,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/","https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/11/18/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-informatica/","https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/11/18/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-informatica/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/11/18/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-informatica/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Salesforce

Open Compute Project (OCP) has launched a new initiative called Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN), aimed at creating open Ethernet standards for high-performance networking in AI clusters. Major tech companies including Meta, Nvidia, AMD, Cisco, and OpenAI are part of the collaboration, along with Arista, ARM, Broadcom, HPE Networking, Marvell, Microsoft, and Oracle. ESUN seeks to challenge InfiniBand, which currently dominates high-speed AI interconnects, by leveraging Ethernet\u2019s maturity, cost-efficiency, and engineer familiarity.\n\nThe group plans to establish standards for switch behavior, protocol headers, error handling, and lossless data transfer. It will work alongside the Ultra Ethernet Consortium and IEEE 802.3 to align with broader Ethernet development. Companies like Broadcom and Nvidia have already introduced Ethernet-based products targeted at AI scaling. While Ethernet offers openness and potential cost benefits, it must prove its reliability and low latency under demanding conditions to rival InfiniBand. The success of ESUN hinges on balancing performance with open standards in large-scale AI environments.","attribution":"TechRadar"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":47}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Open

Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, companies continue to invest in artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, boosting Salesforce's outlook. Agentforce has secured over 8,000 deals, with half already paid, and its Data Cloud and AI services now exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Although Agentforce\u2019s monetization has lagged expectations, analysts anticipate it could become the company\u2019s top revenue source by the end of 2026.\n\nSalesforce also acquired Informatica for approximately $8 billion to strengthen its data tools, marking a significant return to major acquisitions. This move raises questions about the firm\u2019s ability to sustain growth independently of M&A activity. For fiscal 2026, Salesforce forecasted revenue between $41 billion and $41.3 billion, up from its previous guidance, and increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook to $11.27\u2013$11.33. Its Q1 revenue of $9.83 billion slightly surpassed expectations. Shares rose about 1.5% in extended trading following the announcement.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Salesforce Completes Acquisition of

I'll be looking into their recent products, like Google Cloud, Snowflake's data cloud, and any relevant management updates. It\u2019s important to focus on their positioning, legal issues, and innovations. Once I gather relevant info, I'll assess if they belong on the list.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake against list constraints**\n\nOk, I need to recheck whether Google and Snowflake meet the list's criteria. Both are US-based and traded on US exchanges, so they qualify. I'll evaluate them based on AI-focused engineering, their role in cloud platforms, control over value capture, and execution\u2014like Google Cloud\u2019s AI tools. I'll also consider management integrity, factoring in regulatory concerns.\n\n**Evaluating integrity, vision, and tech capabilities**\n\nI need to weigh Snowflake's potential in agent engineering. While it's more of a data cloud platform, its role in the data layer is crucial for AI agents. As for Google, I have to scrutinize management integrity over issues like monopolies and privacy. I'll gather more details on both.\n\n**Assessing Snowflake's integrity and security posture**\n\nI'll check into Snowflake's security history and any potential lawsuits tied to the 2024 breaches involving stolen credentials. It doesn\u2019t seem like a management issue, but it\u2019s still important to verify their security practices. I'll gather current details to make sure all information is up-to-date.\n\n**Cross-checking evaluation criteria for Google and Snowflake**\n\nI need to review the web search results about Google and Snowflake, including leadership updates and predictions. The user wants a strict evaluation, so I'll compare them to my previous picks, considering management integrity and AI capabilities. I\u2019ll finalize which companies might fit within the existing list\u2014yes or no.\n\n**Clarifying \"Google\" and evaluating for integrity**\n\nWhen considering \"Google,\" I'll focus on Alphabet as the parent company, including its Cloud products and services. For Snowflake, I\u2019ll continue exploring its potential. I'll consult official Google Cloud sources and evaluate leadership under Sundar Pichai, balancing the legal and ethical implications of antitrust issues.\n\n**Evaluating Google's integrity and AI positioning**\n\nWhile Google faces regulatory challenges and privacy settlements, no major controversies or internal issues seem to affect its integrity. The company invests heavily in AI, but in terms of enterprise agent engineering, it faces tough competition from Microsoft and AWS. I'll evaluate leadership under Sundar Pichai and Thomas Kurian.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake's leadership and AI offerings**\n\nI need to assess Snowflake's leadership, including CEO Ramaswamy and the board, as well as the CFO. Snowflake's investments in AI tools like Cortex and support for OpenAI models are significant, especially with their new partnership. I\u2019ll explore how their data platform could position them in the agent engineering space.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake and Google for the user\u2019s picks**\n\nI need to explore Snowflake's AI tools like Cortex Agents, and review their OpenAI partnership. For Google, I'll look up management sources to assess leadership and ethics. The user wants a strict evaluation, so I'll compare Google and Snowflake with my previous picks, providing reasoning for whether they'd make the list. Also, I\u2019ll remember that both are US companies.\n\n**Breaking down Google\u2019s enterprise agent engineering focus**\n\nI\u2019m considering \u201cGoogle\u201d as Alphabet, focusing on Google Cloud, Workspace, and Gemini. Google has several tools in AI agent engineering, like Vertex AI Agent Builder and Gemini Enterprise. We need to evaluate these tools\u2019 potential value capture, considering Google's current cloud position and enterprise reach.\n\n**Examining Google\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and potential ethical concerns**\n\nGoogle excels in data analytics (BigQuery) and AI (Gemini), but faces challenges in go-to-market strategies and enterprise mindshare against Microsoft and AWS. Their management is solid, with Sundar Pichai and Thomas Kurian in leadership. However, ongoing antitrust cases may impact their integrity, requiring further research into controversies and rulings.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake and Google**\n\nWe've gathered good sources on the Google monopoly ruling and related developments. Next, we need to assess Snowflake\u2019s management and integrity, using CEO statements and SEC filings. We\u2019ll also compare Google and Snowflake to other companies like Microsoft, AWS, and Salesforce, applying strict criteria, especially in terms of integrity and vision.\n\n**Assessing Integrity for Google and Other Tech Firms**\n\nWe need to consider \"integrity\" as management's ethical behavior, not just corporate compliance. Google's recent monopoly ruling is significant\u2014even if contested. This raises concerns about exclusionary tactics. While big tech like Microsoft and Amazon also face antitrust, we may decide to exclude Google based on its repeated issues. We must apply consistent standards to evaluate all firms.\n\n**Evaluating Integrity and Consistency**\n\nIf we apply strict integrity criteria, it could affect some current picks, but the user didn't ask for a re-evaluation. However, as we compare Google to existing firms based on these criteria, we should also consider Amazon's regulatory past, though we have included some mega-caps due to other positive signals. For Google, the lack of positive ethical signals is a challenge, especially with the recent ruling on illegal monopoly.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake\u2019s Management and Integrity**\n\nI\u2019ll gather more detailed info from the docs, but search results will help too. For Snowflake\u2019s management, I have some press releases and details on their AI pivot. I also need to evaluate potential integrity concerns, like their customer account breaches in 2024 and lack of strong security protocols. Vision looks strong with investment in AI.\n\n**Investigating Snowflake's 2024 security breach and response**\n\nI need to look up Snowflake\u2019s 2024 breach and management\u2019s response, especially considering the stolen credentials and lack of multifactor authentication (MFA). They planned to enforce MFA by November 2025, but I need to verify that. I\u2019ll search for their security incident response to evaluate how proactive management was.\n\n**Evaluating integrity criteria for Google and Snowflake**\n\nFor Snowflake, we already have details on security changes which helps with governance, but we might need sources on its ethical standing like inclusion on \"most ethical\" lists. For Google, despite strong product engineering, the major antitrust issues and privacy fines bring questions about management integrity. Still, we must stay consistent in how we apply the integrity criteria.\n\n**Evaluating whether Snowflake belongs in the original list**\n\nSnowflake is integrating agentic AI tools and forming partnerships with OpenAI, which aligns well with enterprise agent engineering and data governance. Whether it would\u2019ve made our original list is unclear, but it could replace or add to companies like IBM. Including both Google and Snowflake brings the list to eight, which goes beyond our original limit.\n\n**Answering criteria for Snowflake and Google inclusion**\n\nUnder strict criteria, Snowflake might have made the list, possibly replacing IBM or adding to the group, thanks to its focus on data governance and competent management. However, security incidents should be mentioned. For Google, while it excels technically, its management integrity is questionable due to antitrust concerns\u2014I'd likely exclude it to be safe. Alternatively, Google could be included with caution.\n\n**Summarizing evaluation for Google and Snowflake inclusion**\n\nAlphabet/Google is a strong candidate from a tech/positioning perspective, but due to antitrust issues and ongoing appeals, its integrity risk is too high to include under non-negotiable integrity. Snowflake, on the other hand, would likely make the list, potentially replacing IBM or adding as a strong option, given its agentic AI tools, solid governance, and serious leadership approach. However, further comparison against existing picks is needed.\n\n**Comparing Google and Snowflake with competitors and citing relevant features**\n\nFor Google, we should compare it to Microsoft, AWS, Salesforce, and others in the areas of cloud, AI agents, and workflow surfaces. For Snowflake, we compare it to AWS, IBM, Datadog, and Salesforce, emphasizing its cross-cloud capabilities. We'll include citations for Snowflake's agentic AI features, governance, and Google\u2019s integrity issues. We also need to revisit strict criteria for both.\n\n**Evaluating management and integrity for Google and Snowflake**\n\nFor Google, while there are no personal scandals, their corporate antitrust violations may signal an integrity risk, rather than proven dishonesty. We should focus on assessing management competence\u2014looking at key executives, strategic launches like agent platforms, and innovative efforts. For Snowflake, similar evaluations are needed.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake & Google management**\n\nFor Snowflake, CEO Ramaswamy\u2019s background in enterprise AI and focus on security, especially post-incident improvements, showcase vision and integrity. For Google, while they heavily invest in AI infrastructure, the real focus should be on their expertise in enterprise AI agent engineering. Should Google be included in the shortlist? Maybe.\n\n**Evaluating Google & Snowflake for inclusion**\n\nGoogle could have made the list as a strong agent platform with credible management, though antitrust and privacy concerns raise integrity worries. Snowflake, while not as dominant as cloud providers, excels in data governance and could be included. The question remains: should we exclude Google for integrity or apply consistent criteria?\n\n**Refining integrity criteria**\n\nI think we should adjust the integrity criterion: instead of focusing solely on lawsuits, maybe we focus on leadership-level honesty, fraud, and transparency, plus strong governance and compliance. For example, Google's antitrust case may indicate concerns over integrity, but it\u2019s not necessarily fraud. We could apply this standard consistently across the shortlist.\n\n**Creating structured integrity evaluation**\n\nI think it\u2019s important to clearly separate management-level integrity signals (like ethical codes and fraud absence) from structural risks (such as antitrust). Under strict criteria, companies with major legal violations might fail. Using this, I could exclude Google due to integrity concerns but include Snowflake. Let's craft a structured table to assess various criteria for each company.\n\n**Collecting snowflake and google AI sources**\n\nI need to gather official sources on Snowflake and Google\u2019s agentic AI features.\n\nFor Snowflake, I'll collect relevant sources from press releases and news articles, from the Nov 2025 launch of its agentic AI features and its OpenAI partnership. For Google, I'll search blog posts and release notes from 2025 and 2026 about their AI tools and developments. I'll also check executive profiles for management details on Pichai.\n\n**Evaluating exec bios and integrity proxies**\n\nI\u2019ve found Thomas Kurian\u2019s bio from Google Cloud's press corner. For Sundar Pichai, I\u2019ll check Alphabet\u2019s investor relations for an official bio, but I may rely on Britannica for credibility. I\u2019ll also look into Newsweek\u2019s reliability rankings and see if Alphabet appears. For Snowflake, I\u2019ll check for integrity proxies like the Ethisphere list.\n\n**Checking Alphabet in Newsweek reliability list**\n\nI found that Snowflake ranks #50 in the Newsweek reliability ranking, which can support its management integrity. Snowflake also has a code of conduct, which adds to its credibility. Next, I\u2019ll check if Alphabet appears in the Newsweek reliability list by opening and searching directly.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake based on integrity**\n\nThe Newsweek reliability ranking places Google at #4 with a score of 88.83, which supports its integrity. However, Google also faces antitrust rulings, unlike Amazon or Microsoft. This could be a significant issue since the user emphasized management integrity. We should highlight red flags while giving a final decision: Google might have integrity risks, but Snowflake seems clearer.\n\n**Evaluating Google\u2019s integrity under strict criteria**\n\nThe user has asked for strict criteria, so we should apply a pass/fail approach. Given Google's strong ranking, code of conduct, and platform features, they might still make the list. However, the antitrust and privacy issues raise integrity concerns. If we focus strictly on court findings, Google fails, but using a more investor-focused integrity standard, they pass.\n\n**Evaluating Google under strict criteria**\n\nThe strict criteria could disqualify Google due to antitrust issues, but that might also challenge other mega-caps. User expects a clear answer, so I\u2019d say that, while Google faces integrity risks, it could still be included. Google's enterprise AI tools are growing, but it\u2019s still behind Microsoft and Amazon in cloud dominance, even with AI advancements.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake for shortlist**\n\nThe user asked for a small group of U.S. companies positioned to benefit most. Google has strong positioning in cloud, agent tools, and data analytics but faces legal issues and split focus. Snowflake, while not a cloud provider, could be key for data. I\u2019d say Google is borderline due to management challenges.\n\n**Rigorous evaluation of Google and Snowflake**\n\nUsing strict criteria, Google doesn't meet the \"non-negotiable\" requirement due to regulatory and integrity risks, despite its strong AI product stack and enterprise focus. Snowflake, however, qualifies with its AI products, partnerships, and solid reliability ranking. Google's competitive but faces significant challenges, notably antitrust and privacy issues.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake's inclusion**\n\nGoogle\u2019s high reliability ranking and focus on building an enterprise AI agent stack make a compelling case for inclusion. However, antitrust violations weigh on its overall integrity, which the user said is non-negotiable. Despite its strength in AI tools, this regulatory concern likely disqualifies Google. Snowflake remains investable and strong in AI, but Google\u2019s legal challenges are too significant to overlook.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake for inclusion**\n\nSnowflake has strong agent AI features (Cortex Agents, Snowflake Intelligence), partners with OpenAI, and controls a valuable data layer. While there\u2019s no major leadership scandal, issues like a past security incident were addressed responsibly. Snowflake's cross-cloud advantage holds, especially over competitors like Salesforce and AWS, making it a strong candidate for inclusion. However, competition with Databricks and heavy spending require caution.\n\n**Evaluating companies in the agent stack**\n\nI should create an overview for each company, explaining its place in the agent stack. I'll score them across various criteria (1\u20135), comparing them to picks like Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, etc. Google stands out for its cloud and productivity suite, but faces regulatory risks and isn't as enterprise-dominant as AWS/Azure.\n\n**Finalizing decisions on Snowflake and Google**\n\nGoogle might struggle to benefit fully due to litigation risks, which could distract management and harm profitability. They\u2019re also facing threats to partnerships, like with Apple\u2019s search deal. As for Snowflake, its data governance, AI, and cross-cloud features make a solid case, but it competes with big players like Databricks. I need to apply strict criteria and cite sources in my evaluation.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake's position**\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered more sources, including official press releases and news. Now, I can evaluate Google and Snowflake against existing picks, applying strict criteria. Google\u2019s regulatory risks and integrity concerns may limit its inclusion, while Snowflake appears a strong contender. However, I\u2019ll refine the shortlist accordingly.\n\n**Crafting final evaluation approach**\n\nTo answer whether Google should be on the list, I'll clarify the criteria: investability, directness, control point, execution clarity, management integrity, and vision. If Google qualifies, I'll explain why it was omitted earlier for brevity, but still provide a clear yes/no answer based on these factors.\n\n**Evaluating Google for the shortlist**\n\nGoogle scores well on investability, directness, and control, with strong AI and cloud services. The execution looks solid with ongoing feature releases. Management is experienced, but legal issues, including the ongoing monopoly case and fines, raise serious concerns regarding integrity. Given strict criteria, I\u2019d exclude Google from the shortlist.\n\n**Evaluating Google: strict criteria response**\n\nWhile Google would be top-tier on the agent engineering stack, the current regulatory and integrity issues, including the monopolization court findings and ongoing appeals, disqualify them under strict criteria. Therefore, despite their capabilities, I would exclude Alphabet/Google from the integrity-screened shortlist. \n\nNext, I'll focus on evaluating Snowflake.\n\n**Evaluating Snowflake vs Google**\n\nSnowflake is a strong contender \u2013 they\u2019ve recently expanded into enterprise AI through strategic partnerships like the $200M agreement with OpenAI. Their platform, centered on data governance and agent AI, fits well into the current landscape. Snowflake\u2019s leadership and security improvements suggest reliability. Compared to existing players, it could replace or complement IBM. \n\nGoogle, while strong in agent engineering, falls short on integrity due to ongoing regulatory issues. They\u2019re technically capable, but won\u2019t make the cut under strict criteria. \n\nSo, to summarize: Google \u2013 technically yes, but fails integrity; Snowflake \u2013 yes.\n\n**Final Evaluation on Google and Snowflake**\n\nI noticed none of the companies made Ethisphere's 2025 list, which wasn\u2019t necessary for integrity evaluation. Instead, I'll focus on higher-quality sources like Newsweek and Reuters. Google's Cloud platform shows significant agent engineering potential, particularly within Google Cloud and Workspace, even though advertising dominates their revenue. Snowflake, with its data foundation and strong security, also stands out.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake\u2019s position**\n\nGoogle Cloud is smaller than Azure and AWS, but with strong AI, it could gain share. Still, including Google alongside Microsoft and Amazon could be redundant given the user's small list request. Google would qualify but is more of a \"near-miss.\" Snowflake could also qualify based on its strong data layer, potentially outperforming IBM in data.\n\n**Final decision on Google and Snowflake**\n\nGoogle is a near miss, qualifying but not top of the list. It probably fits around 7th place, with a strong agent platform but regulatory concerns. Snowflake would also make the list, especially for data and agent platforms, but the user wants a smaller list. So, both would qualify, but the final call depends on strict criteria.\n\n**Final evaluation of Google and Snowflake**\n\nFor a small, strict shortlist, Google would be a near-miss. Its hyperscaler role can be covered by Microsoft and Amazon, and its legal/regulatory challenges push it off the list. Snowflake, however, makes the cut due to its governed data layer and strong agent tools. The final choice prioritizes Microsoft and Amazon over Google.\n\n**Final decision on Google and Snowflake**\n\nGiven the strict criteria, Google doesn't make the core shortlist primarily due to redundancy in hyperscalers and legal challenges. Snowflake, however, stands out with its unique control point in data-cloud and agent engineering. I'd suggest Snowflake for the shortlist, possibly replacing IBM, but with careful consideration of IBM's governance.\n\n**Clarifying the earlier shortlisted companies**\n\nThe user asked for a comparison to our previous picks, which we assume were Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, IBM, and perhaps Datadog (added later). We didn\u2019t provide an explicit list earlier, but we can mention these companies now as part of the comparison. We should proceed with this inference.\n\n**Crafting a structured response**\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned our existing shortlist, including companies like Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Salesforce, and IBM. I'll use this as the basis for comparison. The verdict: Google doesn\u2019t make the strict shortlist, but Snowflake does. I'll now work on finalizing the evaluation, providing explicit reasons, and following the established style guidelines.\n\n**Evaluating Google (Alphabet) for the shortlist**\n\nFor Google, its tools like Vertex AI, Gemini, and GCP show strong involvement in enterprise AI and its potential as an investment opportunity. There\u2019s solid execution evidence with released products and open-source components. However, its major antitrust issues and ongoing regulatory concerns are significant negative factors that may hurt its position for the shortlist.\n\n**Evaluating Google and Snowflake for the shortlist**\n\nFor Google, while its agent engineering stack is top-tier, antitrust findings and ongoing regulatory issues prevent it from making the shortlist. Its position as a third hyperscaler also makes it redundant when we already have Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nSnowflake, however, stands out with a strong agent engineering stack, solid execution with partnerships and acquisitions, and a governed data platform for agents. It meets the criteria for our shortlist."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 21m 2s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiaeast-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-187c30ab-143e-4898-b7f2-e4119bcfb885:AU","parent_id":"a0c56c0c-183f-48d8-8fe7-de7a512ff7f9","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_698a5b3f1a108191b572fef2fc37b459","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"698a5b3f-1cb4-8399-a16a-dbcd5d5a026d","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T22:10:07.558573Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"a0c56c0c-183f-48d8-8fe7-de7a512ff7f9","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"187c30ab-143e-4898-b7f2-e4119bcfb885","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"5cec865e-e25c-4677-9f21-921a0030587e","finished_duration_sec":1262,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a0c56c0c-183f-48d8-8fe7-de7a512ff7f9","children":["08d3ad19-ab24-434b-9f10-c9a633a896b3"]},"08d3ad19-ab24-434b-9f10-c9a633a896b3":{"id":"08d3ad19-ab24-434b-9f10-c9a633a896b3","message":{"id":"08d3ad19-ab24-434b-9f10-c9a633a896b3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770676270.761226,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I\u2019ll treat this like a **screening committee decision**: two candidates (Alphabet/Google and Snowflake) evaluated against the same \u201centerprise AI agent engineering\u201d thesis and a **hard integrity bar**.\n\n## The strict gates (same as before, explicitly enforced)\n\nA company only \u201cmakes the shortlist\u201d if it clears **all** of these:\n\n1) **Investable**: actively traded on a major U.S. exchange  \n2) **Direct exposure**: sells *agent engineering* capabilities (build/deploy/operate/govern multi\u2011agent systems), not just \u201cAI adjacent\u201d  \n3) **Control point + value capture**: has pricing power / platform gravity at a critical layer (runtime, workflow action surface, data foundation, infrastructure bottleneck, governance/observability)  \n4) **Execution reality**: shipping evidence (GA features, credible enterprise lifecycle tooling) vs. marketing  \n5) **Management competence + vision + integrity**: integrity is not \u201cno controversy\u201d;

The press release also notes he was Snowflake\u2019s **SVP of AI** and Frank Slootman stayed as Chairman. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\nThat\u2019s exactly the management profile you\u2019d want for this transition: \u201cAI leader promoted into CEO role\u201d rather than a CEO bolting AI on as a side quest.\n\n## E) Integrity (including how management behaves under stress)\nSnowflake has a real integrity/competence stress test: the **2024 Snowflake customer environment data theft/extortion wave**.\n\nA key, factual point from Google\u2019s own threat intel write\u2011up: affected customer instances often did **not require multi\u2011factor authentication (MFA)** and credentials were stale. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n\nWhat matters for your integrity filter is how leadership responds:\n\n- Snowflake announced it would **enforce MFA by default** for all human users in accounts created as of **October 2024**, explicitly aligning with \u201cSecure By Design\u201d principles. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \n- Snowflake documentation also describes the rollout to **require MFA** for human users using passwords and to **disallow passwords** for service users, i.e., moving away from single-factor password sign-ins. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue201  \n\nThis is not \u201cproof of virtue,\u201d but it is a **good operational integrity signal**: they took a widely criticized security weakness (optional MFA posture) and moved it toward secure defaults. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search4\ue201  \n\n### Snowflake verdict\n**Would Snowflake have made my shortlist?**  \n**Yes.** Snowflake is one of the most direct \u201centerprise agent engineering\u201d monetizers outside the hyperscalers because it sits at the enterprise data foundation, and it has shipped agentic orchestration features (Cortex Agents, Snowflake Intelligence) plus the surrounding governance/ops plumbing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \n\n---\n\n# If I were forced to keep the list \u201csmall,\u201d what changes?\nIf your shortlist must stay at ~6 names, then the cleanest \u201cswap\u201d would be:\n\n- **Add Snowflake.**\n- **Keep AWS + Microsoft** (you want at least one/two hyperscaler agent platforms).\n- **Keep one workflow surface** (ServiceNow or Salesforce) and **NVIDIA** for the infrastructure bottleneck.\n- **IBM becomes the most replaceable** in the original set under a pure \u201cagent engineering platform value capture\u201d lens (IBM\u2019s integrity signaling can be strong, but Snowflake\u2019s data control point is more central to agent deployment).  \n\nThat said, if your integrity weighting favors \u201cethics brand + governance reputation\u201d over \u201cstack centrality,\u201d you might keep IBM *and* add Snowflake by trimming elsewhere (e.g., do you really need both Salesforce and ServiceNow in a tiny list? depends on your view of workflow dominance).\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent context on Google integrity risk and Snowflake agentic push\ue202turn1news40,turn1news39,turn0news41,turn0news40,turn0news44,turn1news42\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search1\ue201","start_idx":2180,"end_idx":2212,"safe_urls":["https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder","https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/overview","https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google Cloud Documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Vertex AI Agent Builder overview","url":"https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Vertex AI Agent Builder is a suite of products that help developers build, scale, and govern AI agents in production.

The DOJ indicated it would challenge the remedy decisions made by DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who had previously ruled that Google should share its search data with rivals and refrain from exclusive distribution deals that could restrict competitors. However, Judge Mehta did not require Google to divest its Chrome browser or stop paying for preloaded placement of its search or AI products. Google had already filed to appeal the ruling and requested a stay on the imposed remedies. The cross-appeal reflects that both the DOJ and Google seek changes to the initial court-imposed remedies.","attribution":"The Verge"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn1search22\ue201","start_idx":6323,"end_idx":6355,"safe_urls":["https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google","https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/us-states-file-appeal-google-search-case-court-filing-shows-2026-02-03/","https://www.reuters.com/world/us-states-file-appeal-google-search-case-court-filing-shows-2026-02-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-states-file-appeal-google-search-case-court-filing-shows-2026-02-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"US files appeal in Google search antitrust case","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-states-file-appeal-google-search-case-court-filing-shows-2026-02-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1770152398,"snippet":"The U.S. government and a majority of U.S. states are appealing a federal judge\u2019s 2024 ruling in a major antitrust case against Google.

I\u2019ll also factor in integrity and antitrust concerns as I refine my response.\n\n**Assessing Google\u2019s inclusion in shortlist**\n\nGoogle could be considered if the enterprise is willing to accept higher governance risks. However, decisions are often constrained by factors like procurement, cloud standardization, and data residency needs. I\u2019ll note that engineering team decisions for foundational stacks are also influenced by these constraints, and the software layer might offer the highest margin capture.\n\n**Checking details on 78% claim**\n\nThe cost isn\u2019t just about inference; factors like integration, data egress, security, compliance, and staff skills all play a significant role.

For the 78% cost reduction in Gemini serving, I have results from some media outlets, but I need more authoritative confirmation, ideally from Alphabet's Q4 2025 earnings call or their official transcript. I'll search for that.\n\n**Evaluating user\u2019s argument for Google\u2019s inclusion**\n\nI\u2019ve found quality sources confirming the 78% reduction claim, including Alphabet's investor relations page and Google's own blog. Now, the user argues for Google\u2019s inclusion based on stack-first decisions. I'll acknowledge the point and then explain my reasoning: I initially excluded Google due to integrity concerns and redundancy, added revenue capture factors, and cost advantages.\n\n**Responding to user's argument**\n\nI\u2019ll acknowledge that foundational stack decisions happen early, and Google has strong product evidence with tools like Vertex AI, ADK, and cost efficiencies. However, enterprise decisions depend on cloud commitments, compliance, and vendor risk. So, shifting an enterprise to GCP just for agent workloads is not simple. As for the cost advantage, the 78% reduction in Gemini serving costs doesn't necessarily relate to customer prices\u2014it's worth verifying how GCP charges.\n\n**Addressing pricing and advantages**\n\nI should search for pricing or discounts, though it might not be public. Regarding TPUs, GCP offers custom versions that can lower total cost of ownership, but compatibility issues with PyTorch can be a barrier\u2014however, improvements like TorchTPU are helping. For enterprise agent inference, GPUs are often preferred, but GCP\u2019s TPUs could still offer an advantage. As for ADK's flexibility, it's indeed model and deployment-agnostic, but using Google\u2019s ecosystem may create some lock-in, despite being open-source and reducing friction to switch.\n\n**Considering enterprise agent decisions and revenue capture**\n\nEngineering teams often prefer existing open-source frameworks like LangChain or LangGraph, especially in companies with established toolsets. For enterprise agents, deployments typically start from platforms like ServiceNow or Salesforce because of top-down decisions influenced by IT or line-of-business budgets. These choices are shaped by pre-existing vendor relationships, like Microsoft's identity dominance. Regarding revenue capture, while hyperscalers dominate infrastructure, SaaS platforms capture higher-margin subscription revenue, offering more customer stickiness.\n\n**Evaluating Google\u2019s potential inclusion and integrity risks**\n\nThe rise of enterprise AI agents could shift control to hyperscalers, potentially reducing SaaS\u2019s role, but it\u2019s not certain. Not every Google deployment on Vertex Agent Engine will generate revenue for them, as some may use other clouds or on-prem setups. I still maintain my stance on integrity risks with Google, though I could suggest including them conditionally, based on regulatory risk acceptance. My current list includes AWS, Microsoft, NVIDIA, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and maybe Google.\n\n**Considering Google\u2019s inclusion and engineering assumptions**\n\nMy original exclusion of Google is due to integrity concerns and potential redundancy, but if those are relaxed, it could be included. Under strict integrity rules, it stays off the list. I also want to critique assumptions about engineering picking foundational stacks. Often, SaaS or pre-built platforms like Microsoft 365 or Slack drive adoption. Not all agents use Vertex AI for orchestration\u2014many may choose open-source or alternate runtimes. Understanding the shift towards data co-location and network elasticity is important here.\n\n**Clarifying Google\u2019s cost advantage and foundational decisions**\n\nThe user argues that foundational decisions occur first, where Google captures revenue, citing the 78% cost reduction in Gemini serving. We\u2019ve verified the 78% reduction, but we should clarify that it applies to \"Gemini serving unit costs\" specifically, not general costs. Google\u2019s CEO also reinforces that cheaper inference with similar quality can drive adoption to GCP.\n\n**Analyzing Google's cost advantage and ADK claim**\n\nSwitching costs could offset cost advantages, as many enterprises prioritize features, reliability, and integration. Plus, being on Azure or AWS adds complexity. The 100-line claim for ADK is more marketing; real enterprise agents often exceed 100 lines, as productionization includes tests, monitoring, and CI/CD. Nonetheless, ADK\u2019s code-first approach is appealing.\n\n**Evaluating Google's open-source ADK and lock-in**\n\nADK is model-agnostic, but running on Agent Engine ties you into GCP, though its deployment flexibility reduces lock-in. That means Google can\u2019t guarantee full infrastructure revenue unless it delivers the best TCO/performance. GCP\u2019s market share is smaller than AWS or Azure, but rapid growth supports its future viability.\n\n**Evaluating Google\u2019s strategy and challenges**\n\nGoogle\u2019s approach offers a stack-first model, but that\u2019s not always the case. What matters for returns is incremental value, not just cost. The \"model-agnostic\" ADK reduces lock-in, and cost improvements show vertical integration. However, antitrust rulings introduce legal risk, and GCP faces trust and procurement challenges. Multi-cloud could dilute control.\n\n**Evaluating integrity in Google's inclusion**\n\nWhile I initially said no to including Google due to antitrust issues, I now see that if I treat integrity as management not being involved in crime, and focus purely on economic factors, Google could be a contender. However, given the antitrust ruling, I prioritize integrity and governance, so I\u2019ll stick with my no.\n\n**Critiquing Google and GCP's advantages**\n\nI shouldn\u2019t sugar-coat things. While the argument about GCP capturing revenue at every layer is valid, it's overstated. Many enterprises start with workflow vendors, not building agents from scratch. Also, cost reductions may stem from internal efficiency rather than price reduction. Additionally, the ADK's open approach may reduce lock-in.\n\n**Considering Google\u2019s capex risk and framework adjustments**\n\nGoogle\u2019s projected $175-185B capex in 2026 might affect free cash flow, but could benefit long-term growth. We could adjust the framework by categorizing \"Layer 0\" for hyperscalers, \"Layer 1\" for data, and \"Layer 2\" for SaaS. If we prioritize revenue capture over regulatory risk, Google would be included, but under strict integrity guidelines, they\u2019d still be excluded.\n\n**Responding to user's enterprise AI stack argument**\n\nThe user claims that enterprise engineering teams prioritize foundational stack first, ensuring that cloud providers, like Google and Amazon, capture revenue. They argue that Google benefits from a cost advantage and ADK\u2019s open approach. However, while these factors matter, regulatory concerns and integrity should still guide my evaluation.\n\n**Affirming and evaluating Google's position in the foundational stack**\n\nI agree that \"Layer 0\" works for many greenfield engineering projects. However, many enterprises adopt agent capabilities via existing SaaS solutions, accounting for procurement, security, multi-cloud, and decoupled vendors.\n\nRegarding Google, their cost reduction claims and TPU performance are notable but also raise concerns due to regulatory risks. While their \"Layer 0\" position might make them a strong contender, antitrust issues affect their inclusion as a core pick.\n\n**Revisiting integrity and enterprise adoption factors**\n\nYou're right, bottom-up adoption often leads to hyperscalers monetizing infrastructure sooner. However, for enterprise agent adoption, incumbents, like Microsoft with Copilot, can dominate. Engineering teams might not go for Vertex if they already have infrastructure. Cost savings matter, but integration costs often outweigh inference costs. It's a nuanced balance, especially when considering enterprise workflows."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 21m 9s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiaeast-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-fdeb65d4-8f0e-4e46-96f1-99ecadda2794:AU","parent_id":"efa438de-9223-43cd-998c-d88c355b2fac","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_698a9f395ed88191aa3aff0213ab96ba","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"698a9f39-9a08-839a-86f7-361003190ce6","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-10T03:00:09.896920Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"efa438de-9223-43cd-998c-d88c355b2fac","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"fdeb65d4-8f0e-4e46-96f1-99ecadda2794","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"c57acca5-bcd7-4845-b196-13ffc93bdbb0","finished_duration_sec":1269,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"efa438de-9223-43cd-998c-d88c355b2fac","children":["20939f91-0319-4064-9b8d-f97703fae094"]},"20939f91-0319-4064-9b8d-f97703fae094":{"id":"20939f91-0319-4064-9b8d-f97703fae094","message":{"id":"20939f91-0319-4064-9b8d-f97703fae094","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770693679.842846,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Your causal chain is directionally right **for one important adoption path**: when an enterprise engineering org is building a bespoke, internally owned agent system, the \u201cfirst\u201d choices tend to be foundational: **model(s), compute, framework, runtime, deployment**. In that path, the hyperscaler that hosts inference and the agent runtime can capture spend on every invocation.\n\nBut as stated, your argument **over-generalizes how enterprises actually adopt agentic systems** and **overstates how reliably cost advantage translates into platform share**. Here\u2019s the rigorous breakdown.\n\n---\n\n## Where your argument is correct (and you have strong evidence)\n\n### 1) Hyperscalers do monetize \u201cbelow\u201d the application layer\nIf an agent runs on a managed runtime, the cloud provider captures:\n- model inference calls,\n- runtime compute and memory,\n- networking,\n- logging/monitoring/storage,\n- and often tool integrations.\n\nThis is explicitly the point of a managed agent runtime such as **Vertex AI Agent Engine** (Google) that \u201cdeploy[s], manage[s], and scale[s] AI agents in production\u201d and \u201chandles the infrastructure to scale agents.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201\n\n### 2) Google is explicitly pushing \u201cdeveloper pull\u201d with ADK + managed deployment\nGoogle is not hiding the strategy: **Vertex AI Agent Builder** markets that you can \u201cbuild production-ready agents in under 100 lines of \u2026 Python,\u201d using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \nAnd the ADK is described (in Google\u2019s own docs) as **open-source**, **model-agnostic**, **deployment-agnostic**, and compatible with other frameworks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search22\ue201\n\nThat does align with what engineering teams want: fast iteration + an escape hatch if they need to switch models/frameworks.\n\n### 3) The \u201c78% Gemini serving unit cost reduction\u201d claim is real (and primary-sourced)\nThis isn\u2019t rumor. Alphabet\u2019s CEO remarks explicitly state they \u201clower[ed] Gemini serving unit costs by **78%** over 2025\u201d through optimizations and utilization improvements, while also highlighting their own **tensor processing units (TPUs)** (tensor processing unit = Google\u2019s custom AI accelerator) developed \u201cfor a decade.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\nSo your \u201cvertical integration matters\u201d point is grounded.\n\n### 4) Google is also pricing some Gemini tiers aggressively\nExample: Google\u2019s own product blog states **Gemini 3 Flash** pricing at **$0.50 per 1M input tokens** and **$3 per 1M output tokens**. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view4\ue201  \nFor comparison, Anthropic\u2019s own announcement for **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** lists **$3 per 1M input tokens** and **$15 per 1M output tokens**. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search6\ue201\n\nThat doesn\u2019t prove \u201ccomparable quality\u201d for *your* workloads, but it does support the thesis that Google can compete hard on cost for high-volume agent use-cases where \u201cgood enough + cheap + fast\u201d wins.\n\n---\n\n## Where your argument overreaches (important in real enterprise deployments)\n\n### 1) In many enterprises, \u201cthe first decision\u201d is not AWS vs GCP \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cwhat are we already locked into?\u201d\nEnterprise cloud selection is often pre-determined by:\n- **Enterprise discount programs (EDPs)** (AWS) and **enterprise agreements (EAs)** (Microsoft),\n- security baselines and identity,\n- data residency commitments,\n- network topology,\n- and existing operational tooling.\n\nSo the first *practical* decision is often: \u201cHow do we do agents on the platform we already have contractual gravity toward?\u201d That\u2019s why (even if GCP is cheaper per token) a lot of agent workloads will still land on AWS/Azure because the enterprise already has multi-year economic incentives and compliance approvals there.\n\nCost matters, but **switching costs + procurement inertia** often matter more.\n\n### 2) The \u201cframework is portable\u201d trend cuts both ways\nYou\u2019re highlighting ADK\u2019s portability (\u201cany model / any framework\u201d). That\u2019s a double-edged sword **for Google\u2019s value capture**:\n\n- **Good for adoption**: model-agnostic / deployment-agnostic makes engineers more willing to start with it. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n- **Bad for lock-in**: if a team can develop with ADK but deploy elsewhere, Google loses the \u201ctax the runtime forever\u201d benefit.\n\nGoogle\u2019s counter-move is obvious: make deployment to **Vertex AI Agent Engine** the path of least resistance. But the mere fact that ADK is designed to be portable means you can\u2019t assume \u201cADK adoption \u21d2 GCP runtime capture\u201d at 1:1.\n\n### 3) A lot of enterprise agent spend is not inference \u2014 it\u2019s governance + integration + ownership cost\nFor enterprise agent engineering, the dominant cost centers often become:\n- permissioning and identity,\n- auditability and controls,\n- data access governance,\n- integration testing and change management,\n- incident response / rollback,\n- human oversight workflows,\n- and org-wide adoption costs.\n\nThose map very directly to platforms like ServiceNow/Salesforce *because they own the \u201caction surfaces\u201d* (where agents do work with real permissions). Even if the \u201cstack\u201d decision happens first in an architecture diagram, **the budget** and **the risk committee** often anchor on the workflow system where actions happen.\n\nSo: hyperscalers are unavoidable, but \u201cflowing to AWS/GCP before ServiceNow/Salesforce\u201d is not universal. In many deployments it\u2019s reversed: the business buys an \u201cagentic workflow product,\u201d and engineering\u2019s job is to integrate it.\n\n### 4) \u201c78% lower serving cost\u201d \u2260 \u201ccustomers get 78% cheaper inference\u201d\nThe 78% metric is **Google\u2019s internal serving unit cost** reduction. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \nIt *enables*:\n- price cuts,\n- margin expansion,\n- or subsidized adoption.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t force any of those. Google could use it to preserve margins while matching competitor prices, or selectively discount only for strategic accounts. Your gravitational-pull argument only fully holds if the savings are passed through in a way that changes procurement outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Does your argument change my \u201cGoogle vs my shortlist\u201d conclusion?\n\n### If the shortlist is \u201cwho captures the foundational agent stack spend?\u201d\nThen yes: **Google belongs in the top tier with AWS and Microsoft**, because they have:\n- proprietary accelerators (TPUs) and full-stack optimization, \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201  \n- a credible agent dev framework + managed runtime story (ADK + Agent Engine), \ue200cite\ue202turn0search22\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- and credible cost-down + aggressive pricing options for at least some model tiers. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view4\ue202turn3search6\ue201  \n\nSo **on technical positioning + value-capture mechanics**, your critique lands.\n\n### Why I still kept Google out of a *small*, integrity-weighted shortlist\nYou set \u201cgood integrity\u201d as non-negotiable. My earlier exclusion wasn\u2019t \u201cGoogle isn\u2019t positioned\u201d \u2014 it was \u201cintegrity / governance risk is materially elevated.\u201d\n\nThere is an active, court-level antitrust posture:\n- Reuters reports the U.S. government and states are appealing aspects of the Google search antitrust case, after a 2024 ruling that found Google has an online search monopoly, with remedies still contested on appeal. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news32\ue201  \n- The DOJ publicly describes \u201csignificant remedies\u201d won in its monopolization case. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n\nYou may view that as \u201cregulatory risk\u201d rather than \u201cintegrity,\u201d but under a strict integrity screen it\u2019s hard to treat it as irrelevant to management and corporate conduct.\n\nSo my position becomes:\n- **Technically / economically:** Google is *absolutely* a top-tier agent platform contender.\n- **Under your integrity constraint (as I interpret it):** Google remains a near-miss unless you decide antitrust conduct is not disqualifying for \u201cmanagement integrity.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## What would actually prove (or disprove) your \u201cGCP gravitational pull\u201d thesis over the next 6\u201318 months\n\nIf you want to be rigorous rather than narrative-driven, watch for these *observable* signals:\n\n1) **Enterprise Agent Engine adoption**: public customer references + measurable growth in Agent Engine / Agent Builder usage (not just \u201cGemini API tokens\u201d).  \n2) **Price pass-through**: sustained lower effective prices (after discounts) vs AWS/Azure, not just internal cost down.  \n3) **Model parity for enterprise workloads**: quality consistency on enterprise tasks (tool use, long-context retrieval, function calling reliability), not leaderboard anecdotes.  \n4) **Procurement wins**: signs that large regulated enterprises are moving *new* agent workloads to GCP, overcoming existing EDP/EA gravity.  \n5) **Regulatory overhang trajectory**: whether remedies/appeals begin to constrain distribution deals or data sharing in ways that affect the broader platform\u2019s risk profile. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news32\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \n\n---\n\nIf you want a clean resolution: your argument is strong enough that **Google should be treated as a \u201ctop-tier agent infrastructure winner candidate\u201d**. Whether it *belongs* in your shortlist depends on whether you enforce integrity as \u201cno major ongoing legal/governance red flags,\u201d or as \u201cno evidence of dishonest financial reporting / self-dealing / insider misconduct.\u201d\n\nBecause you called integrity non-negotiable, that definitional choice is the fulcrum.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent sources on Google\u2019s agent stack, cost-down, and integrity-risk context\ue202turn1news24,turn1news25,turn2news32,turn2news33,turn0news45,turn2news42,turn2news43\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":1136,"end_idx":1156,"safe_urls":["https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/overview","https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google Cloud Documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Vertex AI Agent Engine overview","url":"https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Vertex AI Agent Engine, a part of the Vertex AI Platform, is a set of services that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale AI agents in production.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Google Cloud Documentation"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":1432,"end_idx":1451,"safe_urls":["https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder","https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Vertex AI Agent Builder","url":"https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Build production-ready agents in under 100 lines of intuitive Python Code, Java and with support for more languages coming soon.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Google Cloud"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search22\ue201","start_idx":1605,"end_idx":1625,"safe_urls":["https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-development-kit/overview","https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-development-kit/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Google Cloud Documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-development-kit/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Overview of Agent Development Kit | Vertex AI Agent Builder","url":"https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-development-kit/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Google Cloud Documentation"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201","start_idx":2168,"end_idx":2200,"safe_urls":["https://abc.xyz/investor/events/event-details/2026/2025-Q4-Earnings-Call-2026-Dr_C033hS6/default.aspx","https://abc.xyz/investor/events/event-details/2026/2025-Q4-Earnings-Call-2026-Dr_C033hS6/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q4-2025/","https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q4-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([blog.google](https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q4-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Alphabet earnings, Q4 2025: CEO's remarks","url":"https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q4-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1770163200,"snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 As we scale, we're getting dramatically more efficient: we were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Alphabet Investor Relations -

I need to research current trends and predictions in tech. I\u2019ll look for comparisons, considering developments in AI and tech strategies. I\u2019ll make sure to present up-to-date info and caution against over-simplifying these huge shifts.\n\n**Evaluating the future of Google and speculation on AI-driven platforms**\n\nI\u2019ll look into recent developments like the Google antitrust case and platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. Google\u2019s stronghold in search and distribution makes it different from Yahoo\u2019s fall due to technological shifts. I\u2019ll approach this with caution, especially pointing out speculative elements and potential future platforms.\n\n**Evaluating the future of Google and the next big tech player**\n\nI\u2019m considering possible contenders after Google, like OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, and others. The key question is who will become the default interface for information and commerce. I need to challenge the Yahoo analogy\u2014Google has a more diverse business and stronger infrastructure. Additionally, I should mention management integrity and the impact of regulation and antitrust challenges. This could affect the future landscape.\n\n**Gathering sources for tech comparison and predictions**\n\nI\u2019ll search for relevant information on Google\u2019s 78% cost reduction, ongoing antitrust updates, and OpenAI's new enterprise platform. I might refer to Yahoo\u2019s history briefly but will rely on general knowledge, focusing on Google\u2019s current situation and key facts for comparisons. Time to gather some details!\n\n**Analyzing whether Google could become another Yahoo**\n\nIt's not a simple question, but we can break it down: Yahoo was a portal and lost relevance due to shifts in technology, like search innovation. If Google were to face a similar situation, it would be driven by changes in AI, user behavior, and regulation. An AI-powered search assistant could disrupt ads, but Google\u2019s infrastructure may still help it adapt.\n\n**Considering the next tech giant after Google**\n\nFor a company to become the next Google, it needs broad distribution through a default channel, like an OS, browser, or platform with strong network effects. Monetization via ads or other means is crucial. Open-source models could reduce reliance on a single provider but still require aggregation. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Apple could potentially take the lead, depending on their progress.\n\n**Weighing risk and adaptability of Google**\n\nGoogle could turn into a Yahoo-like scenario if it doesn't adapt to shifts in interfaces or manage to keep developer and user interest, especially while being constrained by its ad-based model. However, investments in Gemini and AI agents might prevent this. Google\u2019s infrastructure and compute capabilities set it apart from Yahoo. Predicting this is speculative, so I\u2019ll make sure to include citations to back it up.\n\n**Gathering more sources and updates**\n\nI need to gather more recent sources to verify a few things. I'll check for articles on AI agents and their potential to disrupt search engines\u2014market commentary could be useful, but it\u2019s not essential. Also, I\u2019ll look into updates on Gemini 3 pricing, Microsoft Copilot adoption, OpenAI's distribution, Apple\u2019s AI, and AWS agent services. I'll be gathering sources on these, but some info might not be strictly necessary and I'll prioritize what's most relevant.\n\n**Searching for relevant updates and sources**\n\nI\u2019ll search for:\n\n- \"ChatGPT monthly active users 2026\" or similar to estimate growth. \n- \"Microsoft Copilot AI agents\" to see how their platform is expanding.\n- \"Apple Siri Intelligence agent\" to find updates on their AI.\n- \"Perplexity default search on iPhone\" for new developments.\n\nI'll collect these and add more context in a user-friendly way, with a navlist to wrap things up.\n\n**Presenting Google vs. Yahoo scenario with caution**\n\nI\u2019ll approach this question with scenario analysis\u2014quantifying probabilities and exploring categories like interface shifts, distribution, and competition. Since the user is a math researcher, I\u2019ll keep the structure clear but avoid overconfidence, mentioning the potential of companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Apple in this evolving landscape.\n\n**Comparing Google and Yahoo, and predicting the next \"Google\"**\n\nI\u2019ll highlight how Google differs from Yahoo: stronger tech, data, vertical integration, and distribution via Android/Chrome. Google\u2019s ad-driven revenue and AI investments are key. For failure modes like interface disruption or regulatory challenges, I'll emphasize risks like declining search revenue. As for \"next Google,\" I\u2019ll discuss top candidates like OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\n**Citing key facts for accuracy**\n\nI\u2019ll cite sources for key factual statements: Google's 78% cost reduction (from their blog), OpenAI's Frontier release (from their site), ChatGPT\u2019s 800M active users (via Reuters), and antitrust-related news (from Reuters). I\u2019ll also mention Microsoft and Apple\u2019s AI deals and related statements, citing Microsoft\u2019s blog and other primary sources like Reuters.\n\n**Discussing Google's future and AI stack**\n\nThe user mentions \u201cdoorway to AI\u201d and \u201cfull AI stack.\u201d While Google could emphasize their \"full AI stack\" in marketing, it's not crucial here. Critically, enterprises\u2019 AI decisions might be constrained by existing architecture and vendor deals. Google risks becoming another Yahoo if its search dominance is weakened by changing consumer interfaces or distribution deals, like with Apple. AI integration into search might swing either way, with potential publisher-led lawsuits affecting this.\n\n**Exploring the \"doorway\" concept and Google's future**\n\nThe comparison of Yahoo as the doorway to the internet and Google as the full AI stack is interesting. Yahoo's decline happened because search (Google) outperformed its directory, and platform shifts occurred (like social networks). While a citation on Yahoo\u2019s \u201cportal\u201d role could be useful, it's a widely known concept, so we can proceed without it. I'll do a quick search for context.\n\n**Framing Google's potential future scenario**\n\nTo answer whether Google could become another Yahoo, we need to start by framing the question: It\u2019s possible, but it would require a shift in Google\u2019s role as the default information interface, mainly due to the rise of agents, alongside disruptions in distribution and monetization.\n\nI will outline a \"Yahoo moment\" and differences and explore different scenarios:\n1) Google adapts and stays dominant.\n2) A multipolar model with various assistants at OS-level integration, reducing Google\u2019s dominance.\n3) Disintermediation, with a new assistant taking Google\u2019s place, turning Google into a more niche player like Yahoo. I'll also consider probabilities for these possibilities.\n\n**Candidates for \"next Google\" after Google**\n\nThe next \"Google\" could be:\n\n- **Microsoft**: Due to its strong enterprise distribution (Office, Windows, Copilot), growing agent control like Agent 365. (Note: statistic from Microsoft Ignite upcoming blog).\n  \n- **OpenAI**: With ChatGPT\u2019s 800 million weekly active users and the Frontier launch, OpenAI is developing a strong enterprise platform with potential for monetization.\n  \n- **Apple**: With built-in Siri chatbot functionalities and a Gemini deal, Apple\u2019s OS integration could reshape the interface, potentially shifting how users access information.\n\n**Who might follow Google?**\n\nApple\u2019s device distribution could place it in a dominant position. Then we have:\n\n- **Amazon**: With commerce and AWS, but Alexa\u2019s role seems uncertain.\n  \n- **Meta**: Could make a play with its social network, though still unclear.\n  \n- **A new entrant**: Perplexity, with its Chrome bid, shows ambition. However, the \"next Google\" could be a *protocol-level* shift, like Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), not just a company. The future could be an ecosystem, not one entity.\n\n**Defining \"becoming another Yahoo\"**\n\nYahoo\u2019s downfall stemmed from lacking control over core technology (like search), a risk that Google faces if regulations force it to change its default search agreements. Google\u2019s more secure, though, as it\u2019s developing its own models and infrastructure (e.g., Gemini, TPUs). Still, the risk remains due to potential regulatory pressure.\n\n**Analyzing Google's potential downfall like Yahoo**\n\nLosing its dominant gateway status would mean Google becomes secondary, shifting from a primary brand to one just like other cloud/infrastructure companies. The risks include:\n\n- Shift to assistants/agents reducing searches\n- Antitrust actions reducing distribution\n- Lawsuits/content regulations decreasing search value\n- AI model commodification leading to multi-agent platforms\n\n**Identifying potential next Google candidates**\n\nIn the future, different companies could become the dominant player in various domains: OpenAI or Apple might control the consumer assistant gateway; Microsoft could lead the enterprise productivity space; Amazon could be a contender for commerce; or we could see a fragmented landscape rather than one clear successor.\n\n**Answering the \u201cnext Google\u201d question**\n\nGoogle could mimically follow Yahoo\u2019s path if a shift happens from web search to assistant-controlled agents. However, Google has diversified its tech stack and owns major distribution points (Android, Chrome), unlike Yahoo. Yet, regulatory actions, interface shifts, or trust issues with content could create vulnerabilities. The next Google could be Microsoft, OpenAI, or Apple driven by control over defaults.\n\n**Choosing the next Google**\n\nThe next Google could emerge through different avenues: \n\n- **Microsoft**, with its focus on enterprise and Agent 365.\n- **OpenAI**, if it extends its consumer and enterprise reach via ChatGPT and Frontier.\n- **Apple**, controlling device-level assistants like Siri and managing default search rights.\n\nThere may also be no single winner, but a multi-polar landscape with different players dominating various sectors."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 17m 37s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiaeast-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-48b45fa3-f0eb-43af-bc39-24d1e908ceb4:AU","parent_id":"a0c2a9fa-82cb-4dca-b930-6c9f39abeb0b","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_698aa81e78d48191acc0948133245654","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"698aa81e-7e84-839b-a8ce-477fbff7f466","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-10T03:38:06.794290Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"a0c2a9fa-82cb-4dca-b930-6c9f39abeb0b","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"48b45fa3-f0eb-43af-bc39-24d1e908ceb4","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"f91105f9-adeb-4734-a707-89f116df454f","finished_duration_sec":1057,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a0c2a9fa-82cb-4dca-b930-6c9f39abeb0b","children":["190ec183-46f9-4137-889b-795ec3f80561"]},"190ec183-46f9-4137-889b-795ec3f80561":{"id":"190ec183-46f9-4137-889b-795ec3f80561","message":{"id":"190ec183-46f9-4137-889b-795ec3f80561","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770695744.682272,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\u201cGoogle becomes another Yahoo\u201d is possible, but only under a *specific* meaning of \u201cYahoo\u201d:\n\n- **Yahoo didn\u2019t vanish**; it **lost \u201cdefault doorway\u201d status** and ended up getting sold for its remaining audience and assets, after years of strategic drift and erosion.

But the **doorway** is not necessarily the foundation stack.\n\nThe doorway is **who owns the user\u2019s intent and context** at the moment of action:\n- the OS,\n- the work suite,\n- the communication layer,\n- the browser,\n- the enterprise identity plane,\n- or the dominant agent UI.\n\nA cloud provider can be the \u201cfactory,\u201d while someone else owns the \u201cstorefront.\u201d\n\n### The specific scenario where Google becomes \u201cYahoo\u201d\nGoogle risks a Yahoo-like outcome if **agents become the primary UI** and Google becomes \u201cone of several backends,\u201d even a very large one.\n\nThat happens if 3 things stack:\n\n1) **The primary agent UI is controlled by someone else**\n- **Microsoft** is explicitly pushing Copilot + \u201cAgent Mode\u201d across Microsoft 365 and Office apps, aiming to make the work UI itself the doorway (preview timeline referenced in their Ignite 2025 post; and continued agent governance messaging in early 2026). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search22\ue201  \n- **Apple** is also showing signs of letting third\u2011party voice chatbots into CarPlay (while still controlling system-level hooks), which is a small but meaningful example of \u201cthe OS owner can decide whose agent gets distribution.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue201\n\n2) **Distribution moats weaken through regulation**\nGoogle\u2019s historic superpower is default distribution (e.g., default search placement) and data advantages. The current U.S. search antitrust case is still active on appeal, with remedies and default-deal questions in play. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news41\ue202turn1news40\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \nIf default placement and/or data-sharing remedies materially reduce Google\u2019s \u201cstarting point\u201d advantage, that *directly* increases the odds of a doorway shift.\n\n3) **The economics of \u201canswers instead of links\u201d disrupt the ad model**\nThis is the hardest part: Google\u2019s cash machine is intent advertising. If user journeys increasingly become \u201cagent completes task\u201d rather than \u201cuser clicks through,\u201d the monetization mechanics must change. Google can adapt, but the transition is non-trivial because the new interface tends to compress pageviews/clicks.\n\nIf those three stack together, Google can look Yahoo-like **in interface relevance**, even while still huge underneath.\n\n---\n\n## Why \u201cGoogle becomes Yahoo\u201d is not the base case\n\nGoogle is doing multiple things Yahoo never did well:\n\n### 1) Google is actively rebuilding the interface, not ignoring it\nGoogle launched **AI Mode** as part of Search evolution and expanded AI Overviews\u2014i.e., it\u2019s trying to *own the new interface* rather than just supply the backend. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n### 2) Google is investing aggressively in infrastructure scale\nThe Financial Times reported Google planning up to **$185B** of capital expenditure in 2026, driven by AI demand, Gemini models, and TPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue201  \nThat\u2019s the opposite of \u201cdrift.\u201d It\u2019s an all-in bet to remain a foundational platform.\n\n### 3) Google is lowering serving costs substantially\nSundar Pichai publicly stated Google lowered **Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025** via optimizations and utilization improvements. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \nThis supports your argument: if they can translate that into customer economics, they can create real gravitational pull for high-volume agent workloads.\n\nSo: **a Yahoo-style collapse is unlikely**, but **a Yahoo-style loss of \u201cdefault doorway\u201d status is plausible** if OS/work-suite agents dominate and regulation weakens distribution.\n\n---\n\n## If Google gets \u201cYahooed,\u201d who is the \u201cnext Google\u201d after Google?\n\nThe honest answer: **there may not be a single next Google**. The agent era can fragment the doorway into multiple \u201cstarting points\u201d (work, phone, car, dev tools).\n\nBut if you force a single \u201cmost likely\u201d candidate, I\u2019d separate it into *which doorway you mean*:\n\n### 1) The doorway to enterprise work: Microsoft (most likely)\nMicrosoft\u2019s advantage is not just models or Azure. It\u2019s **ownership of the daily work surface** (email, documents, meetings, collaboration) and the ability to ship agents as defaults inside that surface. Their Ignite 2025 messaging and early-2026 governance content is explicitly about scaling agents across organizations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search22\ue201\n\nIf most enterprise \u201cagent actions\u201d happen inside Outlook/Teams/Office workflows, Microsoft becomes the practical doorway\u2014even if Google/AWS still earn plenty as infrastructure elsewhere.\n\n### 2) The doorway to personal devices: Apple (strong contender)\nApple controls the device interface and permissions model. Even when it allows third-party chatbots in CarPlay, it retains system-level control (Siri wake word/button behavior remains controlled per Reuters\u2019 summary). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news39\ue201  \nApple also continues to frame \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d as integrated across devices and available to developers (which matters for on-device agent distribution). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search15\ue201\n\nIf the agent era becomes \u201cwhat your phone can do for you,\u201d Apple has a pathway to become the most important doorway\u2014even if it sources models from multiple partners.\n\n### 3) The doorway to cross-platform enterprise agents: OpenAI (credible but not proven)\nOpenAI just introduced **Frontier**, explicitly an enterprise platform to build/deploy/manage agents (including permissions and integration into company infrastructure). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \nIf Frontier becomes the neutral \u201cagent operating layer\u201d across clouds and apps, OpenAI could become \u201cthe Google of agents.\u201d That\u2019s real strategic intent\u2014but it\u2019s much earlier, and it lacks the entrenched distribution Microsoft/Apple have.\n\n### 4) The doorway for developers: GitHub (a \u201csleeper doorway\u201d)\nGitHub integrating multiple coding agents (Claude, Codex, etc.) is a hint that developer workflow tools can become doorways too. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news41\ue201  \nNot \u201cnext Google\u201d for consumers, but potentially \u201cnext Google\u201d for software creation\u2014another major intent market.\n\n---\n\n## The key critique of your premise\nYou\u2019re equating **\u201cowns the full stack\u201d** with **\u201cowns the doorway.\u201d** They are related but not identical.\n\n- Full-stack advantage helps you win on **cost/performance and operational simplicity** (your point about serving costs is valid). \ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- Doorway advantage comes from **default distribution + context + permissions** (OS, suite, identity, workflow surface) and increasingly **trust**.\n\nGoogle can avoid a Yahoo outcome if it maintains or regains the doorway (Search AI Mode, Android/Chrome integration, etc.). But if the doorway shifts to Microsoft 365 or iOS-level agents, Google can still be a dominant backend while becoming \u201cless where users start.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the most realistic

The judge had found that Google holds a monopoly in online search but rejected more stringent remedies proposed by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general. These remedies included forcing Google to divest its Chrome browser or halting its multibillion-dollar agreement with Apple to be the default search engine on Apple devices. Google is also appealing the ruling, which required it to share data with competitors. The appeals are expected to take several months. Judge Amit Mehta's decision to deny the stronger actions was seen as a victory for Google and a setback for antitrust regulators, especially as courts have shown caution in regulating rapidly evolving tech industries. The case began five years ago, and since then, new competitors like generative AI firms (e.g., OpenAI) have emerged, influencing the judge's decision on market dynamics.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Department of Justice appeals Google search monopoly ruling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"On February 3, 2026, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal in the antitrust case against Google, signaling dissatisfaction with the remedies imposed in a federal ruling on Google's monopolization of internet search and advertising. The DOJ indicated it would challenge the remedy decisions made by DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who had previously ruled that Google should share its search data with rivals and refrain from exclusive distribution deals that could restrict competitors. However, Judge Mehta did not require Google to divest its Chrome browser or stop paying for preloaded placement of its search or AI products. Google had already filed to appeal the ruling and requested a stay on the imposed remedies. The cross-appeal reflects that both the DOJ and Google seek changes to the initial court-imposed remedies.","attribution":"The Verge"},{"title":"Google asks US judge to defer order forcing it to share data ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-asks-us-judge-defer-order-forcing-it-share-data-while-it-appeals-2026-01-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington ruled in 2024 that the company used unlawful tactics to maintain its dominance in online search.Read more","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search7\ue201","start_idx":4411,"end_idx":4443,"safe_urls":["https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/ai-mode-search/","https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/ai-mode-search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/google-search-ai-mode-update/","https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/google-search-ai-mode-update/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([blog.google](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/ai-mode-search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Expanding AI Overviews and introducing AI Mode","url":"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/ai-mode-search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1741132800,"snippet":"5 Mar 2025 \u2014 This new Search mode expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities so you can get help ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AI in Search: Going beyond information to intelligence","url":"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/google-search-ai-mode-update/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"20 May 2025 \u2014 AI Mode is our most powerful AI search, with more advanced reasoning and multimodality, and the ability to go deeper through follow-up questions ...Read more","attribution":"blog.google"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"blog.google"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue201","start_idx":4648,"end_idx":4666,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a","https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Google set to double AI spending to $185bn after strong earnings","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1770239962.169,"snippet":"Google is set to double its capital expenditure in 2026 to as much as $185 billion, far surpassing analyst expectations of $120 billion.

OpenAI anticipates that this approach will accelerate enterprise usage by simplifying the deployment process.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Introducing OpenAI Frontier","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 Today, we're introducing Frontier, a new platform that helps enterprises build, deploy, and manage AI agents that can do real work.

This new feature, available through a public preview, is accessible to users with Copilot Pro Plus or Copilot Enterprise subscriptions. The integration is part of GitHub\u2019s Agent HQ initiative, aimed at making AI agents a core part of the development workflow by allowing developers to select from Copilot, Claude, Codex, or custom agents for specific tasks. These agents assist in issue resolution and pull request management, and their performance can be evaluated by developers.\n\nGitHub emphasizes reducing friction in development by eliminating the need for switching tools during the coding process. This move also reflects GitHub\u2019s openness to incorporating rival AI models to boost its Copilot capabilities. GitHub already provides access to models from Anthropic, Google, xAI, and OpenAI, and plans to expand agent availability across more subscription tiers soon. Furthermore, GitHub is collaborating with companies like Google, Cognition, and xAI to introduce more agents into its products. Meanwhile, Microsoft is internally comparing Claude Code with Copilot to enhance GitHub Copilot\u2019s performance.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Verge"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news42\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":8075,"end_idx":8106,"safe_urls":["https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/04/alphabet-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/","https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/04/alphabet-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a","https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Google set to double AI spending to $185bn after strong earnings","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1770239962.169,"snippet":"Google is set to double its capital expenditure in 2026 to as much as $185 billion, far surpassing analyst expectations of $120 billion. This significant increase, driven by robust growth in its advertising and cloud sectors, supports Google's ongoing AI investments, particularly in its Gemini models and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Despite this bullish investment strategy, Alphabet shares fell 5% amid investor concerns over potential AI market saturation.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the necessity of the spending to meet strong demand for AI capabilities and cloud services, including from Google DeepMind. Google reported strong Q4 results: net income rose 30% YoY to $34.5 billion, revenue increased 18% to $113.8 billion, and annual sales exceeded $400 billion for the first time.\n\nAd revenue grew 17% to $63.1 billion, and cloud revenue surged 48% to $17.7 billion. Google's cloud contract backlog climbed to $240 billion. Its Gemini AI app reached 750 million monthly users, though still behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. Despite broader sector volatility, Alphabet\u2019s free cash flow hit $73.3 billion for 2025, and its shares are up 61% over the past year, placing it as the third-largest global company by market cap.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Alphabet (GOOGL) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript","url":"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/04/alphabet-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency, and utilization improvements.

I\u2019ll analyze this by exploring whether integrating AI into Windows, Mac, and Android would shift power dynamics. It\u2019s important to assess how Microsoft, Apple, and Google might respond, and the implications of antitrust issues for the future.\n\n**Analyzing potential disruptions from AI in OS**\n\nI\u2019ll evaluate how integrating AI directly into OS layers could reshape competition, focusing on Google's position in Android, Chrome, etc. I'll consider factors like Apple's control, Microsoft's stance, the role of open ecosystems, regulatory concerns, privacy, and the interplay of multi-agent systems. Let's gather updated data.\n\n**Evaluating the AI disruption of Google\u2019s dominance**\n\nI\u2019ll analyze the claim that OS-level AI integration could disrupt Google\u2019s monopoly. Google already has a presence via Android and Chrome, but Microsoft and Apple might reduce Google's search dominance. I'll break down pathways like default assistants, on-device AI, and contextual memory features, while considering regulatory challenges.\n\n**Breaking down the AI disruption scenario**\n\nI\u2019ll map out key ideas: 1) OS as an AI shell; 2) disruption mechanisms like default assistants and context integration; 3) barriers such as trust, privacy, vendor lock-in; 4) evaluating Google\u2019s control\u2014dominant on Android, missing on iOS/Windows. While Google\u2019s search dominance remains, OS-level agents can shift search preferences.\n\n**Crafting the response on OS-level AI integration**\n\nI\u2019ll agree that OS-level AI integration is a key distribution shift. For example, Windows 11 integrates Copilot, making every PC an AI-powered device; Apple is enhancing Siri and CarPlay with chatbots. Google is upgrading Assistant to Gemini on Android. While this trend is widespread, the impact on Google deserves deeper evaluation.\n\n**Analyzing OS-level AI integration across platforms**\n\nConsider three OS contexts:\n\n- **Apple**: If Siri becomes a chatbot and integrates more actions, usage of Google Search might drop, though Apple could still partner with Google for revenue.\n  \n- **Windows**: With Copilot as the default assistant, Microsoft could route queries to Bing, reducing Google\u2019s search share.\n  \n- **Android**: Google\u2019s control over the OS may actually help reinforce their presence with integrated AI.\n\n**Analyzing OS-level AI and its potential to disrupt Google**\n\nRegulatory action could impact default assistant or search choices, weakening Google's position. However, OS-level AI doesn\u2019t replace Google\u2014it\u2019s an interface that still relies on fetching web data. So, in an \"agent future,\" platforms like Microsoft or Apple could provide alternatives by managing agents.\n\nFor disruption, I\u2019d define OS-level AI at 3 levels: a simple assistant, contextual knowledge via telemetry, and full action-facilitating agents. This could reduce web search, reroute monetization, and change how search and ads work.\n\n**Evaluating OS AI impact across sectors**\n\nIf OS-level AI is not trusted in enterprises due to privacy concerns, companies may limit its rollout. For Google's resilience, they have Android, Chrome, and distribution deals on iOS, allowing them to stay competitive. As for the \u201cnext Google,\u201d Apple, Microsoft, or possibly OpenAI might emerge as major players.\n\n**Evaluating the impact of OS-level AI integration**\n\nI agree that OS-level AI is a big deal, as it's a potent way to reduce Google\u2019s dominance. However, Google has Android and Chrome, so it may actually benefit from mobile-level AI. On desktop, Microsoft\u2019s OS-level AI holds the advantage. There are also concerns about privacy, security, and governance for enterprise use.\n\n**Exploring cross-platform AI and OS integration**\n\nCross-platform solutions, like Google AI in browsers or ChatGPT, challenge the idea that OS-level AI will dominate. However, we can reframe this as an \u201cintent-capture\u201d layer\u2014OS integration has powerful potential due to its privileged access. Microsoft and Apple are already pushing deeper integrations with features like Copilot and Siri updates, proving the shift toward a truly agentic OS.\n\n**Evaluating Google's potential disruption**\n\nThe disruption to Google depends on how much search is currently used for tasks and whether OS-level agents can intercept those tasks. For info queries, agents might still rely on search, and Google can still be a backend provider through deals (like Apple using Google's Gemini for Siri), retaining its influence.\n\n**Highlighting OS-level AI obstacles**\n\nOS-level AI faces challenges like trust and privacy concerns, safety and reliability in performing actions, and fragmentation across ecosystems. Agents need access to sensitive data, which raises privacy issues. Additionally, actions like ordering groceries require strict permission and reliability. There\u2019s also the multi-platform competition from services like ChatGPT.\n\n**Summarizing the OS-as-AI impact and response**\n\nThe OS-as-AI shift is plausible, with potential OS control reducing search reliance, making Google lose the \"doorway\" position. However, Google still owns Android and Chrome, retaining relevance through backend models. Windows sees Microsoft capturing the agent role, iOS/macOS rely on Google models, and Android benefits Google. The real disruption encompasses OS and app interfaces, agent adoption, and advertising economics.\n\n**Preparing for response with citations**\n\nI\u2019m gathering relevant sources for the response: The Verge on the Recall issue, Microsoft\u2019s AI PC plans, Apple\u2019s Siri and chatbot infrastructure, and the Apple-Google Gemini deal. I\u2019ll include citations for these, as well as for EU regulatory developments. I\u2019ll also remember the user's timezone, and include dates properly.\n\n**Preparing the response structure**\n\nI'll address the user\u2019s question by organizing the response clearly. I will explain the concept of \"OS becoming AI\" at three levels, then highlight the mechanisms for disruption to Google. I\u2019ll also explain why Google may not be dethroned. I'll identify the key players (Microsoft, Apple, Google, OpenAI) and note indicators to watch. Finally, I'll discuss potential shifts in development frameworks and cloud revenue. I will conclude with relevant sources.\n\n**Crafting the response and selecting sources**\n\nI plan to incorporate the news sources we have, including The Verge and TechRadar about CarPlay third-party chatbots, and Windows Central for OS-level AI. The sources might not be perfect but should still be valuable. I'll focus on providing a thorough answer with analysis, ensuring clarity. No need for an image carousel, and I'll include the useful navlist.\n\n**Maintaining objectivity in analysis**\n\nI'll point out both pros and cons to stay balanced. OS-level AI is a big player, but not the biggest disruption, since Google is also an OS vendor (Android). The agent UI can also be cross-platform. Moving forward, it seems Apple may use Google models for Siri, potentially strengthening Google's position."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 10m 22s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-westus3-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-04788919-a16f-459d-bc2c-28475d8f02e9:US","parent_id":"b0025c7e-0d5d-46e6-894d-06cda59acb84","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_698aad8176bc8191af12ecd89ba1e72d","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"698aad81-8f08-839f-8f4a-c11aeb354a1e","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-10T04:01:05.818890Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"b0025c7e-0d5d-46e6-894d-06cda59acb84","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"04788919-a16f-459d-bc2c-28475d8f02e9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","turn_exchange_id":"edfddd67-7643-4feb-bc50-48291efac05f","finished_duration_sec":622,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b0025c7e-0d5d-46e6-894d-06cda59acb84","children":["511952fd-c702-4dec-aac3-4f224872c54d"]},"511952fd-c702-4dec-aac3-4f224872c54d":{"id":"511952fd-c702-4dec-aac3-4f224872c54d","message":{"id":"511952fd-c702-4dec-aac3-4f224872c54d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770696688.602222,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Your instinct is pointing at the *right battlefield*: the \u201cdoorway\u201d is migrating from **a website (google.com)** and a **browser search box** to an **operating system (OS)\u2013level intent layer**\u2014where the OS itself mediates what you want and then *does it* (or delegates it) across apps and services.\n\nThat can absolutely be the biggest structural threat to Google\u2019s historical dominance in search.

Search engines don\u2019t naturally have that breadth.\n\n4) **Policy + safety gatekeeping**\n- The OS vendor can decide which assistants can run, what actions are allowed, and how aggressive autonomy can be (for security reasons).\n\nThis is why your \u201cAI-Windows\u201d / \u201cAI-OS\u201d framing is directionally correct.\n\n## But here\u2019s the hard critique: OS-as-AI doesn\u2019t automatically dethrone Google\n\n### 1) OS-level AI is a disruption to Google **only on OS surfaces Google doesn\u2019t control**\nIf the fight is OS-level intent capture, then:\n\n- **Windows** is Microsoft territory.\n- **iOS/macOS** is Apple territory.\n- **Android** is Google territory.\n\nSo the OS shift is not a single external disruptor; it\u2019s a **re-allocation of doorway power to OS owners**.\n\nGoogle\u2019s counter is obvious and already underway: it\u2019s upgrading the Google Assistant experience on mobile to **Gemini**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \nThat\u2019s literally Google saying: \u201cthe OS assistant layer becomes Gemini.\u201d\n\nSo yes\u2014OS AI can disrupt Google\u2019s *search* doorway\u2014especially on iOS and Windows\u2014but it can also **entrench Google** on Android.\n\n### 2) The antitrust case already shows \u201cdefaults\u201d are the lever\u2014OS AI is the next version of that lever\nThe U.S. search antitrust ruling focused heavily on Google maintaining its position through default distribution agreements (Apple/Samsung/carriers, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue201  \nAnd the remedies / appeals are still active. Reuters reported (Feb 3, 2026) that the U.S. government and many states are appealing the remedies ruling, while Google is also appealing; the judge found Google held a monopoly in online search but rejected the strongest proposed remedies like forcing Chrome divestiture or halting the Apple default-search deal. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news38\ue201\n\nWhy that matters for your thesis: **OS-level AI is \u201cdefault distribution\u201d in a new form**. The \u201cdefault\u201d may stop being a search engine and become a **default agent**.\n\n### 3) The OS vendor may *still* route to Google (or Google-like backends)\nEven if the UI shifts to \u201cask the OS,\u201d the OS agent still needs tools:\n- web retrieval,\n- maps,\n- commerce/catalogs,\n- local search,\n- travel inventory.\n\nIf Google remains the best toolchain/index for certain classes of queries, it can remain a major backend even if it loses front-end branding.\n\nIn other words: \u201cGoogle gets Yahoo\u2019d\u201d is more likely to mean **Google loses the starting point** while still powering chunks of the stack underneath.\n\n### 4) The security/abuse problem forces OS vendors to be conservative\nAn OS agent with real authority is basically **a privileged automation system**. That\u2019s a dream target for:\n- prompt injection via content you view,\n- indirect tool misuse,\n- malicious \u201cactions\u201d executed under your identity.\n\nThis tends to slow down how autonomous the OS can become, because OS vendors inherit enormous liability. Conservative design can blunt the speed of disruption.\n\n## Evidence we\u2019re already moving toward \u201cAI-OS\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to speculate\u2014this direction is visible in product moves:\n\n### Microsoft: \u201cAI at the center of Windows\u201d\n- Microsoft is shipping Windows 11 updates centered around Copilot and agentic experiences. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n- Reuters describes OS-level affordances: wake word, \u201cCopilot Actions,\u201d screen-aware Copilot Vision. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news40\ue201  \n- Even the initial setup flow is getting Copilot exposure (Windows 11 out-of-box experience integration reported). \ue200cite\ue202turn2news36\ue201\n\n### Apple: \u201cAI as an OS capability\u201d + developer access\nApple Intelligence is positioned as integrated across Apple devices. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \nAt WWDC25, Apple announced the **Foundation Models framework**, letting developers tap directly into the **on-device foundation model** at the core of Apple Intelligence. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search6\ue201  \nApple also integrates ChatGPT access through Siri/Writing Tools in its ecosystem (meaning Apple can \u201cbroker\u201d multiple model providers at the OS layer). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn2search2\ue201\n\n### Google: \u201cAndroid becomes Gemini-first\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s own blog says it\u2019s upgrading the mobile Assistant experience to Gemini. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201  \nGemini release notes explicitly position Gemini as an upgrade from Google Assistant in Android Auto. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201  \nThis is Google doing the same \u201cAI-OS\u201d play\u2014just on Android and its device surfaces.\n\n## So is OS-level AI the *biggest* disruption to Google?\n\nIt\u2019s arguably the biggest *distribution* disruption. But the magnitude depends on two measurable things:\n\n1) **How much intent gets intercepted before the browser**\n- If users increasingly initiate tasks via OS agent, Google\u2019s search query volume can drop (especially informational queries).\n\n2) **What happens to commercial intent**\nGoogle\u2019s money isn\u2019t \u201cquestions,\u201d it\u2019s *commercial intent*. If OS agents end up mediating shopping, travel, local services, and lead-gen, then whoever owns the agent UI can demand a toll\u2014ads, commissions, preferred placement, revenue share, or all of the above.\n\nThat\u2019s where the \u201cmonopoly\u201d fight really moves: not \u201cwho answers,\u201d but \u201cwho routes high-value intent.\u201d\n\n## The most important nuance: the OS is becoming the AI, but the *winner* is \u201cwhoever controls default intent routing\u201d\nToday, the OS is the most credible place for that routing to live because it controls invocation + permissions.\n\nBut it\u2019s not guaranteed that OS vendors will allow a single agent monopoly. For example, Reuters reports Apple is planning to allow third-party voice-controlled AI chatbots in CarPlay (while still keeping Siri as the system-level default trigger). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news35\ue201  \nThat\u2019s a concrete example of the OS vendor acting as a **gatekeeper/broker**, not necessarily \u201cone agent to rule them all.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you want to sharpen your thesis into an investment-grade claim, the key question becomes:\n\n**Does OS-level AI cause a durable shift in high-intent commercial routing away from Google, or does Google remain the best backend tool that OS agents keep calling?**\n\nThat\u2019s the line between \u201cGoogle loses the doorway\u201d and \u201cGoogle loses the business.\u201d\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent signals of OS-level AI becoming real\ue202turn2news40,turn1news38,turn0news35,turn2news36,turn2news39\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn2news40\ue201","start_idx":1098,"end_idx":1116,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-launches-new-ai-upgrades-windows-11-boosting-copilot-2025-10-16/","https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-launches-new-ai-upgrades-windows-11-boosting-copilot-2025-10-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-launches-new-ai-upgrades-windows-11-boosting-copilot-2025-10-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Microsoft launches new AI upgrades to Windows 11, boosting Copilot","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-launches-new-ai-upgrades-windows-11-boosting-copilot-2025-10-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1760619734,"snippet":"Microsoft has announced new AI enhancements to Windows 11, significantly upgrading its Copilot assistant.

Google is also appealing the ruling, which required it to share data with competitors. The appeals are expected to take several months.

According to Bloomberg News, this change will allow users to interact with AI services from companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google directly through CarPlay for the first time. However, Apple will maintain control over system-level integration, meaning users must manually open the third-party apps to use their voice assistants, as Siri's wake word and button will remain unchangeable. Developers will be able to configure their apps to automatically launch in voice mode when opened. This rollout is expected to begin within the coming month. Apple has declined to comment on the
