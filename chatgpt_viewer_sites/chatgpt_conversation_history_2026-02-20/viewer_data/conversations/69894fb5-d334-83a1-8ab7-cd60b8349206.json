I need to research historical data, focusing on Yahoo\u2019s peak in 2000 and compare it with those companies' market caps at the time. Some were private or smaller then.\n\n**Analyzing Yahoo\u2019s peak market cap compared to tech giants**\n\nAt Yahoo\u2019s peak around January 2000, its market cap was roughly $125B. However, companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and TSMC were much smaller then, with some not even existing. I\u2019ll need to research exact numbers and adjust for inflation to compare Yahoo\u2019s market cap with these companies' combined value.\n\n**Clarifying Yahoo's market cap compared to today's giants**\n\nThe question seems to ask if Yahoo's market cap ever exceeded the combined market cap of today\u2019s giants. If we are talking about Yahoo\u2019s peak during the dot-com bubble, the answer is no\u2014it didn't surpass the combined value of today's tech giants, who are now worth trillions.\n\n**Contextualizing Yahoo's peak market cap in relation to today's giants**\n\nAt Yahoo's peak in the early 2000s, its market cap was around $125-130B (around $220B in today's dollars). At that time, companies like Apple, Nvidia, Google, Facebook, and TSMC were much smaller. However, compared to today's multi-trillion-dollar giants, Yahoo never surpassed their combined value.\n\n**Gathering market cap data for comparison**\n\nTo compare market caps, I\u2019ll create a table for the dates around Yahoo\u2019s peak (e.g., Jan or March 2000) \u2014 listing Yahoo, Apple, Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. I\u2019ll use sites like companiesmarketcap and macrotrends to gather historical market data, aiming for a big-picture estimate with proper citations.\n\n**Refining the search for market cap data**\n\nI'll focus on gathering precise market cap data for companies like Yahoo, Apple, and Nvidia around 2000. Companiesmarketcap and macrotrends will be helpful for historical market cap data, using USD for consistency. I'll aim for credible reports like Axios for Yahoo's peak and assess share prices to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Researching 2000 market caps for comparison**\n\nIn 2000, Apple\u2019s market cap was around $6-7B before the iPod, Nvidia at $2B, AMD possibly around $12B, and TSMC near $20B. Yahoo\u2019s peak market cap was $125B. At that time, the combined market cap of these tech giants might have been around $30-70B total\u2014so Yahoo\u2019s market cap likely surpassed this. I\u2019ll confirm exact numbers.\n\n**Choosing anchor date and computing market caps**\n\nI\u2019ll use January 3, 2000, as the anchor date since it\u2019s when Yahoo\u2019s market cap peaked. Some sources say it was $121B or $125B, so I\u2019ll cross-check. Then, I\u2019ll gather market caps for other relevant companies on the same day using historical data, likely from CompaniesMarketCap.\n\n**Checking Yahoo market cap history**\n\nI\u2019ll open the Yahoo market cap page on CompaniesMarketCap to see if it has a date-specific table. It might include daily figures, or at least market cap per year. I\u2019m not sure, but checking the page should give me the data I need.\n\n**Adjusting for market cap data and currency**\n\nThe source I\u2019m looking at shows the market cap in SGD, but for the 1999 end-of-year value, we\u2019ll need to convert it to USD for consistency. There\u2019s an option to toggle between currencies on the site, so I\u2019ll use USD to get a clearer comparison for Yahoo's market cap around 2000.\n\n**Using CompaniesMarketCap in USD for comparison**\n\nNow that we have the CompaniesMarketCap pages in USD, I'll use them for all the other companies. I\u2019ll focus on gathering market cap data as of January 3, 2000. However, CompaniesMarketCap mostly provides end-of-year data, so I will need to convert the 1999 figures to get a clearer picture for Yahoo.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo's peak with other companies**\n\nYahoo's peak market cap was around $125B, slightly higher than its end-of-year 1999 value of $113.90B. For consistency, we can use end-of-year 1999 market caps for comparable companies. We could also check early 2000 data, but CompaniesMarketCap mostly offers end-of-year data, though it does provide historical share prices and shares outstanding.\n\n**Approximating market cap at the peak**\n\nTo estimate market caps around Jan 3, 2000, for Yahoo and other companies, I\u2019ll use available data from CompaniesMarketCap. For Yahoo, we can cite its peak at $125B. Since some companies might not have been public yet, I\u2019ll rely on end-of-year 1999 market caps for companies like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD. I'll also note which companies like Tesla and Alphabet weren\u2019t public yet.\n\n**Gathering market caps for major companies:**\n\nWe can't use Meta (founded in 2004), so I\u2019ll focus on other key companies from 1999 or 2000. I'll collect market cap data from CompaniesMarketCap for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, TSMC, Microsoft, and Amazon. Google (Alphabet) wasn\u2019t public yet, but we could include Cisco, a major company at the time.\n\n**Clarifying the task and evaluating market cap comparisons**\n\nThe user wants to compare the market caps of companies from around 2000 with today\u2019s Magnificent 7. I\u2019ll include Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, and note that some companies, like Google and Facebook, were not public yet. To answer the user\u2019s query, we could calculate combined market caps from the period, excluding private companies.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo's market cap with today's tech giants**\n\nI\u2019ll compare Yahoo's peak market cap of $125B to today\u2019s tech giants, showing that today's valuations are much larger individually and in combination. I'll use CompaniesMarketCap for current data, which updates in real time. My answer will explain that Yahoo's peak isn\u2019t comparable to today's giants.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo's peak to today's tech giants**\n\nYahoo's peak market cap of $125B in 2000 ($193B in 2021 dollars) is no match for today's tech giants. I'll compare Apple's and Nvidia's market caps as of February 2026, using credible sources like CompaniesMarketCap, and calculate their combined value. The result will be far greater than Yahoo's peak.\n\n**Checking market cap values in USD**\n\nSome market cap values are shown in SGD, but I'll prioritize using USD where possible. TSMC already has a USD value, so no issue there. For Nvidia, I\u2019ll need to find the USD version of their market cap details rather than relying on the SGD data. Let\u2019s search for that.\n\n**Analyzing historical market caps**\n\nWe can easily get current market caps for companies like Nvidia ($4.514T) and Apple ($4.087T). But the main focus here is the historical peak of Yahoo around January 2000. I\u2019ll use CompaniesMarketCap to pull end-of-year 1999 data for Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and others, and consider the NASDAQ peak in March for context.\n\n**Deciding on a consistent date for comparisons**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to use end-of-year 1999 data since it\u2019s close to Yahoo's peak and easily accessible. Alternatively, for extra precision, we could compute Yahoo\u2019s market cap for January 3, 2000, using stock price and shares outstanding\u2014but data might not be fully available, so end-of-year seems like the safer bet.\n\n**Gathering historical market cap data**\n\nI\u2019m considering using financial data from sources like \"Stockrow,\" but I'll need to be clear that it\u2019s an approximation. I\u2019ll focus on opening pages for each company (Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon) to find the 1999 market cap data from CompaniesMarketCap. I\u2019ll capture relevant info for 1999 from each page.\n\n**Searching Apple market cap data**\n\nI\u2019ve found Nvidia's market cap for 1999 and 2000, but now I need to search for Apple\u2019s market cap in USD. Previous results gave it in SGD, so I\u2019ll try directly accessing Apple\u2019s market cap information. I\u2019ll search for the correct page to pull the 1999 data.\n\n**Opening Apple market cap page**\n\nI've found the Apple market cap page in USD! Now, I\u2019ll open it up and extract the historical market cap data from the table. This will help me gather the info I need for the 1999 data, which is crucial for what we're aiming for.\n\n**Searching for AMD market cap data**\n\nI\u2019ve got the Apple market cap for 1999, which is great! Now, I need to find AMD\u2019s market cap for the needed years. The previous search returned just a list, but I should search directly for their market cap page in USD. Let me search for it now.\n\n**Extracting AMD market cap data**\n\nI\u2019ve found the AMD market cap page. Now it\u2019s time to open it and extract the historical data for the relevant years. This should complete the set of needed market cap info for the user!\n\n**Searching for Microsoft market cap data**\n\nI\u2019ve got AMD\u2019s market cap for 1999 and 2000. Now, I need to find Microsoft\u2019s market cap in USD for the relevant years. Time to search for that data so I can complete the set for the user!\n\n**Searching for Microsoft and Amazon market caps in USD**\n\nI need the market cap pages for both Microsoft and Amazon in USD since the current results I found are listed in SGD. I\u2019ll search for their specific pages, just like I did for Apple, to get the correct data. Let\u2019s go ahead and do that.\n\n**Refining search for Microsoft market cap**\n\nThe search didn\u2019t return the Microsoft market cap page in USD \u2014 that\u2019s strange. It might be a caching issue with the default page showing in SGD. I\u2019ll try searching specifically for the Microsoft market cap page with a more precise query to see if I can find it in USD.\n\n**Searching for Amazon market cap in USD**\n\nI\u2019ve found the Microsoft market cap page in USD, which is great. Now I need to do the same for Amazon and Alphabet. The Amazon page currently shows in SGD, so I\u2019ll refine the search to locate /amazon/marketcap/ in USD. Let me take a look.\n\n**Searching for Alphabet and Meta market cap in USD**\n\nI found the Amazon market cap page in USD, which is great! Now I still need Alphabet and Meta's market cap pages in USD. While they didn\u2019t exist in 2000, we might include them for a current view and a 2026 projection. I'll search for Alphabet\u2019s page in USD now!\n\n**Searching for Alphabet market cap in USD**\n\nWe still need the Alphabet and Meta market cap in USD. The usual CompaniesMarketCap page for Alphabet might not show up, but there\u2019s probably a page under /alphabet-google/marketcap/ in USD. Let\u2019s search for that directly using the site search. I\u2019ll try again now!\n\n**Gathering Microsoft and Amazon market caps for 1999-2000**\n\nI\u2019ve got Alphabet and Meta market caps in USD. For Tesla, it didn\u2019t exist in 2000, but we can include it when looking at the current Magnificent 7. Now, I\u2019ll focus on finding the Microsoft and Amazon market caps around 1999-2000 on CompaniesMarketCap and compare them to Yahoo's peak. Let me grab those values!\n\n**Extracting Amazon market cap for 1999**\n\nMicrosoft's market cap in 1999 was $604.41B, and in 2000, it dropped to $230.80B. Yahoo's peak was around $125B, so Microsoft was significantly larger. Now, I\u2019m opening Amazon\u2019s page to extract their market cap for 1999 and compare.\n\n**Extracting TSMC Market Cap for 1999**\n\nAmazon's market cap was $26.27B at the end of 1999 and dropped to $5.55B in 2000. Now I need to check TSMC's market cap page, which is already available in USD. I'll open it and extract the 1999 data for comparison.\n\n**Extracting Yahoo Market Cap for 1999**\n\nTSMC's market cap was $69.03B in 1999 and dropped to $40.32B in 2000. Now, I need to check Yahoo's market cap history for 1999, so I\u2019ll open the Yahoo market cap page in USD to check the table.\n\n**Searching sources on Yahoo peak market cap**\n\nYahoo's market cap at the end of 1999 was $113.90B, and by 2000, it dropped to $16.78B \u2014 close to its peak. But the all-time high might've been slightly higher. I'll search for sources like Axios to confirm this peak of $125B and compare it to the 1999 value.\n\n**Citing sources and comparing Yahoo's peak market cap**\n\nI\u2019ll use Axios and Business Insider for credible sources. Wikipedia mentions Yahoo\u2019s peak share price but not its market cap \u2014 I'll supplement that with data from free sources. I\u2019ll also compute whether Yahoo's 1999 market cap surpassed the combined value of big companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon in 1999.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo's market cap at its peak**\n\nAt the end of 1999, Yahoo\u2019s market cap was $113.9B, which was larger than Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon combined. However, when adding TSMC\u2019s $69.03B, the combined total exceeds Yahoo\u2019s market cap, reaching $117.13B. If we consider Yahoo\u2019s peak at $125B, it would surpass the combined value.\n\n**Clarifying Yahoo\u2019s peak in comparison to '00 tech giants**\n\nTo confirm if Yahoo's peak market cap of $125B exceeded the combined value of companies like Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, etc., at the time of its peak, we need to accept some approximations, as dates may vary slightly. Additionally, we should note that some current tech giants were either not public yet, or were smaller back then. The landscape in 2000 was quite different, too, as Microsoft was dominant. I'll include a table for comparison.\n\n**Finding Yahoo's peak market cap and comparing it to other companies**\n\nWe need to identify the time near Yahoo's peak and compare it to today's Magnificent 7. Since Yahoo's peak was close to March 2000, I'll probably use either end-of-1999 or March 2000 market caps. StatMuse Money might also help by providing market caps for those companies on specific dates, like January 3, 2000.\n\n**Exploring tools for accurate market cap data**\n\nTo get precise market cap data, we can check StatMuse for companies like Nvidia. Maybe Macrotrends can help with time series, but it might not cover specific dates. StatMuse provides market caps by month or date, so I'll search for Yahoo's market cap in January 2000 on StatMuse to get a clearer picture.\n\n**Searching for Yahoo\u2019s market cap on January 3, 2000**\n\nStatMuse gives market cap data for specific dates, like January 31 and January 3, 2000, which will help refine the calculation. I'll check if StatMuse has Yahoo\u2019s market cap on January 3, 2000, by searching for that exact data point. Hopefully, this will give us the precise value we need.\n\n**Considering Yahoo's peak market cap estimate**\n\nI found that Priceonomics reports Yahoo's peak market cap as 140B in January 2000, even higher than 125B. While Priceonomics isn't as authoritative, we can cite it alongside more credible sources. However, we still need the precise Yahoo market cap on January 3, 2000, which may be available from StatMuse. I'll check for that.\n\n**Verifying Yahoo market cap on Jan 3, 2000**\n\nI found a tweet claiming Yahoo\u2019s market cap on January 3, 2000, was $127B, but it's not a high-quality source. I should rely on more credible ones like Axios, Business Insider, and Bloomberg. I might try calculating it myself, but I need to verify the split-adjusted share count for that date.\n\n**Searching for Yahoo's market cap data on Jan 3 2000**\n\nStatMuse might not have Yahoo's market cap data directly since Yahoo (YHOO) is defunct, but I can still try searching for \"Yahoo market cap January 3, 2000.\" I'll refine the search with \"Yahoo (YHOO) market cap\" to see if they might still have it listed another way.\n\n**Planning final queries for market cap data**\n\nWe\u2019re close to the max tool calls, with only two remaining. We\u2019ve got enough data for Apple\u2019s market cap on Jan 3, 2000, and maybe AMD. We still need Nvidia\u2019s market cap for that date. I\u2019ll do one more search for Nvidia and keep the query count to a minimum.\n\n**Final market cap search plan**\n\nI\u2019ll use one search to check the market cap for Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and TSM on January 3, 2000. We already have Apple\u2019s data. For Yahoo, we might need to compute its market cap from price and shares outstanding data, or rely on estimates from sources like MarketWatch.\n\n**Finalizing market cap estimates**\n\nI'll set Yahoo\u2019s market cap on Jan 3, 2000 to $125B, citing Axios, BusinessInsider, and freecodecamp. Now, I need the market cap for Microsoft, Amazon, and TSMC on that date. We can check sources like Visual Capitalist for Microsoft's $583B and StatMuse for Amazon and TSMC.\n\n**Choosing a source for TSMC market cap data**\n\nFor TSMC's market cap on Jan 3, 2000, I\u2019m comparing CompaniesMarketCap\u2019s end-of-year 1999 figure of $69B to StatMuse\u2019s Dec 29, 2000 value of $21.5B, which could be due to ADR differences. Since CompaniesMarketCap seems more consistent, I\u2019ll use it for TSMC\u2019s data, even though it's not perfectly aligned with Yahoo\u2019s peak.\n\n**Gathering market cap data from StatMuse**\n\nI\u2019ll gather market cap info for Apple ($17.1B), AMD ($5.3B), and possibly Amazon and Microsoft for Jan 3, 2000. StatMuse may have the data. For Nvidia, it\u2019s likely around $1B, but I\u2019ll check. TSMC\u2019s market cap is still unclear but might be available. I'll use one of my remaining calls to search.\n\n**Aligning market cap figures to Jan 31, 2000**\n\nWe\u2019ve got Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia\u2019s market caps for January 31, 2000 \u2014 close enough to January 3. We also have Apple and AMD for the same date. I think for consistency, we\u2019ll align all market caps to Jan 31 and refer to Yahoo's peak at $125B earlier in the month.\n\n**Deciding on consistent data sources for TSMC**\n\nWe\u2019ve got data for companies at Jan 31, 2000, but not for TSMC on that date. We could use year-end 1999 data for TSMC from CompaniesMarketCap, and then use StatMuse for others. Alternatively, we exclude TSMC from January 2000, acknowledging it was actively traded in US markets.\n\n**Comparing market caps for 1999 and Yahoo\u2019s peak**\n\nAt year-end 1999, Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC combined for around $90.86B. Adding Amazon brings it to about $117.13B, still less than Yahoo\u2019s peak of $125B. However, Google and Facebook can be excluded due to being private. So, Yahoo was indeed bigger than these companies combined at the time.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo to other major companies in 1999**\n\nYahoo\u2019s market cap peaked at over $100B, but it was still smaller than companies like Microsoft, which reached over $600B. Excluding Microsoft, Yahoo was bigger than others like Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia. The dot-com bubble inflated valuations for portals, with companies like Cisco peaking around $500B.\n\n**Balancing data sources and consistency**\n\nI\u2019m considering using StatMuse data for consistent January 31, 2000 market caps (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Microsoft) and using CompaniesMarketCap for 1999 year-end figures for others. This keeps things consistent without needing extra web calls. For TSMC, I might leave it out in the date-specific comparison, but still mention it.\n\n**Planning response structure and avoiding unnecessary tools**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of not using extra features like charts or images, as they\u2019re not necessary here. The main focus should be on providing a thorough, objective response. I\u2019ll break it down into steps: explaining the question, giving a clear answer based on market cap comparisons, and showing which companies exceeded Yahoo\u2019s peak valuation for context.\n\n**Comparing market caps and providing context**\n\nI\u2019ll use the end-of-1999 and January 2000 market cap snapshots for more consistency. Yahoo peaked over $125B in January 2000, bigger than the combined market caps of some companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon at the time. But, Microsoft and other giants were far larger. I\u2019ll clarify this and offer context about the dot-com bubble\u2019s oversaturation.\n\n**Evaluating combined market caps and calculations**\n\nWe'll clarify that Yahoo's peak was greater than some current companies' combined market caps but is much smaller than today\u2019s tech giants like Nvidia or Apple. We can adjust for inflation ($193B in 2021). I\u2019ll carefully calculate and cite all current market caps from reliable sources to back this up.\n\n**Balancing market cap and citation sources**\n\nWe need to cite from CompaniesMarketCap or StatMuse for Nvidia\u2019s current market cap and focus on combined tech valuations today, not projections for 2026. Yahoo\u2019s peak market cap can be cited via Axios, Business Insider, and others. Founding/IPO facts might be common knowledge, but I\u2019ll carefully balance citations, considering the tool call limits and the user\u2019s preference for accuracy.\n\n**Calculating and citing IPO and market cap data**\n\nWe can use sources like Investopedia for the Magnificent Seven market cap data, but I'll avoid listing specific IPO dates as they are widely known. Instead, I'll mention that Google and Facebook weren't public until later, which should be well understood. I'll compute the comparisons carefully to prevent errors.\n\n**Calculating comparisons and ratios**\n\nI\u2019ve found that Yahoo's peak market cap of $125B is greater than the combined $117.13B for Combo 2, but less than Combo 1 at $90.86B. Now, I\u2019ll compare it to today\u2019s tech giants. Combining Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Meta, Alphabet, and TSMC gives a total of $16.33T. Calculating the ratio now.\n\n**Refining calculations with precision**\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to use precise values from sources: Meta at 1.673T, Alphabet at 3.908T, and TSMC at 1.809T. Nvidia is 4.514T, AMD at 0.340T, and Apple at 4.088T. Adding them up gives a total of 16.332T. Now, I\u2019ll compute the final ratio with precision.\n\n**Computing the ratio between Yahoo peak and current total**\n\nThe ratio of Yahoo's peak market cap (0.125T) to the current total market cap (16.332T) is 0.00765, or about 0.765%. Now, I'm ready to proceed with the final calculations.\n\n**Clarifying Yahoo peak vs. today's giants and crafting the explanation:**\n\nIf \"today\" refers to current market caps, no, Yahoo's peak (125B) is much smaller than the combined market caps of today's giants (Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Meta, Alphabet, TSMC) at 16T.  \n\nHowever, if we're talking about the companies in the early 2000s, then yes, Yahoo's market cap (125B) likely exceeded the combined total of the smaller companies like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Amazon at that time.\n\nI\u2019ll gather the sources for the current market cap numbers to support this.\n\n**Checking current market cap sources and comparisons:**\n\nI\u2019ll check if Apple\u2019s open lines show their current market cap \u2014 we\u2019ll cite that.\n\nFor AMD, I\u2019ll need to check if their market cap page has current data. If it does, we\u2019ll cite it.\n\nI\u2019ll include market caps for Alphabet, Meta, and TSMC based on CompaniesMarketCap. \n\nIf the user asks about \u201cothers in today\u2019s Magnificent 7,\u201d I'll include a table comparing the cap sizes and note any companies that weren\u2019t public or founded yet.\n\nAdditionally, I might compare Yahoo\u2019s peak during the dot-com bubble to other top companies like Microsoft.\n\n**Adding context from MarketWatch and disclaimers:**\n\nWe\u2019ll reference a MarketWatch article that highlights Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel as the most valuable tech companies back then, with Yahoo briefly above $100B. This will help answer the question of Yahoo being larger than today's giants. I'll also include context on the dot-com bubble peak, with citations. I'll mention possible nuances in market cap data, including the date measured, differences with intraday prices, ADR share counts, and companies not yet public.\n\n**Crafting the narrative based on market cap comparisons**\n\nI\u2019ll mention that Yahoo later reorganized to Altaba, though that\u2019s not essential. I need to ensure I stay within the citations limit. The narrative will include data on Yahoo's peak market cap, comparing it to companies like Apple, Amazon, and TSMC at the time. While Yahoo exceeded smaller tech firms, it never surpassed Microsoft or Cisco. I'll emphasize that the so-called \"giants\" of today were much smaller back then.\n\n**Structuring market cap data and interpretation**\n\nI\u2019ll create a clear structure to present the information. First, I\u2019ll explain Yahoo's peak market cap and its timeline. I\u2019ll then compare market caps of relevant companies as of late 1999 and early 2000, which illustrates Yahoo\u2019s relative size within the tech world. For clarity, I\u2019ll include tables in markdown format\u2014offering both the exact numbers and the context needed to show the difference between then and the current tech giants.\n\n**Finalizing data sources for market cap details**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll use specific dates for company market cap values. For Nvidia, I\u2019ll use the January 31, 2000 figures from StatMuse, as it\u2019s date-specific. For TSMC, I\u2019ll try another search to confirm market cap values from January 2000, which fits the user's query. This will ensure I\u2019m getting comprehensive details.\n\n**Finalizing source selection for market cap data**\n\nIt looks like StatMuse doesn\u2019t provide TSMC\u2019s January 2000 data, probably because of dataset limitations, so I\u2019ll rely on CompaniesMarketCap for year-end 1999 figures, including TSMC's. To double-check, I\u2019ll use StatMuse for a January 31, 2000 snapshot of certain companies and combine both sources for accuracy.\n\n**Finalizing market cap calculations for comparison**\n\nTo answer the question, I\u2019ll use year-end 1999 data from CompaniesMarketCap for Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC. With Yahoo\u2019s peak market cap of $125B, I calculate the combined total for those companies at approximately $92.7B, confirming Yahoo was larger than their combined value at the time.\n\n**Finalizing market cap comparison for accuracy**\n\nTo answer the user's question clearly, I\u2019ll use year-end 1999 market caps from CompaniesMarketCap for Apple, AMD, Yahoo, TSMC, Microsoft, and Amazon. For Nvidia, I\u2019ll use its December 31, 1999 figure of $0.96B or the January 31, 2000 value of $1.3B, noting potential small variations. Mixing is acceptable with a clear explanation.\n\n**Finalizing Nvidia's market cap and citation sources**\n\nIt looks like I could use January 31, 2000 Nvidia data, as I\u2019m not confident in finding a clear December 1999 reference. While I might not have an exact citation for the end-of-year value from CompaniesMarketCap, I\u2019ll use the January 2000 figure from StatMuse, and clearly note that it\u2019s an approximation.\n\n**Clarifying Yahoo's peak and the Magnificent 7 context**\n\nTo answer the question, I'll use January 31, 2000 for market caps since it's close to Yahoo's peak. Yahoo\u2019s market cap peaked in early January 2000 at around $125B. We'll include Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Amazon, and TSMC and also note that Google and Facebook were private. Additionally, Tesla wasn\u2019t part of the Magnificent 7 back then.\n\n**Final summary on Yahoo's peak market cap vs. combined tech giants**\n\nTo answer the question, I\u2019ll explain that at the time (early 2000), Yahoo's market cap was about $125B, while companies like Microsoft and Cisco were much higher. I\u2019ll point out that Yahoo could surpass combined values of some companies like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD. For today\u2019s giants, no, as many firms were either smaller or private at that point. We may need to briefly touch on P/E ratios but focus on key figures.\n\n**Finalizing market cap sources and citations**\n\nFor the table, I\u2019ll list Yahoo\u2019s market cap at $113.9B, Apple\u2019s at $16.57B, and Nvidia at $0.96B (not certain on citation for 1999 end of year but can refer to later sources or estimates). I\u2019m checking to make sure I only use reliable references like existing source IDs to avoid potential errors.\n\n**Finalizing market cap comparisons and citations**\n\nI'll use late 1999 figures from CompaniesMarketCap for Yahoo, Apple, AMD, Amazon, Microsoft, and TSMC, noting Nvidia's market cap at about $1B based on StatMuse. For 2026, I\u2019ll show current market cap data from sources like StatMuse and CompaniesMarketCap for companies like Nvidia, Apple, AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and TSMC.\n\n**Summarizing Magnificent 7 market caps for comparison**\n\nI\u2019ll gather current data for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Meta, Alphabet, TSMC, and compute their combined market cap of roughly $16.3T as compared to Yahoo\u2019s $125B peak in early 2000. I'll add contextual info on the M7 market cap as of late 2025 to provide insight into historical trends.\n\n**Explaining Yahoo's market cap versus tech giants**\n\nYahoo's market cap peaked around $125B (some reports say $140B) in 1999/early 2000, which was larger than the combined market cap of Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Amazon at the time. But comparing it to today\u2019s $16T market cap of tech giants, Yahoo\u2019s peak seems small. I'll highlight the variations in figures, especially with TSMC's status.\n\n**Finalizing the comparison of market caps**\n\nHere\u2019s the dataset for end-of-year 1999 values:\n\n- Yahoo: $113.90B  \n- Nvidia: $0.96B  \n- AMD: $4.30B  \n- Apple: $16.57B  \n- TSMC: $69.03B  \n- Amazon: $26.27B  \n- Microsoft: $604.41B\n\nUsing these numbers: Yahoo\u2019s peak of $125B exceeded a combined $117.13B of Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon, but including Microsoft makes the total much larger.\n\n**Final market cap comparison**\n\nFor February 2026, the market caps are:\n\n- Nvidia: $4.514T (CompaniesMarketCap)\n- Apple: $4.087T (CompaniesMarketCap or StatMuse)  \n- AMD: $339.84B (StatMuse / AMD page)  \n- Alphabet: $3.908T (CompaniesMarketCap)  \n- Meta: $1.673T (CompaniesMarketCap)  \n- TSMC: $1.809T (CompaniesMarketCap)\n\nThe total combined is about $16.332T. Compared to Yahoo\u2019s peak value of $125B, which is far smaller. Accuracy and date matching considerations apply."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 29m 2s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiacentral-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-4bba18b4-caa8-4afe-89bb-34148e9b881a:AU","parent_id":"273a12d5-5a84-431d-8426-f30d00b8fb11","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_69894fb7aa50819187160fb724506e57","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69894fb7-ab50-839a-9e03-d25f1a382294","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T03:08:39.934879Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"273a12d5-5a84-431d-8426-f30d00b8fb11","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"4bba18b4-caa8-4afe-89bb-34148e9b881a","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"70f8ceb6-7b4c-423c-8aab-ba19da3a3870","finished_duration_sec":1742,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"273a12d5-5a84-431d-8426-f30d00b8fb11","children":["32fefe22-b6ad-4325-8b45-9bf6eeef22f7"]},"32fefe22-b6ad-4325-8b45-9bf6eeef22f7":{"id":"32fefe22-b6ad-4325-8b45-9bf6eeef22f7","message":{"id":"32fefe22-b6ad-4325-8b45-9bf6eeef22f7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770608262.980237,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["If you mean **\u201cgreater than those companies\u2019 market caps today (Feb 2026)\u201d**: **no \u2014 not remotely**.\n\nIf you mean **\u201cgreater than the combined market caps of several of those same companies *back around Yahoo\u2019s peak* (late 1999 / early 2000)\u201d**: **yes, that did happen**, largely because (i) several of the \u201ctoday-giants\u201d were **tiny then**, and (ii) Google/Facebook/Tesla **weren\u2019t public yet**, so they had **no public market cap** at that time.\n\n## When was Yahoo at/near peak \u2014 and how big was it?\n\nThe cleanest \u201cpeak moment\u201d to anchor on is the dot\u2011com apex in **early January 2000**:\n\n- **Jan 3, 2000:** Yahoo stock closed at **$475 (pre\u2011split)**. \ue200cite\ue202turn20search7\ue201  \n- Bloomberg later summarized that **on Jan 3, 2000 Yahoo\u2019s market cap was about $128B**. \ue200cite\ue202turn20search3\ue201  \n- Multiple retrospectives characterize Yahoo\u2019s peak valuation as **~$125B in/around January 2000**. \ue200cite\ue202turn16search7\ue202turn5view1\ue202turn16search3\ue201  \n\nSo, \u201cYahoo peak market cap\u201d is reasonably treated as **~$125\u2013$128B around Jan 2000**.\n\n## Part 1 \u2014 Could Yahoo ever be bigger than these giants *as of today*?\n\nUsing **Feb 2026** market caps (CompaniesMarketCap \u201cAs of February 2026\u201d):\n\n- Nvidia: **$4.514T** \ue200cite\ue202turn11view1\ue201  \n- Apple: **$4.087T** \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n- Alphabet (Google): **$3.908T** \ue200cite\ue202turn17view0\ue201  \n- TSMC: **$1.809T** \ue200cite\ue202turn11view2\ue201  \n- Meta (Facebook): **$1.673T** \ue200cite\ue202turn18view0\ue201  \n- AMD: **$339.84B** \ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n\n**Combined (Nvidia + Apple + Alphabet + TSMC + Meta + AMD) \u2248 $16.33T.**\n\nAgainst Yahoo\u2019s **~$125B** peak, that\u2019s about **130\u00d7 larger** today.\n\nFor the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla) as a *current* concept: \ue200cite\ue202turn15search0\ue201  \nTheir Feb 2026 market caps sum to about **$20.96T** (using the same CompaniesMarketCap figures for each), i.e. roughly **168\u00d7 Yahoo\u2019s peak**. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue202turn13view0\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn17view0\ue202turn18view0\ue202turn11view1\ue202turn18view2\ue201  \n\n**Conclusion for \u201ctoday vs Yahoo peak\u201d:** Yahoo was enormous in its era, but **it never exceeded anything like the combined value of today\u2019s mega\u2011caps**.\n\n## Part 2 \u2014 What were those companies worth *around Yahoo\u2019s peak*?\n\nA practical way to do this comparison without a full daily CRSP-style reconstruction is to use **end\u2011of\u2011year 1999 market caps** (which are only days away from Jan 3, 2000), plus end\u2011of\u2011year 2000 to show the post\u2011crash landscape.

I'll use up-to-date sources to evaluate current valuation levels, AI hype, and market concentration, offering a critical yet objective perspective with an analytical framework.\n\n**Analyzing past bubbles and current market dynamics**\n\nI\u2019ll focus on Yahoo\u2019s valuation during the dot-com bubble, examining metrics like market cap, revenue, and investor sentiment. I\u2019ll consider lessons learned, such as network effects, unit economics, and platform shifts. Then, I'll compare today's market leaders with an eye on profitability, risks, and valuation concerns.\n\n**Commenting on mega-cap stocks and risks**\n\nI can\u2019t recommend specific buys or sells, but we can focus on areas of risk for mega-cap stocks. These might include overvaluation, excessive reliance on specific markets, and external pressures like regulation or geopolitical risk. I\u2019ll provide a framework that highlights potential scrutiny areas without naming specific trades.\n\n**Discussing Yahoo\u2019s analytical failures and 1999 valuation**\n\nI'll cover Yahoo's mistakes in underestimating switching costs, platform shifts, and overreliance on traffic metrics. During the 1999 bubble, Yahoo's revenue was around $588M, with a market cap of $125B and a price-to-sales ratio over 200. I\u2019ll compare this to current companies like Apple and Nvidia for context.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo's valuation failures to current market concerns**\n\nI need to explore valuation metrics for early 2026 and compare them with Yahoo's overhyped expectations that failed to materialize due to competition and innovation failure. The dot-com crash collapsed multiples, and now concerns about an AI bubble exist, with Nvidia's market cap reaching 4.5 trillion. Time to search for the latest data.\n\n**Looking for Yahoo\u2019s 1999 financial info**\n\nI\u2019ve found some useful articles about AI trade shifts and market concentration, but I still need the 1999 Yahoo financial info. I have the 2014 10-K, but I need the 1999 report to cross-check its revenue and profit figures. Let\u2019s search specifically for Yahoo\u2019s 1999 10-K or annual report.\n\n**Verifying Yahoo\u2019s 1999 financials**\n\nI\u2019ve found some Yahoo 1999 revenue and net income info from a credible SFgate article, but it might be better to find an authoritative SEC filing like a 10-K. I\u2019ve located a plain text SEC archive with a possible 10-K. Let\u2019s open it and check for the financial statements.\n\n**Locating Yahoo\u2019s 1999 10-K filing**\n\nI\u2019ve found a 1998 Yahoo 10-K, but we need the one for 1999 (filed in early 2000). I\u2019ll look for the 2000 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999. Let\u2019s search EDGAR for the 2000 filing to get the right document.\n\n**Searching for Yahoo\u2019s 1999 10-K filing**\n\nI\u2019ve found Yahoo's annual reports on the CompaniesMarketCap page, which lists filings from 1997 to 2016. They might have the 1999 10-K, but it\u2019s possible it's not there. I\u2019ll open their reports section to check if the 2000 filing for 1999 is available.\n\n**Accessing Yahoo's 1999 10-K filing**\n\nI\u2019ve found the 10-K filings, including the one from 2000-03-30, likely for the fiscal year 1999 (ended 12/31/1999). The previous filing from 1999-02-26 pertains to fiscal 1998. Now, I\u2019ll click on the link for the 2000-03-30 report to access the relevant information.\n\n**Finding revenue and risk factors in 10-K**\n\nI\u2019ve got the 10-K for fiscal year 1999 filed on 2000-03-30. Now, I\u2019ll search within this document to locate the revenue figure for 1999 and any risk factors mentioned. I\u2019ll use \u201cfind\u201d to search for terms like \u201c588\u201d or \u201crevenues.\u201d Let's do that now!\n\n**Analyzing Yahoo\u2019s valuation and comparisons**\n\nI\u2019ve got the revenue and net income lines, so now I need to address analytical failures, noting how investors focused on tech over traditional metrics during the dot-com bubble. I\u2019ll mention Yahoo's peak at $127B market cap with $589M in revenue (P/S 216). I\u2019ll calculate multiples carefully for accuracy.\n\n**Calculating Yahoo\u2019s valuation multiples**\n\nYahoo's price-to-sales ratio is about 216x. For market cap to revenue, that\u2019s roughly 212x. We could also compute the P/E ratio: Yahoo had net income of $61.1M, and with a market cap of $127B, the P/E ratio is approximately 2079. I'll make sure to calculate these carefully.\n\n**Calculating Yahoo's P/E and comparing with current valuations**\n\nYahoo\u2019s P/E ratio is about 2,000x, given a net income of $61.133 million. We can use these multiples to relate to the narrative. For companies like Nvidia, valuations are high but not as extreme as 2000. I\u2019ll check up-to-date valuations for Feb 2026, including calculating price-to-sales ratios for current leaders. Time to check sources like companiesmarketcap.\n\n**Checking Nvidia's P/S ratio discrepancies**\n\nThere\u2019s some inconsistency with Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio: companiesmarketcap lists it as 22.7 for Feb 2026, but then says the TTM ratio is 35.7. This could be due to currency or translation issues, so I\u2019ll open the page to clarify and check the correct numbers.\n\n**Clarifying inconsistent P/S ratios and comparison**\n\nThere's still some inconsistency with Nvidia's P/S ratios, ranging from 24.1 in February 2026 to 38.0 currently. It could be cache or TTM issues, so I'll treat it as approximate. For clarity, it might be better to use other sources like stockanalysis or macrotrends. Yahoo traded at 200x sales at its peak, while Nvidia today is at mid-20s. I'll focus on qualitative comparisons between the dot-com bubble and today\u2019s AI market trends. Sources like Reuters and FT will help.\n\n**Analyzing failures leading up to 2000**\n\nI need to address the analytical failures that led to the 1999/2000 bubble. I'll list key reasons like:\n\n- Valuing \"eyeballs\" over profits and assuming monetization would come later.\n- Underestimating changes in tech and competitive dynamics (search, broadband, mobile).\n- Misinterpreting network effects and low switching costs.\n- Overlooking advertising's cyclical nature and short-term contracts.\n- Not considering stock dilution due to compensation.\n- Overconfidence in management and M&A risks.\n- Missing how value creation differs from value capture.\n\nSome of this can be backed by citations from Yahoo's 1998 and 1999 10-K filings.\n\n**Reflecting on Yahoo\u2019s 1999/2000 failures and lessons for today\u2019s market**\n\nYahoo\u2019s reliance on short-term advertising contracts and unsustained growth predictions were overlooked by investors. From their 10-K, we see that advertising accounted for $529.9 million out of $588.6 million in total revenue. We can compare this to how today\u2019s market leaders, like Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and TSMS, might be heading toward similar pitfalls. Although the specifics aren\u2019t the same, risks like overconfidence in growth, competitive misunderstandings, and reliance on short-term factors persist. Drawing from history, it's important to monitor whether companies today follow similar patterns.\n\n**Building a robust framework for evaluating market leaders**\n\nTo evaluate whether today\u2019s leaders like AI companies are great investments or just great companies, we can consider three pillars: 1) the durability of their advantage 2) their ability to capture value, and 3) the price vs. future cash flow expectations. Also, it\u2019s important to avoid mental model errors like linear extrapolation, ignoring cycles, or neglecting competitive response. While current leaders are profitable with cash flow and high margins, they still face risks from shifts in technology and market dynamics, similar to earlier bubbles driven by overconfidence in the internet.\n\n**Considering which mega stocks to scrutinize**\n\nSome analysts treat AI as a winner-takes-all space, assuming leaders will maintain dominance, but ignoring potential commoditization risks. It's important to avoid claiming things like \"bubbles will burst\" without evidence, and instead focus on stocks with thin margins of safety. We should look at companies with high valuations, cyclicality, concentration, or competition risks, such as Nvidia, TSMC, Tesla, and Apple. We should also note increased market concentration, with the Magnificent Seven now making up 33.5% of the S&P 500 and the top 10 surpassing 40%.\n\n**Discussing market leadership and lessons learned from Yahoo's failings**\n\nWe need to be cautious with sources, as estimates can conflict on market concentration. While some argue it's not inherently risky, we can use reputable sources to highlight concerns about AI, capex, and diminishing leadership. Key lessons: market leadership is transient, value capture is crucial, and business models withstand platform changes. Additionally, management flexibility and valuation discipline are vital\u2014Yahoo's story compared to Apple's illustrates these points.\n\n**Analyzing Yahoo's assumptions and overlooked risks**\n\nMany investors underestimated the web's shift from a curated directory to algorithmic search and later to social/mobile. They focused on traffic growth, not monetization. Yahoo relied too much on ad revenue, which was 90% of their earnings in 1999, and ignored dilution risks from stock options and market competition.\n\n**Connecting Yahoo's lessons to today's market leaders**\n\nStock-based compensation and dilution risks were overlooked in Yahoo's peak, which led to mispricing. Today, many leaders also face similar stock-based comp but account for it differently. We should compare Yahoo\u2019s peak market cap to today's giants like Apple and Amazon, considering their market caps and revenue growth.\n\n**Calculating Apple\u2019s P/S ratio**\n\nI\u2019ll keep it simple to avoid overloading with data. Apple\u2019s market cap is $4.087 trillion, and its TTM revenue is $416.16 billion. Using these numbers, I\u2019ll calculate the P/S ratio, which is 9.82\u2014a useful metric for comparing with other companies. I'll get to the math now!\n\n**Finding Amazon's market cap in USD**\n\nApple\u2019s P/S is around 9.8. Amazon\u2019s market cap is probably around $2.25 trillion, but it's listed in SGD on some sites. To make a P/S comparison, I'll use the same source in USD. I\u2019ll open Amazon\u2019s market cap page in USD and adjust accordingly.\n\n**Using SGD for P/S calculation**\n\nSince the data is in SGD, I can still compute the P/S ratio using the revenue page for Amazon, which is also in SGD. The revenue page is available, so I'll open it to get the numbers and calculate the ratio properly, staying consistent with the currency used.\n\n**Computing Amazon P/S ratio**\n\nTo calculate Amazon\u2019s P/S ratio, I'll use the market cap of 2.869T SGD and revenue of 909.91B SGD. This gives a P/S ratio of approximately 3.15. I'll proceed with this computation, keeping everything in the same currency for simplicity.\n\n**Looking into Nvidia's P/S ratio**\n\nAmazon\u2019s P/S ratio is around 3.15x sales in SGD, which is good. For Nvidia, the market cap is listed at S$5.737T. The P/S ratio is inconsistent, so I\u2019ll compute it myself from their market cap and revenue. I\u2019ll look up Nvidia\u2019s revenue page in SGD to get the necessary details.\n\n**Computing Nvidia's P/S ratio**\n\nI can now compute Nvidia's P/S ratio: with a market cap of S$5.737T and revenue of S$245.41B, that gives a P/S ratio of approximately 23.37. Nice, I have the values needed, so I'll go ahead and calculate that.\n\n**Clarifying Nvidia P/S and next steps**\n\nThe P/S ratio of 23.4 is consistent with the header of 24.1; the 38.0 ratio might be due to currency or fiscal differences. It's best to rely on my own calculation from market cap and revenue, using citations from their respective pages. We may also include other companies like AMD and TSMC.\n\n**Calculating TSMC's P/S**\n\nTSMC has a market cap of S$2.299T and revenue of S$112.29B, which gives a P/S ratio of around 20.48. This should be consistent with their financial details. I'll use this ratio as it fits my calculations well.\n\n**Evaluating the reversal of fortunes between Yahoo and major tech companies**\n\nTSMC's high P/S ratio around 20.5 is influenced by the AI boom. User's question about Yahoo vs. major companies like Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and TSMC can be grounded by highlighting key differences: Yahoo\u2019s smaller revenues vs. these giants' profits. Yahoo\u2019s mistakes like ignoring future competition were repeated today, especially with overvaluing scale over sustainable growth. I'll pull in relevant sources about AI and capital expenditure trends to support this analysis.\n\n**Gathering authoritative sources on the Magnificent Seven share of S&P 500**\n\nI\u2019ll look up information from MoneyWeek and more authoritative sources like S&P Dow Jones Indices or Bloomberg. The focus is on the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d and their share of the S&P 500 in 2025-2026, which is mentioned as 33%. I\u2019ll search trusted financial outlets like WSJ or Bloomberg for confirmation.\n\n**Evaluating mega stocks and lessons from the past**\n\nI think we should approach the user's question about mega stocks by using well-established frameworks like unit economics, competitive moat, and optionality. I'll include key metrics like gross margin, ROIC, FCF yield, and capex intensity. I should also address lessons from past tech failures, like Yahoo\u2019s inability to adapt and Apple's turnaround. For candidates to rethink, we could focus on those overly reliant on one narrative (AI), or those experiencing major platform shifts. I'll provide reasoning while cautioning against overconfidence.\n\n**Leadership, value capture, and capital intensity**\n\nLeadership in tech companies shifts, but successful ones adapt and control platforms. It\u2019s also important to distinguish between value creation (like the internet) and capturing value. AI might create value, but capturing profits is uncertain. I\u2019ll also touch on the rising capital intensity of the sector, similar to the late 1990s.\n\n**Discussing Yahoo's peak and advertising reliance**\n\nWe can mention that Yahoo relied heavily on advertising, and compare it with today's leaders, which have diversified revenue streams. While platforms like Meta and Alphabet still depend on ads, a shift to AI search could change things. Yahoo's market cap peaked at around $125B in early 2000 \u2014 I\u2019ll cite this for context.\n\n**Verifying Yahoo's market cap peak**\n\nWe know Yahoo's peak market cap was around $125B based on various sources like Business Insider. However, the SEC's 10-K filing from Jan 31, 2000 lists a market value of $50.866B held by non-affiliates, which we can use as a reference. We could also estimate its value based on the share price and splits.\n\n**Confirming Yahoo's peak market cap**\n\nYahoo's market cap peaked around $125.06B on Jan 3, 2000, based on data from CompaniesMarketCap, which works for our current purposes. There was a potential 2-for-1 stock split in early February 2000, but I\u2019ll stick with the secondary source figures for accuracy. It\u2019d be useful to confirm from their specific page.\n\n**Confirming sources and framing evaluation**\n\nThe page doesn't show the daily max, but we have the end-of-year market cap for 1999 and 2000. We can cite Business Insider for Yahoo's market cap peak at over $125B in 2000. To assess today's market leaders, we\u2019ll caution about extrapolating and provide scenario analysis. Let\u2019s use the navlist for relevant developments.\n\n**Framing response, providing context, and addressing risks**\n\nLet's start with a recap: at its peak in 2000, Yahoo had $588.6M revenue and $61.1M net income, primarily from advertising ($529.9M). Risks from reliance on advertising contracts and unpredictable revenue growth are important here. I'll cite the 10-K for detailed metrics.\n\nFor comparisons, Yahoo had a market cap of about $125B, a P/S ratio of roughly 215, and a P/E of around 2,000. I'll provide those numbers too.\n\n**Planning content structure and sources**\n\nWe\u2019ll cite Business Insider regarding Yahoo\u2019s peak market cap of $125B, and integrate Yahoo's past failures with comparisons to current market leaders like Meta (Facebook) and Alphabet (Google). TSMC is worth mentioning as a non-U.S. company listed in U.S. markets, though its geopolitical risks are a tail risk to consider. I'll use news sources I already have for the navlist.\n\n**Drawing parallels between tech eras and AI market concentration**\n\nIn 1999/2000, investors thought the internet's growth would guarantee profit, though many companies with network effects struggled to capture value. A similar dynamic exists in AI, where spending may not always lead to returns, with platform gatekeepers possibly profiting most. We can also highlight market concentration today, citing RBC and Commonfund on top stocks' dominance in 2025, but offer a counterpoint emphasizing profitability.\n\n**Drawing parallels of analytical failures from the past to today**\n\nWe should mention FactSet's expectations, where estimated earnings growth is better than the rest, showing the outperformance is partly supported by fundamentals. The dot-com bubble saw leaders with smaller profits, but today\u2019s leaders are more profitable. For the user\u2019s request, we can compare failures in analysis: focusing too much on proxies like adoption metrics (e.g., tokens or users rather than unit economics) and assuming a winner-take-all AI platform.\n\n**Mapping past analysis failures to modern contexts**\n\nWe can draw parallels like how \"ads as safe\" becomes assumed margins in ad, cloud, or hardware industries, but they may face competition/regulation. The cyclical nature of capex today is like the past\u2019s underestimation of advertising cycles. Also, management risks in AI transitions remain, with missteps possible. For valuations, high multiples today could disappoint in future returns. Lastly, I\u2019ll consider which mega stocks might need a rethink.\n\n**Mapping modern mega stocks to Yahoo 1999 lookalikes**\n\nInstead of naming predictions, I\u2019ll highlight what situations resemble Yahoo 1999. Risks include heavy narrative premiums, unreliable moats, and large capex commitments. For stocks to watch: Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Apple, etc. I\u2019ll evaluate these by scenario\u2014focus on risk factors like oversupply, competition, and uncertain returns. I'll also introduce a checklist and implied growth formulas for further evaluation, but keep it simple for the user.\n\n**Discussing Yahoo 1999 failings and lessons for today**\n\nIn 1999, Yahoo\u2019s profitability didn\u2019t align with its inflated valuation\u2014analysts overlooked risks like short-term ad contracts and unsustainable growth assumptions, which were noted in its 10-K. Similarly, today\u2019s top companies may face crashes without being \u201cbad.\u201d We should focus on distinguishing between bubbles and true company viability, using leadership turnover data and market cap changes as our reference. The lesson is that buying during mania can lead to poor returns even if a company grows.\n\n**Comparing Yahoo\u2019s 2000 valuation to today\u2019s giants**\n\nWhile Yahoo\u2019s valuation in 2000 was $125B, today\u2019s tech leaders dwarf that scale. For reference, Nvidia is valued at $4.51T, Apple at $4.08T, Amazon at $2.87T, and TSMC at $2.3T. However, larger valuations don\u2019t guarantee safety, as future expectations heavily influence current market caps.\n\n**Evaluating market caps and revenue across currencies**\n\nTo avoid mixing currencies, I\u2019ll stick with USD for consistency. For Nvidia, market cap is about $4.51T (from Public). For Apple, it's $4.08T with a revenue of $416.16B, and Amazon is approximately $2.25T. Using consistent data from USD sources works best here, focusing on qualitative ratios.\n\n**Calculating and comparing P/S ratios**\n\nFor comparison, I\u2019ll focus on the P/S ratio without showing currency differences. Apple\u2019s is 9.8, Amazon\u2019s 3.2, Nvidia\u2019s 23, TSMC\u2019s 20.5, and Yahoo\u2019s peak was 216. I\u2019ll cite the underlying numbers, such as Yahoo's revenue ($588.6M) and market cap ($125B), clearly explaining the difference with each calculation.\n\n**Calculating P/E ratio**\n\nThe P/E ratio for Yahoo at peak is about 2045.4, based on a market cap of $125B and net income of $61.133M. This incredibly high number helps emphasize the extreme valuation at the time compared to today's valuation standards.\n\n**Evaluating valuations and risks**\n\nSo Yahoo's market cap peaked at roughly $125B, with a P/S ratio around 200x and a P/E of about 2,000x. For comparison, Nvidia's P/S is 23.4, TSMC 20.5, Apple 9.8, and Amazon 3.15. While these valuations seem high, they appear modest compared to Yahoo. However, comparing these across companies with different margins isn\u2019t entirely fair. Valuations today have similar growth risk factors, especially around capex returns and reliance on short-term contracts, much like the risks Yahoo faced. Also, the S&P 500\u2019s forward P/E is approaching pre-2000 levels.\n\n**Adding critique and respecting guidelines**\n\nThe user wants a comprehensive response, which we can provide. They might view today's leaders like Yahoo as part of a bubble, but a critique seems necessary. Today\u2019s companies are different\u2014profitable, with moats and cash flows. However, there is still the risk of overpaying and market concentration. We must define technical terms like P/S, P/E, and FCF clearly, following the guidelines. Avoid informal language, keep it professional, and make sure not to use tables unless permitted.\n\n**Finalizing citations and ensuring proper formatting**\n\nI\u2019ll include a table with ratios and ensure we have accurate citations in the correct format. I\u2019ll gather sources from the web and use them to support each claim. Key references will include both financial reports and articles, keeping track of the two remaining calls to avoid exceeding limits.\n\n**Crafting comprehensive response with analysis**\n\nI'll start with \"Yahoo as a cautionary tale,\" pointing out it had a great product but was overpriced at bubble levels. I'll include key numbers about Yahoo's revenue, advertising reliance, and risk factors. Then, I'll list the analytical failures, with specific reference to Yahoo's 10-K for each point and relevant citations.\n\n**Mapping Yahoo-like mistakes to modern stocks**\n\nI\u2019ll draw parallels between Yahoo\u2019s mistakes and today\u2019s leaders: Overconfidence in winner-take-all AI, high capital intensity, market concentration, and valuations. However, today's big players are profitable, but evaluation should still consider risks like platform, regulatory, and concentration issues. I\u2019ll stress-test business models and highlight potential asymmetric risks.\n\n**Comparing market caps and P/S ratios**\n\nI'll show the P/S ratios of Nvidia, TSMC, Amazon, and Apple. Since the currencies used for market caps differ, I'll focus on the P/S ratios, which are currency-invariant. If relevant, I'll mention market caps in their respective currencies or use USD to make comparisons easier. I'll ensure proper citations for all data.\n\n**Providing a critique on Yahoo\u2019s downfall**\n\nYahoo's downfall wasn't solely due to bubble valuations but also strategic missteps, particularly in search and ad tech. While the dot-com crash played a role, Amazon succeeded post-bubble, showing that market leadership is more than market cap alone. I\u2019ll mention these nuances and add relevant citations.\n\n**Providing relevant context and finer details**\n\nWhen discussing Yahoo's fall, I'll phrase it carefully, acknowledging common reasons but emphasizing that these are widely cited and may require citation\u2014like from Business Insider, for instance. I\u2019ll mention the S&P 500\u2019s weight concentration based on RBC or FactSet, and include the math decomposition of returns, focusing on earnings growth if needed.\n\n**Recomputing and finalizing analysis details**\n\nIn my final breakdown, I'll show and compute data for Yahoo's peak P/S, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and TSMC. The goal is to demonstrate that earnings growth, not just P/E expansion, drives returns. We don\u2019t need a screenshot of the PDF; I'll focus on using RBC for some of the points."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 16m 55s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiacentral-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-c909bb78-92c2-4a32-b60c-c4714dc0000f:AU","parent_id":"50a59a8a-c35a-45f3-a683-5fb87e2af402","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_69895d95dcfc8191a9d3b1782ca063ef","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69895d95-e32c-839f-b012-0d5a04dddde7","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T04:07:50.156130Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"50a59a8a-c35a-45f3-a683-5fb87e2af402","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"c909bb78-92c2-4a32-b60c-c4714dc0000f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"63524936-5040-4ee9-bb4e-41de9dec8750","finished_duration_sec":1015,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"50a59a8a-c35a-45f3-a683-5fb87e2af402","children":["781b855f-32d2-4bfd-9699-9a575520e972"]},"781b855f-32d2-4bfd-9699-9a575520e972":{"id":"781b855f-32d2-4bfd-9699-9a575520e972","message":{"id":"781b855f-32d2-4bfd-9699-9a575520e972","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770611085.509914,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The Yahoo \u2192 Apple/Nvidia/Amazon/TSMC reversal is a reminder that **being the \u201cleader\u201d in a tech wave is not the same thing as being the long\u2011run profit sink**.\n\nYahoo *was* arguably the \u201cfront door to the internet\u201d around 1999/2000, but it turned out that the durable profit pools were captured elsewhere: **search + auctions/commerce + operating systems (mobile/desktop) + cloud + semiconductors + manufacturing scale**.\n\nThat single idea\u2014**value capture moves layers**\u2014is the most transferable lesson for evaluating today\u2019s market leaders.\n\n---\n\n## What Yahoo\u2019s arc teaches us about evaluating \u201cmarket leaders\u201d\n\n### 1) Leadership can be *distribution*, not a moat\nYahoo\u2019s advantage at the peak was heavily about **traffic and brand**. It monetized primarily via advertising, with users paying $0 and switching costs being low. Yahoo\u2019s own SEC filings from that era explicitly frame the model as making properties available \u201cwithout charge\u201d and generating revenue \u201cprimarily through the sale of advertisements.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\nThat can create a spectacular *revenue ramp*\u2014but it\u2019s not automatically a durable moat, because distribution can be re\u2011routed by:\n- a new \u201cdefault\u201d (browser/search/mobile OS),\n- a better relevance engine (search),\n- a new interface (apps, feeds, assistants).\n\n### 2) \u201cThe category will be huge\u201d \u2260 \u201cthis firm will capture the rents\u201d\nThe internet *did* become enormous. Yahoo just didn\u2019t end up owning the key tollbooths.\n\nThe clean way to say this is: **the market was right about the \u201cwave,\u201d wrong about the \u201cshoreline.\u201d** That distinction matters a lot in AI today.\n\n### 3) The biggest risk for winners is often **expectations risk**, not survival risk\nAt the top, Yahoo didn\u2019t need to go to zero for investors to lose big. It only needed to become \u201cmerely a good business\u201d rather than *the* business that absorbs most future internet profits.\n\nA concrete sanity check: Yahoo peaked at **over ~$125B** market cap. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \nFor 1999, press reporting shows **~$588.6M revenue** and **~$61.1M net income**. \ue200cite\ue202turn6search2\ue201\n\nThat implies a **price-to-sales ratio (P/S) \u2248 210\u2013220\u00d7** at the peak (market cap \u00f7 annual revenue). When a stock is priced like that, the dominant question is not \u201cwill it be successful?\u201d but \u201chow insanely successful must it be for this to make sense?\u201d\n\nThat \u201cexpectations trap\u201d is exactly how modern mega\u2011caps can still disappoint investors **even if their businesses keep improving**.\n\n---\n\n## What failed in the analysis of Yahoo in 1999/2000?\n\nHere are the major analytical failures (and I\u2019ll be blunt: many were *structural incentives* as much as modeling mistakes).\n\n### A) Treating \u201ceyeballs\u201d as a proxy for pricing power\nTraffic is not pricing power unless you control something scarce:\n- unique demand,\n- exclusive supply,\n- switching costs,\n- network effects that tip to monopoly,\n- or hard infrastructure constraints.\n\nYahoo monetized via advertising and sponsorships, and it faced the inherent cyclicality and substitutability of ad spend. Yahoo\u2019s filings also emphasize that **substantially all revenues** came from advertising-related sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn5view0\ue201\n\n### B) Ignoring (or underweighting) the \u201cno barriers to entry\u201d reality\nThis is unusually direct: Yahoo\u2019s own filing states **\u201cThere are no substantial barriers to entry,\u201d** and expects competition to intensify. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\nIn other words, a key assumption embedded in peak valuation\u2014\u201cYahoo will remain the front door\u201d\u2014was in tension with the company\u2019s own risk disclosure.\n\n### C) Overlooking the *interface shift* risk: portal \u2192 search (then later web \u2192 mobile/apps)\nA huge tell: Yahoo *used Google to power search* starting in **June 2000**. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search13\ue201  \nThat\u2019s not just an anecdote; it\u2019s evidence that the center of gravity was moving toward relevance/algorithmic search.\n\nIf you\u2019re modeling a \u201cfront door,\u201d and you outsource the lock, you should probably re-rate the durability of that moat.\n\n### D) Confusing \u201coptionality\u201d with \u201cinevitability\u201d\nYahoo was modeled as if it would successfully expand from portal \u2192 commerce \u2192 communications \u2192 media \u2192 everything.\n\nBut optionality only deserves a large valuation premium when there is credible evidence of:\n- repeatable product execution across adjacencies,\n- organizational capacity (shipping cycles, hiring, integration),\n- capital allocation discipline.\n\nIn practice, conglomerating features into a \u201cone stop shop\u201d can create **organizational diffusion** and slow iteration\u2014fatal in consumer internet.\n\n### E) Valuation math that was hypersensitive to tiny assumption errors\nWhen multiples imply *decades* of high growth, a small reduction in:\n- terminal margin,\n- sustainable growth rate,\n- or discount rate regime\ncan collapse fair value.\n\nThis is where the dot\u2011com era \u201cthe numbers don\u2019t matter yet\u201d mentality did real damage. The dot\u2011com bubble retrospective describes investors overlooking traditional metrics and the media amplifying \u201cre-think profits\u201d narratives. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Are those analytical failures being repeated today? Yes\u2014but as variants, not copies.\n\nToday is not 1999:\n- Many current mega\u2011caps have **massive earnings and free cash flow**, unlike many dot\u2011com peak constituents. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn7view1\ue201\n- They have real moats (cloud switching costs, ecosystem lock\u2011in, semiconductor/software stacks, distribution at scale).\n\nBut the *variants* rhyme.\n\n### Variant 1: Confusing \u201cAI is inevitable\u201d with \u201cmy layer captures the profit\u201d\nAI will likely be pervasive. The uncertain part is **where the margin pool settles**:\n- model layer vs distribution layer,\n- open-source vs closed,\n- hardware vs software,\n- inference at the edge vs in the cloud,\n- specialized chips vs general accelerators.\n\nThe Yahoo lesson: the wave can be right while the shoreline is wrong.\n\n### Variant 2: Underwriting capex as automatically value\u2011creating\nA striking 2026\u2011era theme is investor concern that **AI-related capital expenditures (capex) are rising faster than visible monetization**, prompting rotations out of parts of tech. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\nThis rhymes with the dot\u2011com telecom buildout: the infrastructure was real, usage was real, but **returns on capital** were not guaranteed for every builder.\n\n### Variant 3: Concentration and crowding risk is higher than people emotionally price in\nMarket concentration is extreme by historical standards. One institutional commentary notes the **top 10 companies are now >40% of the S&P 500 by market cap**, surpassing the dot\u2011com peak concentration cited there. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view1\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \nA separate analysis puts the top\u201110 share around **~39% as of Aug 31, 2025** and argues earnings power is stronger than 1999\u20132000. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \nAnd recent reporting has put the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d at about **~33.5% of the S&P 500**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news44\ue201\n\nEven if fundamentals are better than 1999, **crowding changes the payoff distribution**:\n- small disappointments can cause large drawdowns,\n- correlations rise in stress,\n- \u201cpassive flows\u201d amplify leaders.\n\n### Variant 4: Valuing optionality (again) as if it\u2019s certain\nLook for \u201cstory stacks\u201d of the form:\n- core business is great **and**\n- AI adds a new growth leg **and**\n- new hardware/platform arrives **and**\n- regulation doesn\u2019t bite **and**\n- competition doesn\u2019t commoditize\n\nThat\u2019s the modern form of \u201cYahoo will own everything internet.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## If we apply the Yahoo lessons, which mega stocks warrant a rethink?\n\nNot \u201csell these.\u201d Rather: **which deserve the most adversarial re\u2011underwriting** because their valuations implicitly assume a specific value\u2011capture story.\n\n### 1) The AI toll\u2011collectors: Nvidia (and to a degree TSMC)\n**Why scrutiny is warranted:** these are the cleanest \u201cpicks-and-shovels\u201d winners, which also means expectations can become single\u2011narrative.\n\nA Yahoo\u2011style analytical failure would look like:\n- extrapolating one hardware architecture\u2019s dominance indefinitely,\n- underweighting the possibility that the profit pool shifts toward **custom silicon**, **more efficient models**, or **pricing pressure** as supply normalizes,\n- ignoring geopolitical/external constraint risk in the value chain (especially relevant for TSMC).\n\n**What to test:** customer concentration, durability of software lock\u2011in, long\u2011run gross margin under competition, and how much demand is \u201cpull forward\u201d vs structural.\n\n### 2) The capex engines: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta\nThese firms are both beneficiaries and *funders* of the AI buildout.\n\n**Why scrutiny is warranted:** the market increasingly debates whether AI capex is earning adequate incremental returns, and you can see that anxiety surfacing in market commentary. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news42\ue202turn8view0\ue201\n\nA Yahoo\u2011style failure here would be:\n- assuming every dollar of AI spend produces software\u2011like margins,\n- treating \u201cAI features everywhere\u201d as automatic willingness-to-pay,\n- ignoring competitive imitation (features become table stakes, pricing stays flat).\n\n**What to test:** incremental revenue per incremental compute, evidence of pricing power in AI products, and whether margins are structurally protected or just temporarily high.\n\n### 3) Consumer ecosystem incumbents: Apple\nApple is not Yahoo\u2014its ecosystem lock\u2011in is far stronger.\n\n**Why a rethink *might* be warranted anyway:** the key question is whether the next interface shift (on\u2011device AI, wearables, mixed reality, new form factors) is an Apple\u2011captured shift or a shift that commoditizes parts of the stack.\n\nA Yahoo\u2011style failure would be:\n- assuming the current \u201cfront door\u201d stays the front door when the interface changes.\n\n**What to test:** dependence on the iPhone profit engine, Services growth quality, and sensitivity to supply chain/geopolitical shocks.\n\n### 4) High\u2011optionality mega cap: Tesla\nTesla is the most \u201cstory\u2011stacked\u201d of the mega caps in many narratives (EVs + autonomy + robotics + AI + energy).\n\nA Yahoo\u2011style failure would be:\n- pricing multiple option legs as if they\u2019re all likely and all near\u2011dated.\n\n**What to test:** what fraction of valuation is supported by the current vehicle business under realistic margins vs the optionality legs, and what probability-weight you assign to autonomy/robotics timelines.\n\n### 5) Ads/search platforms in an AI\u2011answers world: Alphabet and Meta (again)\nThese have real moats, but they sit directly in the line of fire of \u201cAI changes the interface to information.\u201d\n\nA Yahoo\u2011style failure would be:\n- assuming the legacy monetization surface (search queries, feeds) remains the dominant surface even as user behavior shifts to assistants/agents.\n\n**What to test:** whether AI increases engagement in ways that preserve ad load/pricing, or whether it compresses the ad inventory economics.\n\n---\n\n## A practical \u201canti\u2011Yahoo\u201d checklist for today\u2019s leaders\n\nIf you want one repeatable way to avoid the 1999/2000 analytical mistakes, do this for any mega\u2011cap:\n\n1) **What is the moat\u2014specifically?**  \n   Name it: switching costs, network effects, cost advantage, regulatory moat, or scarce infrastructure. If it\u2019s \u201cbrand + traffic,\u201d be cautious.\n\n2) **Where is the profit pool in the value chain, and can it migrate?**  \n   Ask: \u201cIf the interface changes, who becomes default?\u201d\n\n3) **What is the business model concentration?**  \n   How much depends on advertising cycles, hardware cycles, or a handful of customers?\n\n4) **What does the valuation *require*?**  \n   Do a reverse DCF (discounted cash flow): instead of estimating value, infer the growth/margins implied by price.\n\n5) **What is the incremental ROIC?**  \n   Return on invested capital is the core \u201ccompounding quality\u201d variable. Rising capex with falling incremental ROIC is the quiet killer.\n\n6) **Base rates, not just narratives.**  \n   Compare to historical outcomes for dominant firms in past platform shifts.\n\n7) **Crowding matters.**  \n   Even great businesses are risky when everyone owns them and concentration is extreme. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view1\ue202turn0news44\ue201\n\n---\n\n## The uncomfortable conclusion\n\nThe most dangerous mistake is not \u201ctoday\u2019s leaders are the new Yahoo.\u201d It\u2019s the subtler one:\n\n**assuming today\u2019s leaders will capture *the same share of tomorrow\u2019s profit pools* that they capture today, while also assuming their valuation multiples won\u2019t compress.**\n\nYahoo didn\u2019t fail because the internet failed. It failed (as an investment at the peak) because **the market over-assigned it the role of permanent value-capture layer**, and priced it accordingly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn6search2\ue202turn4view0\ue201\n\nIf you want, tell me which \u201cmega stocks\u201d you care about (top 10 holdings, or just Mag 7), and I\u2019ll run this checklist against them in a structured way\u2014**not predictions**, but \u201cwhat has to be true / what breaks the thesis.\u201d\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent reads on concentration + AI capex risk\ue202turn0news44,turn0news42,turn0news43,turn0news45\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue202turn5view0\ue201","start_idx":1013,"end_idx":1041,"safe_urls":["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/0001047469-99-007460.txt"],"refs":[],"alt":"([SEC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/0001047469-99-007460.txt))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"www.sec.gov","url":"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/0001047469-99-007460.txt","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"www.sec.gov","url":"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/0001047469-99-007460.txt","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"SEC"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"SEC"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search20\ue202turn0search8\ue201","start_idx":1958,"end_idx":1991,"safe_urls":["https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledge/professor_analysis/dot-com-to-deepseek-25-year-tech-bubble-comparison-for-ai-er/","https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledge/professor_analysis/dot-com-to-deepseek-25-year-tech-bubble-comparison-for-ai-er/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-market-cap-over-time-2016-7","https://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-market-cap-over-time-2016-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-market-cap-over-time-2016-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Check Out Yahoo's Market Cap Over Time","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-market-cap-over-time-2016-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1469478637,"snippet":"25 Jul 2016 \u2014 Yahoo was once the darling of the new millennium's tech future, with its market cap maxing out at over $125 billion.

I'll look up the latest financials to ensure my info is current, though the user asked for a February 2026 context, so browsing seems necessary. I'll use finance data accordingly.\n\n**Structuring financial analysis for MSFT, Alphabet, and Apple**\n\nI need to break down the analysis by looking at each company's moat, revenue concentration, valuation, and ROI. I'll focus on key metrics like P/E, free cash flow yield, and capex. Although not asked for charts, I\u2019m considering using a finance widget if it adds value.\n\n**Considering chart inclusion and news sources**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about including interactive stock charts for MSFT, GOOGL, and AAPL. It might be helpful to show recent performance, but I\u2019ll make sure to note that charts only show prices, not valuations. I could also add a navlist of recent sources, though news isn\u2019t explicitly available in the tool.\n\n**Correcting citation format and fetching financials**\n\nI realized I didn\u2019t use the proper format for the navlist earlier, so I need to correct that. I'll use recency filters to grab the latest sources, check market caps, capex, and AI spend from reliable filings like the 10-K and earnings releases. Specific info for Microsoft and Alphabet needs closer examination for February 2026.\n\n**Running searches for financial data and estimates**\n\nFor Apple, I'll check the 10-K filings around October/November 2025 and January 2026 for Q1 insights. Since the user asked for a checklist, I'll look for approximate numbers and cite those. I'll search for financial details on capex, services revenue, market cap, and other key metrics for Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple using a few different search terms.\n\n**Gathering accurate financial data**\n\nThe finance tool gives updated market cap figures for February 2026 in USD, so I\u2019ll rely on that for accuracy (MSFT 3.594T, AAPL 4.049T, GOOGL 2.938T). The CompaniesMarketCap pages show data in SGD, which might be confusing; I'll skip converting those values. Next, I\u2019ll gather segment revenue, AI spend, and risk exposures, while checking recent earnings reports and 10-K filings.\n\n**Looking up recent capex and segment revenue data**\n\nFor February 2026, Microsoft would have Q2 FY2026 results, likely with capex commentary in their 10-Q. Alphabet\u2019s Q4 2025 results are expected in late January 2026, which could include information on their capex increase. I\u2019ll search for relevant press releases and company reports, particularly on capex figures and segment revenue breakdowns like Azure growth within Intelligent Cloud. Additionally, I\u2019ll look for CFO commentary, especially around AI services.\n\n**Looking up regulatory and antitrust news for Apple and Alphabet**\n\nI need to gather current information on Apple and Alphabet, considering their business risks. For Apple, this involves analyzing iPhone and services dominance, capex, and AI spending, along with potential regulatory risks like the EU Digital Markets Act. For Alphabet, focusing on advertising, search, and antitrust concerns will be key. I'll search for updates, paying careful attention to ongoing antitrust cases, like U.S. v. Google and Apple\u2019s antitrust issues.\n\n**Looking up Microsoft\u2019s valuation and regulatory updates**\n\nI need to gather the latest on Microsoft\u2019s regulatory matters, particularly regarding their Activision acquisition. Also, for valuation, we can compute implied growth using P/E ratios (MSFT: 30.14, AAPL: 34.38, GOOGL: 23.65). I'll look for Free Cash Flow (FCF) numbers from company filings or reliable financial sites.\n\n**Preparing market leader updates and regulatory checks**\n\nSince the user is reviewing market leaders, I will use the most recent financial reports, like 10-Ks or 10-Qs. I'll search for key documents like \"Microsoft investor relations earnings release January 2026\" and \"Alphabet Q4 2025 earnings report.\" Additionally, I\u2019ll look up regulatory cases such as Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s antitrust remedies.\n\n**Gathering recent financial and regulatory data**\n\nI\u2019ve found reliable information for Microsoft, including their capex and Azure growth. For Alphabet, their earnings release confirms capex and free cash flow. I\u2019ll now focus on searching for Apple\u2019s latest earnings, specifically looking at segment revenues, services share, and regulatory updates, especially regarding AI.\n\n**Analyzing Apple Q1 2026 financials**\n\nI found Apple\u2019s official Q1 2026 release with revenue and EPS. However, they don\u2019t explicitly highlight capex. I\u2019ll need to look at their 10-K for further details, especially on capex, R&D, and net sales. I'll use the screenshot tool for handling PDFs with tables.\n\n**Screenshotting PDFs for accuracy**\n\nWhen using PDFs as a source, I should screenshot relevant pages to ensure I capture everything correctly\u2014since text extraction may miss some details. While the tool already provides snippets from the PDFs, I'll take screenshots of key pages to be extra careful, especially with financial tables like capex and free cash flow.\n\n**Preparing structured response and risk analysis**\n\nI need to focus on crafting a structured answer, ensuring I stay within the scope of the user\u2019s checklist request. I'll research each company's risks (Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple) with clear headings and bullet points. I should avoid giving investment advice, though I can discuss risk scenarios for each. I'll also use the appropriate tools for opening PDFs and screenshots.\n\n**Applying checklist and gathering data**\n\nI\u2019ll follow the checklist the user asked for, applying each point to the company data I have. I can use market cap and PE ratios from a reliable source. Microsoft\u2019s capex and Azure growth are strong indicators. For Apple, I\u2019ll verify its revenue breakdown from their newsroom or financial statements to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gathering Alphabet and Apple data**\n\nI\u2019ll open the Alphabet PDF or SEC exhibit to grab capex and free cash flow, using screenshots as required. For Apple, I\u2019ll check their press release for revenue, but since it lacks a breakdown, I\n\n**Confirming data and deciding on sources**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that Apple\u2019s PDF provides product vs. services revenue and capex details, which is great. For Alphabet, I\u2019ll rely on the SEC exhibit for cash flow and capex figures, avoiding the need for screenshots. I can also cite Reuters for additional guidance on capex. Everything looks good!\n\n**Summarizing company risks and moats**\n\nFor Microsoft, the moat includes enterprise distribution, Azure, and its developer platform. Risks include AI supply limitations, margin pressure, and intense competition. For Alphabet, its moat comes from search, YouTube, and AI research, but risks involve regulatory scrutiny, search\u2019s monetization, and privacy challenges. Apple focuses on hardware-software integration, distribution, and brand, but it must navigate supply chain and competition pressures.\n\n**Evaluating company valuations and risks**\n\nApple faces risks like smartphone saturation, iPhone dependence, regulatory challenges in Services, and supply chain issues. Valuations show Apple at a P/E 34, MSFT 30, and Alphabet 23.6, indicating higher expectations for Apple and Microsoft. Earnings yields are: MSFT 3.3%, Apple 2.9%, Alphabet 4.2%. I'll compute these simply to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Earnings yield, growth, and capex analysis**\n\nEarnings yield for MSFT is 3.32%, Apple 2.91%, and Alphabet 4.23%. At these multiples, the market expects multi-year growth and stable margins, but risks include slower growth or margin compression due to AI-related capex. For specifics, I'll cite Microsoft\u2019s Q2 FY2026 revenue and operating income, Alphabet's Q4 2025 results, and Apple's Q1 2026 data.\n\n**Evaluating incremental ROIC and capex impact**\n\nFor incremental ROIC, indicator analysis shows the significance of capex and asset types. Microsoft\u2019s high capex of $37.5B, mainly GPUs and CPUs, signals rising capital intensity, possibly putting pressure on free cash flow. Alphabet\u2019s much larger capex of $91.447B for 2025, with guidance of $175-185B, suggests significant scale. Apple's smaller $2.373B capex reflects its asset-light model. AI monetization varies: Microsoft faces supply constraints, Alphabet shows strong demand (Q4 2025 cloud revenue up 48%) but with mixed profit impacts, and Apple benefits from its large installed base.\n\n**Evaluating AI risk and Apple's position**\n\nAI could shift interactions to assistants, but Apple maintains strong control over its devices and OS. If users rely on third-party assistants, Apple may lose search/ad revenue but could still capture profits through hardware, services, and fees. There's \"front door risk\" \u2014 if AI assistants become a primary interface, Apple could choose to partner or control the default. We\u2019ll check Apple earnings call for mentions of AI strategies, particularly any partnership with Google.\n\n**Seeking reliable Apple AI and regulatory sources**\n\nI'll rely on Apple\u2019s official releases for accuracy, as third-party transcripts might lack reliability. Apple\u2019s AI features can be mentioned, but with caution and proper citations, likely from their newsroom. Antitrust risks are crucial: for Microsoft, cloud licensing probes, and Alphabet faces ongoing investigations into search/ad tech. We'll keep current updates in mind.\n\n**Organizing antitrust and concentration data**\n\nI'll start by organizing the antitrust case details, specifically focusing on Microsoft's EU cloud investigation and the Swiss probe. Next, I'll provide a snapshot for each company, covering market cap, P/E, and price, and include finance widgets. Multiple charts for different tickers are fine, as long as no chart is repeated.\n\n**Deciding on UI element use**\n\nShowing a stock chart at the beginning might be useful for MSFT, AAPL, and GOOGL, but I need to be careful not to clutter the response. The guidelines suggest using only one UI element per answer to keep things visually clean, so I\u2019ll pick one chart and proceed with the analysis.\n\n**Choosing UI elements wisely**\n\nI need to stick to the guideline of using only one UI element per response, which makes it tricky since I have several options. A mini-snapshot table could show key stats, or I could pick a navlist with recent news to highlight up-to-date factors. I\u2019ll use a single UI element to keep things clean.\n\n**Using a navlist to highlight key news**\n\nI think going with a navlist would be best here since it can show recent news about documents like the Alphabet antitrust appeal and Microsoft\u2019s capex. It\u2019s helpful for providing up-to-date context. I'll ensure that the references align properly and keep the response focused and useful without adding multiple UI elements.\n\n**Including top news and structure for analysis**\n\nI\u2019ll include essential reports like those on AI spending from big tech and Alphabet's capex, while citing news sources like Reuters and the Financial Times. A snapshot of market cap, P/E, and recent numbers will kick things off. For Microsoft, the analysis will touch on segment revenue and regulatory aspects, such as the Swiss competition probe. We'll focus on ensuring each source is correctly cited.\n\n**Discussing Azure and valuation details**\n\nI\u2019ll mention that Azure is a key growth driver for Microsoft. For valuation, Microsoft\u2019s P/E ratio is around 30, with an earnings yield of 3.3%. Its market cap is 3.59T, and growth assumptions indicate continued double-digit growth. Capex ramp-up could affect free cash flow. I'll confirm Q1 capex from the transcript.\n\n**Reviewing additional figures for Alphabet**\n\nThe transcript provides valuable details like cash flow from operations, free cash flow, returns, bookings, and RPO. I'll be sure to cite those. For Alphabet, I\u2019ll open the SEC exhibit for Q4 2025 to review segment numbers and cash flows, and reference them for the analysis.\n\n**Analyzing Alphabet and Apple details**\n\nThe SEC exhibit includes useful segment details and net income, which is great. I also need to note Alphabet's capex guidance of 175-185B for 2026 according to Reuters. For Apple, I have the consolidated statements. Now, for Microsoft, I\u2019ll focus on analyzing \"incremental ROIC\" beyond just the raw numbers.\n\n**Reviewing cash flow and capex for Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple**\n\nFor Microsoft, free cash flow dropped to $5.9B sequentially due to higher capex, indicating ROI uncertainties. Two-thirds of capex is short-lived. \n\nFor Alphabet, 2025 purchases were $91.447B, and TTM free cash flow was $73.266B, indicating high expenses paired with solid cash flow. Capex may see a major increase in 2026.\n\nFor Apple, operating cash flow hit $53.925B, with $2.373B in capex, showing high ROI but from their reliance on iPhone revenue.\n\n**Apple's financials and regulatory overview**\n\nFor Apple, iPhone contributes 59.3% of net sales, and Services represent 20.9%. Their R&D increased to $10.887B. Capital returns include $24.701B in share repurchases and $3.921B in dividends. Their installed base of 2.5B devices shows a strong moat. On regulatory matters, Apple faces pressure from Europe\u2019s DMA and notable legal risks regarding the App Store.\n\n**Covering DOJ, Microsoft, and company metrics**\n\nThere\u2019s a DOJ advertising case that could change ad tech, which I\u2019ll include, along with key risks like Apple's search default payment dispute. For Microsoft, I\u2019ll mention Swiss and EU investigations, and the designation of Microsoft as a critical provider for finance. I'll present a quick snapshot comparing companies' metrics like market cap, P/E, and revenue growth as per the user's request.\n\n**Reviewing revenue and valuation metrics for key players**\n\nFor revenue growth, I\u2019ll summarize recent quarterly data for Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, including their cloud and capex numbers. I\u2019ll also mention market cap and P/E ratios from reliable sources, keeping the citations clear but outside of tables. Moving on to Microsoft's moat, I\u2019ll include insights on its distribution, switching costs, and products like Office, Windows, and Azure.\n\n**Assessing Microsoft\u2019s growth and risk factors**\n\nMicrosoft is integrating AI in Office and developer tools, but there are risks as AI compute could become a commodity, and some value might shift to chips or applications. The cloud business shows strong growth (especially Azure), but there's customer concentration, particularly with OpenAI. Their P/E ratio suggests continued growth despite near-term FCF compression.\n\n**Evaluating Microsoft\u2019s growth risks and triggers**\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s shift to a capex-heavy hyperscaler model carries risks, similar to telecom, with uncertain ROI despite long-term contracts. The high market cap presents the risk of correlated drawdowns. Key triggers for re-rating include slowing Azure growth, AI monetization issues, or regulatory actions challenging bundling practices. \n\n**Addressing Alphabet\u2019s positioning**\n\nAlphabet\u2019s moat includes huge data and search distribution, but there\u2019s risk if AI reduces search queries. Still, Googling revenue continues strong, with cloud growth at 48%, and reliance on advertising nearing 72% of total revenue.\n\n**Alphabet\u2019s breakdown: revenue, valuation, and risks**\n\nAdvertising makes up about 72% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, indicating concentration; however, cloud operating income is improving. With a P/E of 23.65 and market cap of $2.94T, the stock seems priced conservatively, though regulatory risks linger. Capex guidance suggests a potential FCF compression if OCF doesn't scale.\n\n**Disruption risks and market crowding**\n\nAI agents might pose a threat compared to traditional search. Alphabet could disrupt itself with Gemini, yet faces regulatory pressure, with DOJ appealing search antitrust decisions.\n\n**Alphabet and Apple\u2019s key issues: digital advertising, cloud, and hardware**\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s ongoing case against ad tech impacts Alphabet\u2019s ad market dominance; triggers for downside risks could include reduced search monetization or stalled cloud growth. On the upside, continued AI success and cloud scale could boost performance.\n\nFor Apple, its moat includes a 2.5B device base, strong ecosystem, and brand. iPhone makes up 59% of revenue, with Services at 21%. Even if AI shifts profits, Apple could capitalize on hardware upgrades and its services.\n\n**Apple's growth challenges and risks ahead**\n\nApple's high valuation relies on strong cash flows and success in new categories like Services or hardware, though the cyclical nature of the iPhone adds risk. Hardware leaders face disruption, and regulatory pressures, like the EU's anti-steering fines, challenge Apple\u2019s business. New risks could arise from supply chain issues or reduced differentiation due to AI shifts.\n\n**Clarifying Apple's financial data and approach**\n\nApple's reported gross margin for Q1 2026 was 48.2%, which aligns closely with our own calculation (48.16%). The margin forecast is between 48% and 49%, according to Reuters. We'll mention the rising R&D expenses. Additionally, we\u2019ll define any necessary technical terms such as ROIC, PE, and EPS for clarity, providing bullet points for structure.\n\n**Clarifying financial terms and citations**\n\nTo integrate citations effectively, we\u2019ll place them outside of markdown formatting, at the end of each relevant paragraph. We\u2019ll also define industry terms like market cap, P/E, FCF, capex, ROIC, and others as they appear. Additionally, we\u2019ll state that the information provided is not investment advice and refer to the latest data by specific dates.\n\n**Building company analysis with key metrics**\n\nI\u2019ll format the analysis based on the following topics: moat, profit pool migration, concentration, valuation risk, capital intensity, and regulatory issues. I'll cover company-specific risks (e.g., Microsoft\u2019s distribution risks), and compare capex intensity in Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. I'll also consider basic DCF assumptions and earnings yield, without going into full detail. They\u2019ll be backed by citations for reliability. Figures like market cap, revenue, and regulatory aspects will be sourced and acknowledged accordingly.\n\n**Evaluating Microsoft's capex and expectations risk**\n\nI\u2019ll calculate Microsoft's capital expenditures for Q2, which are still large at 46% of revenue. But, since cash paid for PPE is 29.9B, that's 37% of revenue. It's a significant figure and signals potential risks. I'll compute the exact figures and clarify expectations around such investments.\n\n**Highlighting capex intensity comparison**\n\nMicrosoft's capex is around 46% of quarterly revenue, with cash paid for PPE at 37%, a notably high figure indicating capital intensity. For Alphabet, 2025's capex is 22.7% of revenue, with a projected 43-46% capex ratio in 2026 depending on revenue growth. I\u2019ll compute the specifics.\n\n**Highlighting capex relative to operating cash flow**\n\nFor Alphabet, capex is 22.7% of revenue but more significant when comparing it to operating cash flow (OCF). With an OCF of 164.713B and capex of 91.447B, capex represents 55.5% of OCF. I'll compute further details for accuracy.\n\n**Evaluating capex impact on cash flow**\n\nFor Alphabet, if capex doubles to 180B, it could exceed operating cash flow unless OCF increases. For Apple, Q1 capex is 2.373B, making up 1.65% of revenue; compared to operating cash flow (OCF) of 53.925B, which is 4.4%. I'll compute further details to assess impacts.\n\n**Apple\u2019s asset-light model and R&D disclaimer**\n\nApple\u2019s asset-light strategy is evident, and we'll mention their key ratios like R&D spending (10.887B). Microsoft has increased operating expenses, but we need to remind the user: this is analysis, not financial advice. We\u2019ll proceed with a checklist, touching on \"front door vs profit capture,\" and the \"Yahoo failure analog\" while being cautious of critique. Let's craft a concise response.\n\n**Checklist approach and cross-company analysis**\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a brief explanation of what the \"checklist\" is and then give a snapshot comparing companies. After that, we'll go into company-specific analysis. At the end, we\u2019ll include \"comparative takeaways\u201d and relevant news references. We'll make sure to include citations, use bullet lists, and avoid long paragraphs. The news items will be a mix of relevant, properly formatted references.\n\n**Finalizing response with relevant citations**\n\nWe\u2019ll cite lines 65-66 for credible regulatory info. While we could mention Alphabet and Microsoft as DMA gatekeepers, it\u2019s not required. For Alphabet, I\u2019ll highlight the DOJ\u2019s digital advertising case. For Microsoft, I\u2019ll include cloud licensing and European investigations. Apple\u2019s gross margin and OCF can be sourced from the PDF. Finally, we\u2019ll acknowledge \"E-Jay\" only when relevant. Let\u2019s craft a precise response.\n\n**Ensuring clarity and structure in response**\n\nWe need to be careful with framing the failures in Yahoo's analysis and how they apply today. The user likely wants us to highlight recurring mistakes with each stock, so we'll incorporate key points like assuming default distribution, misvaluing optionality, and overlooking capex ROI, regulation, and layer shifts. We'll include a quick snapshot from Feb 7, 2026, ensuring the precise date and time based on the latest trade updates. Let\u2019s craft this clearly!\n\n**Ensuring citation clarity with table format**\n\nI'll present Apple\u2019s quarter numbers and installed base data without putting citations inside the table cells, as that's potentially problematic. Instead, I\u2019ll cite the data in a separate paragraph after the table, following appropriate punctuation to comply with guidelines. This should allow us to include the table for clarity and precision.\n\n**Crafting a concise overview using bullet points**\n\nTo make sure we stay concise, I\u2019ll present the data as a bullet-point list instead of a table, with citations included at the end of each line in a \u201cData source\u201d paragraph. This approach helps keep traceability intact. For each company, I\u2019ll highlight specific items: Microsoft\u2019s market cap, Alphabet\u2019s ad revenue dependence, and Apple financials, with relevant citations."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 18m 30s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"","async_source":"saserver-australiacentral-prod.fck9d:bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-5973011e-b19a-45fa-adb6-b4cd53837c55:AU","parent_id":"0a09ffec-af34-40d1-91b4-c104daba5b1b","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"async_task_id":"promode_6989693686308191b4408417c09de80f","async_task_type":"pro_mode","async_task_conversation_id":"69896936-8d58-839e-8122-6f35a3b80ca3","async_task_created_at":"2026-02-09T04:57:26.941741Z","async_task_title":"","async_task_original_message_id":"0a09ffec-af34-40d1-91b4-c104daba5b1b","permissions":[{"type":"notification","status":"requested","notification_channel_id":"jawbone","notification_channel_name":"Tasks","notification_priority":4}],"request_id":"5973011e-b19a-45fa-adb6-b4cd53837c55","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"standard","turn_exchange_id":"21bde56f-44e4-45f5-b1c6-8a2250819042","finished_duration_sec":1110,"pro_skipped":false,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0a09ffec-af34-40d1-91b4-c104daba5b1b","children":["10b566e7-f058-4abe-bb0d-3a0b9fef4701"]},"10b566e7-f058-4abe-bb0d-3a0b9fef4701":{"id":"10b566e7-f058-4abe-bb0d-3a0b9fef4701","message":{"id":"10b566e7-f058-4abe-bb0d-3a0b9fef4701","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web"}},"create_time":1770614158.213416,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here\u2019s the **same \u201cYahoo-era sanity checklist\u201d** applied to **Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG), and Apple (AAPL)**, using **hard anchors from their latest reported full-year results** and **market caps as of Feb 6, 2026** (close enough to *today*, Feb 9, 2026, Singapore time).\n\n## Anchor numbers first (so the rest isn\u2019t vibes)\n\n**Market caps (Feb 6, 2026):**\n- **Apple:** ~$4.08T \ue200cite\ue202turn6search2\ue201  \n- **Alphabet:** ~$3.91T \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue201  \n- **Microsoft:** ~$2.98T \ue200cite\ue202turn6search3\ue201  \n\n**Latest full-year fundamentals (as reported):**\n- **Microsoft FY2025 (year ended June 30, 2025):** Revenue **$281.7B**, Net income **$101.8B** \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue202turn10view1\ue201  \n  Capex proxy (\u201cAdditions to property and equipment\u201d) **$64.6B** (up from **$44.5B** in FY2024) \ue200cite\ue202turn10view4\ue201  \n- **Apple FY2025 (year ended Sept 27, 2025):** Net sales **$416.2B**, Net income **$112.0B** \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue202turn8view3\ue201  \n  Capex proxy (\u201cPayments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment\u201d) **$12.7B** (up from **$9.4B** in FY2024) \ue200cite\ue202turn9view4\ue201  \n- **Alphabet FY2025 (year ended Dec 31, 2025):** Revenue **$402.8B**, Net income **$132.2B** \ue200cite\ue202turn7view2\ue201  \n  Capex (\u201cPurchases of property and equipment\u201d) **$91.4B** and **free cash flow (FCF)** **$73.3B** \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue202turn7view2\ue201  \n  **2026 capex guidance:** **$175\u2013$185B** \ue200cite\ue202turn7view3\ue201  \n\nA key \u201cYahoo lesson\u201d lens: **when the interface layer shifts, yesterday\u2019s distribution rents can vanish fast**.

MSFT is hedged because it owns both a software bundle **and** a hyperscale cloud, but the margins can get squeezed if compute becomes the bottleneck.\n\n## 3) Concentration\nMicrosoft is *diversified*, but there\u2019s a real concentration: **Azure + M365** are the growth and narrative spine.\n\nAlso note the business mix shift: FY2025 **Service and other** revenue **$217.8B** vs **Product** revenue **$63.9B** \ue200cite\ue202turn10view1\ue201 \u2014 recurring/service economics dominate.\n\n## 4) Valuation: what must be true?\nWith a ~$2.98T market cap \ue200cite\ue202turn6search3\ue201 and FY2025 net income ~$101.8B \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201, the market is paying a \u201cduration premium\u201d for:\n- sustained double-digit earnings growth,\n- sustained enterprise pricing power,\n- and a belief that AI **adds** revenue more than it **adds** cost.\n\n**The Yahoo failure mode to watch:** assuming \u201cbeing the platform\u201d automatically means **capturing** the economics.

are engaging in an extraordinary $660 billion investment spree focused on artificial intelligence, primarily targeting infrastructure such as chips and data centers. This surge in capital expenditures from firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta, and Oracle is outpacing their cash generation, pushing them to consider issuing debt, reducing shareholder returns, or tapping cash reserves. JPMorgan predicts at least $337 billion in high-grade bond issuance from tech and media companies this year. Amazon, for example, plans $200 billion in capex despite generating only $180 billion in operational cash flow, while Oracle recently raised $25 billion in bonds to support a $300 billion AI partnership with OpenAI. Meta and Alphabet face similar imbalances between planned spending and cash flow. Microsoft remains an outlier with more stable financials. Investors are reacting cautiously, with tech stock volatility reflecting concerns over profitability and a shift from an asset-light to a capital-intensive model. This trend, featuring record bond sales and tighter margins, signals a transformative phase in the tech sector driven by the AI arms race.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Google set to double AI spending to $185bn after strong earnings","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Google is set to double its capital expenditure in 2026 to as much as $185 billion, far surpassing analyst expectations of $120 billion. This significant increase, driven by robust growth in its advertising and cloud sectors, supports Google's ongoing AI investments, particularly in its Gemini models and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Despite this bullish investment strategy, Alphabet shares fell 5% amid investor concerns over potential AI market saturation.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the necessity of the spending to meet strong demand for AI capabilities and cloud services, including from Google DeepMind. Google reported strong Q4 results: net income rose 30% YoY to $34.5 billion, revenue increased 18% to $113.8 billion, and annual sales exceeded $400 billion for the first time.\n\nAd revenue grew 17% to $63.1 billion, and cloud revenue surged 48% to $17.7 billion. Google's cloud contract backlog climbed to $240 billion. Its Gemini AI app reached 750 million monthly users, though still behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. Despite broader sector volatility, Alphabet\u2019s free cash flow hit $73.3 billion for 2025, and its shares are up 61% over the past year, placing it as the third-largest global company by market cap.","attribution":"Financial

Tech companies are engaging in an extraordinary $660 billion investment spree focused on artificial intelligence, primarily targeting infrastructure such as chips and data centers. This surge in capital expenditures from firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta, and Oracle is outpacing their cash generation, pushing them to consider issuing debt, reducing shareholder returns, or tapping cash reserves. JPMorgan predicts at least $337 billion in high-grade bond issuance from tech and media companies this year. Amazon, for example, plans $200 billion in capex despite generating only $180 billion in operational cash flow, while Oracle recently raised $25 billion in bonds to support a $300 billion AI partnership with OpenAI. Meta and Alphabet face similar imbalances between planned spending and cash flow. Microsoft remains an outlier with more stable financials. Investors are reacting cautiously, with tech stock volatility reflecting concerns over profitability and a shift from an asset-light to a capital-intensive model. This trend, featuring record bond sales and tighter margins, signals a transformative phase in the tech sector driven by the AI arms race.","attribution":"Financial Times"},{"title":"Google set to double AI spending to $185bn after strong earnings","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Google is set to double its capital expenditure in 2026 to as much as $185 billion, far surpassing analyst expectations of $120 billion. This significant increase, driven by robust growth in its advertising and cloud sectors, supports Google's ongoing AI investments, particularly in its Gemini models and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Despite this bullish investment strategy, Alphabet shares fell 5% amid investor concerns over potential AI market saturation.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the necessity of the spending to meet strong demand for AI capabilities and cloud services, including from Google DeepMind. Google reported strong Q4 results: net income rose 30% YoY to $34.5 billion, revenue increased 18% to $113.8 billion, and annual sales exceeded $400 billion for the first time.\n\nAd revenue grew 17% to $63.1 billion, and cloud revenue surged 48% to $17.7 billion. Google's cloud contract backlog climbed to $240 billion. Its Gemini AI app reached 750 million monthly users, though still behind OpenAI's ChatGPT.

The distribution advantage (Office, Teams, Windows, Active Directory ecosystems) is hard to replicate.\n\n### Amazon (AWS)\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** AWS is explicitly productizing **multi-agent collaboration** inside Amazon Bedrock Agents (supervisor + specialist agents), and pushing an \u201cagentic platform\u201d posture via Bedrock AgentCore. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search27\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** usage-based cloud spend (compute + data + security) and \u201cagents as managed service\u201d primitives that become sticky once productionized.\n\n### Alphabet (Google)\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Google is packaging \u201cagent deployment + governance\u201d as Vertex AI Agent Builder / Agent Engine (managed runtime, evaluation, sessions/memory, monitoring integrations). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search2\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** cloud platform consumption + Workspace-adjacent enterprise rollouts (Gemini Enterprise positioning itself as a secure place to create/run agents). \ue200cite\ue202turn6search3\ue202turn6search7\ue202turn6search18\ue201\n\n### Salesforce\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Agentforce is explicitly marketed as an enterprise agent platform with lifecycle tooling (build/test/supervise) and integration into Salesforce\u2019s multi-cloud CRM footprint. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- **Extra kicker:** Salesforce has publicly deepened model partnerships (OpenAI + Anthropic) to power Agentforce, which matters if enterprises go multi-model. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news39\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** monetizing \u201cagents inside CRM\u201d is natural because CRM already *is* a system-of-action (cases, leads, escalations, approvals).\n\n### ServiceNow\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** ServiceNow AI Agents are presented as teams guided by an AI Agent Orchestrator, embedded directly into the Now Platform across IT/HR/CRM workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- **Model leverage:** ServiceNow also signed an enterprise partnership with OpenAI to embed agents into business software workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news44\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** ServiceNow already runs mission-critical internal workflows\u2014exactly the domain where agents need orchestrated tool execution, approvals, and audit.\n\n### Workday\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Workday is rolling out purpose-built Illuminate agents for HR/finance and explicitly framing an \u201copen enterprise platform\u201d approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201  \n- **Strategic angle:** the \u201csystem of record for agents\u201d concept (register/manage/provision agents across the enterprise) is a plausible control point if it becomes real and widely adopted. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search23\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** if HR/finance agents become standard, Workday can monetize at the intersection of identity, approvals, and sensitive data.\n\n### IBM\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** watsonx Orchestrate is directly positioned around building business-ready agents (no-code/pro-code), prebuilt tools/agents, and governance/guardrails\u2014especially relevant in regulated environments. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** regulated and hybrid/on-prem-heavy enterprises where \u201cgovernance-first agent orchestration\u201d is a buyer requirement, not a nice-to-have.\n\n**Bottom line on Tier 1:** these vendors can bundle agents into the same contracts that already pay for workflow, licenses, support, and compliance. That bundling power tends to beat \u201cbetter standalone agent tech\u201d in procurement reality.\n\n---\n\n## Tier 2: Data/AI platforms becoming the \u201ccontext + execution substrate\u201d for agents\n\nAgents are only as good as the governed data and tools they can access.\n\n### Databricks\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Agent Bricks is designed to automate creation/optimization of business-tailored agents, and Databricks now even documents multi-agent supervisor orchestration. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn3search34\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** if agentic workloads move from prototypes to \u201crun on the lakehouse,\u201d Databricks captures platform spend (data + ML lifecycle + evaluation loops).\n\n### Snowflake\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Snowflake Intelligence / Cortex Agents are explicitly described as agentic capabilities connected to semantic views/models, Cortex Search/Analyst, and tools. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn2search26\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n- **Big signal:** Snowflake announced a sizeable partnership with OpenAI to embed advanced models/agents into its platform. \ue200cite\ue202turn2news36\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** enterprises *already* centralize governed data in Snowflake; \u201cagents that act on governed data without exporting it\u201d is a strong adoption path.\n\n### Palantir\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Palantir AIP explicitly markets building AI apps/actions/agents, with Agent Studio for deploying \u201cAIP Agents\u201d tied to enterprise tools and context. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** high-compliance operational settings where ontology + auditability + controlled action pathways matter.\n\n---\n\n## Tier 3: Automation vendors that turn agent intent into reliable execution\n\nA hard truth: in real enterprises, \u201cthe last mile\u201d is messy. Lots of work still happens in UIs, brittle systems, and semi-manual flows. That\u2019s where automation incumbents can quietly win.\n\n### UiPath\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** UiPath is explicitly framing agentic automation as combining agents + robots + people, with orchestration (Maestro) and agent-building tooling (Agent Builder). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search5\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** when enterprises realize that agents need *hands* (high-fidelity execution) and *connectors* across legacy apps\u2014UiPath already sells that.\n\n### Automation Anywhere\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Automation Anywhere\u2019s Process Reasoning Engine is positioned as orchestrating agents, automations, and people for cross-functional processes at scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search21\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** the \u201cagentic process automation\u201d narrative maps well to buyers who already pay for robotic process automation (RPA) but want something less brittle.\n\n**Why this tier may be underappreciated:** many \u201cagent platform\u201d demos avoid the ugliest integration surfaces. Enterprises can\u2019t.\n\n---\n\n## Tier 4: Agent builders, frameworks, observability, and standards\n\nThis tier often decides which agent programs become maintainable instead of collapsing under \u201cagent sprawl.\u201d\n\n### OpenAI\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** OpenAI is now explicitly building enterprise agent infrastructure: Agents SDK for building agentic apps, plus Frontier as an enterprise platform to build/deploy/manage agents with shared context, onboarding, and permissions boundaries. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue202turn3search11\ue202turn1news36\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** model usage + platform tooling + becoming a management layer for heterogeneous agents (including third-party).\n\n### Anthropic\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Anthropic has robust tool-use/agent building surface area (tool use docs + Agent SDK), and\u2014critically\u2014pushed **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as an open standard for secure connections between tools/data and AI systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search21\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn5search12\ue201  \n- **Why MCP matters:** multi-agent orchestration gets bottlenecked by the N\u00d7M connector problem; a widely adopted standard shifts power toward whoever shapes it.\n\n### LangChain (LangGraph + LangSmith)\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** LangChain is positioning itself as an \u201cagent engineering platform\u201d with LangSmith for observability/evaluation/deployment and LangGraph for orchestration patterns. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search6\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** teams building custom agents across clouds need neutral tooling; the moat is developer adoption plus production debugging workflows.\n\n### Weights & Biases (now part of CoreWeave)\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** W&B Weave targets traces/evals/guardrails/registry for agentic systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201  \n- **Strategic move:** CoreWeave\u2019s acquisition of Weights & Biases suggests an integrated \u201ccompute + agent/model tooling\u201d play. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news39\ue201\n\n### Datadog\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Datadog LLM Observability is explicitly about end-to-end tracing across AI agents (inputs/outputs/latency/token usage/errors) and quality/safety evaluations. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search11\ue202turn4search14\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** once agents touch production workflows, observability becomes non-optional.\n\n---\n\n## Tier 5: Identity + security as the gating factor for enterprise rollout\n\nIf agents become \u201cdigital workers,\u201d identity governance and security vendors can become unexpectedly central.\n\n### Okta\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Okta is explicitly framing AI agents as identities that need governance, and provides mechanisms to govern access to AI agents and linked apps (identity governance for agents). \ue200cite\ue202turn4search6\ue202turn4search17\ue202turn4news38\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** controlling authentication/authorization for agent actions (and audits) is foundational once agents can move money, change systems, or access sensitive data.\n\n### Palo Alto Networks\n- **Why it\u2019s positioned:** Prisma Cloud\u2019s AI Security Posture Management (AI\u2011SPM) is presented as visibility/control over AI data, model integrity, and access to deployed models\u2014i.e., the core risk surface of agentic deployments. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search5\ue201  \n- **Where it captures value:** as soon as enterprises face prompt injection, tool abuse, data exfiltration, or policy violations, spend moves from \u201cinnovation\u201d budgets to \u201crisk\u201d budgets.\n\n---\n\n## The shortlist: \u201cmost likely to capture the biggest share of enterprise agent-engineering spend\u201d\n\nIf I had to compress this to the companies best positioned to benefit *at scale* (not necessarily \u201cbest tech\u201d), it\u2019s:\n\n1) **Microsoft** (Copilot + Azure agent stack + distribution) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n2) **AWS** (Bedrock Agents / AgentCore + enterprise cloud gravity) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search27\ue201  \n3) **Alphabet/Google** (Vertex AI Agent Builder/Engine + Workspace pull-through) \ue200cite\ue202turn6search1\ue202turn6search7\ue201  \n4) **NVIDIA** (compute + NeMo agent lifecycle software: \u201cpickaxes + operating system\u201d) \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search10\ue202turn2news49\ue201  \n5) **Salesforce + ServiceNow** (agents embedded directly into workflows enterprises already run) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0news44\ue201  \n6) **Snowflake + Databricks** (the governed enterprise data plane turning into an agent execution substrate) \ue200cite\ue202turn2news36\ue202turn3search9\ue202turn2search26\ue201  \n7) **UiPath + Automation Anywhere** (agents need reliable execution across messy enterprise reality) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search0\ue201  \n8) **Okta + Palo Alto + Datadog** (identity/security/observability become rollout bottlenecks) \ue200cite\ue202turn4search6\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search0\ue201  \n9) **OpenAI + Anthropic** (agent platforms/SDKs + standards shaping) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search11\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## A useful way to sanity-check \u201cagent leverage\u201d in any company\n\nWhen evaluating any US enterprise vendor claiming \u201cagentic,\u201d the key questions are:\n\n- **Can the agent take actions** (not just answer)?

Frontier supports the deployment, onboarding, and ongoing management of AI agents, even those not created by OpenAI, by providing them with shared context, memory-building, evaluation capabilities, and defined permissions. The platform aims to streamline fragmented AI workflows and integrate AI tools across organizational environments while maintaining regulatory and security boundaries.\n\nInitially available to a limited group of customers including Intuit, State Farm, Thermo Fisher, and Uber, Frontier is expected to expand its availability in the coming months. While pricing remains undisclosed, the platform is positioned as an enterprise-level agent interface allowing organizations to \"hire\" AI coworkers for tasks such as coding and data analysis.\n\nOpenAI emphasizes that Frontier is built on open standards and compatible with agents from various creators, reflecting its strategy to unify AI deployment while fostering collaboration. The launch is seen as a competitive move in response to similar offerings by Microsoft and Anthropic, with OpenAI aiming to make Frontier the central hub for directing digital work across enterprises.","attribution":"theverge.com"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"platform.openai.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search0\ue202turn5search21\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn5search12\ue201","start_idx":9567,"end_idx":9627,"safe_urls":["https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview","https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview","https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp","https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol","https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Tool use with Claude - Claude API Docs","url":"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Learn everything you need to master tool use with Claude as part of our new courses! \u00b7 Guarantee schema conformance with strict tool use \u00b7 Anthropic-defined tools ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Agent SDK overview - Claude API Docs","url":"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OverviewHow to implement tool useFine-grained tool streamingBash toolCode ...

As these AI-driven digital workers proliferate, there is a growing need for the same robust authentication and identity governance used for human employees. Okta sees this as a major growth opportunity, expanding its addressable market beyond $80 billion.\n\nThe company has shifted toward sustained profitability, generating growing free cash flow and strong financial performance. In its latest quarter, Okta reported $742 million in revenue (up 12% year-over-year) and adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 (a 22% rise). High-value customers are increasing, with those generating over $1 million in annual contract value up 17%.\n\nOkta's platform-agnostic, identity-focused model distinguishes it from companies like Microsoft and positions it well within the cybersecurity landscape. Its product suite now includes governance and compliance services, with AI security becoming a core pillar. It recently raised its 2026 revenue and earnings forecasts and approved a $1 billion share repurchase.\n\nDespite current undervaluation\u2014trading 35% below its 52-week high\u2014analysts remain optimistic about Okta\u2019s long-term trajectory, though competition and volatility remain risks.","attribution":"barrons.com"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"okta.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search5\ue201","start_idx":11799,"end_idx":11831,"safe_urls":["https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud/ai-spm","https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud/ai-spm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.paloaltonetworks.sg/cortex/cloud/ai-security-posture-management","https://www.paloaltonetworks.sg/cortex/cloud/ai-security-posture-management?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud/ai-spm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI Security Posture Management","url":"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud/ai-spm?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Prisma Cloud AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) gives you visibility and control over the three critical components of your AI security.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM)","url":"https://www.paloaltonetworks.sg/cortex/cloud/ai-security-posture-management?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) gives you visibility and control over your training data, AI models, GenAI and AI supply chain to secure your AI ...","attribution":"paloaltonetworks.sg"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"paloaltonetworks.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search18\ue201","start_idx":12308,"end_idx":12341,"safe_urls":["https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/multi-agent-patterns","https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/multi-agent-patterns?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/multi-agent-orchestration-maker-controls-and-more-microsoft-copilot-studio-announcements-at-microsoft-build-2025/","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/multi-agent-orchestration-maker-controls-and-more-microsoft-copilot-studio-announcements-at-microsoft-build-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/multi-agent-orchestration-maker-controls-and-more-microsoft-copilot-studio-announcements-at-microsoft-build-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Multi-agent orchestration and more: Copilot Studio ...","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/multi-agent-orchestration-maker-controls-and-more-microsoft-copilot-studio-announcements-at-microsoft-build-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"19 May 2025 \u2014 From multi-agent orchestration to more maker controls, computer use in agents to code interpreter, read on for a first look at Copilot Studio's exciting ...Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Explore multi-agent orchestration patterns","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/multi-agent-patterns?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"20 Jan 2026 \u2014 Learn how to compose inline and connected agents, manage handoffs, and enforce guardrails to deliver modular, scalable workflows.","attribution":"Microsoft Learn"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":18}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Microsoft"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search27\ue201","start_idx":12411,"end_idx":12444,"safe_urls":["https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/","https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-summit-agentic-ai-innovations-2025","https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-summit-agentic-ai-innovations-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI Agents -

This approach targets enterprises that handle confidential data and require customizable solutions. Nvidia sees significant potential in the AI agent market, estimating it could reach $1 trillion, similar to the current enterprise software market. However, widespread enterprise adoption of AI agents has been slow, partly due to difficulties integrating corporate data into the technology. NeMo microservices addresses this by simplifying data integration and agent training. This initiative aligns with Nvidia's broader strategy of bundling software with its powerful GPU hardware, enhancing appeal by being cloud-agnostic and avoiding vendor lock-in, according to IDC's Dave McCarthy. This positions Nvidia alongside other major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in the race to support enterprise AI development.","attribution":"The Wall Street Journal"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"nvidia.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0news44\ue201","start_idx":12795,"end_idx":12839,"safe_urls":["https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/","https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents.html","https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wsj.com/articles/openai-and-servicenow-strike-deal-to-put-ai-agents-in-business-software-57d1da5c","https://www.wsj.com/articles/openai-and-servicenow-strike-deal-to-put-ai-agents-in-business-software-57d1da5c?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Agentforce: The AI Agent Platform","url":"https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Agentforce can transform any team and workflow with AI agents. \u00b7 The most complete enterprise agentic platform. \u00b7 Tools to manage the entire agent lifecycle.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"AI Agents","url":"https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"ServiceNow AI Agents, powered by the ServiceNow AI Platform, automate workflows, streamline operations, and adapt to diverse business needs across IT, HR, CRM, ...Read more","attribution":"ServiceNow"},{"title":"OpenAI and ServiceNow Strike Deal to Put AI Agents in Business Software","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/openai-and-servicenow-strike-deal-to-put-ai-agents-in-business-software-57d1da5c?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"OpenAI and ServiceNow have signed a three-year agreement to integrate OpenAI\u2019s advanced AI models into ServiceNow\u2019s business software platforms.
