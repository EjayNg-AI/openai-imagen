In the late 1980s, Edward Witten\u2019s work on quantum field theories (like the Jones polynomial via Chern\u2013Simons theory and Donaldson invariants via topologically twisted $N=2$ Yang\u2013Mills) demonstrated that quantum physics could produce powerful **topological invariants**\u30107\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u30107\u2020L129-L137\u3011. Mathematicians soon distilled a definition of TQFT: **Michael Atiyah (1988)** formalized a TQFT as a functor from an $n$-dimensional *cobordism category* to the category of vector spaces (or other algebraic structures), obeying locality (gluing) and monoidal axioms\u301010\u2020L193-L202\u3011\u301010\u2020L201-L209\u3011. Intuitively, a TQFT assigns a finite-dimensional vector space (the \u201cstate space\u201d) to each closed $(n\\!-\\!1)$-dimensional manifold (a \u201cspace\u201d slice of spacetime), and a linear map to each $n$-dimensional cobordism between manifolds (a \u201cspacetime\u201d interpolating between slices). Disjoint unions of manifolds are sent to tensor products of vector spaces, reflecting the physical idea that separated components have independent state spaces\u301010\u2020L201-L209\u3011\u301031\u2020L56-L64\u3011. These axioms capture the *topological* nature of the theory: the assigned algebraic data depends only on the topology of the manifolds, not on geometric details. Early examples to keep in mind include **2-dimensional TQFTs**, which are completely classified by **commutative Frobenius algebras** (a theorem of Abrams, Atiyah, Dijkgraaf, Segal and others), and **3-dimensional TQFTs** like Chern\u2013Simons theory, which are related to quantum groups and modular tensor categories (Reshetikhin\u2013Turaev, Witten). For a classical introduction to TQFT, with physical motivation and the Atiyah-Segal axioms, see **Dan Freed\u2019s 1992 lectures**\u301030\u2020L349-L358\u3011 \u2013 Freed emphasizes locality and the analogy to homology theory, noting that in a TQFT the *homotopy* invariance is **strengthened** to *cobordism* invariance and the additivity is replaced by a **multiplicative gluing law**\u301010\u2020L193-L202\u3011\u301010\u2020L201-L209\u3011.\n\nThis reading list is structured to take a reader with background in undergraduate quantum mechanics, algebraic topology, homological algebra, and basic category theory/model categories from these foundations to the modern research frontier of TQFT. In particular, we focus on the modern *categorical* formulation of TQFT \u2013 the language of **higher categories** (especially **symmetric monoidal \u221e-categories** and **stable \u221e-categories**) that culminates in **Lurie\u2019s Cobordism Hypothesis**. We outline key references in roughly increasing order of sophistication: starting with foundational papers and expository texts, then moving through the development of **extended TQFT** and higher category theory, and finally surveying cutting-edge research linking TQFT with stable homotopy theory, derived algebraic geometry, and open problems at the intersection of topology, higher algebra, and quantum field theory.\n\n*(Throughout, we will preserve references in the form \u3010source\u2020lines\u3011 which link to documents or papers, and we include some brief annotations for guidance. The list is comprehensive but by no means exhaustive \u2013 it aims to provide a roadmap into the literature.)*\n\n## Foundations of Topological Quantum Field Theory \n**Atiyah\u2019s Axioms and Early Examples:** The modern definition of an $n$-dimensional TQFT was given by *Atiyah*\u301010\u2020L193-L202\u3011 (inspired by *Segal\u2019s* axioms for conformal field theory). Atiyah defines a TQFT as a symmetric monoidal functor \n\\[ Z: \\mathbf{Cob}_n \\;\\to\\; \\mathbf{Vect}_k, \\] \nfrom the category of **$n$-Cobordisms** (smooth, oriented $n$-manifolds as morphisms (cobordisms) between $(n\\!-\\!1)$-manifolds as objects) to the category of vector spaces over a field $k$\u301031\u2020L56-L64\u3011. Here disjoint union of manifolds is the monoidal operation on $\\mathbf{Cob}_n$, and the tensor product of vector spaces is the monoidal operation on $\\mathbf{Vect}_k$. The functor $Z$ assigns to each closed $(n-1)$-manifold $\\Sigma$ a vector space $Z(\\Sigma)$ (the state space), and to each $n$-dimensional cobordism $M:\\Sigma_0\\to \\Sigma_1$ a linear map $Z(M): Z(\\Sigma_0)\\to Z(\\Sigma_1)$. Gluing cobordisms corresponds to composing linear maps, and disjoint unions correspond to tensor products\u301031\u2020L56-L64\u3011. Crucially, $Z(\\emptyset)=k$ (the ground field) as the unit object, reflecting that the empty manifold yields a one-dimensional trivial state. Atiyah\u2019s paper *\u201cTopological quantum field theories\u201d* (1988) is very short (12 pages) and a recommended primary reference\u301010\u2020L193-L202\u3011\u301010\u2020L201-L209\u3011 for the axioms. In parallel, *Graeme Segal\u2019s* unpublished notes (circa 1987) on conformal field theory axiomatized the notion of functorial field theories in an $n=2$ context, and are also worth reading for perspective (they influenced Atiyah; see Atiyah\u2019s acknowledgment of Segal\u301010\u2020L173-L181\u3011). \n\n- **Basic references:** For a gentle introduction, see **Daniel S. Freed\u2019s** *\u201cLectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory\u201d*\u301030\u2020L349-L358\u3011, which provide a physicist-friendly yet mathematically inclined overview. Freed\u2019s notes (written in 1992, available on his website) discuss 2D and 3D examples, the role of gluing laws, and how TQFT fits into the broader context of quantum field theory (e.g. path integrals in a toy finite model)\u301029\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u301029\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Another excellent source is **John Baez & Javier P. Muniain\u2019s** book *\u201cGauge Fields, Knots and Gravity\u201d* (1994) \u2013 Chapter 4 gives an introduction to 3D TQFT and knot invariants from a categorical viewpoint. For the **2D case**, **Joachim Kock\u2019s** book *\u201cFrobenius Algebras and 2D TQFT\u201d* (2004) is a beautiful exposition: it proves that 2-dimensional oriented TQFTs are equivalent to commutative Frobenius algebras. In a 2D TQFT, the genus-0 **pair-of-pants cobordism** (a sphere with three boundary circles, two incoming and one outgoing) corresponds to the multiplication map $\\mu: A\\otimes A \\to A$ of a Frobenius algebra $A$, while the upside-down pair-of-pants gives the coproduct (comultiplication)\u301045\u2020L279-L287\u3011\u301045\u2020L290-L295\u3011. The Frobenius algebra axioms (associativity, coassociativity, and a nondegenerate bilinear form pairing inputs and outputs) arise exactly from topological homeomorphisms of surfaces that relate different compositions of cobordisms \u2013 a vivid illustration that \u201ctopology = algebra\u201d in these theories. This 2D example is a model case to keep in mind; it underlies more complicated higher-dimensional analogies. For an accessible summary of the 2D case, see the expository paper by **Abrams** (1996) or the early sections of Kock\u2019s book. \n\n- **3D TQFT and Knot Invariants:** In dimension 3, TQFT connects to knot and manifold invariants. The pioneering example is Witten\u2019s **Chern\u2013Simons TQFT**, which for each compact Lie group (and level) produces a 3D TQFT whose state spaces on surfaces are related to the group\u2019s representation theory, and whose manifold invariants include the Jones polynomial for knots\u30107\u2020L125-L133\u3011\u30107\u2020L129-L137\u3011. Rigorous construction was supplied by **Reshetikhin\u2013Turaev (1991)** using quantum groups, leading to the notion of **modular tensor categories** \u2013 algebraic structures that serve as \u201ctargets\u201d for 3D TQFTs. **Vladimir Turaev\u2019s** book *\u201cQuantum Invariants of Knots and 3-Manifolds\u201d* (1994; 2nd ed. 2010) is the standard reference, introducing modular categories and the Turaev\u2013Viro state-sum invariant (which is another 3D TQFT constructed from a certain tensor category). These works showed that much of the **\u201cquantum algebra\u201d** developed in the 1980s can be understood as providing **TQFT data**. For a survey at an elementary level, **Baez\u2019s** article *\u201cQuantum Quandaries\u201d* (2006) gives a conceptual overview linking category theory and physics, including a gentle introduction to how a category of representations yields a TQFT. By the end of this foundational stage, one should be comfortable with the **functorial point of view**: knowing Atiyah\u2019s axioms, understanding examples like 2D (Frobenius algebras) and 3D (quantum group and category-based) TQFTs, and why TQFTs can be seen as **\u201ctopological analogues\u201d of quantum mechanics/field theory** (with state spaces and operators that depend only on topological features). Good exercise references are **Kevin Walker\u2019s** online notes (circa 1991, unpublished but circulated) which work out many low-dimensional TQFT examples and ideas.\n\n**Recommended foundational readings:**\n\n- *Atiyah, \u201cTopological quantum field theories,\u201d* Pub.

(Although we will revisit this below, we list it here as it starts with a very readable **overview of low-dimensional TQFT** and how category theory enters the picture. Section 1 of this paper is a friendly introduction to why categories (and higher categories) naturally arise when formalizing TQFTs \u2013 highly recommended after one knows the basic axioms. It foreshadows extended TQFT.)\n\n## Extended TQFT and the Rise of Higher Categories \nAs the field developed, it became clear that **Atiyah\u2019s axioms were not the end of the story**. In Atiyah\u2019s formulation (sometimes called \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cunextended\u201d TQFT), one only assigns state spaces to closed $(n-1)$-manifolds and numbers to closed $n$-manifolds. However, many natural examples of TQFT (especially those coming from physics) have richer structure: they assign **additional data to lower-dimensional boundaries, corners, etc.** For instance, a **TQFT with boundaries** might assign not just a number to a closed 2D surface, but a vector space to a 1D boundary circle, and perhaps even a category to a 0D corner point. This led to the concept of **Extended TQFT**, formulated by *John Baez and James Dolan* in the mid-1990s. An *extended* $n$-TQFT assigns data not just to top-dimensional manifolds, but consistently to all $k$-dimensional submanifolds ($k=0,1,\\dots,n$). For example, a **fully extended 2D TQFT** would assign: objects to points (0-manifolds), 1-morphisms to 1D bordisms (intervals) between points, and 2-morphisms to 2D surfaces between those intervals \u2013 in other words, it is a functor \n\\[ Z: \\mathbf{Cob}_2^{\\text{ext}} \\to C, \\] \nwhere $\\mathbf{Cob}_2^{\\text{ext}}$ is a **2-category** (or $(\\infty,2)$-category) of bordisms (with points, intervals, surfaces), and $C$ is some target 2-category. In practice $C$ might be the 2-category of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners, so that $Z(\\text{point})$ is an algebra object, $Z(\\text{interval})$ is a bimodule (giving a map of algebras), etc.\u301016\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301016\u2020L43-L50\u3011. In this example, one recovers the fact that a 2D extended TQFT is determined by a Frobenius algebra (the value on a point). \n\nRealizing this vision required a new language: **higher category theory**. Baez and Dolan conjectured the **Cobordism Hypothesis** (1995) which informally states: *an $n$-dimensional fully extended TQFT is completely determined by the single piece of data it assigns to a point (a 0-dimensional manifold), which must be a \u201cfully dualizable\u201d object in the target $(\\infty,n)$-category.*\u301036\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301036\u2020L19-L27\u3011 In plainer terms, once you specify $Z(\\text{point})=X$, an object in some symmetric monoidal $n$-category $C$, then there is (conjecturally) a unique consistent extended TQFT $Z$ with that point data, *if and only if* $X$ has certain finiteness, duality, and adjointability properties (fully dualizable means it has duals at all levels up to $n$). This beautiful hypothesis provides a kind of *classification* of extended TQFTs by algebraic objects. It generalizes the 2D case (point $\\mapsto$ Frobenius algebra) and the 3D case (point $\\mapsto$ spherical fusion category or modular tensor category, roughly). \n\nTo make these ideas precise, mathematicians had to develop rigorous frameworks for **$(\\infty,n)$-categories** \u2013 informally, categories with up to $n$ levels of morphisms (and beyond that everything is invertible). Early efforts by Baez\u2013Dolan, Kapranov\u2013Voevodsky, and others defined special cases (like 2-categories, 3-categories, \u201cweak\u201d n-categories). A major leap came with **Jacob Lurie\u2019s work (2006\u20132009)** formulating $(\\infty,n)$-categories using the language of **$\\infty$-categories** (see next section) and **simplicial manifolds**, and eventually giving a proof of the Cobordism Hypothesis. Lurie\u2019s *\u201cOn the Classification of Topological Field Theories\u201d*\u30105\u2020L69-L77\u3011\u30105\u2020L81-L89\u3011 (2009, 100+ pages) provides an outline of a proof of the Baez\u2013Dolan conjecture. In essence, Lurie showed that the $n$-category of $n$-bordisms (with a certain tangential structure, like framing) is the **\u201cfree symmetric monoidal $n$-category generated by a fully dualizable object.\u201d** Each fully dualizable object $X$ in a symmetric monoidal $(\\infty,n)$-category $C$ therefore determines a unique framed $n$-TQFT $Z$ with $Z(\\ast)=X$\u301036\u2020L7-L15\u3011. If one wants oriented or spin TQFTs, one uses variants of the cobordism category (with $O(n)$ or $Spin(n)$-structure) and imposes corresponding conditions on $X$ (e.g. oriented TQFT requires $X$ to carry an $O(n)$-action, etc., making it **not just fully dualizable but \u201c$n$-dualizable\u201d in a weaker sense**\u30100\u2020L9-L12\u3011\u30100\u2020L19-L23\u3011). The Cobordism Hypothesis was *finally proven* in full generality by **Ayala and Francis (2017)** using factorization homology methods\u30104\u2020L2-L7\u3011\u30104\u2020L25-L33\u3011, building on prior partial results (e.g. **Hopkins\u2013Lurie** for $n=2$ and unoriented, **Lurie** for framed case, **Schommer-Pries (2009)** for $n=2$ oriented, etc.). \n\nWhat does this mean concretely? It means to specify an *extended* TQFT, we \u201conly\u201d need to pick an object $X$ in some known higher category and verify it has the required duals. For example, in a **3D oriented TQFT**, $Z(\\text{point})$ might be a **fusion category** (a certain semisimple monoidal category) \u2013 fully dualizable in the 3-category of monoidal categories, bimodule categories, and functors \u2013 and the Cobordism Hypothesis implies that giving such a fusion category is equivalent to giving a 3D TQFT\u301034\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u301036\u2020L7-L15\u3011. This reframes the classification problem for TQFTs as an **algebraic problem**: classify fully dualizable objects in various symmetric monoidal higher-categories. While that is still a hard problem, it is something algebraists and homotopy theorists can attack with known tools.\n\n**Key readings for extended TQFT:**\n\n- *Baez & Dolan (1995), \u201cHigher-dimensional algebra and TQFT\u201d*\u301034\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301036\u2020L7-L15\u3011. *Recommended:* the **introduction and section 2** are very accessible.

Lurie sets up the problem in the language of $(\\infty,n)$-categories and sketches the proof that an $n$-TQFT (specifically, a fully extended **framed** TQFT) is equivalent to a fully dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal $(\\infty,n)$-category\u301036\u2020L7-L15\u3011. He also discusses examples (like how a **fully dualizable object in $\\mathbf{Vect}$ is just a finite-dimensional vector space**, recovering Atiyah\u2019s original picture in the 1-dimensional case, and how dualizability corresponds to finite-dimensionality/invertibility of counits, etc.).

This paper (together with related works by Ayala, Francis, and Tanaka on factorization homology) gives a modern proof of the Cobordism Hypothesis.

We also recommend **Kevin Walker\u2019s** proposed classification of 3D TQFTs (unpublished notes, 2011) which anticipate that *\u201c3D TQFT = spherical fusion categories\u201d* and outline the idea of computing 3D cobordism 2-category generators and relations. While some of Walker\u2019s arguments remain conjectural, they influenced later developments and offer intuition on how one might *present* cobordism categories. \n\nIn summary, this part of the reading list should leave you with an understanding that moving beyond the original axioms of TQFT required embracing **higher categories** and dualizability. The notion of **symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category** is central \u2013 one needs it to even state the Cobordism Hypothesis precisely. Thus, we now turn to a brief primer on $\\infty$-categories and **stable $\\infty$-categories**, which will be important for connecting TQFT to other areas like homological algebra and derived geometry.\n\n## Higher Categories and Stable \u221e-Categories \nThe language of **$\\mathbf{\\infty}$-categories** (particularly $(\\infty,1)$-categories and $(\\infty,n)$-categories) has become the lingua franca of modern algebraic topology, homological algebra, and now TQFT. An $(\\infty,1)$-category can be thought of informally as a category where you have objects, morphisms between objects, *and* homotopies between morphisms, homotopies between homotopies, and so on \u2013 all higher morphisms above the first level are *invertible*. This is exactly what you get, for example, if you take a category of topological spaces: the hom-sets are replaced by homotopy classes of maps, which naturally form an $\\infty$-groupoid. In general, working with $\\infty$-categories allows one to do algebra **up to coherent homotopy**, which is essential in topology and derived geometry. **Jacob Lurie\u2019s** books *\u201cHigher Topos Theory\u201d* (HTT, 2009) and *\u201cHigher Algebra\u201d* (HA, 2017 draft) are comprehensive references introducing $\\infty$-categories (via **quasi-categories**) and developing their theory. These are challenging texts, but they have become standard. \n\nFor our purposes, a few key ideas and definitions are needed:\n\n- A **monoidal $\\infty$-category** is the homotopy-coherent analogue of a monoidal category. For example, the $\\infty$-category of spaces is monoidal (via Cartesian product or smash product), the $\\infty$-category of chain complexes is monoidal (via tensor product), etc. Many invariants in homotopy theory are naturally expressed by monoidal $\\infty$-functors (E.g. cohomology theories are monoidal functors from spectra to spaces).\n\n- A **symmetric monoidal $(\\infty,n)$-category** is the structure in which the Cobordism Hypothesis is formulated. Roughly, it is an $n$-category (with invertibility above level $n$) that is also equipped with a symmetric monoidal product (with all coherence data up to homotopy). The category of $n$-dimensional cobordisms, $\\mathbf{Cob}_n$, is such an $(\\infty,n)$-category (symmetric monoidal by disjoint union). The target of an extended TQFT, like the $(\\infty,n)$-category of $n\\!-\\!1$-categories (or $n$-vector spaces, etc.), is also symmetric monoidal via Deligne tensor product or similar.\n\n- A **stable $(\\infty,1)$-category** (often just called a **stable $\\infty$-category**) is an $\\infty$-category with features analogous to a triangulated category, but in a fully homotopy-coherent way. Formally, a stable $\\infty$-category $C$ is an $(\\infty,1)$-category that is pointed (has a zero object), has all finite limits and colimits, and such that every exact triangle \u201cfits\u201d (any pushout is a pullback and vice versa)\u301014\u2020L38-L46\u3011. Equivalently, $C$ has a suspension functor and every fiber sequence is a cofiber sequence\u301014\u2020L38-L46\u3011. The prototypical example is **$Sp$**, the $\\infty$-category of spectra (stable homotopy types), which is *the* universal stable $\\infty$-category\u301011\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In fact, one characterization is that a stable $\\infty$-category is a full subcategory of $Sp^{I}$ (diagrams of spectra) for some indexing shape $I$. Stable $\\infty$-categories provide the natural home for homological algebra: for example, the derived category $D(A)$ of an abelian category $A$ can be enhanced to a stable $\\infty$-category (removing the need to pass through triangulated categories which lose information). **Lurie\u2019s** *\u201cDerived Algebraic Geometry I: Stable $\\infty$-Categories\u201d* (2007) is an exposition of this, explaining how classical derived categories are subsumed by stable $\\infty$-categories\u301015\u2020L9-L17\u3011. A stable $\\infty$-category has a **homotopy category** which is triangulated, but the $\\infty$-category contains strictly more information (like higher homotopies between morphisms). Working with stable $\\infty$-categories allows one to *avoid the technical pitfalls* of triangulated categories (like non-functorial cones) and carry out derived functor constructions very cleanly. \n\nIn the context of TQFT, stable $\\infty$-categories often appear as **target categories** for TQFTs that are more general than Atiyah\u2019s original vector-space-valued ones. For example, one fruitful idea is to have a TQFT valued not in plain $\\mathbf{Vect}$ (which is like $\\pi_0$ of a stable category of chain complexes) but in $\\mathbf{Ch}$ (chain complexes) or $Sp$ (spectra). Such theories are sometimes called **homotopical or \u201cextended\u201d TQFTs**; they can carry richer information (like finer homotopy invariants rather than just numerical invariants). Another scenario: in an **extended 2D TQFT** as constructed by **Kevin Costello** or **Chris Schommer-Pries**, one might take the target $C$ to be the $(\\infty,2)$-category of **Calabi\u2013Yau categories** (which are stable $\\infty$-categories with extra structure) instead of just the 2-category of pure algebraic Frobenius algebras. This is connected to ideas in mirror symmetry and **category-valued field theories** (sometimes called \u201ccategorified\u201d TQFTs). For instance, one can have a 2D TQFT where the state space on $S^1$ is not just a vector space but a whole derived category of coherent sheaves on some variety (this happens in certain topologically twisted sigma models in physics). To accommodate that, one needs the target of the functor to be something like the $(\\infty,2)$-category of stable $\\infty$-categories (with monoidal structure given by tensor product of categories). Indeed, **Ben-Zvi, Francis, and Nadler (2010)** constructed an example of a fully extended 2D TQFT by taking $Z(\\text{pt}) = QC(X)$, the $\\infty$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a fixed derived stack $X$. This $QC(X)$ is a stable $\\infty$-category (monoidal under $\\otimes$), and it is fully dualizable in the symmetric monoidal 2-category of presentable stable $\\infty$-categories\u301016\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301016\u2020L33-L41\u3011. By the cobordism hypothesis, it therefore determines a 2D TQFT. In this theory, a closed 1-manifold ($S^1$) is assigned the category $QC(X)$, and a closed 2-manifold (like a pair-of-pants) gives a functor $QC(X)\\otimes QC(X)\\to QC(X)$, which turns out to be the *tensor product of categories of sheaves* on a fiber product of stacks\u301016\u2020L17-L25\u3011\u301016\u2020L25-L28\u3011. Concretely, they proved a crucial identity $QC(X_1 \\times_X X_2)\\cong QC(X_1)\\underset{QC(X)}{\\otimes} QC(X_2)$ relating fiber product of spaces to tensor product of categories\u301016\u2020L17-L25\u3011\u301038\u2020L55-L63\u3011. This result is a **bridge between geometry and algebra**: it means that cutting a surface along a curve corresponds to \u201cfactorizing\u201d the category (an integral transform perspective). This example is a beautiful application of stable $\\infty$-categories in TQFT.

These concepts will be crucial in the next section, where we see how modern TQFT formalism is formulated using *stable* and *symmetric monoidal* $\\infty$-categories \u2013 for example, fully dualizable objects often live in a stable setting (like the category of modules over a ring spectrum, etc.). \n\n## Interplay of TQFT with Stable \u221e-Categories and Derived Geometry \nOne of the most exciting aspects of modern TQFT research is its interaction with **derived algebraic geometry** and **higher algebra**. In many situations, the \u201cvalues\u201d of a TQFT (the state spaces and operators it assigns) are naturally objects like *chain complexes, spectra, or categories*, rather than finite-dimensional vector spaces. Stable $\\infty$-categories provide the right framework for these generalized values. Here we highlight a few key themes and references at this intersection:\n\n- **Cobordism Hypothesis with **Structured** Targets:** The classical Cobordism Hypothesis discussed above has extensions where manifolds carry additional structure (orientation, spin, $G$-bundles, etc.), and accordingly the \u201cfully dualizable object\u201d must live in a target $\\infty$-category with that structure. For example, **Freed and Hopkins** have studied **invertible** TQFTs (where all state spaces are 1-dimensional and all partition functions are roots of unity) in depth, because these correspond to elements of certain **generalized cohomology theories**. In their work *\u201cReflection positivity and invertible topological phases\u201d* (2016\u20132021)\u301046\u2020L50-L58\u3011\u301046\u2020L53-L60\u3011, they implement the cobordism hypothesis for *reflection-positive* (unitary) theories and show that the group of deformation classes of invertible TQFTs in dimension $n$ with symmetry $G$ is given by (a subgroup of) the $n^{th}$ homotopy group of a Thom spectrum (the $G$-bordism spectrum)\u301046\u2020L50-L58\u3011\u301046\u2020L55-L60\u3011. This is a beautiful result connecting TQFT classification to stable homotopy groups and cobordism theory (in the classical sense of Thom spectra like $MO, MSO, MSpin$, etc.). For example, **one can recover the classical result** (due to Kitaev and others, proven by Freed\u2013Hopkins) that 2D invertible phases with $Fermionic$ (spin) structure and no other symmetry are classified by the spin bordism group $\\Omega_2^{Spin}\\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$ \u2013 this is essentially the generator of the complex Kitaev chain phase (the $\\mathbb{Z}/2$-valued Majorana fermion invariant). Freed\u2013Hopkins\u2019s work is quite advanced, but it\u2019s a pinnacle of how stable homotopy ($\\Omega$-spectra) enters TQFT: to understand all invertible TQFTs (which form an abelian group under stacking), you compute stable homotopy classes of maps (bordism invariants)\u301046\u2020L50-L58\u3011. For a gentler entr\u00e9e to this, see Freed\u2019s *ICM 2018 lecture \u201cAnomalies and Invertible Field Theories\u201d* or Freed\u2019s survey *\u201cShort-range entanglement and invertible field theories\u201d* (2014). These explain how once-extended invertible TQFTs in $d$ dimensions are essentially elements of $\\pi_0$ of some Thom spectrum (and once you fully extend, higher $\\pi_k$ come into play).\n\n- **TQFT and Derived Categories of Sheaves:** We already mentioned the example by **Ben-Zvi, Francis, Nadler** where a 2D TQFT is constructed from the stable $\\infty$-category $QC(X)$. This fits into a broader paradigm of using **geometric data to generate field theories**. A slogan here is *\u201ccategories are the new vectors\u201d*. Whereas a traditional TQFT gives numbers and vector spaces, a categorified one gives vector spaces and categories. There are multiple instances: **Kapustin, Rozansky, Witten (mid-2000s)** connected 3D $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric theories to derived categories of coherent sheaves and the **3D Rozansky\u2013Witten TQFT** (which assigns a category to a 2D surface \u2013 specifically the derived category of a hyper-K\u00e4hler target\u2019s sheaves). **Costello\u2019s** work on **Topological (Conformal) Field Theories** (circa 2007, in his book *\u201cRenormalization and Effective Field Theory\u201d*) also constructs field theories whose state spaces are chain complexes of geometric origin. If you are interested in these physical examples, *Kapustin\u2019s lectures on \u201cTopological Field Theory (2008)\u201d* and *Costello\u2013Gwilliam\u2019s book \u201cFactorization Algebras in Quantum Field Theory\u201d* (2017) give some perspective on how **derived algebraic geometry** (like moduli of bundles, etc.) yields TQFT data via BRST/BV formalisms. \n\n- **Factorization Homology and $E_n$-Algebras:** A powerful toolkit in modern TQFT is **factorization homology** (or topological chiral homology), developed by Ayala, Francis, Lurie, and others. This is essentially a higher-categorical version of the idea of an \u201c$n$-dimensional field theory determined by local data.\u201d Technically, given an **$E_n$-algebra** (an algebra with an $n$-fold commutative structure) in a symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category $C$, one can integrate it over an $n$-manifold to get an object of $C$ \u2013 this is factorization homology. The relevance to TQFT is that giving an $E_n$-algebra is like giving the data of a fully extended TQFT on an $n$-ball (local operators), and factorization homology can be seen as *building the extended TQFT by integrating these local degrees of freedom*. Ayala\u2013Francis (2015) *\u201cFactorization Homology of Stratified Spaces\u201d* and Lurie\u2019s *\u201cHigher Algebra\u201d* (chapters on $E_n$-objects and their homology) are key references. While this is a bit tangential to our main line, it\u2019s a big part of current research. For a simpler introduction, see **John Francis\u2019s** 2013 ICM talk *\u201cFactorization Homology and Topological Field Theories\u201d*. In short, factorization homology gives a way to *construct* extended TQFTs from algebraic data (and is deeply related to the Cobordism Hypothesis as well \u2013 essentially providing the \u201cif\u201d direction by constructing a theory from a fully dualizable object). \n\n- **Examples in Higher Geometry:** The interplay of TQFT and stable categories also appears in the study of the **Moduli space of Riemann surfaces**. For example, the famous **Segal\u2013Cohen algebraic topological approach** to 2D conformal field theory can be seen as assigning spectra to surfaces (cobordism to a point yields a spectrum whose homotopy is related to moduli space homology). The **Madsen\u2013Tillmann\u2013Weiss (MTW) theorem** and **Galatius\u2019 theorem** on the homology of cobordism categories (Annals 2011) are results purely in topology, but conceptually linked: they identify the classifying space of the $n$-cobordism category (without a functor, just the category itself) with a certain infinite loop space (related to Thom spectra like $MO$). These results provide input to the Cobordism Hypothesis and also show that *\u201cthe space of all TQFTs\u201d* has a homotopy type of its own. In particular, **Galatius, Madsen, Tillmann, Weiss (2006)** showed that the classifying space of the 2D cobordism category is an infinite loop space corresponding to a Thom spectrum ($MTSO(2)$), which indirectly leads to understanding how *unstable* phenomena in a category stabilize after a point (echoing Baez\u2013Dolan\u2019s stabilization hypothesis\u30105\u2020L113-L121\u3011). For a modern treatment, see *\u201cHomological stability for cobordism categories\u201d (Galatius\u2013Randal-Williams 2018)*.\n\nSummarizing this section: *stable $\\infty$-categories appear as natural targets or values of TQFTs whenever we allow homotopical or categorical enhancements*. The **applications in derived and higher geometry** include using TQFT as a tool to produce invariants of manifolds valued in exotic theories (like **K-theory, elliptic cohomology, etc.** via invertible field theories), as well as using geometric techniques to produce new TQFTs (like via factorization homology or categories of sheaves on moduli spaces). As this is a rapidly evolving area, a good strategy is to follow a few active researchers: for example, **Theo Johnson-Freyd** (often writes about higher categories and phases of matter\u301022\u2020L9-L17\u3011), **David Reutter**, **Claudia Scheimbauer** (on oriented field theories and bimodules), **Kevin Costello** (on gauge theory and string theory aspects), and **Dan Freed & Mike Hopkins** (on homotopy-theoretic classification of TQFT). Many of their papers assume a lot, but they often have extensive introductions or surveys embedded.\n\n**Key references bridging TQFT and higher geometry:**\n\n- *Ben-Zvi, Francis, Nadler, \u201cIntegral transforms and Drinfeld centers in DAG\u201d*, JAMS **23** (2010) 909\u2013966 \u301038\u2020L50-L59\u3011\u301038\u2020L59-L67\u3011.

While not proved, this \u201cST program\u201d guides a lot of thinking in how field theories might be used to *define* cohomology operations. It\u2019s beyond our scope, but worth knowing about as an ambitious frontier.)\n\n## Current Frontiers and Open Problems \nThe marriage of TQFT with stable $\\infty$-categories and higher algebra has opened many new directions. We conclude with a brief look at **current research frontiers** and some open problems:\n\n- **Classification of Non-Semisimple and Logarithmic TQFTs:** Classical 2D and 3D TQFT classifications (Frobenius algebras, modular categories) assumed semisimplicity (e.g. vector spaces are finite-dimensional and semi-simple). **What if these conditions are dropped?** In recent years, there is interest in **non-semisimple TQFTs** (e.g. ones related to logarithmic conformal field theory and representation categories of non-semisimple Hopf algebras). These do not fit into the original TQFT classification easily because their state spaces can be infinite-dimensional or indecomposable. The stable $\\infty$-category framework is flexible enough to handle such theories \u2013 for example, one can allow state spaces in an ind-completion of $\\mathbf{Vect}$ or chain complexes. A concrete open problem is to classify **2D extended TQFTs without the semisimplicity assumption** \u2013 conjecturally, these correspond to **balanced Frobenius algebras** (algebras with a possibly degenerate pairing). Partial progress has been made by **Gainutdinov, Runkel, et al.** who constructed specific examples of such TQFTs (e.g. using Lyubashenko\u2019s non-semisimple modular categories). This is a blend of algebra (e.g. understanding module categories of non-semisimple algebras) and categorical TQFT.\n\n- **TQFT with **Defects** and Higher Categories:** Realistic physical theories often have domain walls or defects of various codimensions. Mathematically, these are handled by **multi-tiered TQFTs** where one assigns categories not just to boundaries but to defect lines, etc. The fully extended TQFT framework already allows points, lines, surfaces as different levels of morphisms \u2013 but incorporating *labelings* or *defect conditions* means we consider **functors out of a stratified bordism $n$-category** into some target. **Open problem:** Formulate a complete *\u201ccobordism hypothesis with singularities\u201d* (there are conjectures by Lurie and schemas by Ayala\u2013Francis\u2013Tanaka). Some recent progress: **Y. Lekili and A. Polishchuk (2020)** studied 2d TQFT with defects in relation to Fukaya categories; **Decoppet, Runkel, et al. (2023)** looked at extending the Cobordism Hypothesis to include domain walls. This is cutting-edge, requiring an understanding of $(\\infty,n)$-categories with subcategories for defects (often modeled via *$(\\infty,n)$-operads*). The ultimate goal is a structure that classifies, say, 3D TQFTs with line and surface defects by algebraic data (like module categories, etc.) \u2013 a vast generalization still in progress.\n\n- **Topological Phases of Matter and Condensed Matter Physics:** As mentioned, TQFT has become a key tool in classifying topological phases (e.g. gapped phases of matter). The work of Freed\u2013Hopkins and others has translated physical symmetry and localization data into homotopy-theoretic terms (Thom spectra and cobordism invariants)\u301046\u2020L50-L58\u3011\u301046\u2020L53-L60\u3011. An active area is **crystalline symmetries** (spatial lattice symmetries) where one has to consider twisted equivariant versions of bordism (Johnson-Freyd and others are working on a \u201ccrystalline cobordism hypothesis\u201d\u301022\u2020L11-L19\u3011). An open problem is to rigorously define and classify **gapless** phases (which might require going beyond TQFT to conformal field theory or non-topological QFT), but invertible TQFT techniques might still apply to their anomalies. For the reader interested in physics, **Zhenghan Wang\u2019s** survey *\u201cTopological Quantum Computation\u201d* (especially the Outlook and Open Problems section) is enlightening\u301017\u2020L33-L36\u3011\u301017\u2020L31-L36\u3011 \u2013 it discusses the role of modular categories (3D TQFT) in quantum computing and the need for new mathematics (possibly higher categories for 4D and beyond) to handle more complex topological qubits or non-abelian anyons in 3+1D.\n\n- **Higher Geometries (Derived, Stacks) and Field Theories:** One frontier at the intersection of algebraic geometry and TQFT is understanding **7-dimensional** (and 6d) theories arising in string/M-theory using derived categorical methods. For instance, the **Kapustin\u2013Witten 4D topological twist** (related to geometric Langlands) leads to certain categories of branes (Fukaya categories vs. $D$-modules) that are equivalent \u2013 an example of a \u201cholographic\u201d or duality context where each side is a boundary condition category for a 4D TQFT. There is speculation that a fully extended 4D TQFT (which would be an $(\\infty,4)$-functor) could underlie the Geometric Langlands correspondence. *Open problem:* Construct a fully extended 4D TQFT for $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM (or even a simpler one like Donaldson theory) \u2013 this likely involves **4-categories** and is currently out of reach, but progress in simpler cases (e.g. 4D Crane\u2013Yetter model which uses braided fusion categories) is being made. Tools like **$G$-crossed braided categories** and **fusion 2-categories** (monoidal categories enriched in categories) are being developed to handle 4D phenomena (see work by **Douglas, Schommer-Pries, Snyder (2018)** on *\u201cFusion 2-categories and 4D TQFT\u201d*). The mathematics of **2-categories of bimodules** (which appear in 4D TFT via loop surfaces) is still developing, so there are foundational categorical questions here as well.\n\n- **Computational and Data Aspects:** With the classification of many TQFTs now reduced to algebraic or homotopy-theoretic data, there\u2019s an emerging computational angle: for example, computing stable homotopy groups for specific bordism spectra to identify invertible phases in higher dimensions (Freed\u2013Hopkins have tables up to dimension 20 or so, but beyond that it\u2019s very hard). Also, given a fully dualizable object in some category, how does one *compute* the resulting manifold invariants? For instance, given a fusion category, the 3-manifold invariants can be hard to compute for large examples. Thus, bridging the gap between *the existence proof of a TQFT and explicit computations* is often nontrivial \u2013 an open problem in its own right (one needs efficient state-sum models or algebraic descriptions). \n\nFinally, we highlight that the **formalization of TQFT in $\\infty$-categories is still ongoing**. While the cobordism hypothesis gives a conceptual classification, extracting concrete results (like \u201call 3D TQFTs are state-sum invariants of some algebraic data\u201d) is sometimes conditional on deep algebraic classification results (e.g. the classification of fusion categories in general is still open \u2013 it\u2019s known in certain rank and dimensionality cases, but a full classification is wild). So one open-ended question is: *to what extent can we classify or enumerate fully dualizable objects in various important symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-categories?* This is where algebra, number theory, and geometry feed back into topology. \n\nIn summary, the interplay of TQFT with stable $\\infty$-categories has revolutionized our understanding, leading to a unification with homotopy theory and higher algebra. It has provided a **universal language** to discuss quantum field theories in purely mathematical terms. The reading list above should equip you with the background to delve into this rich literature. From Atiyah\u2019s axioms to Lurie\u2019s hypothesis, and from vector spaces to $\\infty$-categories of spectra, the journey reflects the vibrant cross-pollination of ideas across mathematics and theoretical physics. With these resources, you are poised to explore further \u2013 whether it be understanding specific theories (like Chern\u2013Simons or the topological sigma-model) in higher-categorical terms, or contributing to the open problems in the field.

More generally, we show that the E_n-center and the E_n-trace (or E_n-Hochschild cohomology and homology categories respectively) of QC(X) are equivalent to the category of sheaves on the space of maps from the n-sphere into X. This directly verifies geometric instances of","attribution":"arxiv.org","icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u301046\u2020L50-L58\u3011","start_idx":51112,"end_idx":51124,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"[1604.06527] Reflection positivity and invertible topological phases","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06527#:~:text=,in%20quantum%20field%20theories%2C%20a","pub_date":null,"snippet":"> Abstract:We implement an extended version of reflection positivity (Wick- rotated unitarity) for invertible topological quantum field theories and compute the abelian group of deformation classes using stable homotopy theory.
