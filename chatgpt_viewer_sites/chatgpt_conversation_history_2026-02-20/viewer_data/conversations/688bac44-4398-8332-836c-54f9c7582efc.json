The views presented by the faculty or other guest speakers do not reflect official positions of the Naval War College, DON or DOD. \r\n\r\nSynopsis:\r\nThis lecture starts with the geopolitical cards dealt to the United States, Russia, and China. While the United States and its partners and allies are attempting to maintain a maritime global order to foster trade, China and Russia are great continental powers increasingly fixated on dominating territory. These differences have precipitated a Second Cold War. The second section will examine the views of those on both sides, who oversaw the end of the last Cold War, to explain how the democracies won without fighting a hot war. The final section will suggest some possible ways forward based on the geopolitical hand that the United States holds, the potential strategies that such a hand can support, and the strategies that proved most fruitful the last time around.\r\n\r\nSpeaker bio:\r\nSarah C.M. Paine, the College's William S. Sims University Professor of History and Grand Strategy, has published Wars for Asia, 1911-1949, Japanese Empire, and with Bruce A. Elleman, Modern China: Continuity and Change 1644 to the Present and five co-edited books on naval operations. The Economist just featured her in its annual special issue, \u201cThe World Ahead 2025.\u201d\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nwe got\r\n7:35\r\nthe current problem now which is a second Cold War and I believe my Reckoning is it began between 2012 and\r\n7:42\r\n14 why those dates 2012 is when Vlad the bad comes to power actually he disposes\r\n7:49\r\nterm limits that year and uh and then you get Xi Jinping coming into power and\r\n7:54\r\nthen 2014 is when uh Vlad the bad moves into Ukraine and and ever since Putin\r\n8:01\r\nand she have been emphasizing that they're not particularly interested in this rules based order and have other\r\n8:07\r\nplans for us so uh I've got a three-part lecture but really it's two main parts\r\n8:12\r\nthe first part is the underlying geopolitics and the second part is how the last Cold War was uh one lost and\r\n8:19\r\nplayed and then at the end I'll say based on all this what is the way forward and that'll be short if I go at\r\n8:25\r\na real rate I'll get this done in an hour and five so here we go uh first half it turns out that Continental\r\n8:32\r\nMaritime Empires ran business in fundamentally different ways how they wanted to organize themselves and how\r\n8:37\r\nthey wanted to organize others but then the Industrial Revolution came and put both of them out of business and\r\n8:43\r\nintroduced a maritime incoming Maritime rules-based order so that's what I'm going to talk about three parts first\r\n8:49\r\nhalf uh for those of you who like animals and we at the naval war College generally speaking most of us like\r\n8:55\r\nanimals so the maritime powers of the whales the the elephants are the Continental Powers all right so the\r\n9:02\r\nfirst distinguishing characteristic of Maritime versus Continental Powers is whether you can or cannot defend\r\n9:09\r\nprimarily at Sea look at Ukraine they cannot defend primarily at Sea so uh if\r\n9:14\r\nyou can having a big Navy would be a thing for you and if you can uh can only defend by land then you need to go to\r\n9:20\r\nArmy and these differences have profound not only military but also economic and political ramifications and I'll go into\r\n9:27\r\nthem the United States started out as tradition typical Continental power here's President Monroe the Monroe\r\n9:34\r\nDoctrine typical Continental power steers of influence telling the Europeans stay out of the Americas it's\r\n9:41\r\nours and here's how the United States expanded again like a typical Continental power it did a series of re\r\n9:47\r\nRegional Wars with Mexico the longest counterinsurgency in US history fought against the Native Americans uh but the\r\n9:54\r\ntwist that Americans liked was checkbook de diplomacy you know paying money to people and that's what the Louisiana\r\n10:01\r\nPurchase and uh buying Alaska were all about and Americans had a name for this\r\n10:07\r\nand it was Manifest Destiny it was the obvious manifest fate of America the\r\n10:12\r\nUnited States we see we appropriated the name for the entire continent to own own\r\n10:17\r\nat least North America and this painting which today goes by the politically\r\n10:22\r\ncorrect name of a Westward hoe at the time of painting was called Westward the course of Empire takes its way it's it\r\n10:28\r\nhangs in the Capital apparently in some part of the the House of Representatives so Americans in the 19th century\r\n10:34\r\nconsider themselves an Empire proud of it but the view changes in the late 19th\r\n10:39\r\ncentury and here Alfred the Mahan who is by far the most famous person ever\r\n10:44\r\nassociated with this college uh of of enduring International uh influence uh\r\n10:50\r\nhe looks at the world and thinks well actually it's not so much uh con\r\n10:56\r\nContinental consolidation that is the origin of power and position in this world but the the wealth uring from\r\n11:02\r\nMaritime trade and he said there are six prerequisites for playing this game of Maritime security Paradigm number one\r\n11:09\r\nyou need a moat you need insulation from Attack number two you need a dense inter internal Transportation grid to get the\r\n11:15\r\ngoods out in peace time you need reliable egress by sea to get the Navy out in Wartime you need dense Coastal\r\n11:22\r\npopulation these are the people running this Commerce driven economy and you need uh the Commerce driven economy that\r\n11:27\r\ngoes with them and you also need stable government institutions because uh this is going to\r\n11:33\r\nmean you have stable laws that uh promote uh Commerce and also promote the\r\n11:39\r\nNavy if you look at China and Russia Today neither one of them has a full list of six start with moat they most\r\n11:47\r\ncertainly do not have Moes either one of them in fact they each have more neighbors than any other two countries on the planet and a lot of those places\r\n11:53\r\ndon't much like them for excellent reasons moreover uh China has an improving internal transport ation grid\r\n12:00\r\nbut Russia's remains lamentable neither one has reliable access by sea because\r\n12:05\r\nthey're all surrounded by um narrow Island cluttered uh Coastal seas that\r\n12:11\r\nare surrounded by all kinds of neighbors that shut down in Wartime and I guess Russia's got the big arctic thing well great if you want to go Cort with polar\r\n12:18\r\nbears that's a place for you but not for Commerce uh in addition uh China has a dense Coastal population Russia doesn't\r\n12:25\r\nI mentioned the polar bears uh Russia has never had a Comm driven economy and under dun sha ping China was more so but\r\n12:33\r\nin recent years xiin ping has been privileging the crony sector over the private sector and neither China nor\r\n12:38\r\nRussia has stable government institutions and what would be the defining characteristic of that well uh\r\n12:44\r\nregular trans parent uh transfers of executive power and dictator for life\r\n12:49\r\ndoes not remotely qualify so China and Russia have some Mari time Ambitions but\r\n12:54\r\nthey don't have the geopolitical position actually to play the game and I'm not even clear they understand it\r\n13:00\r\nhere if you look at China it shows you a lot of vertical real estate there and the flat stuff up north a lot of it not\r\n13:07\r\nall of it is either awfully cold or awfully dry to grow much of anything so if you look where the Han live the\r\n13:13\r\npreponderant ethnic group of China it's all the pink places uh you can see where they live and then they're surrounded by\r\n13:19\r\nuh heterogeneous ethnic groups and then if it's a simplified ethnic map what you\r\n13:25\r\nrealize is that the Han occupy all the prime real estate in the curious might ask uh how did that happen and the\r\n13:32\r\nanswer would be they laid waste to the competing zunar and Mongol Empires but you haven't heard about the zunar the uh\r\n13:38\r\nH Ching Dynasty wiped out them out year uh hundreds of years ago and this is how\r\n13:44\r\nContinental Empires run business uh either you get with the program or they will kill you right it's a binary choice\r\n13:51\r\neither you become Han honorary Han or that's it and in our own day I believe\r\n13:57\r\nthe Wagers are slated for Gen side this is not a world for the faint-hearted all right now for a sanitized version of\r\n14:03\r\nChinese history the Hans started out up there uh in on the Yellow River Valley\r\n14:09\r\nand then they spread and they spread and they spread bu some walls too and spread and did all this CRA stuff and they're coming and going and going and coming\r\n14:15\r\nand then there's a lot of uh consolidation before this happens to them this is the UN Dynasty it looks\r\n14:21\r\nlike just bigger version of what I've been showing you except there's a major discontinuity these Yan Dynasty they're\r\n14:26\r\nMongols this is the largest Empire in Chinese history and when the hunter is subjugated to people and this uh grossly\r\n14:32\r\nunderstates the issue the Mongol uh Empire went all the way west to uh\r\n14:38\r\nHungary and they're expanding over the Eurasian plane but the Han reassert themselves\r\n14:44\r\nunder the Ming the the Mongols only last for a century and but then the Ming succumbed to the second largest Empire\r\n14:51\r\nin Chinese history this is the Ching they aren't Han either they're manew and\r\n14:56\r\nso what's quite ironic today when the Chinese government starts claiming what its historic lands are they go back to\r\n15:03\r\nthe Mongol Yen Dynasty or the Manu Ching Dynasty when quite ironically the Han were subjugated people but the reason\r\n15:09\r\nfor all the maps wasn't to make that snide remark but rather it was to show\r\n15:14\r\nyou all lots and lots of shrinkage lots and lots of expansion and lots and lots of Bloodshed while this is taking place\r\n15:21\r\nthe Chinese have been raising an army and arming armies denominated in hundreds of thousands of people for\r\n15:28\r\nthousands of years the West does not do this certainly not on a regular basis until the Napoleonic Wars so uh it's\r\n15:35\r\nquite a world this Continental world and just to let you know how Russia did it the Russians uh their expansion from the\r\n15:40\r\ngrand duche or whatever it was of musy is like Mongols in the war in Reverse they're going from west to east across\r\n15:47\r\nthe Eurasian plane all right if you look at Russia's no kidding enemies circa\r\n15:53\r\n1900 there are lots of them because although in this world of Empire\r\n15:59\r\nleveraging internal lines of communication it comes with a corresponding disadvantage of multiple\r\n16:04\r\nneighbors and so these are Russia's no kidding security threats it's very different from the security world of\r\n16:10\r\nBritain with its 360 degree you can't get me wot lots of people have come to get Russians over the years the swedes\r\n16:18\r\nthe Mongols the French the Germans and most recently the Cold War the west but\r\n16:23\r\neach time the central position allowed them to rise again and here uh in this\r\n16:28\r\nsort of uh world power is a function of land neighbors are dangerous even the itty\r\n16:33\r\nbitty ones can cause problems because the instability can spread over the border and the big ones if they've got\r\n16:38\r\nan attitude are dangerous because they may come get you so the purpose for an Army in this world is not the maritime\r\n16:45\r\npower army which is expeditionary Warfare the expedition mean you cross the ocean to go somewhere else uh-uh in\r\n16:51\r\nthis world the Army's number one mission is to keep the ruling regime in power so\r\n16:57\r\nif you think people's Liberation Army you think it's it's the petorian guard of the Chinese Communist Party the\r\n17:03\r\nsecond most important thing for your army is to prevent any uh defections from the Empire and then only third is\r\n17:09\r\nat border defense so in this world away games are rare most of the fighting is on home territory and the winter takes\r\n17:16\r\nand keeps the field now this is going to give you some of the mathematics of all this of the cost of the home front main\r\n17:24\r\nfront so these are deaths in World War II lot of axis uh deaths military deaths\r\n17:30\r\nand then a lot of uh Allied landow deaths High numbers but when you compare\r\n17:36\r\nBritain and France the uh Britain and the United States the two Maritime Powers with France and Italy by some\r\n17:42\r\nstatistics uh they suffer less and France France wasn't even the in the war\r\n17:47\r\nthat long and then if you add in civilian deaths the difference between the maritime deaths and the Continental\r\n17:53\r\ndeaths just Skyrocket and why is this because in the Continental World a a lot of the\r\n17:59\r\nfighting happens on home territory particularly if you lose so you have your citizens have no Sanctuary from\r\n18:05\r\nthis and there are a lot of deaths associated with it uh no uh no country\r\n18:11\r\nin their right mind wants to fight on the home front main front it's just so costly Continental Powers just don't\r\n18:17\r\nhave a choice Maritime Powers it's a great point of strategy of weather and if you do when you're going to get\r\n18:23\r\ninvolved but there are certain advantages if you win on the main front home front cuz for instance stal he wins\r\n18:29\r\nWorld War II wherever his Red Army is uh he keep he keeps uh Eastern Europe but\r\n18:34\r\nit comes at the cost of millions and millions of Soviet deaths to do this and there are certain rules to play and win\r\n18:40\r\nin this this particular uh setup rule number one neighbors are numerous so no\r\n18:46\r\ntwoof front Wars if multiple neighbors try to come get you you're in trouble secondly no great power neighbors why\r\n18:54\r\nbecause today's friend can be tomorrow's fo and that will spell trouble so what do you do you take on your neighbors\r\n19:00\r\nsequentially you set them to fail up to fail you destabilize the rising ingest the failing set up buffer zone in\r\n19:07\r\nbetween and you wait the opportune moment to pounce and absorb that is Vladimir Putin's game um better yet you\r\n19:14\r\nget the neighbors to do the work for you you seow their Mutual resentments by deluging them with fake news and\r\n19:20\r\nanything else you can think of so that Russia can act to play the role of a jackal state to steal the Kill made by\r\n19:26\r\nothers well if this is your security Paradigm uh you're going to surround yourself with failing States look at\r\n19:32\r\nRussia and China they have some of those dysfunctional places on the planet on their borders are they unlucky or are they complicit uh also there are no\r\n19:40\r\nenduring alliances because people figure it out eventually the hegemonic power only offers trouble in the long run uh\r\n19:46\r\nand there's also a tendency for overextension like there's no counsel how much is enough uh territories enough\r\n19:52\r\nbefore you choke on it but before you dismiss this security Paradigm\r\n19:57\r\nunderstand this is how the civilizations of great civilizations of Eur Asia ran business they didn't care about collateral damage killing a bunch of\r\n20:04\r\nextra people uh this Paradigm is all about wrecking things killing people to get territory and you've seen it\r\n20:10\r\noperating in real time in Syria and in uh Ukraine all right here's the problem\r\n20:16\r\nfor the likes of Vladimir Putin in this world if you botch strategy your Known\r\n20:22\r\nWorld can just just vanish forever and this is what happened to Imperial Russia Imperial China and many of these great\r\n20:28\r\ncivil Iz ation of Eurasia and I love this picture of a aristocrat's ruined uh\r\n20:35\r\nPalace or whatever it is uh in Russia because those whole social classes were\r\n20:41\r\nwiped off the face of the map by the bul X for messing with their strategy so the\r\n20:47\r\nContinental world is a world without insurance policies here's the maritime world it's different I love this picture\r\n20:52\r\nI don't know how accurate it is but it shows um all of the the Commerce that's\r\n20:58\r\ngoing on in in the 19th century and shows the Atlantic a very busy place the center of the world economy and all of\r\n21:04\r\nthese these uh sea lines of communication are connecting trade from all the coastlines they're traversing\r\n21:09\r\nthe ocean which is a Commons a shared space think about it in our own highly networked age uh the seas are the\r\n21:18\r\nworld's original Network potentially connecting everyone with everything and this Maritime world begins or it goes\r\n21:26\r\nback further but certainly is it's up in starting with the ancient Greeks who had\r\n21:31\r\nthis rimland Empire along the aian and ionian seas where they're making a lot of money from trade Roman Empire similar\r\n21:39\r\nidea a rimin Empire very different from the Consolidated empires of Russia and\r\n21:44\r\nChina look at the terminology Mediterranean met middle terranean lands it's the sea among the lands whereas the\r\n21:50\r\nname for China is Jung Gua Jung Central Gua Kingdom the kingdom among the kingdoms one uh piece of vocabulary\r\n21:57\r\nemphasizes the centrality the sea the other the centrality of the land now the Silk Road connected these two worlds\r\n22:05\r\neast and west and there has been much money to be made on East West trade for a very long time and whoever controlled\r\n22:11\r\nthe Western Terminus there a big toll booth made a lot of money for a while the Muslim Conquest settled that problem\r\n22:18\r\nbut then uh for a while no one controlled the rims and this is when the Crusades take place which is in part of\r\n22:24\r\nwho's going to control the toll booth uh for a long time the Ottomans settled that that problem they controlled it and\r\n22:30\r\ntherefore the Spanish and the Portuguese got creative they decided to get to Asia the long way around except they bumped\r\n22:37\r\ninto the new world new to them not so much to other people bumped into gold and silver and decided forget about the\r\n22:42\r\nhigh-end dinner where they're going to do heavy metal instead so uh the Dutch are the real people who focus on an\r\n22:50\r\nEmpire that's all about trade and their trading bases their problem was their exposed position in Europe so that they\r\n22:57\r\ncould be defeated in Europe so the real P pioneers of Maritime Empire the British so whereas every other country\r\n23:04\r\nin Europe had to maintain a large potentially cou generating standing army\r\n23:09\r\nthat's expensive and that also is probably going to want to have economic policies privileged the Army Britain uh\r\n23:17\r\ncould take its disadvantage its dependence on trade and transform it into an advantage that if they could\r\n23:23\r\nmake lots and lots of money on trade that would fund a Navy if anyone tries to invade you drowned at Sea so you've\r\n23:30\r\ngot homeline defense and meanwhile while your adversaries are busy destroying wealth at a really rapid clip Britain is\r\n23:37\r\ngoing to maximize its money so this is a prevent defeat strategy no one's going to invade Britain if they keep a good\r\n23:42\r\nNavy but it doesn't deliver Victory against Continental problems that a Navy won't do that for you uh here's the guy\r\n23:49\r\nin the horse uh who's uh with the attitude who got the British thinking\r\n23:54\r\nreally deeply about Grand strategy in fact the British Co Co Britain's coin the term a grand strategy is Grand in\r\n24:02\r\nthe multiplicity of instruments of National Power that are integrated because uh if Britain's going to align a\r\n24:08\r\nNavy navies are rarely can Del deliver uh victory in a war uh usually you need\r\n24:15\r\nother things to go on as well so they're going to be thinking Grand strategy and so after much trial and much error six\r\n24:22\r\ncoalition's final Capstone Alliance they deal with Napoleon and here is their grand strategy for elant hunting that\r\n24:29\r\nthey actually use to great effect in World War II as well first of all keep the home economy growing that's where\r\n24:36\r\nyour money is that's going to fund your military it's going to fund your allies uh that's key second don't let the elep\r\n24:43\r\nthe enemy elephant forage you want to shut them right down and force them back for resources on their own dwindling\r\n24:51\r\nresources and they're increasingly embittered allies and then you want to rent an elephant you want to find the Continental power most directly\r\n24:57\r\nthreatened by your Continental problem and you want to arm and fund that that\r\n25:04\r\ncountry that is fighting on the main front and then Britain needs to find a theater peripheral to that Main theater\r\n25:10\r\nthat favors Maritime access and if it can find a good theater to do that it is going to have cumulative effects on the\r\n25:17\r\nenemy more people getting killed in the enemy uh secondly U you're going to force the enemy to fight on divided\r\n25:23\r\nattentions because there are a couple theaters going on here and you're going to relieve pressure on the main front you hope and um Britain if it chooses\r\n25:31\r\nthe right theater its casualties will be far lower than the continental problem it's dealing with rule number five is\r\n25:37\r\ndon't take on the U certainly not as your opening move don't go toe-to-toe with your Continental problem because\r\n25:43\r\nBritain's great strength is not its Army the great strength of a continental power is its Army Britain needs to\r\n25:49\r\nleverage its ability to generate M money and help other people and leverage those things and if Britain is going to get\r\n25:55\r\ninvolved on the main front only do it after you really bled that elephant and you come in with lots of friends always\r\n26:02\r\ngang up on others if you can in this world as much as a continental power might want to do this can't why because\r\n26:07\r\nit probably has very constrained Maritime access can't deploy a Navy easily and secondly has a surfit of\r\n26:14\r\nneighbors who might cause problems but if Britain plays this games it can put itself and its enemies on opposing trend\r\n26:20\r\nline so Britain is going to get wealthier and wealthier and wealthier if it can trade and meanwhile this war is\r\n26:27\r\nencroaching on your enemy so it's going to uh undermine it's going to croach on enemy territory undermine the economy\r\n26:33\r\nmorale productivity Etc So eventually what the story is they're going to get\r\n26:38\r\nexhausted first it's a strategy of exhaustion and uh it focuses not only on\r\n26:44\r\nmilitary power but also economics coalitions institution buildings and there's certain prerequisites one is\r\n26:50\r\nsanctuary at home no one can touch your productive base for this really to work well you need access access to markets\r\n26:57\r\naccess to allies access to peripheral theaters and you need institutional stability at home to run a long-term\r\n27:04\r\nforeign policy these are some of the things that Mahan would later emphasize all right this brings me to the second\r\n27:09\r\ndistinguishing characteristic between maritime and Continental powers conell\r\n27:15\r\npowers uh face contiguous threats so they got to pay attention to them focus on National Security and as a result\r\n27:22\r\nthey tend to want to have be insulated with from their neighbors and have exclusion zones that they tend to also\r\n27:29\r\nwant to apply to the Seas exclude people from near Seas Maritime Powers because of their comparative security of aot are\r\n27:36\r\nall about trying to make money by doing international trade and so they' want\r\n27:42\r\naccess to International markets and therefore they want the Seas to be a Commons that everyone can share so the\r\n27:48\r\nsecond distinguishing character characteristic is a focus on installation from landord uh neighbors\r\n27:54\r\nversus access to markets and therefore a desire for closed Open Seas uh we're starting to get to two very different\r\n28:01\r\nworld orders here all right that's it for Empires the in the industrial\r\n28:06\r\nrevolution upended both types of Empires because it introduces economic growth\r\n28:11\r\nwhose compounding effects were truly revolutionary uh the Industrial Revolution starts in uh Britain and\r\n28:19\r\nafter the Napoleonic War Wars settle down it moves the continent it's been making its disruptive path around the\r\n28:25\r\nworld ever since and you can see it's based on a combination of institution and technological factors what it does\r\n28:31\r\nis it changes the currency of international power formerly power was a function of land right that's where you\r\n28:38\r\nget your Commodities that you can buy and sell that's where you get your peasant conscripts to man uh Mass armies\r\n28:45\r\nwell once you have compounding growth the source of of uh Power in this world's money that's going to come from\r\n28:51\r\ntrade industry and commerce and it is the most disruptive effect for traditional Society is the globe over\r\n28:59\r\nsuddenly their security paradigms don't work anymore I mean look at who's rich and who's poor in the world today it's\r\n29:04\r\ndegrees of industrialization uh going on and uh\r\n29:10\r\never since uh the Industrial Revolution there's been a gradual expansion with\r\n29:15\r\nups and downs of this Maritime trading order which is all about negotiating\r\n29:21\r\nrule often quite acrimoniously but negotiating rules for trade but it's a catastrophic uh event for traditional\r\n29:28\r\nsocieties many of which have never gotten over it the Chinese never like the incoming Maritime order in the 19th\r\n29:33\r\ncentury and they aren't happy about it now this guy Malcolm mlan really sets things moving on the mar expansion of\r\n29:40\r\nthe maritime order he ran a trucking company and he took his trucks minus the chassis and put them on ships what we\r\n29:46\r\ncall uh containers and this radically reduced shipping times loading times so\r\n29:52\r\nit becomes so much cheaper to send things by sea than by land and then\r\n29:57\r\nthese container size are standardized to go one if by truck two if by rail car and thousands if by SE so I guess we got\r\n30:04\r\nthe last dictator or the latest dictator for Life XI Jin ping who thinks he's got this 2 two train event with the Belt\r\n30:10\r\nRoad initiative that somehow this is the great way to get Goods around the world okay here's my argument why his math is\r\n30:17\r\nflawed in 1960 the average tanker size was 20,000 dead white tons in our own\r\n30:23\r\nday the smallest ultra-large crew tanker is a quar of a million dead white tons\r\n30:28\r\nthis means uh well the largest container ships now and I probably should update the stats it's probably even larger is\r\n30:34\r\nabout 21,000 containers over a billion dollars in cargo one ship whereas you're going\r\n30:41\r\nto do a train 600 containers give me a break on what's going to cost money also for the Belt Road thing to work it's got\r\n30:48\r\nto be continuous from end to end and it would be nice if we're all the same track gauge otherwise you're loading\r\n30:54\r\nunloading and it would be really nice if the track were continuous well it's not\r\n30:59\r\nalso in peace time uh the things will move but in\r\n31:05\r\nWartime uh Xi Jinping is going to even have trouble with the maritime part of\r\n31:11\r\nhis belt Road initiative because China is surrounded by narrow uh cluttered\r\n31:17\r\nIsland cluttered Seas with lots of neighbors who may or may not like them in more time those seas are closed to\r\n31:22\r\ncommercial traffic you can't get it through and you even have trouble getting warships through so whereas the\r\n31:27\r\nWest that's going through the high seas you can if you provided you Convoy things you can get stuff through so his\r\n31:33\r\nbelt Road thing has problems anyway if you look at the inter Cold War period or\r\n31:38\r\neven uh at the end of World War II you look at the skyrocketing international trade that uh lifts hundreds of millions\r\n31:45\r\nof people out of poverty and in the inner Cold War period um from the the 90s upwards look at it it just goes up\r\n31:52\r\nup and away and this is the miracle of our times but I'm sad to tell you it's over the inner Cold War period over uh\r\n31:59\r\neverybody the uh there's going to be this funding and counter funding of insurgencies the globe over which is\r\n32:06\r\ngoing to be incredibly wealth reducing all right so this Transportation Revolution that just makes it so much\r\n32:13\r\ncheaper to ship things by ship uh is going to lead me into my third uh uh\r\n32:20\r\ndistinguishing characteristic between maritime and Continental Powers Continental powers in the past did quite\r\n32:26\r\nwell with their interior lines of communication right it's to Garrison their empire to De deploy their armies\r\n32:32\r\nagainst people causing them problems and also it allowed them to form alliances with contiguous places uh whereas the\r\n32:40\r\nmaritime powers are using these exterior lines of communication that's what oceans are they're exterior lines of\r\n32:45\r\ncommunication but it's providing access to global markets access to wartime allies and guess what this one gives you\r\n32:52\r\nthe possibility of a Global Alliance System the other doesn't so this third\r\n32:58\r\ndesigning characteristic Reliance and interior versus exterior Alliance of communication and whether you can have a\r\n33:04\r\ncontiguous or Global Alliance System uh these two sets of preferences are two M mutually exclusive World orders uh the\r\n33:12\r\nIndustrial Revolution upended the world not only because of the cheaper Transportation but but because it\r\n33:19\r\noffered the possibility of a new positive some world order instead of wrecking all your neighbors which is\r\n33:26\r\nwhat the Continental uh Paradigm is right you're you're destabilizing neighbors you're invading\r\n33:32\r\nand you're just destroying things so great you get territory but it's just a wasteland whatever you get instead the\r\n33:39\r\nmaritime order is positive sum right the the Continental order is negative some\r\n33:44\r\nwhy because the loser's loss is less than the Winner's win because you're you're you're capturing damaged goods\r\n33:51\r\nbut in this world it's all about positive sum trade transactions where both parties win that's why you do trade\r\n33:58\r\nand in this world there's a focus for it to work on freedom of navigation free trade international laws and\r\n34:04\r\ninstitutions facilitating the trade to minimize the transaction costs and the\r\n34:10\r\ninsurance system for all of this are alliances so that countries that aren't\r\n34:15\r\nMaritime by geography if they join up with enough other people uh they can all\r\n34:20\r\ncome out in force with various instruments of National Power to deal with uh the Continental problems that\r\n34:27\r\nthat uh that are going on and here is the the the insurance system for all of this created by the greatest Generation\r\n34:34\r\nthe World War I generation not the World War II who claimed it a World War I generation who were conscripts when they\r\n34:40\r\nwere young trying to raise families that gr the great during the Great Depression and then their the Strategic Leaders of\r\n34:47\r\nWorld War II uh they decided that and they'd send their kids to fight World War II uh they decided that the solution\r\n34:54\r\nto World War and great depressions was institution building on a global scale and they're the ones who really rapidly\r\n35:00\r\nbuild uh they get the the UN going the IMF NATO you're going to get the\r\n35:06\r\npredecessor institutions of the uh EU and World Trade Organization to hold the\r\n35:11\r\npeace institutionally and it did in the industrialized World until Vlad the bad\r\n35:16\r\nuh worked his magic and Ukraine decided to overturn the chess table um all right\r\n35:23\r\nthe maritime world is invisible and here why it took me\r\n35:28\r\nworking here 15 years for to Dawn to me what was going on it's it has to do with the difference between NE negative and\r\n35:34\r\npositive objectives the conell world is all about positive objectives you're taking land and when you take it or even\r\n35:40\r\nwhen you're trying to take it you're wrecking things so people can see what's going on the maritime World particularly\r\n35:45\r\nif you're successful it's about negative objectives you're um preventing stuff from happening so in this Continental\r\n35:53\r\nworld uh operationally you can have all these winds but actually you're destroying wealth at the Strategic level\r\n35:59\r\nat a rapid clip whereas in the maritime world so what are you preventing particularly for the Navy the Navy\r\n36:07\r\nfocuses mostly on negative objectives in peace time uh not always but mostly and\r\n36:12\r\npeace time by the way is is most of the time or it has been of late uh the Merit\r\n36:17\r\nthe Navy is preventing the destruction of the global trading system that would be an important Mission uh preventing\r\n36:23\r\nlimits on freedom of navigation if you can't get Goods Port to Port pretty useless so that would be important also\r\n36:31\r\nuh navies are about uh deterring people from trying to take other people's territory sovereignty being the Bedrock\r\n36:37\r\nprinciple of international law these are incredibly uh important uh objectives but on a good day Navy day absolutely\r\n36:45\r\nnothing happens looks like the Navy is doing nothing but it's incredibly important and so Maritime Powers uh the\r\n36:52\r\nway they hold it together with alliances diplomacy sanctions embargos Containment all kinds of uh things going on the\r\n37:00\r\nNavy's deterrence blockades Commerce rating and you can look at um the sanctions and things and go well the\r\n37:06\r\nrogue's still there true um but if you shave one or two% of growth off your\r\n37:12\r\nRogue uh wait a few generations and it's the difference between North and South Korea so you're make you're shrinking\r\n37:19\r\nthe the opposing piggy bank and you go well I'd like to solve the whole problem well great if the whole problem has\r\n37:25\r\nnuclear weapons the solution may be Armageddon and this world is not about operational wins it's about the\r\n37:31\r\nStrategic win of making of maximizing wealth for you and your allies all right\r\n37:37\r\nuh they were optimists at the end of the Cold War who thought that surely this Maritime Continental thing was over and\r\n37:43\r\nthat everyone would go for uh liberal democracy not so here we got Mr fit and Miss fit Vladimir Putin and Kim jung-un\r\n37:51\r\nwho want to hollow out our alliance systems they want to undermine international law they want to rec\r\n37:57\r\nInternational institutions to subject all of us to the kind of squalor their own citizens have to endure all right to\r\n38:03\r\nsummarize this half um there are three characteristics that distinguish\r\n38:08\r\ncontinental and Maritime Powers the inability ability to defend primarily at C focus on insallation from versus\r\n38:15\r\naccess to the world Reliance on interior versus exterior lines of communication and from these accidents of geography\r\n38:22\r\ncome some preferences a continental preference looking at territory thinking about taking it Maritime looking at\r\n38:28\r\nthink ah it's markets Continental thought about prioritizing self-sufficiency whereas Maritime is\r\n38:35\r\ninterest power interested in Access uh Continental power exclusive zones Maritime power uh about Commons not only\r\n38:42\r\nMaritime Commons but air cyber uh space Commons uh and obviously a lot of\r\n38:49\r\ncountries aren't strictly one or the other so there's a Cary to all of this\r\n38:55\r\nuh you can gain a maritime position by the countries you support and the the uh\r\n39:01\r\ninstit International institutions that you support so that collectively the whole thing can operate on a maritime\r\n39:08\r\nsecurity Paradigm and the choice is quite cons uh uh consequential because those who choose a\r\n39:15\r\ncontinental Paradigm these days typically are deep dictators who wind up hemorrhaging their cash either to\r\n39:23\r\ndominate their own systems uh their own citizens or their neighbors um if you think about China China uh by rejoining\r\n39:31\r\nthe maritime system under dung sha ping it was amazing uh transforming a very uh\r\n39:37\r\npoor country to a far richer country but these older Continental predilections\r\n39:43\r\nstill exist and uh they seem to be taking a uturn on this road uh sadly the\r\n39:50\r\nContinental world it's negative sum the only uh positive sum that human beings\r\n39:55\r\nhave come up with is this Mariton order for all of its flaws at least there institutions where you can go to\r\n40:01\r\nand send your lawyers and diplomats and argue things out that way the alternative is potentially terminal for\r\n40:08\r\nman mankind if you get into a big uh War okay that's first half second half uh\r\n40:15\r\nCold War there was one that turned out quite well is there anything we can glean from this how did it turn out the\r\n40:21\r\nway it did a lot of people uh Drive comfort and they say ronal Reagan won the Cold War that's one way of looking\r\n40:27\r\nat it I'm going to have a lot of arguments and counterarguments because there many explanations but this one's a good one to start with um those who\r\n40:35\r\nsupported although this picture seems remarkably cordial at the uh Reagan Ranch after it's all over and the\r\n40:41\r\ngorbachov seemed purply happy but um what Ronald Reagan did a big military\r\n40:46\r\nbuildup and the Russians at the end of the Cold War some have estimated that as much as 70% of their economy was devoted\r\n40:53\r\nto the military and it was absolutely suffocating and if you think about the Germans the Nazis in Hot War they only\r\n40:59\r\nspent 55% of their economy on this stuff and so it was a problem for the Soviets I'm going be quoting a lot of Russians\r\n41:05\r\ntoday because they thought deeply about what happened to their country uh how they lost the Soviet Union the Empire\r\n41:12\r\nand indeed the world as they knew it here is Valentine Fallon he was a long time serving uh Soviet ambassador to\r\n41:18\r\nGermany and he said look the American strategy of our exhaustion in the arms wraith it just wrecked our quality of\r\n41:24\r\nlife and also Russia had R not only with the United States but also problems with\r\n41:30\r\nChina so the arms race plunged the Soviet economy into a permanent crisis and here's GGI arbatov who was the\r\n41:36\r\nSoviet Prime expert on the United States who's watching Reagan funding\r\n41:42\r\nanti-communist uh caner insurgencies all over the world this is how you destroy wealth by having both sides funding\r\n41:49\r\ninsurgencies and uh in Afghanistan he go yeah we got our Vietnam uh problem for\r\n41:55\r\nus so some would argue that us victory in the arms race that determined the victory in the Cold War okay I'm going\r\n42:01\r\ngo through other presidents and because there are other arguments starting with Ford Carter and the Helsinki Accords uh\r\n42:06\r\nfor the longest time after World War II the Soviets really wanted to hold a european-wide\r\n42:12\r\nconference for everyone to agree on their expanded World War II borders and for the longest time the Europeans\r\n42:18\r\nweren't interested but then by the 70s they're sick of all the drama the United States isn't interested but we show up\r\n42:24\r\nand then we say we're going to have some human rights Clauses in here which we know they aren't going to respect and lo\r\n42:29\r\nand behold this is the third basket of the human rights Clauses of the Helsinki Accords lo and behold human rights\r\n42:37\r\nactivists in the west and dissidents throughout the Warsaw Pact started trying to hold the Soviet C government\r\n42:43\r\naccountable saying okay where is The Liberation that communism has promised\r\n42:49\r\nuh why are we dealing with this uh dictatorship that's been delivered and by the way you signed all of these\r\n42:54\r\nthings and this dissident movement human rights movement took on a life of its own and here's Jimmy Carter who then ran\r\n43:01\r\nwith it uh and he's giving a commencement address at Notre Dame he said look we have Refirm reaffirmed\r\n43:07\r\nAmerica's commitment to human rights as a fundamental tenant of our foreign policy what draws us together is a\r\n43:13\r\nbelief in human Freedom we want the world to know that our nation stands for more than just financial prosperity\r\n43:20\r\nwe're bigger than that uh Carter was emphasizing precisely the political freedoms that were being denied\r\n43:26\r\nthroughout the Easter e block and here is Alle G gki A longtime Soviet career\r\n43:33\r\nDiplomat saying look the Communist ideology is associated above all with the Soviet Union and when you reject it\r\n43:39\r\na vacuum a real problem so that some would argue that human rights causes of the Helsinki Accords and Carter's\r\n43:46\r\nsubsequent Human Rights Campaign uh destroyed communist belief in communism and that's why it all ended um okay\r\n43:55\r\nanother president another explanation others say nonsense it's Richard Nixon and the China card and uh others would\r\n44:02\r\nsay no it's Ma and the America card but whatever it turns out that in 1969\r\n44:08\r\nRussia and China were going at it in a border war and over some islands in the\r\n44:13\r\nAmore River and the Russians approached the United States and said would it be okay if we nuke these people and the\r\n44:21\r\nUnited States said no way okay and Mal figured it out the one that wants to\r\n44:26\r\nNuke you is is the primary adversary and this reshuffles the uh the\r\n44:33\r\ngreat Powers P prior to this China um the United States have been the primary\r\n44:39\r\nadversary of China and Russia after this is over China and Russia are each\r\n44:44\r\nother's primary adversaries and the United States decides since it's the Swing Vote let's go gang up with China\r\n44:50\r\nagainst Russia and this forces Russia into a bankrupting militarization of its\r\n44:56\r\nlaw Frontier with China it's already militarized its European Frontier but now it's got to put these mechanized\r\n45:02\r\nnuclear Armed Forces there imagine if the United States had to do this on our long Canadian and Mexican borders it\r\n45:08\r\nwould be bankrupting and our economy is of much larger than the Russian economy\r\n45:13\r\nso great uh the slides have just disappeared do we have anyone working on\r\n45:20\r\nfixing the ah so thank you very much I don't know what I did I work Magic on these things anyway\r\n45:27\r\nthe appliances I wreck them all right the US Coop someone argue that the US cooperation with China so fatally over\r\n45:34\r\nextended the Soviet Union but another way is to put together all of these presidents to say each one o oper open\r\n45:42\r\nopportunities for successors so Nixon plays the China card which then Ford\r\n45:47\r\nkeeps using and then starts playing the human rights card Carter runs with that begins a military uh buildup that Reagan\r\n45:55\r\nreally runs with and this puts Reagan and Bush later uh operating from a\r\n46:01\r\nposition of military and ideological strength so uh also for those who think\r\n46:07\r\nthat US foreign policy wasn't consistent during the Cold War war you have it wrong the policy objective was\r\n46:13\r\nrelentless free trade democracy containment of Communism the two political parties Republicans and Democrats agreed on this they had\r\n46:19\r\ndifferent strategies how to achieve it but they agreed on that all right so someone would argue that President Nixon\r\n46:25\r\nthrough Reagan produced the cumulative presidential effects to defeat the Soviet Union others would say forget\r\n46:31\r\nthis great man uh theory of History business it's this platform the nuclear\r\n46:37\r\npowered nuclear arms submarine that determined the outcome of the of the Cold War because under Carter and then\r\n46:42\r\ncertainly under Reagan there was a much more aggressive strategy of targeting uh\r\n46:48\r\nSoviet nuclear subs in their homeat bastions and the Soviets were scared to death that they didn't have a reliable\r\n46:55\r\nsecond strike capability and so here you have our Marshall acev who is in the\r\n47:01\r\nUnited States telling his host uh we're surrounded uh that's why we're concerned\r\n47:07\r\nwe know that you know where our subs are and we don't know where yours are you you the United States Navy they the problem we go Navy uh so the USSR could\r\n47:16\r\nnot counter technologically or financially the US submarine threat and to its ralit nuclear forces so some\r\n47:23\r\nwould argue this is why they had to settle in the Cold War all right so uh I all the preceding explanations\r\n47:32\r\nI've been giving you are naval explanations spell with an e as in staring at one's own they're all about\r\n47:38\r\nwhat team America did or didn't do so let's get to the other side of the tennis court net to see what team Russia\r\n47:44\r\nwas up to and here's Arnold Toby he was one of the finest historians of the 20th\r\n47:50\r\ncentury observing that civilizations die from suicide not by murder so I've been talking about the murder right why other\r\n47:57\r\ncountries did to the Soviet Union now I'm going to get to the suicide the self-defeating things that the Soviets\r\n48:02\r\ndid so explanation number one uh from looking at this the other side of the tennis court net is to say they lost the\r\n48:10\r\nSoviet the Empire the Cold War because their Empire collapsed that domino\r\n48:15\r\ntheory idea that was supposed to apply to capitalism actually it applied to communism because once the Democratic\r\n48:22\r\ncontagion hit one warsa pack country and demonstrations for Freedom started\r\n48:28\r\nuh incre incre coming with increasing frequency they P they spread to the\r\n48:34\r\nother wara pack countries and the leaders of these countries no longer had the stomach for the kind of violence it\r\n48:40\r\nwould take to get the demonstrators off the street so gorbachov's ideas of glus\r\n48:46\r\nuh openness and pistor rebuilding they resonated throughout Russia and Eastern Europe Russians hit\r\n48:53\r\nthe streets demonstrating for political freedoms and in e Eastern Europe they hit the streets demonstrating for freedom from the Soviet Union and the\r\n49:00\r\nSoviets may not have gotten that distinction but uh gorbachov was all about encouraging people to reform and\r\n49:06\r\nso he didn't send tanks into the Eastern block he said you need to do political and economic reforms the way we are and\r\n49:12\r\nthese reforms started in Poland uh Poland had quite a history that goes back with it uh has been\r\n49:19\r\nsuffering severe unrest periodically 58 on and off and then a big time in 1988 1\r\n49:27\r\nthis is when solidarity the workers movement be gains a national and an international reputation it is the only\r\n49:35\r\nindependent uh opposition movement of any warsa uh packed country and then in\r\n49:40\r\n1988 it gets really bad because the economy is a mess the government needs to raise uh staple prices because the\r\n49:47\r\nbudgets broke and solidarity hits the streets and the government is afraid of the economy going to freef fall so they\r\n49:54\r\noffer solidarity a place at the bargaining table if they'll call off the strikes and a complicating factor in\r\n50:00\r\nPoland is the Roman Catholic Church an institution of enormous legitimacy and\r\n50:07\r\nwhich had a partiality for solidarity okay so these talks started taking place\r\n50:12\r\nin February 1989 the Roundtable talks and here's Soviet advice the polls it's\r\n50:18\r\nyou got to find some quick Solutions you're an itty bitty country so if you make mistakes they'll be itty bitty mistakes if we make them they'll be big\r\n50:24\r\nthey got that one right the uh Communist party in Poland decides to hold\r\n50:29\r\nelections and they those elections were held on the very same day that dun sha\r\n50:35\r\nping calls out the tanks and the 10 and you have the 10 amend ma Massacre two very different solutions and the\r\n50:41\r\nCommunist Party thought in Poland that they had it under control why because uh\r\n50:47\r\nthey thought they had these party designated seats that would make sure they controlled everything so not so\r\n50:53\r\nmuch what happens is solidarity wins everything seat but one for which it could compete and in the party\r\n51:00\r\ndesignated seats the party only gets three and who gets all the rest of them the Box on the ballot called none of the\r\n51:07\r\nabove that's the end of Communist Party legitimacy in Poland and then further\r\n51:12\r\nDem Democratic reforms are on the way the demonstrations uh Cascade into East\r\n51:18\r\nGermany which in the past had always sent out tanks well would be tankman Eric huker was already out of a job\r\n51:25\r\nbecause his disaster uh strategy of living off debt since when he came in power I think it's 71 or\r\n51:30\r\nsomething had just wrecked the place so he had been forced out most of the PO bureaus resign by the time you get to\r\n51:36\r\nnov November 9th they if issue some new power uh travel rules why do we care about travel here's why we care about\r\n51:42\r\ntravel uh and what's left of the government this gter shabi is at a press conference and he's being asked well\r\n51:49\r\nwhat are the travel regulations going to be implemented and so instead of admitting he didn't know he winged it\r\n51:55\r\nand he said immediately well immediately huge crowds started\r\n52:01\r\nmassing at the six Gates uh of East Berlin and at one of them the Border\r\n52:06\r\nguards decided that discretion is the better part of valor they opened it and people just streamed into West Berlin\r\n52:13\r\nand within a week uh over half the country had visited West Berlin and it\r\n52:19\r\nwas a pivotal uh a choice a pivotal event and like the Polish elections uh\r\n52:25\r\nopening the the gate uh there's no going back to the way the world was it's over so Gunter missed\r\n52:32\r\nthat one all right and here is anatol koval's take on it he was longtime Deputy foreign minister of the Soviet un\r\n52:38\r\nlook and there was no confidence whatsoever uh the Soviets had no confidence whatsoever whom the East uh\r\n52:45\r\nGerman Army is going to shoot us or the demonstrators same thing for the Poes and the hungarians great with an\r\n52:51\r\nalliance system like this you got troubles so unrest in the Empire forc the Union to uh forfeit the Cold War all\r\n53:00\r\nright here's another way of looking at it another counterargument for him said no no no it's something different it has to do with the satellites themselves are\r\n53:06\r\nterribly unhealthy and that's the origin of the problem so if you look at this map circa 1960 all those tempting green\r\n53:12\r\nplaces they're about to become independent they're really SI sick of their colonial overlords enter Soviet\r\n53:17\r\nUnion with a plan plan to put them out of business and there were many takers\r\n53:23\r\nuh fast forward to 1980 is and you can see all the promising pink places where the Soviets have got all kinds of new\r\n53:29\r\nfriends well here's the problem in the late 70s commodity prices including oil\r\n53:34\r\ngo way down and these places depend on that the Soviet Union for some years as\r\n53:39\r\nmuch of its government budget as 55% was based on oil so not only did the\r\n53:44\r\nnon-performing pals have no money and need bigger subsidies but the Soviet Union was less in a position to\r\n53:50\r\nsubsidize them with its deep bench of these places and most problematically at\r\n53:55\r\nall Soviet I's own internal nationalities simultaneously erupt and\r\n54:01\r\nthey all want to secede remember the rule of uh Continental Empire no two-\r\n54:06\r\nfront Wars well the Soviets had so many fronts at this point they couldn't keep track of it so you can make an argument\r\n54:11\r\nthat by bankrupting itself in the third world ignoring its own internal third world that's why the Soviet Union lost\r\n54:18\r\nthe Cold War another argument economics you could say that the Soviet economy\r\n54:23\r\nlost Cold War and here are the statistics economy did quite well rebuilding after World War II but it\r\n54:29\r\nreally stagnates in the 70s and so in the pr decade preceding when gorbachov comes into Power uh the Soviet economy\r\n54:36\r\nhas been growing from 1 to 2% less per anom compared to the west and the compounding effects are really uh very\r\n54:43\r\nlarge and then uh here's what's going on\r\n54:49\r\nif you have a command economy you have Moscow Central telling everybody what resources they get what they're going to\r\n54:55\r\nproduce but when you're unit on the bottom what you have to do is you lie about what inventory you have you say\r\n55:01\r\nit's less than it is and then you lie about how many inputs you need you say it's more than you need because you have\r\n55:06\r\nno idea what you're actually going to get and everyone's lying to each other so the macroeconomic uh statistics are\r\n55:13\r\ngarbage so people are allocating capital and labor Without Really knowing what their True Values are no one has any\r\n55:19\r\nidea of uh consumer preferences or what productivity is so the misallocation is\r\n55:25\r\nhorrendous and no one figur figures out it out until it's catastrophic and so under gorbachov oil\r\n55:32\r\nprices have tanked this mess is is is starting to deliver troubles and uh\r\n55:37\r\neconomic growth goes negative it's a mess so here's Marshall Aram yazov looking at all this and go look and NATO\r\n55:44\r\nthey're they're just Rich we can't counter these people we've got to figure out some way of calling it off so the Soviet eony lost the Cold War uh here is\r\n55:53\r\na very famous man uh Alexis dville and a very famous quotation from him he wrote\r\n55:58\r\na very famous book about the last years of the monarchy uh before it fell in the\r\n56:05\r\nFrench Revolution and he has this Chestnut in there the most dangerous moment for bad government is when it\r\n56:10\r\nbegins to reform and people in Russia disagree about many things but they\r\n56:15\r\nagree at least on this one point that gorbachov's role was absolutely Central in what how it all turned out and\r\n56:22\r\ngorbachov made his decisions based on a number of uh incorrect assumptions first\r\n56:29\r\nuh that history was irreversible it's always forward towards communism and of\r\n56:35\r\ncourse Eastern Europe madebe U-turn back to capitalism and also here his U\r\n56:40\r\nforeign policy adviser Anon Chas uh gorbachov misread the sentiments of the\r\n56:45\r\nneighbors gorbachov thought that the E Eastern Europeans would look upon him as their Liberator rather than looking upon\r\n56:52\r\nRussia as their ins Surfer and here's CH of gord thought that bringing freedom to our Eastern European satellites that's\r\n56:59\r\nalready a bad word who wants to be a satellite would lead them to adopt socialism with a human face whatever\r\n57:05\r\nthat is uh he made an enormous mistake because these countries brutally turned their back on us uh it was totally\r\n57:11\r\nunexpected for us really you invade the neighbors you kill their leaders you\r\n57:17\r\nsiphon off their wealth you impose a non-performing economic model on them and then you never leave and you wonder\r\n57:24\r\nwhy these people don't like you give me a breath the United States intervenes in Civil Wars all over the world but we we\r\n57:29\r\nDeluge them with economic aid and we even leave people don't like us I don't know why the Russians think they're so special all right in addition gorbachov\r\n57:38\r\nbelieved if there was no Warsaw pack there would be no NATO that NATO would disappear and that if there were no\r\n57:43\r\nComiCon that's their internal trading or or group that then there would be no European Community or the EU today wrong\r\n57:51\r\ntwo of those things are still around he also thought that the United States like a continental power no great Powers\r\n57:58\r\ndon't want them and would oppose German unification so gorbachov goes on vacation while all the unrest is\r\n58:03\r\nhappening Germany poor life choice because what's actually going on is President Bush and Chancellor Cole of\r\n58:09\r\nGermany are coordinating on the fastest reunification of Germany ever so some\r\n58:15\r\nwould argue that it's gorbachov's sins of commission uh that cause all the problems that his foreign policy\r\n58:21\r\nmistakes are a function of his domestic policy mistakes and they together it kills the Soviet Union so\r\n58:26\r\nuh the big bozza was playing with plastic bags and he stuck one on his on his head so it was suicide by mistake\r\n58:32\r\nothers would argue no it's not about sins of commission it's about sins of\r\n58:38\r\nomission what the Army failed to do I mean just they would argue uh the Red Army should have done the dun sha ping\r\n58:45\r\nsolution send in the tanks and so just sort that sort out problems that way so they would argue that t timely tank\r\n58:52\r\ndeployment is TTD this is my contribution to military acronyms um would have changed the outcome of the\r\n58:57\r\nCold War all right others would say no no no it's not sins of omission still a\r\n59:02\r\nsins of commission but by this charmer Boris yelton who's gorbachov's successor what did buddies do he got rid of I\r\n59:09\r\nthink it's article six in the Soviet Constitution which had given the Communist Party the Monopoly of power now you're going to have multi-party\r\n59:16\r\ncompetitions and also he got together with the heads of belus and Ukraine and\r\n59:21\r\nsigned a formal document the Bel Accords that dissolves the Soviet Union so by this way of reasoning it's suicide on\r\n59:28\r\npurpose all right I can now end on give you a couple of umbrella explanations\r\n59:34\r\none of them is any of any of the above reasons I've just given you it's inevitable or all of the above it barely one here's how that goes let's start\r\n59:40\r\nwith uh any of the above uh there were so many problems with the Soviet Union\r\n59:48\r\nthat you could argue that its demise was inevitable uh it was just brutally\r\n59:53\r\ninefficient this is why the West didn't like it in the beginning it wasn't that any US president did anything it's the\r\n59:59\r\nRussians finally figured it out and they invented it and they wanted to get rid of it so uh the Soviet Union was\r\n1:00:05\r\ndestined to lose that's an optimistic way of looking at it here's a pessimistic way of looking at it it's\r\n1:00:10\r\nlike no no no the Cold War ended very much on Western terms because it required all of these factors the whole\r\n1:00:17\r\nlist that I gave you today and you remove any one of them and you get a different outcome and you might uh may\r\n1:00:23\r\nmaybe don't even end the Cold War and it took the whole the whole shebang so the West barely won the Cold War another\r\n1:00:30\r\nTwist on this one is say not only did it take the whole shebang but you need these two gentlemen to be in office at\r\n1:00:36\r\nthe same time uh George Bush uh quite a resume he'd had stints in Congress a\r\n1:00:42\r\nrepresentative China representative of the UN and then of course he'd been vice president under Reagan for 8 eight years\r\n1:00:47\r\nso he's very well qualified and helmet Cole was the longest serving Chancellor of of West Germany since his uh\r\n1:00:54\r\nillustrious predecessor bismar and they worked on fast-tracking this as soon as\r\n1:00:59\r\nk m Cole came into Power he decided to um to unify with uh East Germany by one\r\n1:01:07\r\ntourist at a time how's that work East Germans love to travel but they didn't like to return home and all of a sudden\r\n1:01:14\r\nEast Germany starts easing the travel restrictions in 1988 and you go why and the answer would be money helmet started\r\n1:01:20\r\npaying them big money to let more people out and he also gave the hungarians big money to let East Germans out out\r\n1:01:26\r\nthrough the Austrian border that way but then he and uh Bush do tag team\r\n1:01:31\r\ndiplomacy where they are doing it so fast and they're offering really big money to gorbachov that he can't react\r\n1:01:39\r\nand he's his the Soviet economy is imploding and they desperately need the cash so they get gorbachov to agree\r\n1:01:45\r\nfirst to German unification second to unification with West Germany and NATO and thirdly unification with both halves\r\n1:01:52\r\nin NATO and uh by paying big money but complicating Factor uh a month and a\r\n1:01:58\r\nhalf before the reunification treaty was signed you get sodam uh Hussein invading\r\n1:02:04\r\nIraq and Iraq was a major Soviet client State uh owed the Soviets between 10 and\r\n1:02:10\r\n13 billion do that's a lot of money for a broke creditor and but Bush finesses\r\n1:02:15\r\nthis problem he doesn't go too far into Iraq to upset the Soviets he also finesses these two this is um prime\r\n1:02:23\r\nminister Margaret thater of Britain and president of of France neither one of them wanted\r\n1:02:28\r\nto see a unified Germany why because it would Eclipse their own countries they were correct uh but so France midan uh\r\n1:02:37\r\neventually finds Solace by uh negotiating the MRI treaty that's going to create uh the European Union that's\r\n1:02:43\r\ngoing to bring in all the Eastern European countries and merge it with the European Community but Margaret Thatcher just plain lost out she wanted to retain\r\n1:02:51\r\nsome Soviet troops in uh Germany for the duration imagine dealing with Putin\r\n1:02:56\r\ntoday if they'd had their way they didn't uh okay that's it for the\r\n1:03:02\r\nunderlying geopolitics and for what was done the last time around now what do we do all\r\n1:03:09\r\nright in the first half what I talked about elephant hunting uh I talked about\r\n1:03:14\r\nhow the British ran their elephant hunting strategy which they did quite well when they applied it to World War II but there's a huge difference now\r\n1:03:21\r\nit's Precision Nuclear Strike none of us has an inv vulnerable home anymore and\r\n1:03:27\r\nso by all means keep the economy running and probably your friend's econom is\r\n1:03:32\r\nrunning and by all means close down enemy trade you probably don't want to do it with blockades and commerce rating\r\n1:03:39\r\nmuch better with sanctions sanctions is just I'm going to buy stuff or I'm not going to buy stuff I'm going to sell stuff or I'm not going to sell stuff you\r\n1:03:45\r\ncan do all of that and then on peripheral theaters of course you want to help out people who are baguer uh by\r\n1:03:52\r\nContinental problems but you're going to have to be cautious uh about how this is done uh the uh goal of maintaining\r\n1:03:59\r\nProsperity uh hasn't changed uh if you think about how it worked last time\r\n1:04:04\r\naround the West Japan South Korea all uh\r\n1:04:09\r\ntogether parried the nuclear threat no through a nuclear a nuclear bomb at anyone all maintained economic growth\r\n1:04:17\r\nand so as the maritime world is compounding economic growth the Communists are living in compounded\r\n1:04:23\r\nPoverty of their own making uh and so as Les you despair on all of\r\n1:04:29\r\nthis understand that people in the west during the Cold War not everybody but most people were living quite well\r\n1:04:34\r\ncertainly much better than compared to how the Communists were living so that uh there was Prosperity while all this\r\n1:04:41\r\nwas going on so you can keep doing these things uh I dare say the current cold\r\n1:04:46\r\nwar is going to be going on for Generations because uh you don't change how other people think they decide uh\r\n1:04:53\r\nchanging what they thought gorbachov and his Generations changed their minds of what they wanted to do dung sha ping and\r\n1:05:01\r\nhis generation changed their minds of what they wanted to do and it'll probably take the Russians and Chinese a\r\n1:05:06\r\nlong time to change um so if you look at uh the from the Cold War\r\n1:05:13\r\nsection uh I talked about all the reasons for why the the war was won or lost but you can extract what US\r\n1:05:19\r\nstrategy was uh an extensive military buildup with allies uh also a very broad\r\n1:05:25\r\nstrategic Communications campaign it wasn't just uh human rights at the end but from the very beginning it's getting accurate news to subject populations\r\n1:05:33\r\nRadio free Europe Radio uh uh Voice of America Etc and then a lot of\r\n1:05:39\r\nunbi Alliance building for friends and Alliance busting for enemies and what\r\n1:05:44\r\nyou want to do is amplify overextension of your enemy of all the stupid things they're doing in the case of the Soviet\r\n1:05:50\r\nUnion it was they're ere extended by it's not efficient to to occupy someone\r\n1:05:55\r\nelse's country and stay there forever and uh also the Russians were quite abusive and we leveraged that and of\r\n1:06:02\r\ncourse they had a non-performing economic model and so you want to amplify those errors uh also geography\r\n1:06:08\r\nwithout us lifting a finger naturally contains Russia and China H they're\r\n1:06:13\r\nsurrounded by narrow Seas it's just facts and the one up north there's not much going on up there it those narrow\r\n1:06:21\r\nseas in peace time it's great doesn't matter the traffic goes but if you're going to do a hot War the merchant\r\n1:06:27\r\ntraffic doesn't go and your Navy won't go if you're located uh on a really\r\n1:06:32\r\nnarrow sea and if you look at uh Putin and she and whoever else is bothering\r\n1:06:38\r\nyou lately it isn't a coherent Alliance System you've got basically a bunch of Eur Asian dictators sure they share the\r\n1:06:45\r\nUnited States as a shared secondary enemy but think who the primary enemies are Russia's primary enemy right now is\r\n1:06:52\r\nUkraine China's primary enemy I don't know is it Taiwan is in India or if they do some Belt Road something is it's\r\n1:06:58\r\nsomebody up there but it's not us uh Iran's primary enemy is Israel Pakistan's is India North Korea South\r\n1:07:05\r\nKorea none of this aligns for anyone to make meaningful sacrifices for the others whereas you compare the World War\r\n1:07:12\r\nII Alliance System uh there's an agreement Germany primary theater Germany primary enemy whereas the access\r\n1:07:18\r\ndifferent primary theaters different primary enemies and they disperse their resources accordingly um moreover in our\r\n1:07:26\r\nown day we got uh Vladimir Putin who's trying to reconstitute an empire in the age of\r\n1:07:31\r\nnationalism uh good luck with that one it that uh dominated peoples no longer\r\n1:07:37\r\nsit Supine and uh take it they resist and uh you could look at uh this Belt\r\n1:07:45\r\nRoad initiative as Vladimir Putin is taking his nuclear well not his nuclear but his Arsenal and dumping it into uh\r\n1:07:53\r\nUkraine it's leading him wide open open to CH Siberia to Chinese Ambitions and\r\n1:07:58\r\nChina is busy peeling away uh from the russan the zaris and the Soviet sphere\r\n1:08:05\r\nof influence in Central Asia that's what that Belt Road thing is it's it's uh quite threatening for Putin not so much\r\n1:08:11\r\nfor us so um also if you think in the last uh Cold War when the the Russians\r\n1:08:19\r\nkept it cold right uh they fought proxy wars other people do the fighting Vladimir Putin is doing uh the fighting\r\n1:08:26\r\nhimself and oh by the way in the last Cold War when the Russians were smart enough not to do the too much of the\r\n1:08:32\r\nfighting uh Russia was strong China was weak now those tables have turned and\r\n1:08:38\r\nyou go well why would that matter and not only does Siberia have loads of resources that China would like and oh\r\n1:08:44\r\nby the way uh if you look at uh what the territories that the the\r\n1:08:51\r\nRomanov Dynasty took from the Chinese it exceeds US territory east of the Mississippi and you think Chinese have\r\n1:08:57\r\nforgotten not so much uh Putin says boundary treaties don't matter right because it's ripped up to it it's with\r\n1:09:04\r\nuh Ukraine and his these historic things what matter well the Chinese can play that back at him because the key\r\n1:09:10\r\nresource right now that Siberia has is water North China has blown through its water table and Bal has 20% or more than\r\n1:09:18\r\nthat of the world's surface freshwater and the Chinese can uh you can pipe it down if you would like to so good luck\r\n1:09:25\r\nuh good old Vladimir Putin the question isn't when the Sino Russian\r\n1:09:31\r\nrelationship's going to break up but when and here's the the problem with misidentifying your primary adversary\r\n1:09:37\r\nand fighting a recreational War where you don't need to uh Nicholas II tried this he decided that Japan was his\r\n1:09:44\r\nprimary enemy and off he goes to the Russo Japanese war great buddy uh so\r\n1:09:49\r\ninstead of investing in Railways and Armament production to deal with Germany\r\n1:09:55\r\nwhich comes and destroys his dynasty 10 years later he's fighting Japanese well\r\n1:10:01\r\nPutin is doing his emptied out his Cold War arsenals uh on Ukraine and the\r\n1:10:06\r\nukrainians never were after Russian territory the Chinese might well be so\r\n1:10:12\r\nif we play our cards right the Russians and the Chinese will take care of each other but we're going to be on a long\r\n1:10:19\r\nwait while this occurs and uh it is better off to have more friends rather\r\n1:10:24\r\nthan fewer friends in this kind of world and the maritime order as uh flawed as it is uh is your\r\n1:10:33\r\nbest bet to work with uh allies and Friends through International institutions to coordinate against these\r\n1:10:40\r\ncrazy people all right well that summarizes what I had to say today and thank you for taking time late in the\r\n1:10:47\r\nday to listen to me talk talk talk but I'll happy to answer any questions you all might have\r\n1:10:59\r\n[Applause] okay we're going to pass out the pop quizzes and nobody gets home unless you\r\n1:11:05\r\nget an 80 so now no quiz but you have any questions got time for about one or\r\n1:11:11\r\ntwo questions and I'll hang around afterwards and talk to anybody who wants to Sir\r\n1:11:18\r\nSir Matt Young Army and I'm a senior student here at the naval war College uh\r\n1:11:23\r\nso Bush he wins in Iraq then presides over the uh closing of the cold\r\n1:11:30\r\nbasically the close out of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall then he's immediately not reelected what does\r\n1:11:37\r\nthat say about us as the United States and our ability to to focus longterm on\r\n1:11:43\r\nany type of geopolitical strategy okay the question is Bush senior who very\r\n1:11:49\r\nsuccessfully negotiates the end of the Cold War and then he's very promptly not reelected\r\n1:11:55\r\nand what does this say about us um a lot of things are not visible until the\r\n1:12:02\r\nfullness of time for instance I was wondering about well are we in another\r\n1:12:08\r\ncold war and a decade in I can tell you uh particularly with Putin's Invasion\r\n1:12:13\r\nthe 2022 event I can say absolutely I I believe maybe I'll be wrong whereas in\r\n1:12:19\r\n2012 you go and then 2014 looks more like it so a\r\n1:12:25\r\nlot of is it takes time and a lot of the decisions that we all make uh both the\r\n1:12:31\r\ngood ones and the bad ones take a long time for their implications to be felt\r\n1:12:36\r\nfor instance President Eisenhower invests in the highway system and part\r\n1:12:42\r\nof that the idea was to have the highways wide enough so you could land planes anywhere you want well not anywhere they're Bridges but that but\r\n1:12:50\r\nbut to protect the country you'd have airfields everywhere and um actually\r\n1:12:55\r\nwhat that does is allows all kinds of Economic Development all over the United States but it takes a long time for all\r\n1:13:01\r\nthat to happen so um for instance recently there's been a lot of investment in uh internet right to get\r\n1:13:09\r\ninternet to all the rest of the country and we'll see whether that has any implications or not and it'll be 10\r\n1:13:15\r\nyears where you go okay that was a big nothing sandwich or no it's uh so I\r\n1:13:21\r\nthink that's a lot of it and also this is foreign policy Americans focus on domestic policy right\r\n1:13:30\r\nand I think what Americans don't understand uh today is their security\r\n1:13:37\r\ndepends on this Maritime order think about it you take your little piece of plastic you go wherever it is in the\r\n1:13:43\r\nworld and then you take that little plastic and you go I want to buy this thing or whatever and they give it to\r\n1:13:49\r\nyou right and so you've traded plastic which is nothing and oh they even give you the plastic back a little piece\r\n1:13:55\r\npiece of paper you get and then you take the good with you well that only works in a rules-based\r\n1:14:01\r\norder right we take it for granted you take it for granted in a business when you sign a contract with I don't know\r\n1:14:08\r\nwhere it is that they honor it if they don't you're going to have to send armies and things and do gumbo diplomacy\r\n1:14:15\r\nuh how expensive so your security is dependent on this Maritime order I don't\r\n1:14:22\r\nthink Americans today have a BW about it and that is why um I'm out here\r\n1:14:29\r\nlecturing I think it's important that you understand this and then what decisions you make afterwards is your\r\n1:14:35\r\nbusiness uh any other questions I've cowed you all the\r\n1:14:41\r\nsubmission it was so boring you can't think of anything hardly boring hardly one in the back yes Brave person Bron\r\n1:14:49\r\nNel United States Court thanks for your uh your lecture your discussion of the greatest Generation they sh a formative\r\n1:14:55\r\nexperience of catastrophic Paradigm changing two world wars and how that set\r\n1:15:01\r\nthe stage for their strategy the Cold War I'm wondering if there's uh when\r\n1:15:06\r\nwe're trying to extract lessons from the first Cold War to the second Cold War if it if there's changes we need to account\r\n1:15:12\r\nfor because it just kind of snuck up on us that\r\n1:15:17\r\ncatastropic okay so the question is about greatest Generations whether it requires a catastrophic event in order\r\n1:15:25\r\nto come up with good ideas um and how we needed to think about things to deal with the second Cold War um what a I\r\n1:15:33\r\nhave a question about human beings I don't know if human beings require a catastrophic disaster in order to get\r\n1:15:39\r\nreal because um you get the Marshall Plan which is big bucks there's no way\r\n1:15:45\r\nyou would have gotten Americans to agree to that after World War I after World War I we're all about collecting our debts give us the money back give us the\r\n1:15:51\r\nmoney back um and then we get World War II and maybe we should have more money back and it would have been so much\r\n1:15:56\r\ncheaper so the question is whether human beings require a catastrophic disaster\r\n1:16:02\r\nin order to get real um I hope not but we all know hope isn't a strategy but\r\n1:16:07\r\nsecond your generation is tremendously important for those of you who are\r\n1:16:13\r\nveterans of Afghanistan and Iraq because you have really important lived\r\n1:16:19\r\nexperience about what works and what doesn't work and uh I don't know whether\r\n1:16:24\r\nyou're the greatest generation of the next one in the making if you can make uh wise decisions and learn from your\r\n1:16:31\r\nexperience and also I urge you to publish this is how one generation passes the Baton to the Next Generation\r\n1:16:39\r\nwrite down what your experiences are and and analyze them and there you can write\r\n1:16:44\r\nshort things in uh military journals that your peers will see it's important\r\n1:16:49\r\nso uh we're in dangerous times uh Americans need to stop f with each other\r\n1:16:56\r\nand treat each other with respect and kindness and honesty and work together and if we do scorched Earth on ourselves\r\n1:17:03\r\nand our allies that is

Here is the reconstructed narrative, divided into appropriate sections, with speakers labeled and all available transcript content repaired for broken sentences and coherence.\n\n---\n\n# Introduction and Opening Remarks\n\n**Dr. Sarah C.M. Paine:**\n\nWe have the current problem now, which is a second Cold War, and in my reckoning, it began between 2012 and 2014. Why those dates? In 2012, Vlad the Bad comes to power\u2014he actually disposes of term limits that year. And then you get Xi Jinping coming into power. In 2014, Vlad the Bad moves into Ukraine, and ever since, Putin and Xi have been emphasizing that they\u2019re not particularly interested in this rules-based order and have other plans for us.\n\nSo, I have a three-part lecture, but really it\u2019s two main parts. The first part is the underlying geopolitics. The second part is how the last Cold War was won, lost, and played. Then at the end, I\u2019ll say, based on all this, what is the way forward. That\u2019ll be short. If I go at a real rate, I\u2019ll get this done in an hour and five. So here we go.\n\n---\n\n# Part 1: Geopolitics of Continental and Maritime Powers\n\nContinental and maritime empires ran business in fundamentally different ways\u2014how they wanted to organize themselves and how they wanted to organize others. But then the Industrial Revolution came and put both of them out of business and introduced a maritime, incoming, rules-based order.\n\nFor those of you who like animals\u2014and we at the Naval War College generally speaking, most of us like animals\u2014the maritime powers are the whales; the elephants are the continental powers. The first distinguishing characteristic of maritime versus continental powers is whether you can or cannot defend primarily at sea. Look at Ukraine\u2014they cannot defend primarily at sea. So, if you can, having a big Navy would be a thing for you, and if you can only defend by land, then you need to go to Army. These differences have profound military, economic, and political ramifications.\n\nThe United States started out as a traditional, typical continental power. Here\u2019s President Monroe and the Monroe Doctrine\u2014typical continental power, spheres of influence, telling the Europeans, \u201cStay out of the Americas, it\u2019s ours.\u201d And here\u2019s how the United States expanded, again like a typical continental power: it did a series of regional wars with Mexico, the longest counterinsurgency in U.S. history was fought against the Native Americans. But the twist that Americans liked was checkbook diplomacy, you know, paying money to people\u2014and that\u2019s what the Louisiana Purchase and buying Alaska were all about. Americans had a name for this: Manifest Destiny. It was the obvious, manifest fate of America, the United States\u2014we appropriated the name for the entire continent\u2014to own at least North America.\n\nThis painting, which today goes by the politically correct name of \u201cWestward Ho,\u201d at the time of painting was called \u201cWestward, the Course of Empire Takes Its Way.\u201d It hangs in the Capitol, apparently in some part of the House of Representatives. Americans in the 19th century considered themselves an empire\u2014proud of it. But the view changes in the late 19th century. Here, Alfred Thayer Mahan, who is by far the most famous person ever associated with this college\u2014of enduring international influence\u2014looked at the world and thought, \u201cWell, actually, it\u2019s not so much continental consolidation that is the origin of power and position in this world, but the wealth accruing from maritime trade.\u201d\n\nMahan said there are six prerequisites for playing this game of maritime security paradigm. Number one: you need a moat, insulation from attack. Number two: you need a dense internal transportation grid to get the goods out in peacetime. Number three: you need reliable egress by sea to get the Navy out in wartime. Number four: you need a dense coastal population\u2014these are the people running this commerce-driven economy. Number five: you need the commerce-driven economy that goes with them. Number six: you need stable government institutions\u2014this is going to mean you have stable laws that promote commerce and also promote the Navy.\n\nIf you look at China and Russia today, neither one of them has a full list of six. Start with the moat\u2014they most certainly do not have moats, either one of them. In fact, they each have more neighbors than any other two countries on the planet, and a lot of those places don\u2019t much like them for excellent reasons. Moreover, China has an improving internal transportation grid, but Russia\u2019s remains lamentable. Neither one has reliable access by sea because they\u2019re all surrounded by narrow, island-cluttered coastal seas, surrounded by all kinds of neighbors that shut down in wartime. Russia\u2019s got the big Arctic thing\u2014well, great if you want to go court with polar bears, that\u2019s a place for you, but not for commerce. In addition, China has a dense coastal population, Russia doesn\u2019t. Russia has never had a commerce-driven economy, and under Deng Xiaoping, China was more so, but in recent years, Xi Jinping has been privileging the crony sector over the private sector. Neither China nor Russia has stable government institutions\u2014regular, transparent transfers of executive power. Dictator for life does not remotely qualify.\n\nChina and Russia have some maritime ambitions, but they don\u2019t have the geopolitical position actually to play the game, and I\u2019m not even clear they understand it.\n\n---\n\n# Continental Empires: Historical Context and Expansion\n\nIf you look at China, it shows you a lot of vertical real estate there, and the flat stuff up north, a lot of it is either awfully cold or awfully dry to grow much of anything. If you look at where the Han live\u2014the preponderant ethnic group of China\u2014it\u2019s all the pink places. You can see where they live, and they\u2019re surrounded by heterogeneous ethnic groups. If it\u2019s a simplified ethnic map, what you realize is that the Han occupy all the prime real estate. The curious might ask, \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d The answer would be, they laid waste to the competing Xiongnu and Mongol empires. You haven\u2019t heard about the Xiongnu\u2014the Qing dynasty wiped them out hundreds of years ago. This is how continental empires run business: either you get with the program, or they will kill you. It\u2019s a binary choice\u2014either you become Han, honorary Han, or that\u2019s it. In our own day, I believe the Uyghurs are slated for genocide. This is not a world for the faint-hearted.\n\nFor a sanitized version of Chinese history: the Hans started out up there in the Yellow River Valley and then they spread, and they spread, built some walls too, and spread, and did all this crazy stuff, coming and going. Then there\u2019s a lot of consolidation before this happens to them\u2014the Yuan dynasty. It looks like just a bigger version of what I\u2019ve been showing you, except there\u2019s a major discontinuity: these Yuan dynasty, they\u2019re Mongols. This is the largest empire in Chinese history, and when the Han are subjugated people\u2014and this grossly understates the issue\u2014the Mongol empire went all the way west to Hungary, expanding over the Eurasian plain. But the Han reassert themselves under the Ming. The Mongols only last for a century, but then the Ming succumb to the second largest empire in Chinese history\u2014the Qing. They aren\u2019t Han either; they\u2019re Manchu.\n\nWhat\u2019s ironic today, when the Chinese government starts claiming what its historic lands are, is that they go back to the Mongol Yuan dynasty or the Manchu Qing dynasty, when, ironically, the Han were subjugated people. But the reason for all the maps wasn\u2019t to make that snide remark\u2014it was to show you lots and lots of shrinkage, lots and lots of expansion, and lots and lots of bloodshed. While this is taking place, the Chinese have been raising and arming armies in the hundreds of thousands for thousands of years. The West does not do this, certainly not on a regular basis, until the Napoleonic Wars. It\u2019s quite a world, this continental world.\n\nTo let you know how Russia did it: their expansion from the grand duchy of Muscovy is like Mongols in the war in reverse\u2014they\u2019re going from west to east across the Eurasian plain.\n\nIf you look at Russia\u2019s no-kidding enemies circa 1900, there are lots of them. Although in this world of empire, leveraging internal lines of communication comes with a corresponding disadvantage of multiple neighbors. These are Russia\u2019s no-kidding security threats. It\u2019s very different from the security world of Britain with its 360-degree, \u201cyou can\u2019t get me\u201d moat. Lots of people have come to get Russians over the years\u2014the Swedes, the Mongols, the French, the Germans, and most recently, the Cold War, the West. But each time, the central position allowed them to rise again.\n\nIn this world, power is a function of land; neighbors are dangerous, even the itty-bitty ones can cause problems, because instability can spread over the border. The big ones, if they\u2019ve got an attitude, are dangerous because they may come get you. The purpose for an army in this world is not the maritime power army, which is expeditionary warfare\u2014expedition means you cross the ocean to go somewhere else. In this world, the army\u2019s number one mission is to keep the ruling regime in power. If you think \u201cPeople\u2019s Liberation Army,\u201d you should think it\u2019s the Praetorian Guard of the Chinese Communist Party. The second most important thing is to prevent any defections from the empire, and only third is border defense. In this world, away games are rare\u2014most of the fighting is on home territory, and the winter takes and keeps the field.\n\nThis gives you the mathematics of all this\u2014the cost of the home front, main front. These are deaths in World War II\u2014Axis and Allied land deaths, high numbers. But when you compare Britain and the United States\u2014the two maritime powers\u2014with France and Italy by some statistics, they suffer less, and France wasn\u2019t even in the war that long. Add in civilian deaths and the difference between maritime and continental deaths just skyrockets. Why is this? In the continental world, a lot of the fighting happens on home territory, particularly if you lose, so your citizens have no sanctuary. There are a lot of deaths associated with it.\n\nNo country in their right mind wants to fight on the home front main front\u2014it\u2019s just so costly. Continental powers just don\u2019t have a choice. Maritime powers\u2014it\u2019s a great point of strategy of whether and if you do when you\u2019re going to get involved. But there are advantages if you win on the main front\u2014Stalin wins World War II, wherever his Red Army is, he keeps\u2014he keeps Eastern Europe, but it comes at the cost of millions and millions of Soviet deaths to do this.\n\nThere are rules to play and win in this setup. Rule number one: neighbors are numerous\u2014no two-front wars; if multiple neighbors try to come get you, you\u2019re in trouble. Secondly, no great power neighbors\u2014because today\u2019s friend can be tomorrow\u2019s foe, and that will spell trouble. So what do you do? You take on your neighbors sequentially. You set them up to fail, you destabilize the rising, ingest the failing, set up buffer zones in between, and you wait for the opportune moment to pounce and absorb. That is Vladimir Putin\u2019s game. Better yet, you get the neighbors to do the work for you, sow their mutual resentments by deluging them with fake news and anything else you can think of, so that Russia can play the role of a jackal state\u2014to steal the kill made by others.\n\nIf this is your security paradigm, you\u2019re going to surround yourself with failing states. Look at Russia and China\u2014they have some of the most dysfunctional places on the planet on their borders. Are they unlucky, or are they complicit? There are no enduring alliances, because people figure out that eventually the hegemonic power only offers trouble in the long run. There\u2019s also a tendency for overextension\u2014there\u2019s no counsel on how much is enough territory before you choke on it.\n\nBut before you dismiss this security paradigm, understand this is how the great civilizations of Eurasia ran business. They didn\u2019t care about collateral damage, killing a bunch of extra people. This paradigm is all about wrecking things, killing people to get territory, and you\u2019ve seen it operating in real time in Syria and in Ukraine.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem for the likes of Vladimir Putin: in this world, if you botch strategy, your known world can just vanish forever. This is what happened to imperial Russia, imperial China, and many of the great civilizations of Eurasia. I love this picture of an aristocrat\u2019s ruined palace, or whatever it is, in Russia, because whole social classes were wiped off the face of the map by the Bolsheviks for messing with their strategy. The continental world is a world without insurance policies.\n\n---\n\n# The Maritime World and the Industrial Revolution\n\nHere\u2019s the maritime world\u2014it\u2019s different. I love this picture\u2014it shows all of the commerce going on in the 19th century and shows the Atlantic as a very busy place, the center of the world economy. All of these sea lines of communication are connecting trade from all the coastlines, traversing the ocean, which is a commons, a shared space. Think about it in our own highly networked age\u2014the seas are the world\u2019s original network, potentially connecting everyone with everything.\n\nThis maritime world goes back to the ancient Greeks, who had a rimland empire along the Aegean and Ionian Seas, making a lot of money from trade. The Roman Empire had a similar idea\u2014a rimland empire, very different from the consolidated empires of Russia and China. Look at the terminology: Mediterranean\u2014middle of the lands, the sea among the lands. China\u2019s name is Zhongguo\u2014central kingdom, the kingdom among the kingdoms. One emphasizes the centrality of the sea, the other, the centrality of the land.\n\nThe Silk Road connected these two worlds, East and West, and there\u2019s been much money to be made on East-West trade for a very long time. Whoever controlled the western terminus\u2014the big toll booth\u2014made a lot of money. The Muslim conquests settled that problem for a while; no one controlled the rims, and this is when the Crusades take place. The Ottomans controlled it for a long time, so the Spanish and Portuguese got creative and decided to get to Asia the long way around, except they bumped into the New World\u2014new to them, not to others\u2014and found gold and silver. The Dutch were the real people who focused on an empire that\u2019s all about trade and trading bases. Their problem was their exposed position in Europe, so they could be defeated in Europe.\n\nThe real pioneers of maritime empire were the British. Every other country in Europe had to maintain a large, potentially coup-generating standing army, which is expensive and will want economic policies to privilege the army. Britain could take its dependence on trade and transform it into an advantage: if they could make lots of money on trade, that would fund a Navy, and if anyone tried to invade, they\u2019d drown at sea. Meanwhile, while their adversaries were busy destroying wealth, Britain maximized its money. This is a prevent-defeat strategy: no one\u2019s going to invade Britain if they keep a good Navy, but it doesn\u2019t deliver victory against continental problems.\n\nBritain coined the term \u201cgrand strategy\u201d\u2014grand in the multiplicity of instruments of national power that are integrated. Navies rarely deliver victory in war; usually, you need other things to go on as well. After much trial and error, the British had six coalitions, a final capstone alliance, and they dealt with Napoleon. Here is their grand strategy for elephant hunting, used to great effect in World War II: keep the home economy growing\u2014that\u2019s where your money is, that funds your military and allies. Don\u2019t let the enemy elephant forage\u2014shut them down and force them back on dwindling resources and increasingly embittered allies. Rent an elephant\u2014find the continental power most directly threatened by your problem, arm and fund them. Find a theater peripheral to the main theater that favors maritime access, so you can have cumulative effects on the enemy, force them to fight with divided attention, and relieve pressure on the main front. If Britain chooses the right theater, casualties are far lower than in the continental problem. Rule five: don\u2019t take on the elephant as your opening move; don\u2019t go toe-to-toe with your continental problem, because Britain\u2019s great strength is not its army. Only get involved on the main front after bleeding the elephant and coming in with lots of friends.\n\nIf Britain plays this game, it can put itself and its enemies on opposing trend lines\u2014Britain gets wealthier and wealthier if it can trade, and war undermines the enemy\u2019s territory, economy, morale, and productivity. Eventually, the story is, they get exhausted first. It\u2019s a strategy of exhaustion, focusing not only on military power but economics, coalitions, institution-building. Prerequisites: sanctuary at home, access to markets, allies, peripheral theaters, and institutional stability at home for long-term foreign policy\u2014some of what Mahan emphasized.\n\nThis brings me to the second distinguishing characteristic between maritime and continental powers: continental powers face contiguous threats, so they want to be insulated from neighbors and have exclusion zones\u2014applied to the seas as well. Maritime powers, due to their comparative security, want access to international markets and the seas as a commons that everyone can share. So, focus on insulation versus access to markets; desire for closed versus open seas. We\u2019re starting to get to two very different world orders here.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution upended both types of empires by introducing economic growth whose compounding effects were truly revolutionary. It started in Britain, moved to the continent, and has been making its disruptive path around the world ever since. It\u2019s based on a combination of institutional and technological factors. The currency of international power changed: formerly, power was a function of land, for commodities and conscripts. Once you have compounding growth, the source of power is money from trade, industry, and commerce. The disruptive effect for traditional society was global; suddenly, their security paradigms didn\u2019t work anymore. Who\u2019s rich and who\u2019s poor today is about degrees of industrialization.\n\nEver since the Industrial Revolution, there\u2019s been a gradual expansion\u2014ups and downs\u2014of the maritime trading order, all about negotiating rules for trade. It\u2019s catastrophic for traditional societies; many have never gotten over it. The Chinese never liked the incoming maritime order in the 19th century and aren\u2019t happy about it now. Malcolm McLean set things moving on the expansion of the maritime order\u2014he ran a trucking company, took his trucks minus the chassis and put them on ships\u2014what we call containers. This radically reduced shipping times and loading times, making it so much cheaper to send things by sea than by land. Container sizes are standardized: one if by truck, two if by rail car, thousands if by sea.\n\nXi Jinping thinks his Belt and Road Initiative is a great way to get goods around the world. Here\u2019s my argument why his math is flawed: in 1960, the average tanker size was 20,000 deadweight tons. Today, the smallest ultra-large crude tanker is a quarter of a million deadweight tons. The largest container ships now carry about 21,000 containers and over a billion dollars in cargo\u2014one ship. By train: 600 containers.

In peacetime, things move, but in wartime, China has trouble even with the maritime part of Belt and Road\u2014surrounded by narrow, cluttered seas with neighbors who may not like them. In wartime, those seas are closed to commercial traffic. Meanwhile, the West moves through the high seas\u2014provided you convoy, you can get stuff through.\n\nIf you look at the inter-Cold War period, or at the end of World War II, you see skyrocketing international trade that lifts hundreds of millions out of poverty. From the \u201990s upward, it just goes up, up, and away. This is the miracle of our times, but I\u2019m sad to tell you, it\u2019s over\u2014the inter-Cold War period is over. There\u2019s going to be this funding and counter-funding of insurgencies worldwide, reducing wealth.\n\n---\n\n# Third Distinguishing Characteristic: Lines of Communication and Alliances\n\nThe transportation revolution that makes it so much cheaper to ship things by sea leads me to my third distinguishing characteristic: continental powers did quite well with interior lines of communication to garrison their empire, deploy their armies, and form alliances with contiguous places. Maritime powers use exterior lines\u2014oceans provide access to global markets, wartime allies, and the possibility of a global alliance system. The third characteristic is reliance on interior versus exterior lines of communication and the ability to have a contiguous or global alliance system.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution upended the world not just because of cheaper transportation, but because it offered the possibility of a new positive-sum world order. Instead of wrecking your neighbors (the continental paradigm: destabilizing, invading, and destroying, so what you get is a wasteland), the maritime order is positive-sum. The continental order is negative-sum\u2014because the loser\u2019s loss is less than the winner\u2019s win, you\u2019re capturing damaged goods. In the maritime order, it\u2019s all about positive-sum trade transactions where both parties win. That\u2019s why you do trade.\n\nFor this to work, the focus is on freedom of navigation, free trade, international laws, and institutions facilitating trade to minimize transaction costs. The insurance system for all of this is alliances. Countries that aren\u2019t maritime by geography, if they join up with enough others, can operate on a maritime security paradigm. Here\u2019s the insurance system for all of this, created by the greatest generation\u2014the World War I generation, not the World War II who claimed it. The World War I generation were conscripts trying to raise families during the Great Depression, then became the strategic leaders of World War II and sent their kids to fight. They decided that the solution to war and depression was institution-building on a global scale\u2014rapidly building the UN, IMF, NATO, predecessor institutions of the EU and World Trade Organization, to hold the peace institutionally. It worked in the industrialized world until Vlad the Bad overturned the chess table in Ukraine.\n\nThe maritime world is invisible. It took me 15 years working here for it to dawn on me what was going on. It has to do with the difference between negative and positive objectives. The continental world is about positive objectives: you\u2019re taking land, and when you take or try to take it, you\u2019re wrecking things, so people can see what\u2019s going on. The maritime world, particularly if you\u2019re successful, is about negative objectives\u2014you\u2019re preventing stuff from happening. Operationally, you can have all these wins in the continental world, but actually you\u2019re destroying wealth at the strategic level. In the maritime world, you\u2019re preventing things: for the Navy, the focus is mostly on negative objectives in peacetime (which, by the way, is most of the time). The Navy is preventing the destruction of the global trading system\u2014that\u2019s an important mission. Preventing limits on freedom of navigation\u2014if you can\u2019t get goods port to port, it\u2019s useless. Navies are about deterring people from taking other people\u2019s territory\u2014sovereignty being the bedrock of international law.\n\nOn a good day, Navy day, absolutely nothing happens\u2014looks like the Navy is doing nothing, but it\u2019s incredibly important. Maritime powers hold it together with alliances, diplomacy, sanctions, embargos, containment. The Navy\u2019s deterrence: blockades, commerce raiding. Sanctions and other measures may not seem to have immediate effect, but over a few generations, the difference between North and South Korea is significant. You\u2019re shrinking the opposing piggy bank. Solving the whole problem isn\u2019t always feasible\u2014if the whole problem has nuclear weapons, the solution may be Armageddon. This world isn\u2019t about operational wins\u2014it\u2019s about the strategic win of maximizing wealth for you and your allies.\n\n---\n\n# Recap: Continental vs Maritime Powers\n\nThere are three characteristics that distinguish continental and maritime powers: the (in)ability to defend primarily at sea; focus on insulation from versus access to the world; and reliance on interior versus exterior lines of communication. From these accidents of geography come some preferences: continental preference for territory, self-sufficiency, exclusion zones; maritime preference for markets, access, and commons\u2014not only maritime, but air, cyber, and space commons. A lot of countries aren\u2019t strictly one or the other, so there\u2019s a continuum.\n\nYou can gain a maritime position by the countries and institutions you support, so that collectively the whole thing can operate on a maritime security paradigm. The choice is consequential: those who choose a continental paradigm these days typically are dictators who wind up hemorrhaging cash to dominate their own citizens or neighbors. China, by rejoining the maritime system under Deng Xiaoping, transformed from a very poor country to a far richer country. But older continental predilections still exist\u2014they seem to be taking a U-turn on this road. The continental world is negative-sum; the only positive-sum order humans have come up with is this maritime order. For all its flaws, at least there are institutions where you can go, send your lawyers and diplomats, and argue things out. The alternative is potentially terminal for mankind if you get into a big war.\n\n---\n\n# Part 2: The Last Cold War \u2013 Causes, Consequences, and Explanations\n\nLet\u2019s move to the Cold War\u2014there was one, and it turned out quite well. Is there anything we can glean from this? How did it turn out the way it did? Some people take comfort in saying Ronald Reagan won the Cold War. That\u2019s one way of looking at it, but there are many explanations.\n\nWhat Ronald Reagan did was a big military buildup, and the Russians, at the end of the Cold War, had as much as 70% of their economy devoted to the military\u2014it was absolutely suffocating. The Nazis in hot war spent only 55% of their economy on it, so it was a problem for the Soviets. I\u2019ll be quoting a lot of Russians today, because they thought deeply about what happened to their country.\n\nHere\u2019s Valentin Falin, long-time Soviet ambassador to Germany. He said, look, the American strategy of our exhaustion in the arms race just wrecked our quality of life. Russia had not only problems with the United States but also with China, so the arms race plunged the Soviet economy into a permanent crisis.\n\nHere\u2019s Georgy Arbatov, the Soviet premier expert on the United States, watching Reagan funding anti-communist counter-insurgencies all over the world\u2014destroying wealth by having both sides funding insurgencies. In Afghanistan, he said, \u201cYeah, we got our Vietnam.\u201d So some would argue that U.S. victory in the arms race determined victory in the Cold War.\n\nLet\u2019s go through other presidents, because there are other arguments, starting with Ford, Carter, and the Helsinki Accords. After World War II, the Soviets wanted a European-wide conference for everyone to agree on their expanded borders. For the longest time, Europeans weren\u2019t interested, but by the \u201970s, they were sick of the drama. The U.S. wasn\u2019t interested, but we showed up and insisted on human rights clauses\u2014which we knew they wouldn\u2019t respect. The third basket of the Helsinki Accords was human rights. Lo and behold, human rights activists in the West and dissidents throughout the Warsaw Pact started trying to hold the Soviet government accountable: \u201cWhere is the liberation that communism promised? Why are we dealing with this dictatorship that\u2019s been delivered?\u201d And by the way, you signed all these things. This dissident movement, the human rights movement, took on a life of its own.\n\nJimmy Carter then ran with it, giving a commencement address at Notre Dame: \u201cWe have reaffirmed America\u2019s commitment to human rights as a fundamental tenet of our foreign policy. What draws us together is a belief in human freedom. We want the world to know that our nation stands for more than just financial prosperity\u2014we\u2019re bigger than that.\u201d Carter was emphasizing precisely the political freedoms being denied throughout the Eastern bloc.\n\nHere\u2019s Anatoly Gromyko, long-time Soviet diplomat: Communist ideology was associated above all with the Soviet Union, and when you reject it, a vacuum, a real problem, results. Some would argue that the human rights clauses of the Helsinki Accords and Carter\u2019s campaign destroyed belief in communism, and that\u2019s why it all ended.\n\nOthers say, \u201cNonsense\u2014it\u2019s Richard Nixon and the China card.\u201d Or it\u2019s Mao and the America card. In 1969, Russia and China were going at it in a border war over some islands in the Amur River. The Russians approached the United States: \u201cWould it be okay if we nuke these people?\u201d The U.S. said, \u201cNo way.\u201d Mao figured it out: the one that wants to nuke you is the primary adversary. Prior to this, the U.S. had been China\u2019s primary adversary; after, China and Russia are each other\u2019s primary adversaries, and the U.S. becomes the swing vote, ganging up with China against Russia. This forced Russia into a bankrupting militarization of its long frontier with China\u2014it had already militarized its European frontier, now it had to put mechanized, nuclear-armed forces there. Imagine if the U.S. had to do this on both Canadian and Mexican borders\u2014it would be bankrupting.\n\nSo, U.S. cooperation with China fatally overextended the Soviet Union. You could also say each president opened opportunities for successors: Nixon plays the China card, Ford keeps using it, and starts playing the human rights card, Carter runs with that, begins a military buildup that Reagan really runs with. Reagan and Bush later operate from a position of military and ideological strength. For those who think U.S. foreign policy wasn\u2019t consistent during the Cold War, you\u2019re wrong: the policy objective was relentless\u2014free trade, democracy, containment of communism. Republicans and Democrats agreed on that; they had different strategies, but agreed on the goal.\n\nOthers would say, forget the great man theory of history\u2014it\u2019s this platform, the nuclear-powered submarine, that determined the outcome. Under Carter and Reagan, there was a much more aggressive strategy of targeting Soviet nuclear subs in their home bastions, and the Soviets were scared to death that they didn\u2019t have reliable second-strike capability. Here\u2019s Marshal Akhromeyev, in the U.S., telling his host, \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded, that\u2019s why we\u2019re concerned. We know that you know where our subs are, and we don\u2019t know where yours are. You, the United States Navy\u2014they, the problem. Go Navy.\u201d The USSR could not counter, technologically or financially, the U.S. submarine threat and to its retaliatory nuclear forces. Some would argue that\u2019s why they had to settle the Cold War.\n\n---\n\n# The Soviet Side: Collapse and Self-Destruction\n\nAll the preceding explanations are \u201cnavel explanations\u201d (with an \u201ce\u201d), all about what Team America did or didn\u2019t do. Let\u2019s get to the other side: what was Team Russia up to? Arnold Toynbee, one of the finest historians of the 20th century, observed that civilizations die from suicide, not by murder. I\u2019ve been talking about the murder\u2014what others did to the Soviet Union\u2014now I\u2019ll get to the suicide, the self-defeating things the Soviets did.\n\nExplanation number one: they lost the empire, the Cold War, because their empire collapsed\u2014the domino theory supposed to apply to capitalism actually applied to communism. Once the democratic contagion hit one Warsaw Pact country and demonstrations for freedom started, they spread to others. The leaders of these countries no longer had the stomach for the violence it would take to get demonstrators off the street. Gorbachev\u2019s ideas of \u201cglasnost\u201d (openness) and \u201cperestroika\u201d (rebuilding) resonated throughout Russia and Eastern Europe. Russians hit the streets demonstrating for political freedoms; in Eastern Europe, they demonstrated for freedom from the Soviet Union.\n\nGorbachev encouraged people to reform; he didn\u2019t send tanks into the Eastern bloc. Instead, he told them to do political and economic reforms the way we are. These reforms started in Poland, which had a history of unrest. In 1988, Solidarity, the workers\u2019 movement, gained national and international reputation\u2014it was the only independent opposition movement of any Warsaw Pact country. The economy was a mess, the government needed to raise staple prices, Solidarity hit the streets, the government feared freefall, so they offered Solidarity a place at the bargaining table if they\u2019d call off the strikes. A complicating factor in Poland is the Roman Catholic Church\u2014an institution of enormous legitimacy, with a partiality for Solidarity.\n\nTalks started in February 1989\u2014the Round Table Talks. Here\u2019s Soviet advice to the Poles: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find some quick solutions. You\u2019re an itty-bitty country, so if you make mistakes, they\u2019ll be itty-bitty mistakes; if we make them, they\u2019ll be big.\u201d The Communist Party in Poland decided to hold elections, on the very same day that Deng Xiaoping called out the tanks and the Tiananmen Massacre occurred\u2014two very different solutions. The Communist Party thought they had it under control with party-designated seats, but Solidarity won every seat it could compete for, and in the party-designated seats, the party got only three\u2014the rest went to \u201cnone of the above.\u201d That was the end of Communist Party legitimacy in Poland. Further democratic reforms cascaded into East Germany. In the past, East Germany would have sent tanks, but \u201cTankman\u201d Erich Honecker was already out of a job, his disastrous strategy of living off debt having wrecked the place.\n\nMost of the Politburo resigned by November. They issued new travel rules. At a press conference, Gunter Schabowski was asked, \u201cWhen are the travel regulations going to be implemented?\u201d Not wanting to admit he didn\u2019t know, he winged it: \u201cImmediately.\u201d Huge crowds started massing at the gates of East Berlin; at one, the border guards decided discretion was the better part of valor, opened it, and people streamed into West Berlin. Within a week, over half the country had visited West Berlin. Like the Polish elections, opening the gate meant there was no going back\u2014the world had changed.\n\nHere\u2019s Anatoliy Kovalev\u2019s take\u2014longtime deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union: there was no confidence whatsoever in whom the East German army would shoot\u2014us or the demonstrators. Same thing for the Poles and Hungarians\u2014great alliance system, right? Unrest in the empire forced the Union to forfeit the Cold War.\n\nAnother argument: the satellites themselves were terribly unhealthy, and that\u2019s the origin of the problem. Circa 1960, all those tempting green places were about to become independent; enter the Soviet Union with a plan to put them out of business. There were many takers. By the 1980s, all the promising pink places where the Soviets had all kinds of new friends. But in the late \u201970s, commodity prices (including oil) went way down. The Soviet Union\u2019s budget depended heavily on oil\u2014sometimes as much as 55%. Not only did the non-performing pals have no money and need bigger subsidies, but the Soviet Union was less able to subsidize them. Most problematically, Soviet internal nationalities erupted, all wanting to secede. Rule of continental empire: no two-front wars. The Soviets had so many fronts, they couldn\u2019t keep track. By bankrupting itself in the Third World and ignoring its own internal Third World, the Soviet Union lost the Cold War.\n\nAnother argument: economics. The Soviet economy did well rebuilding after World War II but stagnated in the 1970s. In the decade before Gorbachev, the Soviet economy had been growing 1\u20132% less per annum compared to the West; the compounding effects are huge. In a command economy, Moscow central tells everyone what to produce, but units on the bottom lie about inventory and inputs, macroeconomic statistics are garbage, and capital and labor are misallocated. No one knows consumer preferences or productivity; misallocation is horrendous and no one figures it out until it\u2019s catastrophic. Under Gorbachev, oil prices tanked, growth went negative, and economic growth goes negative. Marshall Akhromeyev looked at all this and concluded, \u201cNATO\u2014they\u2019re just rich, we can\u2019t counter these people; we\u2019ve got to find a way to call it off.\u201d The Soviet economy lost the Cold War.\n\nHere is Alexis de Tocqueville and his famous chestnut: \u201cThe most dangerous moment for bad government is when it begins to reform.\u201d People in Russia disagree about many things but agree that Gorbachev\u2019s role was absolutely central in how it all turned out. Gorbachev made decisions based on incorrect assumptions: that history was irreversible, always forward toward communism, but Eastern Europe made a U-turn back to capitalism. He misread the sentiments of neighbors\u2014thought Eastern Europeans would look upon him as their liberator, rather than as an interloper. He believed that bringing freedom to satellites would lead them to adopt \u201csocialism with a human face.\u201d He made an enormous mistake; these countries turned their back on Russia. The United States intervenes in civil wars all over the world but deluges them with economic aid and even leaves\u2014people don\u2019t like us, but we don\u2019t stick around. Russians wonder why they\u2019re so special.\n\nGorbachev also believed if there were no Warsaw Pact, there would be no NATO; no Comecon, no European Community. Wrong\u2014two of those things are still around. He thought the United States, like a continental power, would oppose German unification. So Gorbachev goes on vacation while all the unrest is happening\u2014poor life choice, because President Bush and Chancellor Kohl of Germany are coordinating on the fastest reunification of Germany ever. Some would argue that Gorbachev\u2019s sins of commission caused the problems, that his foreign policy mistakes were a function of domestic policy mistakes, and together they killed the Soviet Union.\n\nOthers would argue it\u2019s not about sins of commission, but sins of omission\u2014what the Army failed to do. The Red Army should have done the Deng Xiaoping solution: send in the tanks. Timely tank deployment\u2014TTD\u2014would have changed the outcome.\n\nStill others say it\u2019s not sins of omission but commission by Boris Yeltsin, Gorbachev\u2019s successor\u2014he got rid of Article Six in the Soviet Constitution, which had given the Communist Party the monopoly of power; now you have multi-party competition. He signed the Belavezha Accords that dissolved the Soviet Union\u2014so, suicide on purpose.\n\n---\n\n# Summing Up the Collapse\n\nYou can give umbrella explanations: maybe any of the above reasons, or all of"]},"status":"finished_partial_completion","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"max_tokens"},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"967eeec5cbfb3dd8-SIN","message_type":"continue","model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"1ff25d76-b0a8-45a0-998b-9ddfebf3379c","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1ff25d76-b0a8-45a0-998b-9ddfebf3379c","children":["5c70cbb6-53be-4398-ae5c-a699fa9e6526"]},"5c70cbb6-53be-4398-ae5c-a699fa9e6526":{"id":"5c70cbb6-53be-4398-ae5c-a699fa9e6526","message":{"id":"5c70cbb6-53be-4398-ae5c-a699fa9e6526","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753984265.535593,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[" them. There were so many problems with the Soviet Union, you could argue its demise was inevitable\u2014it was brutally inefficient. The West didn\u2019t like it because of this; it wasn\u2019t that any U.S. president did anything\u2014the Russians figured it out, invented it, and wanted to get rid of it. The Soviet Union was destined to lose\u2014that\u2019s an optimistic way of looking at it.\n\nA pessimistic way: the Cold War ended very much on Western terms because it required all of these factors\u2014the whole list I gave you today. Remove any one of them and you get a different outcome\u2014maybe you don\u2019t even end the Cold War. It took the whole shebang, so the West barely won the Cold War. Another twist: not only did it take everything, but you needed Bush and Kohl in office at the same time. Bush had a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Kohl was the longest-serving chancellor of West Germany since Bismarck. They worked on fast-tracking unification by letting East Germans travel, paying big money to let more people out, and then doing tag-team diplomacy\u2014offering big money to Gorbachev that he couldn\u2019t refuse, as the Soviet economy imploded.\n\nA month and a half before reunification, Saddam Hussein invaded Iraq\u2014a major Soviet client state. Bush finessed this, not going too far into Iraq to upset the Soviets, and also finessed Margaret Thatcher and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2014neither wanted to see a unified Germany, since it would eclipse their own countries. Mitterrand negotiated the Maastricht Treaty to create the European Union, bringing in all Eastern European countries and merging with the European Community. Thatcher just plain lost\u2014she wanted Soviet troops in Germany for the duration. Imagine dealing with Putin today if she\u2019d had her way.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion and Possible Ways Forward\n\nThat\u2019s it for the underlying geopolitics and what was done last time around. Now, what do we do?\n\nIn the first half, I talked about elephant hunting\u2014how the British ran their strategy, which worked in World War II. But there\u2019s a huge difference now: it\u2019s precision nuclear strike\u2014none of us has an invulnerable home anymore. By all means, keep the economy running and probably your friends\u2019 economies running; by all means, close down enemy trade\u2014not with blockades and commerce raiding, but much better with sanctions. Sanctions: \u201cI\u2019m going to buy stuff or I\u2019m not, sell stuff or I\u2019m not.\u201d Then, on peripheral theaters, help people who are beset by continental problems, but you must be cautious.\n\nThe goal of maintaining prosperity hasn\u2019t changed. Last time around, the West, Japan, and South Korea all parried the nuclear threat\u2014not through nuclear bombs, but through economic growth. As the maritime world compounded economic growth, the communists were living in compounded poverty. Don\u2019t despair: people in the West during the Cold War\u2014most people\u2014were living quite well, much better than the communists. There was prosperity while all this was going on.\n\nThe current Cold War will go on for generations, because you don\u2019t change how other people think\u2014they decide. Changing what they thought\u2014Gorbachev and his generation, Deng Xiaoping and his\u2014took time. It\u2019ll take the Russians and Chinese a long time to change.\n\nFrom the Cold War section, you can extract U.S. strategy: extensive military buildup with allies, a broad strategic communications campaign (not just human rights at the end, but from the beginning\u2014accurate news to subject populations: Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, etc.), lots of alliance-building for friends and alliance-busting for enemies. Amplify overextension of your enemy\u2014all the stupid things they\u2019re doing. The Soviet Union was overextended\u2014occupying someone else\u2019s country and staying forever is not efficient. The Russians were abusive, we leveraged that, and they had a non-performing economic model. Amplify those errors.\n\nGeography, without us lifting a finger, naturally contains Russia and China\u2014they\u2019re surrounded by narrow seas, just facts. Those narrow seas in peacetime don\u2019t matter, but in hot war, merchant traffic doesn\u2019t go and your navy won\u2019t either if you\u2019re located on a really narrow sea. Putin and Xi, and whoever else is bothering you, don\u2019t have a coherent alliance system. It\u2019s a bunch of Eurasian dictators\u2014they share the U.S. as a secondary enemy, but their primary enemies are different. Russia\u2019s primary enemy is Ukraine, China\u2019s might be Taiwan, India, or someone else; Iran\u2019s is Israel, Pakistan\u2019s is India, North Korea\u2019s is South Korea. None of this aligns for meaningful sacrifices for each other. Compare that to World War II alliances\u2014there was agreement on Germany as the primary theater, primary enemy. The Axis had different theaters and enemies, dispersing their resources.\n\nToday, Vladimir Putin is trying to reconstitute an empire in the age of nationalism. Good luck\u2014dominated peoples no longer sit supine and take it, they resist. The Belt and Road initiative: Putin is dumping his arsenal into Ukraine, leaving Siberia open to Chinese ambitions. China is peeling away from the Russian sphere of influence in Central Asia\u2014that Belt and Road thing is quite threatening for Putin, not so much for us.\n\nIn the last Cold War, the Russians kept it cold\u2014proxy wars, other people did the fighting. Now, Vladimir Putin is doing the fighting himself. Back then, Russia was strong, China was weak; now, the tables have turned. Siberia has resources China would like; the territories the Romanov dynasty took from China exceed U.S. territory east of the Mississippi. The Chinese haven\u2019t forgotten. Putin says boundary treaties don\u2019t matter; the Chinese can play that back at him. Siberia has water\u2014North China has blown through its water table, Baikal has over 20% of the world\u2019s surface freshwater, and the Chinese can pipe it down if they wish. The question isn\u2019t if, but when the Sino-Russian relationship will break up.\n\nThe problem with misidentifying your primary adversary and fighting a recreational war: Nicholas II thought Japan was his primary enemy, fought the Russo-Japanese War instead of preparing for Germany, and the dynasty was destroyed ten years later. Putin is emptying out his arsenal on Ukraine\u2014the Ukrainians never wanted Russian territory; the Chinese might. If we play our cards right, the Russians and Chinese will take care of each other, but we\u2019re going to be on a long wait while this occurs. It is better to have more friends in this world, and the maritime order, as flawed as it is, is your best bet\u2014work with allies and friends through international institutions to coordinate against these \u201ccrazy people.\u201d\n\nThat summarizes what I had to say today. Thank you for taking time late in the day to listen to me talk, talk, talk. I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you all might have.\n\n---\n\n# Question and Answer Session\n\n**Moderator:**\n\n[Applause] Okay, we\u2019re going to pass out the pop quizzes, and nobody gets home unless you get an 80. No quiz, but if you have any questions, we\u2019ve got time for about one or two, and I\u2019ll hang around afterwards.\n\n---\n\n## Question 1: On Bush Senior and U.S. Long-Term Strategy\n\n**Sir Matt Young (Army):**\n\nBush wins in Iraq, then presides over the closing of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall, then he\u2019s immediately not reelected. What does that say about us as the United States and our ability to focus long-term on any type of geopolitical strategy?\n\n**Dr. Paine:**\n\nThe question is: Bush Senior, who very successfully negotiates the end of the Cold War, then is very promptly not reelected\u2014what does this say about us? A lot of things are not visible until the fullness of time. For instance, I wondered about whether we were in another Cold War, and a decade in, I can tell you\u2014particularly with Putin\u2019s invasion in 2022\u2014I believe absolutely, maybe I\u2019ll be wrong, but whereas in 2012, you\u2019d go \u201cEh,\u201d and then in 2014, it looks more like it.\n\nA lot of it takes time, and a lot of the decisions we all make\u2014both good and bad\u2014take a long time for their implications to be felt. For instance, President Eisenhower invests in the highway system; part of the idea was to have highways wide enough so you could land planes anywhere you want. Actually, what that does is allow economic development all over the U.S., but it takes a long time for all that to happen. Recently, there\u2019s been a lot of investment in internet, right, to get internet to all the rest of the country. We\u2019ll see whether that has any implications; it\u2019ll be ten years before we know if it was a big nothing sandwich or not.\n\nForeign policy: Americans focus on domestic policy. What Americans don\u2019t understand today is that their security depends on this maritime order. Think about it: you take your little piece of plastic and go wherever in the world, and you use it to buy things. They give you the goods and even give you the plastic back. That only works in a rules-based order. We take it for granted that when you sign a contract, it\u2019s honored; if not, you\u2019d have to send armies and do gunboat diplomacy\u2014how expensive. Your security depends on the maritime order. I don\u2019t think Americans today have a clue about it, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m out here lecturing. I think it\u2019s important you understand this; what decisions you make afterwards is your business.\n\n---\n\n## Question 2: On Generational Experience and Learning\n\n**Bron Nel (U.S. Court):**\n\nThanks for your lecture and your discussion of the greatest generation, their formative experience of two catastrophic, paradigm-changing world wars, and how that set the stage for their Cold War strategy. I\u2019m wondering: when we try to extract lessons from the first Cold War for the second, are there changes we need to account for, since it kind of snuck up on us?\n\n**Dr. Paine:**\n\nThe question is about the greatest generation\u2014whether it requires a catastrophic event to come up with good ideas, and how we need to think about things to deal with the second Cold War. I have a question about human beings: I don\u2019t know if people require a catastrophic disaster to get real. The Marshall Plan, for example\u2014big bucks, and there\u2019s no way you would have gotten Americans to agree to that after World War I. After WWI, it was all about collecting debts. Then after WWII, we maybe should have collected more, but it would have been so much cheaper. The question is, do we require catastrophe to get real? I hope not, but hope isn\u2019t a strategy.\n\nSecond: your generation is tremendously important, especially for those of you who are veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq\u2014you have important lived experience about what works and doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re the greatest generation or the next one in the making, but if you can make wise decisions and learn from your experience\u2014and I urge you to publish; this is how one generation passes the baton to the next. Write down your experiences and analyze them; you can write short things in military journals your peers will see\u2014it\u2019s important.\n\nWe\u2019re in dangerous times; Americans need to stop fighting with each other, treat each other with respect, kindness, and honesty, and work together. If we do scorched earth on ourselves and our allies, that is a strategy of suicide\u2014and others will gladly assist us if we play that game. Thank you very much."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"967ef1185ca73dd8-SIN","message_type":"continue","model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"3b6fd38b-6743-484c-b195-c5779d82fcad","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3b6fd38b-6743-484c-b195-c5779d82fcad","children":[]}}}
