Here are the main types:\n\n1. **Red Dwarfs (M-type stars):**\n   - **Characteristics:** These stars are the smallest and coolest type of main-sequence stars. They have masses between about 0.08 and 0.6 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures below 4,000 K.\n   - **Lifespan:** Red dwarfs can burn their hydrogen fuel very slowly, allowing them to last from tens of billions to even trillions of years. Their stable and long-lived energy output makes them excellent candidates for stable, long-term energy sources.\n\n2. **K-type stars (Orange Dwarfs):**\n   - **Characteristics:** These stars have masses between about 0.6 and 0.8 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 3,900 and 5,200 K.\n   - **Lifespan:** K-type stars have stable lifespans ranging from 17 to 70 billion years, making them stable energy sources over geological timescales.\n\n3. **G-type stars (Yellow Dwarfs, like the Sun):**\n   - **Characteristics:** These stars have masses between about 0.8 and 1.2 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 5,300 and 6,000 K.\n   - **Lifespan:** G-type stars, including our Sun, have stable main-sequence lifespans of about 10 billion years. While they eventually become less stable as they age and evolve off the main sequence, they provide stable energy output for most of their lifespan.\n\nThese stars provide relatively stable energy outputs due to the stable hydrogen fusion processes occurring in their cores during their main-sequence phase. The stability and longevity of these stars make them excellent candidates for considering long-term energy stability in astronomical and astrobiological contexts."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"80276f52-5977-49c4-a769-79c13be703af","request_id":"89b4c133af139e2e-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"80276f52-5977-49c4-a769-79c13be703af","children":["aaa2bc13-369f-43ed-8d2f-8c3790e167f8"]},"aaa2bc13-369f-43ed-8d2f-8c3790e167f8":{"id":"aaa2bc13-369f-43ed-8d2f-8c3790e167f8","message":{"id":"aaa2bc13-369f-43ed-8d2f-8c3790e167f8","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719652654.860161,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What are the typical sizes of Red Dwarfs stars?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"89b4d301bd3a9f85-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"550652b3-a3a8-414e-bde0-805dc4540026","children":["78dbd53c-e605-46e3-8f36-086292618fad"]},"78dbd53c-e605-46e3-8f36-086292618fad":{"id":"78dbd53c-e605-46e3-8f36-086292618fad","message":{"id":"78dbd53c-e605-46e3-8f36-086292618fad","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719652661.277865,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Red dwarf stars are the smallest and coolest type of main-sequence stars.
