In order to help the public better understand the devel\ufffeopments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest quantifying standard levels of autonomy and\r\nnovelty of AI-assisted results, as well as propose a novel concept of human-AI interaction cards for\r\ntransparency. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics.\r\n1. Introduction\r\nRecent years have witnessed rapid progress in the reasoning capabilities of natural language-based\r\nAI in competition mathematics (Luong et al., 2025). Notably, AI models have already achieved gold\ufffemedal performance in the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) (Luong and Lockhart,\r\n2025), widely regarded as the world\u2019s premier mathematics competition. This milestone motivates\r\na fundamental question regarding AI-driven scientific discovery: can AI autonomously discover and\r\nprove new mathematical theorems? Transitioning from contest to research mathematics presents\r\nsignificant challenges. Unlike self-contained competition problems, research questions require syn\ufffethesizing advanced techniques from an extensive body of literature. This poses a major hurdle for\r\nfoundation or large language models, which often hallucinate and exhibit only a superficial under\ufffestanding of specialized topics\u2014limitations likely stemming from a scarcity of relevant training data.\r\nTo explore this challenge, we developed Aletheia, a math research agent that can iteratively gen\ufffeerate, verify, and revise solutions end-to-end in natural language. Aletheia is powered by three\r\nmain sources: (i) an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think (Deep Think team, 2025) for tack\ufffeling extremely hard reasoning problems, (ii) a novel inference-time scaling law that extends from\r\nOlympiad-level problems to PhD-level exercises, and (iii) intensive tool use such as Google Search\r\nand web browsing to navigate the complexities of mathematical research.

However, for the vast majority of mathematics research results, only a few\r\nexperts are equipped to properly evaluate their novelty and significance.

Aletheia agent: From Olympiads to Research-level Mathematics\r\nThis section outlines the methodological framework utilized in the development of agents capable of\r\naddressing research-grade mathematics. There are many challenges involved in transferring capabil\ufffeities from contest problem-solving to mathematics research. While IMO problems require ingenuity,\r\ntheir solutions usually span only a few pages and rely only on standard theorems from the high\r\nschool curriculum. By contrast, research-level mathematics draws on advanced techniques from vast\r\nliterature, with papers often spanning dozens of pages. Human mathematicians, even IMO medal\ufffeists, usually take many years of postgraduate study to reach the frontier of mathematical research.\r\nWhile foundation models possess a large knowledge base from pretraining, their understanding of\r\nadvanced subjects remains superficial due to data scarcity, and they are also prone to hallucinations.\r\nFigure 1 | Overview of Aletheia, a math research agent powered by Deep Think that can iteratively\r\ngenerate, verify, and revise for research-level math problems.\r\nTo address these issues, we built a math research agent, internally codenamed Aletheia, on top of\r\nGemini Deep Think. Aletheia include three subagents, a (solution) Generator, a Verifier, and a Reviser\r\nthat interact continuously until a solution is found that the Verifier approves, or until the attempts\r\nreach a preset (hyperparameter) limit. The subagent orchestration is sketched in Figure 1. In turn,\r\neach of the three subagents involves internal orchestration of calls to a Gemini base model.\r\n4\r\nIn fact, one such \u2018Open\u2019 problem (Erd\u0151s-397, posed in 1980) was eventually discovered to be nearly identical to\r\na problem on the 2012 Team Selection Test for the Chinese IMO team (Art of Problem Solving Community, 2012), a\r\n(challenging) exam for high school students; we exclude it from our classification since we consider the solution to be\r\nalready in the literature.\r\n3","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 35>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://6021fe2f22d01ff#file_0000000089787206a2fe794b75e31893#p_2.jpg","size_bytes":147452,"width":512,"height":1024,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n(a) IMO-Proof Bench Advanced (Olympiad Level). (b) FutureMath Basic (Ph.D. Level Exercises).\r\nFigure 2 | The latest advanced version of Deep Think, as of Jan 2026, has significantly\r\noutperformed the IMO-Gold version (Jul 2025) on Olympiad-level problems. The inference-time\r\nscaling law also transfers to PhD-level exercises. Aletheia makes further leaps in terms of reasoning\r\nquality with lower inference-time compute. All results were graded by human experts.\r\nIn contrast to AlphaGeometry (Chervonyi et al., 2025; Trinh et al., 2024) and AlphaProof (Hubert\r\net al., 2025), that use formal language, Aletheia operates end-to-end in natural language. At the\r\nsame time, designs similar to Aletheia have been demonstrated elsewhere. For example, Huang\u2013\r\nYang (Huang and Yang, 2025) showed that a manually crafted solver-verifier harness could boost\r\nGPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or Grok 4 to Gold Medal performance on the 2025 IMO. Another example is\r\nthe FullProof system5 built by Salafatinos (Bryan et al., 2026), which is another mathematics specific\r\nresearch agent incorporating a separate informal verifier mechanism.\r\n2.1. Scaling Laws and the Evolution of Deep Think\r\nWe first discuss some empirical findings about inference time scaling laws for Olympiad-level and\r\nPhD-level problems, which underlie the development of Deep Think. To investigate the inference\r\nscaling behavior, we evaluated different advanced versions of Gemini Deep Think (Deep Think team,\r\n2025). Since Deep Think leverages parallel thinking to explore multiple ideas at once, we were able\r\nto flexibly adjust the amount of compute spent at inference time. To ensure that results were not\r\ncherry-picked, we ran the model exactly once for each problem at each compute scale, with tool use\r\ndisabled, and the outputs are carefully graded according to the grading guideline.\r\nFor Olympiad level, we leveraged the the advanced subset of IMO-Proof Bench (Luong et al., 2025)\r\nwhich consists of 30 problems similar in difficulty and problem style to those found at the IMO.\r\nThis was the benchmark used during our IMO 2025 preparation; ultimately, an advanced version\r\nof Gemini Deep Think achieved a gold-medal standard at the IMO in July 2025, perfectly solving\r\nfive out of six problems (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Benchmarking our systems on IMO-Proof Bench\r\nhelped us understand which systems were most promising.

The compute required to achieve equiva\ufffelent performance on IMO-Proof Bench was reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude (100x).\r\n5The authors were not aware of this work until after the results of this paper were collected.\r\n4","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 35>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://67660d0eece66e5#file_0000000089787206a2fe794b75e31893#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":165864,"width":512,"height":1024,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\nSpecifically, utilizing extreme scale and simple prompting, Gemini Deep Think (advanced version,\r\nJan 2026), without internet access, demonstrated the potential to solve exceptionally difficult reason\ufffeing tasks such as IMO 2025 Problem 6 (see Appendix B), that our previous IMO-gold model failed\r\nto solve. Notably, the latest model also solved IMO 2024 Problem 3 with a minor mistake (achieved\r\nat 2\r\n7\r\nscale) and completely solved Problem 5 (at 2\r\n8\r\nscale) (see Appendix C)\r\n6\r\n.\r\nTo further assess the readiness of our models for research-grade mathematics, we evaluated on\r\nFutureMath Basic, an internal benchmark designed to test PhD-level mathematics knowledge. We\r\ngive an example of a FutureMath benchmark problem in appendix \u00a7A. Figure 2b demonstrated similar\r\nscaling law for PhD-level problems, though with significantly lower accuracy compared to the com\ufffepetition problems. Corroborating these quantitative results, expert mathematicians who assessed\r\nthe model noted that its susceptibility to mistakes and hallucinations inhibited its effectiveness on\r\nthe longer, more complex reasoning required for research. With these findings, we concluded that\r\ninference-time scaling alone would not be sufficient, and we shifted our focus towards further im\ufffeproving and adapting our systems for research-level math.\r\n2.2. Developing Agentic Harnesses for Research-Level Math\r\nThe design of Aletheia is motivated by an empirical observation: decoupling a reasoning model\u2019s final\r\noutput from its intermediate thinking tokens, and adding well-chosen prompt scaffolding, enables\r\nthe model to recognize flaws it initially overlooked during generation. One possible explanation\r\nfor this phenomenon is that the training process incentivizes the model to guess or bluff. Another\r\nhypothesis is that an extended thinking trace might act as misleading \u201csupporting\u201d context, artificially\r\ninflating the conditional probability of an erroneous solution.\r\nRegardless of the underlying mechanism, we observed that explicitly separating out the verifi\ufffecation step is effective in practice. Figure 2 depicts Aletheia\u2019s performance relative to Gemini Deep\r\nThink, the agent that achieved the 2025 IMO Gold Medal standard (Luong and Lockhart, 2025).\r\nDue to its dynamic nature, Aletheia\u2019s total inference compute cannot be precisely controlled, but\r\nthe results indicate that Aletheia outperforms Deep Think at similar (and indeed, larger) compute\r\nscales. On IMO-Proof Bench Advanced, Aletheia achieved a 95.1% overall score, surpassing Deep\r\nThink across all tested compute scales using the same base model (Figure 2a). Moreover, on the\r\n29 out of 30 problems where Aletheia actually returned a solution, its conditional accuracy reached\r\n98.3%. On the FutureMath Basic (Figure 2b), Aletheia again outperformed Deep Think at all compute\r\nscales on the same base model. Notably, it returned solutions for fewer than 60% of these problems,\r\nand its conditional accuracy on the answered subset exceeded 82%. Thanks to its verification mech\ufffeanism, Aletheia often admits failure to solve a problem, a key feature that improved the efficiency of\r\nour human-AI research collaborations.\r\n2.3. Importance of Tool Use\r\nBeyond its foundational natural language verifier, Aletheia relies heavily on tool use to navigate the\r\ncomplexities of mathematical research. We find that a foundation model operating without such tools\r\nis prone to frequent hallucinations\u2014primarily in the form of spurious citations (see Figure 3 for an\r\nexample), and to a lesser extent, computational inaccuracies. In contrast to the structured, bounded\r\nnature of IMO problems, mathematical research requires synthesizing published literature to address\r\nbroader, open-ended questions. We observed that simply granting internet access is insufficient;\r\n6We caution that the model\u2019s knowledge cutoff falls between IMO 2024 and IMO 2025, implying possible exposure\r\nto the IMO 2024 problems. Additionally, as IMO 2025 has been public for six months, we do not claim the problem was\r\nstrictly unseen. We report these findings to transparently demonstrate the potential of our new Gemini Deep Think model.\r\n5","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\nhowever, when our model was extensively trained for tool use, the integration of Google Search\r\nand web browsing led to a substantial reduction in obvious citation hallucinations with fictitious\r\ntitles and/or authors. This shifted citation errors to subtler hallucinations, for example where the\r\nreference exists but its results are not quoted properly (as illustrated in Figure 4).\r\nPerhaps unexpectedly, our results indicate that the integration of Python as a tool yielded only\r\nmarginal improvements in mitigating computational hallucinations. This suggests that the baseline\r\nproficiency of Gemini in these specific tasks is already high; consequently, further performance gains\r\nmay require more specialized or sophisticated tools beyond standard code execution.\r\nSample Interaction\r\nPrompt: Prove or disprove: the pretzel knot \ud835\udc43(\u22123, 5, 13) has infinite order in the smooth\r\nconcordance group.\r\nModel output:\r\n\u2026\r\nProof.

Summary of Mathematical Research Results\r\nBelow we will briefly summarize the papers with substantial contributions from Aletheia that have\r\nalready been publicly released. Due to timing, these results were obtained by Aletheia with a base\r\nmodel that was intermediate between the two base models depicted in Figure 2.\r\nTo be clear, the final versions of these papers were all written by human authors, starting\r\nfrom Aletheia\u2019s outputs. This was due to the principle held by the human authors involved that\r\nresearch papers should be authored exclusively by humans, even when AI contributions reach a level\r\n6","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\nthat would traditionally merit co-authorship. The primary reason is that authorship of a mathematics\r\npaper implies accountability for all of its contents, and this is a responsibility that only humans can\r\nbear. We emphasize that beyond mathematical correctness, authors also assume accountability for\r\nimportant aspects of exposition such as adequacy and accuracy of attributions, which cannot be\r\nguaranteed by formal verification.\r\n3.1. Milestone A: Reliable Autonomous Research\r\nThe paper Eigenweights for Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality (Feng26) resolves a problem that\r\narose in the work of Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang (FYZ26) investigating an extension of the celebrated Hirze\ufffebruch Proportionality Principle (Hir58).\r\nThe backdrop. Hirzebruch\u2019s original Proportionality Principle expresses the Chern numbers\r\nof an automorphic vector bundle on a compact locally symmetric space as a multiple of the corre\ufffesponding Chern numbers on the compact dual variety, with a proportionality constant that can be\r\ninterpreted as a value of the \ud835\udc3f-function for the associated Gross motive (Gro97). This formula was\r\nlater generalized to non-compact locally symmetric spaces by Mumford (Mum77).\r\nRecent work by Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang (FYZ26) studies a variant of this principle, called \u201cArithmetic\r\nHirzebruch Proportionality\u201d, relating the \u201carithmetic volume\u201d of Chern classes on moduli spaces of\r\nshtukas to differential operators applied to the \ud835\udc3f-function of Gross motives. It can be seen as a\r\ngeneralization of Gaitsgory\u2013Lurie\u2019s resolution of Weil\u2019s Tamagawa Number Conjecture (GL14). The\r\nprecise differential operator appearing in Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality is governed by cer\ufffetain fundamental structure constants called eigenweights. In (FYZ26), the authors calculated some\r\nexamples of eigenweights, but did not know how to determine all of them in closed form.\r\nThe story of the paper. In fact, this project began almost incidentally, while tracking partial\r\nprogress on a problem that was submitted to an internal benchmark: the computation of a particular\r\nfamily of eigenweights (whose answer was already known to Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang). Initially no model\r\ncould solve it, but clear progress was visible as inference time computation was scaled, until the\r\neventual IMO Gold model found the correct answer. Upon examining the AI-generated solution, the\r\nauthors of (FYZ26) preferred it over their original one, leading them to replace the original proofs\r\nin their paper.\r\nThis success encouraged us to task Aletheia with calculating the eigenweights in general. Without\r\nany human intervention, Aletheia found an elegant way to do this, using techniques from a different\r\nfield of mathematics7 unfamiliar to the authors of (FYZ26), and in the process resolved several\r\nquestions left open in (FYZ26). This is the subject of the paper (Feng26), which is notable in that\r\nall of the mathematical content is fully generated by AI. While our ultimate goal is to empower\r\nhuman mathematicians with AI tools, we note the ability to generate correct results without human\r\nintervention as an important milestone for reliability and trustworthiness of natural language models.\r\n3.2. Milestone B: Lower Bounds for Multivariate Independence Polynomials\r\nThe paper Lower bounds for multivariate independence polynomials and their generalisations (LeeSeo26)\r\nestablishes new mathematical inequalities that link the world of physics with the logic of discrete\r\nmathematics.\r\nThe backdrop. In physics, scientists often model how gas molecules occupy a space by imag\ufffeining them as points on a network. Because these molecules naturally repel one another, no two\r\n7Namely, algebraic combinatorics.\r\n7","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\nmolecules can occupy \u201cneighboring\u201d spots that are directly connected. Mathematicians call these\r\nvalid arrangements independent sets, and they are a cornerstone of understanding complex systems\r\nin both physics and mathematics.\r\nThe story of the paper. Joonkyung Lee and Jaehyeon Seo first used Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to\r\nprove the key inequality needed to obtain a further generalization of a well-known result by Sah\u2013\r\nSawhney\u2013Stoner\u2013Zhao (SSSZ19) on the lower bound for the number of (weighted) independent\r\nsets.8 Encouraged by this success, they tackled an even harder problem: modeling systems where\r\ntwo different types of molecules interact at the same time, such that different types do not repel each\r\nother. For this deeper challenge, Aletheia provided9 a high-level roadmap of insightful ideas that the\r\nauthors then turned into a complete, rigorous proof.\r\nThe interesting feature here is that the workflow was somewhat reversed from the usual nar\uffferative of human-AI collaboration. Typical human-AI workflows involve decomposing a project into\r\ngranular technical queries for the model to resolve. But in this project, Aletheia actually gave the\r\n\u201cbigger picture\u201d strategy for a deep result\u2013such as suggesting the use of specific \u201cdual sets\u201d\u2014leaving\r\nthe human authors to fill in the rigorous execution. In some parts, the authors retained only the\r\nstatements provided by the AI and produced the proofs independently, as if they were inspired by\r\nthe model\u2019s vision.\r\n3.3. Milestone C: The Erd\u0151s Problems\r\nErd\u0151s was a prolific Hungarian mathematician who left a vast legacy of papers and unsolved conjec\ufffetures. In 2023, Thomas Bloom launched ErdosProblems.com, a centralized repository designed to\r\ncatalog these conjectures and track their resolutions. At the time of this writing, the database tracks\r\n1,179 problems, with 483 (41%) classified as solved. We stress, however, that the \u201cOpen\u201d status of\r\na problem in this database does not always reflect the true state of the literature.\r\nRecently, AI managed to solve a few problems marked \u201cOpen\u201d in Bloom\u2019s database. While some\r\nof these solutions were later discovered to already exist in the literature, others appear to be gen\ufffeuinely novel. To systematically document these advancements, Terence Tao (Tao, 2026) established\r\na community wiki dedicated to tracking AI-assisted progress on Erd\u0151s\u2019s conjectures.\r\nBecause only success cases tend to be reported in public forums, these results do not provide a\r\ncomplete picture of AI capability. In order to understand this better, we initiated a case study on\r\nthe Erd\u0151s problems in early December, 2025. From December 2\u20139, we deployed Aletheia against the\r\n700 Erd\u0151s problems then marked as \u201cOpen\u201d in Bloom\u2019s database. Aletheia\u2019s informal verifier mecha\ufffenism streamlined the initial pool of candidates: of the 700 original prompts, the model returned 212\r\nresponses as potentially correct. These candidates were then evaluated by a team of mathematicians.\r\nMost were not experts in the relevant problem domain, so we prioritized narrowing the pool of can\ufffedidate solutions quickly (possibly at the cost of making noisier judgments) to a manageable size for\r\nour smaller core of domain experts. This step was essentially completed by December 21. Then our\r\ninternal domain experts vetted the solutions carefully, consulting external experts when correctness\r\nwas ascertained but novelty was unclear. In some cases, minor inaccuracies in the solutions were\r\ncorrected.\r\nOur ultimate findings were that 63 solutions were technically correct, but only 13 solutions cor\uffferectly addressed the intended problem statement (either by invoking the literature, or by a novel\r\nargument). The remaining 50 of Aletheia\u2019s correct solutions were technically valid but mathemati\ufffe8Other models were also able to solve the problem: Gemini Deep Think, Aletheia, and\u2014with some back and forth\u2014\r\nGPT-5 Pro.\r\n9Other models were tasked with the same prompt, but Aletheia\u2019s output was the only one that the authors found useful.\r\n8","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\ncally vacuous, because the problem statements were interpreted in a way that did not capture Erd\u0151s\u2019s\r\nintent, often (but not always) leading to trivial solutions. Finally, 12 of the responses were marked\r\nambiguous, for example due to open-endedness of the question itself. In summary, out of the 200\r\nsolution candidates that we were definitely able to mark correct or incorrect, 137 (68.5%) of the\r\nresponses were fundamentally flawed, while 63 (31.5%) of the responses were technically correct,\r\nof which only 13 (6.5%) were meaningfully correct. These 13 meaningfully correct results clustered\r\nnaturally into four categories which we felt should be distinguished; see Table 2 for a summary.\r\nAutonomous Resolution. On these problems, Aletheia found the first correct solution (as far as we\r\ncan tell) in a mathematically substantive way. These include Erd\u0151s-652 and Erd\u0151s-1051.\r\nPartial AI Solution. On these problems, there were multiple questions and Aletheia found the first\r\ncorrect solution to one of the questions. These include Erd\u0151s-654, and Erd\u0151s-1040.\r\nIndependent Rediscovery. On these problems, Aletheia found a correct solution, but human au\ufffeditors subsequently found an independent solution already in the literature. These include\r\nErd\u0151s-397, Erd\u0151s-659, Erd\u0151s-935, and Erd\u0151s-1089. The solutions appear to have been in\ufffedependently rediscovered by our model: we scanned the logs of Aletheia\u2019s reasoning trace to\r\nensure that the solution was not pulled directly from the literature solution.10\r\nLiterature Identification. On these problems, Aletheia found that a solution was already explicitly\r\nin the literature, despite the problem being marked \u201cOpen\u201d on Bloom\u2019s website at the time\r\nof model deployment. These include Erd\u0151s-333, Erd\u0151s-591, Erd\u0151s-705, Erd\u0151s-992, Erd\u0151s\ufffe1105.\r\nTo be clear, we make no claims of novelty for the latter two categories. The \u20184\u2019 autonomous solutions\r\ncited above refer to Erd\u0151s-652, Erd\u0151s-654, Erd\u0151s-935, Erd\u0151s-1040, and Erd\u0151s-1051. In the es\ufffetimation of our experts, none of the four individually rises to the level of a research paper. The\r\nsolution to Erd\u0151s-1051 was generalized further, in a collaborative effort by Aletheia together with\r\nhuman mathematicians and Gemini Deep Think, to produce the research paper (BKKKZ26).\r\nClassification Description Instances\r\nAutonomous\r\nResolution\r\nAutonomous novel solution. 652*\r\n, 1051\r\nPartial AI\r\nSolution\r\nSolved some part of a multi-part problem. 654, 1040\r\nIndependent\r\nRediscovery\r\nFound a correct solution later discovered to exist in\r\nthe literature. 397*\r\n, 659*\r\n, 935, 1089\r\nLiterature\r\nIdentification\r\nIdentified that the problem was already solved in the\r\nliterature.\r\n333*\r\n, 591, 705,\r\n992, 1105\r\nTable 2 | Taxonomy of Aletheia results on Erd\u0151s problems. *\r\nIndependently obtained by other parties\r\nafter our initial evaluations were conducted, but prior to the publishing of this work.\r\n10It is of course possible that the solution was indirectly ingested from the literature solution, either implicitly through\r\nintermediate sources or during pretraining. This highlights a new danger that accompanies AI-generated mathematics: it\r\nis susceptible to \u201csubconscious plagiarism\u201d by reproducing knowledge acquired during pretraining, without attribution.\r\n9","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 10 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\nContextualizing the results. A disclaimer is necessary regarding the novelty of these results on\r\nErd\u0151s problems. While we made considerable efforts to review the literature, it is certainly possi\ufffeble that we missed earlier solutions to these problems by human mathematicians. Therefore, our\r\ninitial classification into categories is, at best, an upper bound on novelty. It is subject to revision\r\nafter further investigation by the public. Indeed, previous AI-assisted work on Erd\u0151s problems 1026,\r\n397, 333, and 281 was discovered, after initial announcements of novelty, be redundant with the\r\nliterature11. To the outside observer, this may present a misleading impression of mathematics re\ufffesearch: in the authors\u2019 experience, it is very unusual for human-generated results to be redundant\r\nin this manner (in the modern era of communication). One reason why it seems to be happening so\r\nfrequently with AI-generated work on Erd\u0151s problems is that the solutions are so simple that they\r\nwould not necessarily attract attention if they originated from humans. For instance, Erd\u0151s-1089\r\nis answered by an offhand remark in a 1981 paper (Bannai and Bannai, 1981), where the authors\r\nseemed unaware that they had resolved an Erd\u0151s problem. Our takeaway from this experience is\r\nthat many open Erd\u0151s problems remained unresolved out of obscurity rather than difficulty. We\r\nstress that the mathematical significance of such resolutions can only be accurately evaluated by expert\r\nmathematicians, even if the correctness can be ascertained by non-mathematicians or formal verifiers.\r\nSee (Feng et al., 2026a) for further discussion.\r\n3.4. Bounds for Polynomial Dyadics\r\nThe paper Strongly Polynomial Policy Iteration for \ud835\udc3f\u221e Robust MDPs by Asadi\u2013Chatterjee\u2013Goharshady\u2013\r\nKarrabi\u2013Montaseri\u2013Pagano (ACGKMP26) proves complexity bounds for certain algorithms arising in\r\nMachine Learning and Game Theory called \u201cRobust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\u201d. For this\r\npaper, Aletheia provided an improvement to a crucial mathematical ingredient.\r\nThe backdrop. This work was originally a project of Asadi\u2013Chatterjee\u2013Goharshady\u2013Karrabi\u2013\r\nMontaseri, a team of computer scientists at ISTA. They were able to prove the desired strongly\ufffepolynomial time bound on Robust MDPs conditionally on a number-theoretic assertion: that specific\r\nbounded combinations of numbers are in polynomially many dyadic intervals. They reached out to\r\nnumber theorists for help, and eventually the problem arrived at Pagano, who, after some effort,\r\ncould prove the desired complexity bound using a relatively advanced result from Number Theory\r\ncalled Siegel\u2019s Lemma (a tool that does not immediately appear related to the question). Pagano\r\nshared the problem with several colleagues and some of them eventually found variants of the argu\ufffement leading to the same complexity bound. The result was sufficient for the intended algorithmic\r\napplication, but the optimality of the bounds was unclear.\r\nThe story of the paper. Pagano also contributed the problem to an internal benchmark, where\r\nthe IMO Gold version of Deep Think provided a valid solution. However, Aletheia devised an indepen\ufffedent argument (also making creative use of Siegel\u2019s Lemma) that achieved the best bound among all\r\nhuman and autonomous attempts. In particular, this significantly improved the bound established\r\noriginally by Pagano and the other mathematicians. Therefore, this argument was adopted for the\r\neventual publication.\r\n4. Analysis\r\n4.1.

Weaknesses of AI\r\nThe results of this paper should not be interpreted as suggesting that AI can consistently solve\r\nresearch-level mathematics questions. In fact, our anecdotal experience is the opposite: success\r\ncases are rare, and an apt intuition for autonomous capabilities (and limitations) may currently be\r\nimportant for finding such cases. The papers (ACGKMP26; Feng26; LeeSeo26) grew out of spon\ufffetaneous positive outcomes in a wider benchmarking effort on research-level problems; for most of\r\nthese problems, no autonomous progress was made.\r\nThe case study (Feng et al., 2026a) on the Erd\u0151s problems offers a more quantitative picture.\r\nTable 5 illustrates the success rate on the 200 solution candidates that we were able to mark Correct or\r\nIncorrect (filtered from 700 open problems).

Finally, we reiterate that hallucination is still a common failure mode. Even with internet search\r\ncapability to check references, the model tends to fabricate or misrepresent results from legitimate\r\nreferences in order to assert a solution (see Figure 4 for an example).\r\nWe identify several qualitative gaps between current autonomous mathematics research and\r\nhuman-generated research. To date, autonomous results have been relatively brief and elementary\r\nin comparison to typical human papers. Furthermore, success cases seem to arise from clever tech\ufffenical manipulations or vast knowledge retrieval, rather than what mathematicians would consider\r\nto be genuine creativity, although the latter concept is admittedly subjective.\r\n5. Representing AI contributions to mathematics\r\nMathematics provides a domain that is\u2014at least superficially\u2014analogous to game-playing, making\r\nit a highly attractive target for AI researchers. In mathematics there is a near-universal consensus on\r\nstarting points (mathematical axioms) and atomic moves (valid mathematical deductions), and a rich\r\nlandscape of objectives (precise theorems and conjectures). However, the extreme difficulty and spe\ufffecialization of frontier mathematics research makes performance evaluation exceptionally challenging.\r\nFor a given research problem, there may be only a handful of mathematicians in the world equipped\r\nto evaluate a potential solution, and such evaluations can take tremendous effort. (For example, in\r\nmathematics the peer review process typically exceeds a year, and it is common for research papers\r\nto surpass 100 pages in length.) Even given a solution that is known to be correct, perhaps through\r\nformal verification, it could be difficult for an outside observer to distinguish a major advance from\r\na triviality.\r\nThis evaluation gap has enabled a surge in hyperbolic or misleading messaging regarding AI\ufffegenerated mathematical content. Instead of using academic publishing venues with vetting and\r\nreview by professional mathematicians, such claims are often propagated through social media chan\ufffenels. While AI proponents have obvious incentives to exaggerate the mathematical capabilities of AI,\r\na somewhat perverse incentive has also arisen for mathematicians to overstate the contribution of\r\nAI to their own work, because doing so leads to a significant increase in publicity and attention.\r\nMoreover, misinformation propagates easily in this domain because the audience is ill-equipped to\r\nevaluate the claims.\r\nSince we are developing tools for AI-assisted mathematics research, we also felt a responsibility\r\nto contribute to the discussion on responsible documentation, evaluation and communication of AI\ufffegenerated results. In order to inform our thinking, we held a discussion with several mathematicians\r\nto understand the concerns of the mathematical community regarding AI.13 One of the dominant\r\nthemes of the discussion was the desire for transparency, both about the role of the AI and the\r\n13Mathematicians consulted (outside those among the authors of this paper) included Jarod Alper\u2605\r\n, Kevin Barreto,\r\n12","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\ntechnical importance of AI-assisted results. Motivated by this, we will define one possible framework\r\nfor describing autonomous mathematics, and contextualize our own results within it for illustration.\r\nThis should be considered as only a starting point in a broader discussion of responsible scientific\r\ncommunication. If any such standards are to be universally adopted, they must arise organically\r\nfrom the mathematical community.\r\n5.1. Autonomous Mathematics Levels\r\nAutonomous driving is classified according to standard \u201cLevels\u201d, measuring the degree of autonomy,\r\ndefined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). A meaningful taxonomy of autonomous math\ufffeematics should have at least two dimensions, with one axis for the level of autonomy and another for\r\nthe level of mathematical significance14. Maintaining a coarse division while preserving essential\r\ndistinctions would minimize subjective disputes. We divide our own results into three broad levels\r\nof autonomy, described in Table 6.\r\nLevel Level Description\r\nH\r\nPrimarily Human\r\n(secondary AI in\ufffeput)\r\nCore mathematical content is human-generated; AI contributions\r\nare minor or auxiliary (e.g., literature search, basic calculations,\r\nwriting routine proofs which the human author could have sup\ufffeplied) if any.\r\nC\r\nHuman-AI\r\nCollaboration\r\nA substantive human-AI collaboration where both parties con\ufffetribute in an essential way.\r\nA\r\nEssentially\r\nAutonomous\r\nThe core mathematical content is fully AI-generated without\r\nany essential human intervention. (Human authors are still ulti\ufffemately responsible for the final paper content.)\r\nTable 6 | Axis 1: Level of Autonomy. This axis quantifies the relative contribution between the\r\nhuman and AI agents.\r\n5.1.1. Discussion and Examples for Level of Autonomy.\r\nIn these terms, we consider the paper (Feng26) to be of Level A, as the human contribution is only\r\nin expository aspects, aside from posing the original questions. The results in (Feng et al., 2026a)\r\nare also of Level A insofar as the role of humans was only to correct minor inaccuracies. We consider\r\nthe papers (LeeSeo26) and (BKKKZ26) to be of Level C: both humans and AI contributed essential\r\naspects of the papers. We consider the papers (FYZ26) and (ACGKMP26) to be of Level H: while the\r\nwritten papers have non-trivial contributions from AI, these contributions form a minor portion of\r\nthe paper and the human authors could have supplied those parts themselves.\r\nEven with these broad subdivisions, there can be some ambiguity. A possible situation is that\r\ninteracting with AI leads human mathematicians to a key idea or reference, but the AI itself does not\r\ntruly make its own mathematical contribution. In other words, the AI contributes only via \u201cinspira\ufffetion\u201d. Although the research may not have happened without AI assistance, we would consider such\r\ninstances as Level H.\r\nSourav Chatterjee, Otis Chodosh, Michael Hutchings, Daniel Litt, Ciprian Manolescu, Mona Merling, Johannes Schmitt,\r\nRavi Vakil, Shengtong Zhang. \u2605Affiliated with Google DeepMind.\r\n14A similar example of such a division is in Epoch AI\u2019s FrontierMath open problems, which are rated as \u201cmoderately\r\ninteresting,\u201d \u201csolid result,\u201d \u201cmajor advance,\u201d or \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d (Epoch AI, 2026)\r\n13","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 14 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n5.1.2. Discussion and Examples for Level of Significance.\r\nWe emphasize at the outset that these Levels fail to capture the depth and diversity of human mathe\ufffematics research, and are only meant to contextualize autonomous contributions. Given the inherent\r\nsubjectivity of mathematical significance, and the proven difficulty of comparing the work of (hu\ufffeman) mathematicians, we felt that the Levels of Mathematical Significance should be coarse enough\r\nthat they do not differentiate human-generated research. A possible exception is that there is near\ufffeuniversal consensus on the top 5 journals in mathematics15, so it could make sense to anchor one\r\nlevel to them. One would expect to find major advances published in these journals; as far as we\r\nare aware, no autonomous result has yet come close to that standard. A final category could be\r\nreserved for truly landmark breakthroughs of once-in-a-generation stature.16 Although evident, it\r\nseems worth emphasizing that the Level of Mathematical Significance can only be evaluated by mathe\ufffematicians, who are moreover experts on the particular domain of the problem.\r\nLevel Significance Examples / Criteria\r\n0 Negligible novelty Suitable for Olympiad contests or Ph.D. student exercises.\r\n1 Minor novelty A new result, but the techniques and novelty do not meet the\r\nstandard for a professional research paper.\r\n2 Publication Grade\r\nPublishable in a research journal in good standing (that is not\r\nspecifically intended for students or expository articles), follow\ufffeing established peer-review practices.\r\n3\r\nMajor\r\nAdvance\r\nAt the highest level of typical human results; published in the top\r\n5 general-interest journals in mathematics.\r\n4\r\nLandmark\r\nBreakthrough\r\nA truly landmark breakthrough result of generational importance\r\nand influence.\r\nTable 7 | Axis 2: Mathematical Significance of Result. This axis measures how significant the\r\nmathematical result is, regardless of how it was produced.\r\nIn these terms, we view our solutions to Erd\u0151s-652, 654, 935, 1040 as Level A0, and our so\ufffelution to Erd\u0151s-1051 as Level A1. We view (Feng26) as Level A2, (BKKKZ26) and (LeeSeo26) as\r\nLevel C2, and (ACGKMP26) and (FYZ26) as Level H2. We reiterate that the variation within Level\r\n2 is deliberately wide to encompass the vast majority of papers written by professional mathemati\ufffecians, ranging from very minor to extremely influential works. This appears to be the only way to\r\navoid subjective disputes about human research. Because of the exceptional width of this category,\r\nthe public should not understand a paper of level C2 or A2 as indicating that AI tools have\r\nreached the level of human mathematicians. For example, we view our own results within Level\r\n2 (ACGKMP26; BKKKZ26; Feng26; FYZ26; LeeSeo26) as being very spread out in significance and\r\ndifficulty.\r\n5.2.

We note that, in a related direction, Tao has initiated an online discussion\r\nof \u201cbest practices for incorporating AI usage\u201d (Tao, 2024) for mathematicians.\r\n6. Reflections on the Impact of AI in Mathematics\r\nTo date, hype notwithstanding, the impact of artificial intelligence on pure mathematics research has\r\nbeen limited. While our results do solve some problems that seem to have eluded experts, they do not\r\nindicate that artificial intelligence has matched, or will match, the capabilities of human mathemati\ufffecians. Rather, they illustrate how certain comparative advantages of AI models over humans can be\r\nuseful for certain kinds of problems. This perhaps clarifies the directions where human researchers\r\ncan expect the most impact from AI in the near future.\r\nA first observation is that AI models exhibit a form of intelligence that diverges significantly from\r\nthat of human scientists. In any specific subject, frontier models have much shallower knowledge\r\nthan a domain expert, but they also possess superhuman breadth of knowledge, which could be the\r\nkey to unlocking certain problems. The simple fact that artificial intelligence differs from human\r\nintelligence presents the possibility that it is better suited for solving some types of problems, for\r\nexample those requiring vast memory, computation, or breadth of knowledge.\r\nAnother comparative strength of AI is that it is not constrained by human physical limitations. It\r\nis likely that many open questions lie within the reach of existing techniques, but are not resolved\r\nbecause of limited time and attention from the right experts, as demonstrated by our results on\r\nthe Erd\u0151s problems (Feng et al., 2026a). This reinforces the point that AI is bottlenecked by very\r\ndifferent factors compared to humans, which can be an advantage in the right context.\r\n16","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n7. Related Work\r\nAdvances in Mathematical Reasoning Recent advances in large language models have yielded\r\nsystems capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning (Deep Think team, 2025; OpenAI, 2025),\r\nmoving beyond standard benchmarks to competition-level problems. Notably, these models have\r\nachieved gold-medal standards at the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) (Luong and Lock\ufffehart, 2025) and demonstrated proficiency on difficult benchmarks like IMO-Proof Bench (Luong et al.,\r\n2025). New, more challenging benchmarks continue to emerge as the field shifts to focus on research\ufffelevel math (Glazer et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2025; Tao, 2026).\r\nAI-Assisted Research Results Already, AI has been successfully applied to assist mathematical re\ufffesearch. Examples include research on extremal descendant integrals on moduli spaces (Schmitt25),\r\nmotivic classes of genus zero maps (BEMSV26), and convergence rates for Nesterov\u2019s method (Jan\ufffegRyu25). Beyond these specific cases, AI has been used in other works across discrete analysis,\r\nconvex analysis, and combinatorics (IvanisviliXie25; Salim25). Other studies show AI is useful for\r\nsolving accessible conjectures or assisting with problems that require mathematical exploration (Feld\ufffemanKarbasi25; GGTW25). Even more broadly, (Woodruff et al., 2026) demonstrates a multitude of\r\ntechniques and case studies for AI-assisted research across several mathematics-adjacent domains,\r\nincluding theoretical computer science, economics, and physics.\r\nFrameworks for Human-AI Collaboration A variety of human-AI collaborative implementations\r\nhave emerged, ranging from fully agentic architectures with self-verification and refinement (Bryan\r\net al., 2026; Huang and Yang, 2025), to exploration methods such as AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al.,\r\n2025; Wang et al., 2025; Yuksekgonul et al., 2026), to more collaboration-focused methods such as\r\ninteractive protocols suggesting how to integrate AI as a research assistant (Henkel, 2025; Li et al.,\r\n2025). Despite the surge in attention (Bubeck et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), the community is\r\nstill in the early stages of adapting AI for mathematical research, making it essential to establish\r\ntransparent standards for how AI-generated mathematics is documented, evaluated, and communi\ufffecated.\r\n8. Conclusion\r\nUltimately, we believe that AI will become a tool that enhances rather than replaces mathematicians.\r\nCurrently, natural language models struggle to reason reliably without human intervention to correct\r\nmistakes and hallucinations, while formal verification systems are not yet capable of even formulating\r\nthe questions of interest on most research frontiers. For this reason, we have introduced specialized\r\nmath reasoning agents, incorporating informal natural language verification, to help mathematicians\r\nharness the benefits of AI.\r\nAcknowledgments.

Since \ud835\udc53\r\n\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc67\r\n\u22122 > 0, \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc67) is strictly convex on\r\n(0, 1).

Therefore, apart from the uniform\r\ndistribution \ud835\udc5d\r\n\u2217\r\n, the only candidate for a global maximum is a distribution with one large\r\ncomponent and \ud835\udc5e \u2212 1 small components: \ud835\udc5d = (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66, . . . , \ud835\udc66) with \ud835\udc65 + (\ud835\udc5e \u2212 1) \ud835\udc66 = 1.\r\nEliminating \ud835\udc66 =\r\n1\u2212\ud835\udc65\r\n\ud835\udc5e\u22121\r\n, the objective function restricted to this symmetric subspace becomes\r\na function of \ud835\udc65 \u2208 (0, 1):\r\n\u210e(\ud835\udc65) =\r\n\ud835\udefd\r\n2\r\n(\r\n\ud835\udc65\r\n2 +\r\n(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65)\r\n2\r\n\ud835\udc5e \u2212 1\r\n)\r\n\u2212 \ud835\udc65 log \ud835\udc65 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) log (\r\n1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\r\n\ud835\udc5e \u2212 1\r\n)\r\n.\r\nDetermination of the Critical Inverse Temperature\r\nFor \ud835\udc5e \u2265 3, the model undergoes a first-order phase transition (Wu, 1982).

Case Study: Solving IMO 2025 Problem 6\r\nWe consider the problem statement for IMO 2025 P6:\r\nConsider a 2025 \u00d7 2025 grid of unit squares. Matilda wishes to place on the grid some\r\nrectangular tiles, possibly of different sizes, such that each side of every tile lies on a grid\r\nline and every unit square is covered by at most one tile.\r\nDetermine the minimum number of tiles Matilda needs to place so that each row and\r\neach column of the grid has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any tile.\r\nWe initialized the session by providing Gemini Deep Think (advanced version, Jan 2026) with the\r\nraw problem statement only, excluding any context regarding its origin (IMO) or specific formatting\r\nconstraints. Consistent with standard competition rules, the model was evaluated in a restricted\r\nenvironment without access to the internet or external tools. We ran the model at extreme scale\r\n(equivalent to 2\r\n12 in Figure 2a) and obtained the following response:\r\nTo find the absolute minimum number of rectangular tiles Matilda needs to place, we\r\ncan model this problem using combinatorial geometry.\r\nSince each row and each column must contain exactly one uncovered unit square, there\r\nare exactly \ud835\udc41 = 2025 uncovered squares in total. We can treat these uncovered squares\r\nas \u201choles\u201d acting as obstacles in our 2025 \u00d7 2025 grid. Because no two holes share a row\r\nor a column, their coordinates perfectly correspond to an \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 permutation matrix.\r\nOur goal is to choose the optimal permutation of holes to minimize the number of non\ufffeoverlapping rectangular tiles required to perfectly cover the remaining \ud835\udc41\r\n2 \u2212 \ud835\udc41 squares.\r\n1. Theoretical Lower Bound\r\nWhen partitioning a rectilinear grid with \ud835\udc41 isolated holes into rectangles, each hole in\ufffetroduces internal reflex (concave) corners into the free space. Every reflex corner must\r\nbe resolved by the boundaries (cuts) of the rectangular tiles.\r\nBy analyzing the maximum number of non-intersecting internal cuts that can connect\r\nthese concave corners, a known theorem in discrete geometry (recently featured in the\r\nEuropean Girls\u2019 Mathematical Olympiad) dictates that for any arrangement of holes cor\uffferesponding to a permutation, the minimum number of rectangular tiles \ud835\udc47 required to\r\npartition the remaining grid is bounded by:\r\n\ud835\udc47 \u2265 \ud835\udc41 + \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f \u2212 3\r\nwhere \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f are the lengths of the longest monotonically increasing and decreasing\r\nsubsequences of the permutation formed by the holes\u2019 coordinates. Geometrically, these\r\nsubsequences represent the maximum number of holes stepping diagonally down-and\uffferight (\ud835\udc4e) and down-and-left (\ud835\udc4f).\r\nAccording to the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres Theorem (via Dilworth\u2019s Theorem), any permutation\r\nsequence of length \ud835\udc41 must contain an increasing subsequence of length \ud835\udc4e and a decreasing\r\nsubsequence of length \ud835\udc4f such that:\r\n\ud835\udc4e \u00d7 \ud835\udc4f \u2265 \ud835\udc41\r\nFor Matilda\u2019s grid, \ud835\udc41 = 2025, meaning \ud835\udc4e\u00d7\ud835\udc4f \u2265 2025. To minimize the total number of tiles\r\n\ud835\udc47, Matilda must select a hole permutation that minimizes the sum \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f. Because 2025 is\r\n25","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 26 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\na perfect square (452\r\n), by the AM-GM inequality, the sum \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f is absolutely minimized\r\nwhen the lengths are equal: \ud835\udc4e = 45 and \ud835\udc4f = 45.\r\nSubstituting these optimal lengths into our lower bound formula establishes the mathe\ufffematical minimum possible number of tiles:\r\n\ud835\udc47 \u2265 2025 + 45 + 45 \u2212 3 = 2112\r\n2. The Optimal Tiling Construction\r\nMatilda can flawlessly achieve this global minimum of exactly 2112 tiles by utilizing a\r\nhighly symmetric \u201cmacro-block\u201d arrangement that limits both \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f strictly to 45.\r\nLet \ud835\udc58 = 45.

Because of this interlaced\r\ndesign, the holes dynamically step away from the inner corners of the blocks, cleanly\r\nbounding large, unbroken orthogonal channels of empty space.\r\nThe remaining squares can be seamlessly partitioned with zero wasted cuts into exactly\r\n2112 strictly non-overlapping rectangles:\r\n1. Central Tiles: Safely nestled entirely in the unbroken spaces bounded between the\r\ndiagonal chains of holes, there form exactly (\ud835\udc58 \u2212 1)\r\n2 massive, completely empty\r\nsquares. Each tile perfectly fills a \ud835\udc58 \u00d7 \ud835\udc58 area.\r\nNumber of central tiles = 442 = 1936 (each of size 45 \u00d7 45)\r\n2. Edge Tiles: The remaining boundary space cleanly extends from the outermost\r\nholes to the 4 absolute edges of the overall grid, forming a staggered staircase\r\nperimeter. This area can be completely wrapped and perfectly flushed out using\r\nexactly \ud835\udc58 \u2212 1 unbroken rectangular boundary tiles along each of the 4 outer walls.\r\nThese cascade symmetrically in varying widths and lengths.\r\nNumber of edge tiles = 4\u00d744 = 176 (consisting of 4 sets of cascading strip dimensions\r\nsuch as 1 \u00d7 45, 2 \u00d7 45, . . . , 44 \u00d7 45)\r\nSumming the completely disjoint tiles used in this provably optimal, zero-waste arrange\ufffement gives:\r\nTotal Tiles = 1936 (central squares) + 176 (edge rectangles) = 2112\r\nBecause this perfectly matches the absolute theoretical lower bound, it is mathematically\r\nimpossible to cover the space efficiently using any fewer tiles.\r\nFinal Answer:\r\nThe minimum number of tiles Matilda needs to place is 2112.\r\n26","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 27 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\nIt is important to note that the model successfully identified the correct construction and out\ufffelined a valid proof sketch. This represents a significant improvement over our previous IMO Gold\r\nmodel, which failed to make meaningful progress on this problem even with extreme scaling. How\ufffeever, despite this conceptual breakthrough, our unofficial expert assessment determined the prelim\ufffeinary attempt was merited only a partial score of 1\u20133 points. The solution relied heavily on citing\r\nadvanced\u2014and in this case, likely non-existent\u2014results without proof. While such citation is often\r\nencouraged and necessary in research mathematics, the IMO strictly requires solutions to be self\ufffecontained and derived using elementary techniques, rendering the unproven citations inadmissible.\r\nTo address this, we explicitly prompted the model to adhere to the competition format.

We can bypass advanced\r\ndiscrete geometry black-boxes by modeling the grid as a rectilinear partition, utilizing\r\na corner-counting topological formula, and applying a classic Pigeonhole Principle argu\ufffement (the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres Theorem).\r\n1. The Rectilinear Partition Formula\r\nLet \ud835\udc41 = 2025. The grid contains exactly \ud835\udc41 uncovered 1\u00d71 squares (\u201choles\u201d), with exactly\r\none hole in each row and column. Our goal is to perfectly tile the remaining free space\r\nwith the absolute minimum number of rectangular tiles, \ud835\udc47.\r\nThe final arrangement partitions the \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 grid into exactly \ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc41 smaller rectangles\r\n(the \ud835\udc47 tiles and \ud835\udc41 holes). The boundaries of these rectangles form a set of maximal\r\nstraight line segments. Let \ud835\udc3b be the number of maximal internal horizontal segments,\r\n\ud835\udc49 be the number of maximal internal vertical segments, and \ud835\udc3c be the number of strictly\r\ninternal crossings (where a horizontal and vertical segment intersect).\r\nWe establish an exact formula for \ud835\udc47 by counting the 90\u25e6\r\ncorners of the rectangles. Every\r\nrectangle has exactly 4 corners, yielding 4(\ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc41) corners in total. These corners occur\r\nstrictly at the intersections of the grid\u2019s bounding frame and the internal segments. We\r\nclassify all such points:\r\n1. Grid Corners: The 4 absolute corners of the \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 grid each provide exactly 1\r\nrectangle corner. (Total: 4)\r\n2. Internal Crossings: Each of the \ud835\udc3c strict crossings of maximal segments provides\r\nexactly 4 rectangle corners.

T-Junctions (Endpoints): Every maximal internal segment has exactly 2 endpoints.\r\nAn endpoint must terminate perpendicularly on the outer grid boundary or on an\ufffeother maximal internal segment, forming a T-junction.\r\n(Note: An \u201cL-junction\u201d where two endpoints meet without continuing is geometrically\r\nimpossible. This would leave a 270\u25e6\r\nreflex angle in the space, which cannot be parti\ufffetioned by rectangles without a segment emanating from the corner.)\r\nFurthermore, no two maximal internal segment endpoints can meet at the same T\ufffejunction (collinear endpoints would merge into a single maximal segment, and per\ufffependicular endpoints would form an impossible L-junction or an X-crossing).

Thus, exactly \ud835\udc3f elements reach count \ud835\udc49, meaning every integer \ud835\udc49 >\r\n\ud835\udc402 appears exactly \ud835\udc3f times in the sequence.

Common solutions, such as those in (Chen, 2024), rely on constructing\r\nspecific shapes (e.g., \u201cstaircase\u201d patterns or \u201chappy triangles\u201d) to define winning paths, but the model\r\ndoes not use these visual constructions. Instead, it treats the grid as a state-space, defining dynamic\r\nsets of \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d columns to derive a general \u201cSafe Probing\u201d algorithm. This shift from\r\npattern-based path-finding to abstract state-tracking suggests that the model derived an alternative\r\nstrategy from first principles, rather than simply recalling shape-based lemmas found online. Most\r\nnotably, the model\u2019s approach bypasses the case splitting based on the first-row stone\u2014a step typical\r\nof most public solutions.\r\nThe problem statement and the model-generated solution are provided below:\r\nPB-Advanced-023 (Robustified IMO 2024 P5) from (Luong et al., 2025)\r\n18\r\nOn a table of size 3002\u00d73001, a stone is placed on the leftmost cell of the first row. James\r\nand Peters play a game on this table. Peter selects 3000 cells, under the rule that he must\r\nchoose one from each row except the first and last rows (i.e., the 1st and 3002th row),\r\nand there must be at most one stone in each column. James knows this rule too, but he\r\ndoesn\u2019t know where Peter placed the stones. The goal of James is to move the stone to\r\nthe last row, avoiding the cells selected by Peter. The stone can only move to adjacent\r\ncells on the table. If the stone enters a cell selected by Peter, James receives a penalty\r\nof 1 point, and the stone returns to its initial position (i.e., the leftmost cell). Find the\r\nsmallest positive integer \ud835\udc5b such that there exists a method for James to achieve his goal\r\nbefore receiving a penalty of \ud835\udc5b points.\r\nModel-Generated Solution\r\nTo determine the smallest positive integer \ud835\udc5b such that James can guarantee reaching the\r\nlast row before receiving \ud835\udc5b penalty points, we can analyze the game as an adversarial\r\ncontest. James wants to reach row 3002 while minimizing his penalties, whereas Peter\r\nchooses the 3000 selected cells (which we will call traps) to maximize James\u2019s penalties.\r\n(Note: The problem states \u201cat most one stone in each column\u201d referring to Peter\u2019s selected\r\ncells. We will use the word \u201ctrap\u201d for Peter\u2019s cells to distinguish them from the \u201cstone\u201d James\r\nmoves).\r\nThe grid has 3002 rows and 3001 columns. Peter places exactly 3000 traps following\r\nthese rules:\r\n18The problem statement below has a minor typo when compared to the problem statement from (Luong et al., 2025),\r\nnamely, \u201cthere must be at most one stone in each column\u201d should read \u201cthere must be at most one selected cell in each\r\ncolumn\u201d.\r\n33","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 34 / 35>","Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n1. Row 1 and Row 3002 contain 0 traps.\r\n2. Each intermediate row (rows 2 through 3001) contains exactly 1 trap.\r\n3. Each column contains at most 1 trap. (Since there are 3001 columns and 3000\r\ntraps, exactly one column is completely empty, and all others contain exactly one\r\ntrap).\r\nWhen James steps on a trap, he receives 1 penalty point, teleports back to (1, 1), and\r\npermanently learns the location of that trap.\r\n1. Lower Bound: Peter can force at least 2 penalties (\ud835\udc5b \u2265 3)\r\nBecause James does not know the trap locations initially, Peter can anticipate any deter\ufffeministic path James takes and place traps to ensure James gets hit at least twice:\r\n\u2022 First Penalty: To reach the bottom, James\u2019s initial path \ud835\udc431 must eventually cross\r\nrow 2. Let the very first cell he steps on in row 2 be (2, \ud835\udc501). Peter places the row 2\r\ntrap at (2, \ud835\udc501).

To cross\r\nthe board, \ud835\udc432 must eventually reach row 3. Because orthogonal movement restricts\r\nJames from stepping onto (3, \ud835\udc501) without first stepping onto (2, \ud835\udc501) or an adjacent\r\ncell already in row 3, the first cell \ud835\udc432 visits in row 3 must be some (3, \ud835\udc502) where\r\n\ud835\udc502 \u2260 \ud835\udc501.

James hits it, receiving his 2nd\r\npenalty.\r\nThus, James cannot guarantee a win with 0 or 1 penalty. He must be prepared to take at\r\nleast 2 penalties, meaning \ud835\udc5b > 2 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc5b \u2265 3.\r\n2. Upper Bound: James can always win with at most 2 penalties (\ud835\udc5b \u2264 3)\r\nJames can use a structured row-by-row probing strategy to ensure he never receives a\r\n3rd penalty.\r\nLet \ud835\udc46 be the set of columns where traps have already been discovered.

Taking a Penalty: If (\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc66) IS a trap, James receives a penalty, adds \ud835\udc66 to \ud835\udc46, and the\r\nturn ends.

He teleports to (1, 1). He now has enough structural\r\ninformation to immediately reach the bottom without further probing:\r\n\u2022 Step 1: Safely drop down column \ud835\udc65.

Furthermore, the trap for row \ud835\udc58 is known to be at \ud835\udc66.

James walks horizontally along\r\nrow \ud835\udc58 from \ud835\udc65 to \ud835\udc501. Why is this safe? Because \ud835\udc65 was chosen as the closest column in\r\n\ud835\udc34 to \ud835\udc501, every column strictly between them belongs to \ud835\udc46. Columns in \ud835\udc46 had their\r\nsingle traps discovered in rows strictly above \ud835\udc58. Therefore, their cells in row \ud835\udc58 are\r\ndefinitively safe. The cell (\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc501) is also safe for the same reason.\r\n\u2022 Step 3: Safely drop down column \ud835\udc501 to the finish. James is now at (\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc501). Why\r\nis this safe? Column \ud835\udc501 is the column where he took his 1st penalty (at some row\r\n\ud835\udc5f1 < \ud835\udc58). Because each column has at most one trap, the entirety of column \ud835\udc501 strictly\r\nbelow row \ud835\udc5f1 is completely empty. James walks straight down this empty highway\r\nto row 3002 and wins!\r\n(Note: If James finishes probing all rows with \u2264 1 penalty, the single remaining column in\r\n\ud835\udc34 will be completely void of traps, and he can walk straight down it from row 1 to 3002).\r\nConclusion\r\nJames\u2019s strategy inherently limits his maximum possible penalties to exactly 2. Thus, he\r\nachieves his goal flawlessly before his accumulated penalties reach 3.\r\nFinal Answer:\r\nThe smallest positive integer \ud835\udc5b such that there exists a method for James to achieve his\r\ngoal before receiving a penalty of \ud835\udc5b points is 3.\r\n35"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"retrieval_turn_number":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"300342aa-9ae2-96a2-ac3f-dd69cf17e1d8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"150d92e3-2802-4fcf-b49e-bd4660387115","turn_exchange_id":"f9c6c982-360a-4a22-a079-fe9e6ad6e6e7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"150d92e3-2802-4fcf-b49e-bd4660387115","children":["c35b0d7b-5e9d-4ff9-ba75-2d1ba7a66cf5"]},"c35b0d7b-5e9d-4ff9-ba75-2d1ba7a66cf5":{"id":"c35b0d7b-5e9d-4ff9-ba75-2d1ba7a66cf5","message":{"id":"c35b0d7b-5e9d-4ff9-ba75-2d1ba7a66cf5","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1770854923.228542,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\nRemember you have access to rendered images of pages from the files, in addition to their parsed text content.

If any such standards are to be universally adopted, they must arise organically\r\n[L5] from the mathematical community.\r\n[L6] 5.1. Autonomous Mathematics Levels\r\n[L7] Autonomous driving is classified according to standard \u201cLevels\u201d, measuring the degree of autonomy,\r\n[L8] defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). A meaningful taxonomy of autonomous math\ufffeematics should have at least two dimensions, with one axis for the level of autonomy and another for\r\n[L9] the level of mathematical significance14. Maintaining a coarse division while preserving essential\r\n[L10] distinctions would minimize subjective disputes. We divide our own results into three broad levels\r\n[L11] of autonomy, described in Table 6.\r\n[L12] Level Level Description\r\n[L13] H\r\n[L14] Primarily Human\r\n[L15] (secondary AI in\ufffeput)\r\n[L16] Core mathematical content is human-generated; AI contributions\r\n[L17] are minor or auxiliary (e.g., literature search, basic calculations,\r\n[L18] writing routine proofs which the human author could have sup\ufffeplied) if any.\r\n[L19] C\r\n[L20] Human-AI\r\n[L21] Collaboration\r\n[L22] A substantive human-AI collaboration where both parties con\ufffetribute in an essential way.\r\n[L23] A\r\n[L24] Essentially\r\n[L25] Autonomous\r\n[L26] The core mathematical content is fully AI-generated without\r\n[L27] any essential human intervention.

This axis quantifies the relative contribution between the\r\n[L29] human and AI agents.\r\n[L30] 5.1.1. Discussion and Examples for Level of Autonomy.\r\n[L31] In these terms, we consider the paper (Feng26) to be of Level A, as the human contribution is only\r\n[L32] in expository aspects, aside from posing the original questions. The results in (Feng et al., 2026a)\r\n[L33] are also of Level A insofar as the role of humans was only to correct minor inaccuracies. We consider\r\n[L34] the papers (LeeSeo26) and (BKKKZ26) to be of Level C: both humans and AI contributed essential\r\n[L35] aspects of the papers. We consider the papers (FYZ26) and (ACGKMP26) to be of Level H: while the\r\n[L36] written papers have non-trivial contributions from AI, these contributions form a minor portion of\r\n[L37] the paper and the human authors could have supplied those parts themselves.\r\n[L38] Even with these broad subdivisions, there can be some ambiguity. A possible situation is that\r\n[L39] interacting with AI leads human mathematicians to a key idea or reference, but the AI itself does not\r\n[L40] truly make its own mathematical contribution. In other words, the AI contributes only via \u201cinspira\ufffetion\u201d.

How\ufffeever, despite this conceptual breakthrough, our unofficial expert assessment determined the prelim\ufffeinary attempt was merited only a partial score of 1\u20133 points. The solution relied heavily on citing\r\n[L11] advanced\u2014and in this case, likely non-existent\u2014results without proof. While such citation is often\r\n[L12] encouraged and necessary in research mathematics, the IMO strictly requires solutions to be self\ufffecontained and derived using elementary techniques, rendering the unproven citations inadmissible.\r\n[L13] To address this, we explicitly prompted the model to adhere to the competition format. We\r\n[L14] instructed it to treat the task as an IMO problem, thereby enforcing the requirement for elementary,\r\n[L15] self-contained logic:\r\n[L16] Please rewrite the solution below to be suitable for an IMO competition.

We can bypass advanced\r\n[L28] discrete geometry black-boxes by modeling the grid as a rectilinear partition, utilizing\r\n[L29] a corner-counting topological formula, and applying a classic Pigeonhole Principle argu\ufffement (the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres Theorem).\r\n[L30] 1.

Our goal is to perfectly tile the remaining free space\r\n[L33] with the absolute minimum number of rectangular tiles, \ud835\udc47.\r\n[L34] The final arrangement partitions the \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 grid into exactly \ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc41 smaller rectangles\r\n[L35] (the \ud835\udc47 tiles and \ud835\udc41 holes). The boundaries of these rectangles form a set of maximal\r\n[L36] straight line segments. Let \ud835\udc3b be the number of maximal internal horizontal segments,\r\n[L37] \ud835\udc49 be the number of maximal internal vertical segments, and \ud835\udc3c be the number of strictly\r\n[L38] internal crossings (where a horizontal and vertical segment intersect).\r\n[L39] We establish an exact formula for \ud835\udc47 by counting the 90\u25e6\r\n[L40] corners of the rectangles. Every\r\n[L41] rectangle has exactly 4 corners, yielding 4(\ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc41) corners in total.

Therefore, apart from the uniform\r\n[L12] distribution \ud835\udc5d\r\n[L13] \u2217\r\n[L14] , the only candidate for a global maximum is a distribution with one large\r\n[L15] component and \ud835\udc5e \u2212 1 small components: \ud835\udc5d = (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66, . . . , \ud835\udc66) with \ud835\udc65 + (\ud835\udc5e \u2212 1) \ud835\udc66 = 1.\r\n[L16] Eliminating \ud835\udc66 =\r\n[L17] 1\u2212\ud835\udc65\r\n[L18] \ud835\udc5e\u22121\r\n[L19] , the objective function restricted to this symmetric subspace becomes\r\n[L20] a function of \ud835\udc65 \u2208 (0, 1):\r\n[L21] \u210e(\ud835\udc65) =\r\n[L22] \ud835\udefd\r\n[L23] 2\r\n[L24] (\r\n[L25] \ud835\udc65\r\n[L26] 2 +\r\n[L27] (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65)\r\n[L28] 2\r\n[L29] \ud835\udc5e \u2212 1\r\n[L30] )\r\n[L31] \u2212 \ud835\udc65 log \ud835\udc65 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) log (\r\n[L32] 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\r\n[L33] \ud835\udc5e \u2212 1\r\n[L34] )\r\n[L35] .\r\n[L36] Determination of the Critical Inverse Temperature\r\n[L37] For \ud835\udc5e \u2265 3, the model undergoes a first-order phase transition (Wu, 1982).

We can bypass advanced\r\n[L8] discrete geometry black-boxes by modeling the grid as a rectilinear partition, utilizing\r\n[L9] a corner-counting topological formula, and applying a classic Pigeonhole Principle argu\ufffement (the Erd\u0151s-Szekeres Theorem).\r\n[L10] 1. The Rectilinear Partition Formula\r\n[L11] Let \ud835\udc41 = 2025. The grid contains exactly \ud835\udc41 uncovered 1\u00d71 squares (\u201choles\u201d), with exactly\r\n[L12] one hole in each row and column. Our goal is to perfectly tile the remaining free space\r\n[L13] with the absolute minimum number of rectangular tiles, \ud835\udc47.\r\n[L14] The final arrangement partitions the \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 grid into exactly \ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc41 smaller rectangles\r\n[L15] (the \ud835\udc47 tiles and \ud835\udc41 holes). The boundaries of these rectangles form a set of maximal\r\n[L16] straight line segments. Let \ud835\udc3b be the number of maximal internal horizontal segments,\r\n[L17] \ud835\udc49 be the number of maximal internal vertical segments, and \ud835\udc3c be the number of strictly\r\n[L18] internal crossings (where a horizontal and vertical segment intersect).\r\n[L19] We establish an exact formula for \ud835\udc47 by counting the 90\u25e6\r\n[L20] corners of the rectangles. Every\r\n[L21] rectangle has exactly 4 corners, yielding 4(\ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc41) corners in total. These corners occur\r\n[L22] strictly at the intersections of the grid\u2019s bounding frame and the internal segments. We\r\n[L23] classify all such points:\r\n[L24] 1.

T-Junctions (Endpoints): Every maximal internal segment has exactly 2 endpoints.\r\n[L30] An endpoint must terminate perpendicularly on the outer grid boundary or on an\ufffeother maximal internal segment, forming a T-junction.\r\n[L31] (Note: An \u201cL-junction\u201d where two endpoints meet without continuing is geometrically\r\n[L32] impossible. This would leave a 270\u25e6\r\n[L33] reflex angle in the space, which cannot be parti\ufffetioned by rectangles without a segment emanating from the corner.)\r\n[L34] Furthermore, no two maximal internal segment endpoints can meet at the same T\ufffejunction (collinear endpoints would merge into a single maximal segment, and per\ufffependicular endpoints would form an impossible L-junction or an X-crossing). Thus,\r\n[L35] there are exactly 2\ud835\udc3b + 2\ud835\udc49 distinct endpoints, each forming a unique T-junction. A\r\n[L36] T-junction provides exactly 2 rectangle corners.

Aletheia agent: From Olympiads to Research-level Mathematics\r\n[L16] This section outlines the methodological framework utilized in the development of agents capable of\r\n[L17] addressing research-grade mathematics. There are many challenges involved in transferring capabil\ufffeities from contest problem-solving to mathematics research. While IMO problems require ingenuity,\r\n[L18] their solutions usually span only a few pages and rely only on standard theorems from the high\r\n[L19] school curriculum. By contrast, research-level mathematics draws on advanced techniques from vast\r\n[L20] literature, with papers often spanning dozens of pages. Human mathematicians, even IMO medal\ufffeists, usually take many years of postgraduate study to reach the frontier of mathematical research.\r\n[L21] While foundation models possess a large knowledge base from pretraining, their understanding of\r\n[L22] advanced subjects remains superficial due to data scarcity, and they are also prone to hallucinations.\r\n[L23] Figure 1 | Overview of Aletheia, a math research agent powered by Deep Think that can iteratively\r\n[L24] generate, verify, and revise for research-level math problems.\r\n[L25] To address these issues, we built a math research agent, internally codenamed Aletheia, on top of\r\n[L26] Gemini Deep Think. Aletheia include three subagents, a (solution) Generator, a Verifier, and a Reviser\r\n[L27] that interact continuously until a solution is found that the Verifier approves, or until the attempts\r\n[L28] reach a preset (hyperparameter) limit. The subagent orchestration is sketched in Figure 1. In turn,\r\n[L29] each of the three subagents involves internal orchestration of calls to a Gemini base model.\r\n[L30] 4\r\n[L31] In fact, one such \u2018Open\u2019 problem (Erd\u0151s-397, posed in 1980) was eventually discovered to be nearly identical to\r\n[L32] a problem on the 2012 Team Selection Test for the Chinese IMO team (Art of Problem Solving Community, 2012), a\r\n[L33] (challenging) exam for high school students; we exclude it from our classification since we consider the solution to be\r\n[L34] already in the literature.\r\n[L35] 3<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 3 / 35><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L36] (a) IMO-Proof Bench Advanced (Olympiad Level).

Aletheia makes further leaps in terms of reasoning\r\n[L3] quality with lower inference-time compute. All results were graded by human experts.\r\n[L4] In contrast to AlphaGeometry (Chervonyi et al., 2025; Trinh et al., 2024) and AlphaProof (Hubert\r\n[L5] et al., 2025), that use formal language, Aletheia operates end-to-end in natural language. At the\r\n[L6] same time, designs similar to Aletheia have been demonstrated elsewhere. For example, Huang\u2013\r\n[L7] Yang (Huang and Yang, 2025) showed that a manually crafted solver-verifier harness could boost\r\n[L8] GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or Grok 4 to Gold Medal performance on the 2025 IMO. Another example is\r\n[L9] the FullProof system5 built by Salafatinos (Bryan et al., 2026), which is another mathematics specific\r\n[L10] research agent incorporating a separate informal verifier mechanism.\r\n[L11] 2.1. Scaling Laws and the Evolution of Deep Think\r\n[L12] We first discuss some empirical findings about inference time scaling laws for Olympiad-level and\r\n[L13] PhD-level problems, which underlie the development of Deep Think. To investigate the inference\r\n[L14] scaling behavior, we evaluated different advanced versions of Gemini Deep Think (Deep Think team,\r\n[L15] 2025). Since Deep Think leverages parallel thinking to explore multiple ideas at once, we were able\r\n[L16] to flexibly adjust the amount of compute spent at inference time. To ensure that results were not\r\n[L17] cherry-picked, we ran the model exactly once for each problem at each compute scale, with tool use\r\n[L18] disabled, and the outputs are carefully graded according to the grading guideline.\r\n[L19] For Olympiad level, we leveraged the the advanced subset of IMO-Proof Bench (Luong et al., 2025)\r\n[L20] which consists of 30 problems similar in difficulty and problem style to those found at the IMO.\r\n[L21] This was the benchmark used during our IMO 2025 preparation; ultimately, an advanced version\r\n[L22] of Gemini Deep Think achieved a gold-medal standard at the IMO in July 2025, perfectly solving\r\n[L23] five out of six problems (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Benchmarking our systems on IMO-Proof Bench\r\n[L24] helped us understand which systems were most promising. We observed that the inference-time\r\n[L25] compute could be increased by orders of magnitude while yielding substantial gains in accuracy, as\r\n[L26] graded by human experts, before eventually plateauing (Figure 2a).\r\n[L27] Building upon the key recipes developed for the IMO-gold model and incorporating a suite of\r\n[L28] novel technical improvements, we trained a stronger model Gemini Deep Think (advanced version,\r\n[L29] Jan 2026) that significantly improved inference efficiency. The compute required to achieve equiva\ufffelent performance on IMO-Proof Bench was reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude (100x).\r\n[L30] 5The authors were not aware of this work until after the results of this paper were collected.\r\n[L31] 4<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 35><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L32] Specifically, utilizing extreme scale and simple prompting, Gemini Deep Think (advanced version,\r\n[L33] Jan 2026), without internet access, demonstrated the potential to solve exceptionally difficult reason\ufffeing tasks such as IMO 2025 Problem 6 (see Appendix B), that our previous IMO-gold model failed\r\n[L34] to solve. Notably, the latest model also solved IMO 2024 Problem 3 with a minor mistake (achieved\r\n[L35] at 2\r\n[L36] 7\r\n[L37] scale) and completely solved Problem 5 (at 2\r\n[L38] 8\r\n[L39] scale) (see Appendix C)\r\n[L40] 6\r\n[L41] .\n# \u30101\u2020Aletheia.pdf\u2020file_0000000089787206a2fe794b75e31893\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Aletheia.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file1\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:1\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Moreover, on the\r\n[L2] 29 out of 30 problems where Aletheia actually returned a solution, its conditional accuracy reached\r\n[L3] 98.3%. On the FutureMath Basic (Figure 2b), Aletheia again outperformed Deep Think at all compute\r\n[L4] scales on the same base model. Notably, it returned solutions for fewer than 60% of these problems,\r\n[L5] and its conditional accuracy on the answered subset exceeded 82%. Thanks to its verification mech\ufffeanism, Aletheia often admits failure to solve a problem, a key feature that improved the efficiency of\r\n[L6] our human-AI research collaborations.\r\n[L7] 2.3. Importance of Tool Use\r\n[L8] Beyond its foundational natural language verifier, Aletheia relies heavily on tool use to navigate the\r\n[L9] complexities of mathematical research. We find that a foundation model operating without such tools\r\n[L10] is prone to frequent hallucinations\u2014primarily in the form of spurious citations (see Figure 3 for an\r\n[L11] example), and to a lesser extent, computational inaccuracies. In contrast to the structured, bounded\r\n[L12] nature of IMO problems, mathematical research requires synthesizing published literature to address\r\n[L13] broader, open-ended questions. We observed that simply granting internet access is insufficient;\r\n[L14] 6We caution that the model\u2019s knowledge cutoff falls between IMO 2024 and IMO 2025, implying possible exposure\r\n[L15] to the IMO 2024 problems. Additionally, as IMO 2025 has been public for six months, we do not claim the problem was\r\n[L16] strictly unseen. We report these findings to transparently demonstrate the potential of our new Gemini Deep Think model.\r\n[L17] 5<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 6 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L18] however, when our model was extensively trained for tool use, the integration of Google Search\r\n[L19] and web browsing led to a substantial reduction in obvious citation hallucinations with fictitious\r\n[L20] titles and/or authors. This shifted citation errors to subtler hallucinations, for example where the\r\n[L21] reference exists but its results are not quoted properly (as illustrated in Figure 4).\r\n[L22] Perhaps unexpectedly, our results indicate that the integration of Python as a tool yielded only\r\n[L23] marginal improvements in mitigating computational hallucinations.

Summary of Mathematical Research Results\r\n[L33] Below we will briefly summarize the papers with substantial contributions from Aletheia that have\r\n[L34] already been publicly released. Due to timing, these results were obtained by Aletheia with a base\r\n[L35] model that was intermediate between the two base models depicted in Figure 2.\r\n[L36] To be clear, the final versions of these papers were all written by human authors, starting\r\n[L37] from Aletheia\u2019s outputs. This was due to the principle held by the human authors involved that\r\n[L38] research papers should be authored exclusively by humans, even when AI contributions reach a level\r\n[L39] 6<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L40] that would traditionally merit co-authorship. The primary reason is that authorship of a mathematics\r\n[L41] paper implies accountability for all of its contents, and this is a responsibility that only humans can\r\n[L42] bear. We emphasize that beyond mathematical correctness, authors also assume accountability for\r\n[L43] important aspects of exposition such as adequacy and accuracy of attributions, which cannot be\r\n[L44] guaranteed by formal verification.\r\n[L45] 3.1.\n# \u30103\u2020Aletheia.pdf\u2020file_0000000089787206a2fe794b75e31893\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Aletheia.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"2:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] From December 2\u20139, we deployed Aletheia against the\r\n[L2] 700 Erd\u0151s problems then marked as \u201cOpen\u201d in Bloom\u2019s database. Aletheia\u2019s informal verifier mecha\ufffenism streamlined the initial pool of candidates: of the 700 original prompts, the model returned 212\r\n[L3] responses as potentially correct. These candidates were then evaluated by a team of mathematicians.\r\n[L4] Most were not experts in the relevant problem domain, so we prioritized narrowing the pool of can\ufffedidate solutions quickly (possibly at the cost of making noisier judgments) to a manageable size for\r\n[L5] our smaller core of domain experts. This step was essentially completed by December 21. Then our\r\n[L6] internal domain experts vetted the solutions carefully, consulting external experts when correctness\r\n[L7] was ascertained but novelty was unclear. In some cases, minor inaccuracies in the solutions were\r\n[L8] corrected.\r\n[L9] Our ultimate findings were that 63 solutions were technically correct, but only 13 solutions cor\uffferectly addressed the intended problem statement (either by invoking the literature, or by a novel\r\n[L10] argument). The remaining 50 of Aletheia\u2019s correct solutions were technically valid but mathemati\ufffe8Other models were also able to solve the problem: Gemini Deep Think, Aletheia, and\u2014with some back and forth\u2014\r\n[L11] GPT-5 Pro.\r\n[L12] 9Other models were tasked with the same prompt, but Aletheia\u2019s output was the only one that the authors found useful.\r\n[L13] 8<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L14] cally vacuous, because the problem statements were interpreted in a way that did not capture Erd\u0151s\u2019s\r\n[L15] intent, often (but not always) leading to trivial solutions. Finally, 12 of the responses were marked\r\n[L16] ambiguous, for example due to open-endedness of the question itself. In summary, out of the 200\r\n[L17] solution candidates that we were definitely able to mark correct or incorrect, 137 (68.5%) of the\r\n[L18] responses were fundamentally flawed, while 63 (31.5%) of the responses were technically correct,\r\n[L19] of which only 13 (6.5%) were meaningfully correct. These 13 meaningfully correct results clustered\r\n[L20] naturally into four categories which we felt should be distinguished; see Table 2 for a summary.\r\n[L21] Autonomous Resolution. On these problems, Aletheia found the first correct solution (as far as we\r\n[L22] can tell) in a mathematically substantive way. These include Erd\u0151s-652 and Erd\u0151s-1051.\r\n[L23] Partial AI Solution. On these problems, there were multiple questions and Aletheia found the first\r\n[L24] correct solution to one of the questions. These include Erd\u0151s-654, and Erd\u0151s-1040.\r\n[L25] Independent Rediscovery. On these problems, Aletheia found a correct solution, but human au\ufffeditors subsequently found an independent solution already in the literature. These include\r\n[L26] Erd\u0151s-397, Erd\u0151s-659, Erd\u0151s-935, and Erd\u0151s-1089. The solutions appear to have been in\ufffedependently rediscovered by our model: we scanned the logs of Aletheia\u2019s reasoning trace to\r\n[L27] ensure that the solution was not pulled directly from the literature solution.10\r\n[L28] Literature Identification. On these problems, Aletheia found that a solution was already explicitly\r\n[L29] in the literature, despite the problem being marked \u201cOpen\u201d on Bloom\u2019s website at the time\r\n[L30] of model deployment.

Milestone A: Reliable Autonomous Research\r\n[L21] The paper Eigenweights for Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality (Feng26) resolves a problem that\r\n[L22] arose in the work of Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang (FYZ26) investigating an extension of the celebrated Hirze\ufffebruch Proportionality Principle (Hir58).\r\n[L23] The backdrop. Hirzebruch\u2019s original Proportionality Principle expresses the Chern numbers\r\n[L24] of an automorphic vector bundle on a compact locally symmetric space as a multiple of the corre\ufffesponding Chern numbers on the compact dual variety, with a proportionality constant that can be\r\n[L25] interpreted as a value of the \ud835\udc3f-function for the associated Gross motive (Gro97). This formula was\r\n[L26] later generalized to non-compact locally symmetric spaces by Mumford (Mum77).\r\n[L27] Recent work by Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang (FYZ26) studies a variant of this principle, called \u201cArithmetic\r\n[L28] Hirzebruch Proportionality\u201d, relating the \u201carithmetic volume\u201d of Chern classes on moduli spaces of\r\n[L29] shtukas to differential operators applied to the \ud835\udc3f-function of Gross motives. It can be seen as a\r\n[L30] generalization of Gaitsgory\u2013Lurie\u2019s resolution of Weil\u2019s Tamagawa Number Conjecture (GL14). The\r\n[L31] precise differential operator appearing in Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality is governed by cer\ufffetain fundamental structure constants called eigenweights. In (FYZ26), the authors calculated some\r\n[L32] examples of eigenweights, but did not know how to determine all of them in closed form.\r\n[L33] The story of the paper. In fact, this project began almost incidentally, while tracking partial\r\n[L34] progress on a problem that was submitted to an internal benchmark: the computation of a particular\r\n[L35] family of eigenweights (whose answer was already known to Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang). Initially no model\r\n[L36] could solve it, but clear progress was visible as inference time computation was scaled, until the\r\n[L37] eventual IMO Gold model found the correct answer. Upon examining the AI-generated solution, the\r\n[L38] authors of (FYZ26) preferred it over their original one, leading them to replace the original proofs\r\n[L39] in their paper.\r\n[L40] This success encouraged us to task Aletheia with calculating the eigenweights in general.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://67660d0eece66e5#file_0000000089787206a2fe794b75e31893#p_3.jpg","size_bytes":165864,"width":512,"height":1024,"fovea":null,"metadata":null}],"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":2,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_pulls","slurm_github_issues","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github_commits","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"connectors_file_search":{"tool_call_message_id":"8e244e41-7060-4694-8bf6-36ea4d914d97","source_filters":["files_uploaded_in_conversation"],"call_tool_latency_ms":1514.53114207834},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"300342aa-9ae2-96a2-ac3f-dd69cf17e1d8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"6b7e2d00-580a-44bd-b476-424979722bd5","turn_exchange_id":"f9c6c982-360a-4a22-a079-fe9e6ad6e6e7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6b7e2d00-580a-44bd-b476-424979722bd5","children":["3c56848d-3f0a-42dc-9c82-bc7a1df25853"]},"3c56848d-3f0a-42dc-9c82-bc7a1df25853":{"id":"3c56848d-3f0a-42dc-9c82-bc7a1df25853","message":{"id":"3c56848d-3f0a-42dc-9c82-bc7a1df25853","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770854969.212814,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting deep dive response with structured sections","content":"The user asks for a deep dive with a focus on mathematics from the article.

Summary of Mathematical Research Results\r\n[L8] Below we will briefly summarize the papers with substantial contributions from Aletheia that have\r\n[L9] already been publicly released. Due to timing, these results were obtained by Aletheia with a base\r\n[L10] model that was intermediate between the two base models depicted in Figure 2.\r\n[L11] To be clear, the final versions of these papers were all written by human authors, starting\r\n[L12] from Aletheia\u2019s outputs. This was due to the principle held by the human authors involved that\r\n[L13] research papers should be authored exclusively by humans, even when AI contributions reach a level\r\n[L14] 6<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L15] that would traditionally merit co-authorship. The primary reason is that authorship of a mathematics\r\n[L16] paper implies accountability for all of its contents, and this is a responsibility that only humans can\r\n[L17] bear. We emphasize that beyond mathematical correctness, authors also assume accountability for\r\n[L18] important aspects of exposition such as adequacy and accuracy of attributions, which cannot be\r\n[L19] guaranteed by formal verification.\r\n[L20] 3.1. Milestone A: Reliable Autonomous Research\r\n[L21] The paper Eigenweights for Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality (Feng26) resolves a problem that\r\n[L22] arose in the work of Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang (FYZ26) investigating an extension of the celebrated Hirze\ufffebruch Proportionality Principle (Hir58).\r\n[L23] The backdrop. Hirzebruch\u2019s original Proportionality Principle expresses the Chern numbers\r\n[L24] of an automorphic vector bundle on a compact locally symmetric space as a multiple of the corre\ufffesponding Chern numbers on the compact dual variety, with a proportionality constant that can be\r\n[L25] interpreted as a value of the \ud835\udc3f-function for the associated Gross motive (Gro97). This formula was\r\n[L26] later generalized to non-compact locally symmetric spaces by Mumford (Mum77).\r\n[L27] Recent work by Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang (FYZ26) studies a variant of this principle, called \u201cArithmetic\r\n[L28] Hirzebruch Proportionality\u201d, relating the \u201carithmetic volume\u201d of Chern classes on moduli spaces of\r\n[L29] shtukas to differential operators applied to the \ud835\udc3f-function of Gross motives. It can be seen as a\r\n[L30] generalization of Gaitsgory\u2013Lurie\u2019s resolution of Weil\u2019s Tamagawa Number Conjecture (GL14). The\r\n[L31] precise differential operator appearing in Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality is governed by cer\ufffetain fundamental structure constants called eigenweights. In (FYZ26), the authors calculated some\r\n[L32] examples of eigenweights, but did not know how to determine all of them in closed form.\r\n[L33] The story of the paper. In fact, this project began almost incidentally, while tracking partial\r\n[L34] progress on a problem that was submitted to an internal benchmark: the computation of a particular\r\n[L35] family of eigenweights (whose answer was already known to Feng\u2013Yun\u2013Zhang). Initially no model\r\n[L36] could solve it, but clear progress was visible as inference time computation was scaled, until the\r\n[L37] eventual IMO Gold model found the correct answer. Upon examining the AI-generated solution, the\r\n[L38] authors of (FYZ26) preferred it over their original one, leading them to replace the original proofs\r\n[L39] in their paper.\r\n[L40] This success encouraged us to task Aletheia with calculating the eigenweights in general.\n# \u30103\u2020Aletheia.pdf\u2020file_0000000089787206a2fe794b75e31893\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: Aletheia.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn4file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"4:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] Other studies show AI is useful for\r\n[L2] solving accessible conjectures or assisting with problems that require mathematical exploration (Feld\ufffemanKarbasi25; GGTW25). Even more broadly, (Woodruff et al., 2026) demonstrates a multitude of\r\n[L3] techniques and case studies for AI-assisted research across several mathematics-adjacent domains,\r\n[L4] including theoretical computer science, economics, and physics.\r\n[L5] Frameworks for Human-AI Collaboration A variety of human-AI collaborative implementations\r\n[L6] have emerged, ranging from fully agentic architectures with self-verification and refinement (Bryan\r\n[L7] et al., 2026; Huang and Yang, 2025), to exploration methods such as AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al.,\r\n[L8] 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Yuksekgonul et al., 2026), to more collaboration-focused methods such as\r\n[L9] interactive protocols suggesting how to integrate AI as a research assistant (Henkel, 2025; Li et al.,\r\n[L10] 2025). Despite the surge in attention (Bubeck et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), the community is\r\n[L11] still in the early stages of adapting AI for mathematical research, making it essential to establish\r\n[L12] transparent standards for how AI-generated mathematics is documented, evaluated, and communi\ufffecated.\r\n[L13] 8. Conclusion\r\n[L14] Ultimately, we believe that AI will become a tool that enhances rather than replaces mathematicians.\r\n[L15] Currently, natural language models struggle to reason reliably without human intervention to correct\r\n[L16] mistakes and hallucinations, while formal verification systems are not yet capable of even formulating\r\n[L17] the questions of interest on most research frontiers. For this reason, we have introduced specialized\r\n[L18] math reasoning agents, incorporating informal natural language verification, to help mathematicians\r\n[L19] harness the benefits of AI.\r\n[L20] Acknowledgments.

Without\r\n[L17] any human intervention, Aletheia found an elegant way to do this, using techniques from a different\r\n[L18] field of mathematics7 unfamiliar to the authors of (FYZ26), and in the process resolved several\r\n[L19] questions left open in (FYZ26). This is the subject of the paper (Feng26), which is notable in that\r\n[L20] all of the mathematical content is fully generated by AI. While our ultimate goal is to empower\r\n[L21] human mathematicians with AI tools, we note the ability to generate correct results without human\r\n[L22] intervention as an important milestone for reliability and trustworthiness of natural language models.\r\n[L23] 3.2.

Because these molecules naturally repel one another, no two\r\n[L28] 7Namely, algebraic combinatorics.\r\n[L29] 7<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 8 / 35>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research\r\n[L30] molecules can occupy \u201cneighboring\u201d spots that are directly connected. Mathematicians call these\r\n[L31] valid arrangements independent sets, and they are a cornerstone of understanding complex systems\r\n[L32] in both physics and mathematics.\r\n[L33] The story of the paper. Joonkyung Lee and Jaehyeon Seo first used Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to\r\n[L34] prove the key inequality needed to obtain a further generalization of a well-known result by Sah\u2013\r\n[L35] Sawhney\u2013Stoner\u2013Zhao (SSSZ19) on the lower bound for the number of (weighted) independent\r\n[L36] sets.8 Encouraged by this success, they tackled an even harder problem: modeling systems where\r\n[L37] two different types of molecules interact at the same time, such that different types do not repel each\r\n[L38] other. For this deeper challenge, Aletheia provided9 a high-level roadmap of insightful ideas that the\r\n[L39] authors then turned into a complete, rigorous proof.\nVisible: 0% - 100%","summary":null,"assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"command":"msearch","cloud_doc_urls":[null,null,null,null,null],"retrieval_turn_number":4,"is_contextual_answers_supported":true,"contextual_answers_available_sources":["slurm_github_pulls","slurm_github_issues","files_uploaded_in_conversation","slurm_github_commits","slurm_github"],"retrieval_search_sources":[{"product_type":"threads","source_name":"files_uploaded_in_conversation"}],"connectors_file_search":{"tool_call_message_id":"57a4d133-ea64-4666-b3a1-5132a6a954d4","source_filters":["files_uploaded_in_conversation"],"call_tool_latency_ms":1224.943915847689},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"classifier_response":"default","request_id":"300342aa-9ae2-96a2-ac3f-dd69cf17e1d8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"60ccfc24-5553-4893-a132-5d11849716cc","turn_exchange_id":"f9c6c982-360a-4a22-a079-fe9e6ad6e6e7","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"60ccfc24-5553-4893-a132-5d11849716cc","children":["976eac20-abae-47f2-86b5-3c4bec08d1fe"]},"976eac20-abae-47f2-86b5-3c4bec08d1fe":{"id":"976eac20-abae-47f2-86b5-3c4bec08d1fe","message":{"id":"976eac20-abae-47f2-86b5-3c4bec08d1fe","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770855021.500972,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Planning a critical deep dive","content":"I\u2019ll go ahead with the deep dive, making sure to include critical analysis of the methods.
