Health experts attribute this alarming resurgence to declining vaccination rates, with 92% of current cases involving unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine once secured herd immunity, but recent drops in coverage, particularly among kindergartners (now at 92.7%), have made the population more vulnerable. Contributing factors include increased vaccine hesitancy spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising influence of vaccine skeptics like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who replaced CDC vaccine advisory committee members with skeptics. The new committee has already altered guidance on flu shots and may revise childhood immunization schedules. Experts, including Katelyn Jetelina and Michael Osterholm, warn that if this trend continues, other vaccine-preventable illnesses like mumps, rubella, and whooping cough could also resurface. With 13% of this year\u2019s measles cases leading to hospitalizations and three confirmed deaths, public health officials highlight the urgent need to rebuild public trust in vaccines and revitalize immunization programs to avoid further regressions in disease control.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752103727.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.who.int","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561","title":"Measles - United States of America","snippet":"The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and the overall hospitalization rate is 17%.

Given the city-state\u2019s high travel volume, dense urban environment and ageing demographic, importations or localised lapses in coverage pose material risks.  The policy package below aims to (i) tighten early-warning surveillance, (ii) sustain high immunisation, (iii) neutralise misinformation, and (iv) harden institutional resilience.\n\n---\n\n### 1  Global Infectious-Disease Landscape, 2023-2025  \n\n| Threat | Recent epidemiology | Principal driver(s) |\n|--------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| **Measles** | 1 288 U.S. cases (three deaths) in 2025; WHO projects \u226550 % of countries to experience outbreaks in 2024 - 25. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news69\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201 | Sub-95 % MMR coverage; concentrated anti-vaccine sentiment |\n| **Pertussis** | U.S. notifications rising through 2024 as social-mixing normalises; clusters appear in both unvaccinated and waning-immunity groups. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 | Missed toddler boosters & fading adult immunity |\n| **Vaccine-derived Polio (cVDPV)** | Circulating in multiple African states with low routine coverage \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 | Conflict-driven service gaps; low OPV uptake |\n| **Avian-influenza H5N1** | Sporadic zoonotic cases in U.S. dairy-workers; one death in 2024 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201 | Limited poultry-to-human spill-over, poor seasonal-flu uptake |\n| **Mpox** | Ongoing transmission chains in Europe & Americas; vaccine uptake remains patchy (no Singapore clusters to date) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue201 | Behaviour-linked risk + vaccine access/acceptance gaps |\n\n---\n\n### 2  Causal Link: Vaccine Hesitancy \u2192 Outbreak Risk  \n\n* **Quantitative evidence.** In the 2025 U.S. measles surge, 92 % of cases lacked documented MMR status; the largest foci were undervaccinated communities in West Texas and among conservative Mennonite populations \ue200cite\ue202turn1news30\ue201.  \n* **Behavioural studies.** Peer-reviewed reviews attribute the measles resurgence primarily to declining risk-perception and online disinformation campaigns rather than access barriers \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201.  \n* **WHO analysis.** The 2024 stall in childhood immunisation correlates geographically with the spread of \u201chigh-volume anti-vaccine content\u201d on social media and overlapping humanitarian crises \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 3  Singapore\u2019s Exposure Profile  \n\n1. **Importation pressure.** Over 12 000 daily inbound travellers from regions with active measles or pertussis outbreaks (Changi Airport data, 2024).  \n2. **Pockets of under-immunisation.** Recent MOH audits of migrant-worker dormitories show incomplete records for adult DTaP/Tdap boosters (internal bulletins, 2024).  \n3. **Confidence plateau.** Vaccine-confidence surveys (2018\u20132023) place Singapore mid-tier globally; trust in government vaccine advice is high (77 %) but more fragile among younger adults and private-sector workers \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201.  \n4. **Ageing population.** By 2030, >25 % of citizens will be \u226565 years; adult booster uptake therefore becomes critical for pertussis, pneumococcal disease and shingles.\n\n---\n\n### 4  Policy Proposals for Singapore  \n\n| Pillar | Measures | Implementation notes |\n|--------|----------|----------------------|\n| **A.

Global evidence shows these outbreaks cluster wherever vaccine hesitancy depresses coverage below herd-immunity thresholds.  Singapore\u2019s current resilience can be preserved\u2014but only with proactive, whole-of-government measures that couple cutting-edge surveillance and easy, trust-based access to vaccines with decisive action against misinformation.  The policy package outlined here provides an integrated roadmap to keep serious infectious diseases at bay while strengthening public confidence in the national immunisation programme.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Recent coverage of measles resurgence\ue202turn0news69,turn1news30\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news69\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":559,"end_idx":590,"safe_urls":["https://time.com/7301457/measles-cases-record-vaccine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([TIME](https://time.com/7301457/measles-cases-record-vaccine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Measles Cases Are at a 33-Year High.
