I\u2019ll use market analysis, commentary, sentiment indicators, etc., to determine when sentiment turned bearish. For 2017, Bitcoin peaked in December and crashed in 2018\u2014likely shifting sentiment around early January when the price dropped by 30%.\n\n**Clarifying and evaluating Bitcoin downturns**\n\nThe user mentions downturns in 2017 and 2021. For 2017, the downturn likely starts at the end of 2017, continuing into 2018. Meanwhile, 2021 had two notable downturns: one in May after the April peak, and another after the November peak leading into the 2022 bear market. I\u2019ll clarify which downturn they mean.\n\n**Clarifying and defining sentiment shifts after peak cycles**\n\nThe user specifies the major Bitcoin cycle peaks in December 2017 and November 2021. It seems they want to understand how sentiment turned bearish after these peaks, leading to the bear markets. I'll focus on analyzing those specific peaks and the sentiment changes around them.\n\n**Defining sentiment change triggers**\n\nTo define when sentiment started turning bearish, I\u2019ll consider price-based triggers, like breaking key moving averages, and sentiment indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. However, since the index started in 2018, I might look at Google Trends or social media to assess the 2017 mania phase.\n\n**Defining when sentiment turns bearish**\n\nTo define a bearish sentiment shift, I\u2019ll use price-based triggers like breaking key moving averages as common indicators. For sentiment indicators, I might consider tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index (though it started in 2018), Google Trends, social media, and mainstream commentary from 2018 about the bubble's end.\n\n**Defining sentiment turn and major upswing triggers**\n\nWe can pinpoint a sentiment turn in early January 2018, when Bitcoin dropped from $20k to around $13k and $11k, followed by news on the crackdown and the January 2018 slump. For analysis, I'll reference historical price data, including the 2017 all-time high, the 2018 low, and the 2019-2020 rallies. The next major upswing could be the 2020-2021 bull run, or possibly the 2023-2024 rise following the 2021 downturn.\n\n**Defining the duration of bearish sentiment and next upswing in 2017 cycle**\n\nThe user wants to understand the timeline from the 2017 downturn's sentiment shift to the next major upswing. In 2017, sentiment likely turned bearish from December 2017 to January 2018. The next major upswing could be the 2019 rally, roughly 15-16 months later, which reached $13k after a period of stability.\n\n**Clarifying the 2021 downturn and 2017 cycle**\n\nFor the 2021 cycle, the downturn likely started in May 2021 with a sharp crash, and sentiment stayed negative through July. This fits with the user\u2019s mention of the 2021 downturn. The user is probably referring to that crash, not the post-November 2021 bear phase. As for 2017, the downturn started after December 2017, not in 2017 itself.\n\n**Clarifying the 2017 and 2021 downturns**\n\nThe user might refer to downturns in 2017 and 2021 as the mid-cycle crashes within those bull markets rather than the full bear markets that followed. In 2017, the September crash followed by a rise to $20k mirrors the May 2021 drop, both around 40-50% before price surged again.\n\n**Interpreting bearish sentiment and downturns in 2017 and 2021**\n\nThe user asks about the start of the bearish mood and how long it lasted before the next upswing in Bitcoin price. These downturns could refer to mid-cycle crashes (like Sept 2017 and May-July 2021) or the post-peak bear markets (2018 and 2022). I'll analyze both interpretations.\n\n**Assessing Bitcoin bearish shifts and cycles**\n\nUser asks about the downturns in 2017 and 2021. I'll interpret this as analyzing the bear markets post-peak in 2018 and 2022, not mid-cycle changes. I'll track sentiment with relevant indicators like the Fear & Greed index, Google Trends, and on-chain metrics, alongside price movements, to determine when the bearish mood flipped.\n\n**Compiling Bitcoin downturn timeline and visual aids**\n\nTo answer the user, I can break down\n\n**Gathering sources for sentiment analysis**\n\nTo analyze sentiment shifts, I need to gather historical data from sources like the Crypto Fear & Greed index, focusing on early 2018, 2019, and 2021-2022. I'll use time-series charts to track when sentiment turned bearish, incorporating price data and sourcing citations when necessary.\n\n**Choosing the Fear & Greed index as key metric**\n\nI think the Fear & Greed index is a good way to track sentiment shifts. I'll use the periods when the index enters \"Fear\" or \"Extreme Fear\" for an extended time to mark bearish mood. I can pull data from public sources and analyze it to identify relevant date ranges.\n\n**Using the Fear & Greed index dataset for analysis**\n\nI can access the Fear & Greed index data via API and check when it first enters \"Fear\" or \"Extreme Fear.\" The\n\n**Finding the best way to access JSON data**\n\nThe tool output is truncated due to word limits, so I\u2019ll need to find the right method to get the full content. I could use Python to download it, but since it\u2019s offline, I\u2019ll rely on the web\n\n**Facing data access challenges**\n\nIt looks like there are some limitations in accessing the full data, especially since the web tool can\u2019t provide JSON or large amounts of data in one go. I could try other sources like alternative.me API or MacroMicro, but they might require logins. I might also check Kaggle for downloadable datasets.\n\n**Considering alternative data methods**\n\nIt seems using the alternative.me API to get the dataset in CSV format could solve the data access issue. The open tool might still have limitations, but by pulling specific line numbers, I could get around that. Alternatively, I could download the file directly using the container tool, if network access is permitted.\n\n**Exploring container.download for CSV fetch**\n\nIt seems container.download might still allow internet access, even though the Python environment says otherwise. If that works, I can fetch the CSV file and then parse it locally to compute the durations. However, I should also remember to follow the instruction to avoid creating downloadable files.\n\n**Opening the CSV URL before download**\n\nI need to open the CSV URL first using web.run since the container.download tool requires it to be viewed in the conversation. I\u2019ve already checked the JSON API URL, but I haven't done the CSV URL yet. Once I open it, I can proceed with the download as planned.\n\n**Attempting to download the CSV via container**\n\nIt seems like the API returns JSON by default, possibly with a CSV string in a \"data\" field, but I can't view the whole file because of the word limit. Since we've already viewed the URL, I\u2019ll try using the download tool to fetch the CSV file and parse it locally. Let's give it another shot.\n\n**Using the exact URL to try again**\n\nIt seems the tool expects the exact same URL, and even though we opened it, the string might have been normalized (order changed). I'll use the precise URL as shown in the website to meet the requirements and try downloading the CSV file again. Let's give it another try.\n\n**Exploring different ways to fetch the CSV file**\n\nIt seems like the container tool doesn't support JSON, and it might only allow binary or plain text formats. I wonder if adding an \"Accept: text/csv\" header could work, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s possible here. I could try fetching it with a different method directly from the API using the correct arguments for CSV.\n\n**Exploring workarounds to fetch and process data**\n\nThe container tool can\u2019t access the internet, and its download method is restrictive about content types. I could try using a web tool to open the data and parse smaller segments, but the word limit might truncate it. Maybe I can narrow down the dataset by targeting specific date ranges?\n\n**Checking alternative.me API docs**\n\nI think the API might support a 'start' parameter, but I\u2019m not sure. The documentation snippet seems to mention it, but it could be for different endpoints. Let me check their API page to verify if it includes parameters like 'limit,' 'start,' or 'date_format,' so I can tailor my queries accordingly.\n\n**Testing URL for the CSV format**\n\nI see the API docs mention the format should be CSV, but the content type shows as JSON\u2014maybe it's just how the tool interprets it. To test this, I\u2019ll open the example URL with a smaller limit of 10 and check if it returns actual CSV data as expected.\n\n**Parsing the unusual API response**\n\nThe API is returning JSON, but inside the \"data\" field, there's a comma-separated list that looks like CSV, although it's not quoted correctly. It seems they tried to return CSV inside JSON, but the format isn\u2019t fully encoded properly. I could try parsing the raw tokens myself, querying smaller segments with limits and start parameters.\n\n**Searching for an alternative approach**\n\nThe documentation for the FNG API doesn\u2019t support an offset; it only accepts parameters like limit, format, and date_format. So, if limit=0 truncates the results, retrieving data in manageable chunks is tricky. I\u2019ll need to find another source for historical Fear &\n\n**Looking for a suitable dataset repository**\n\nThis repo doesn't include a data file; it\u2019s just code to download into a database, which isn\u2019t what I need. I\u2019ll try searching again for a repo that stores the actual historical data. Maybe searching \u201ccrypto fear greed index CSV raw GitHub\u201d will turn up a better result.\n\n**Checking GitHub repo for dataset**\n\nI found a GitHub repo, 0xReisearch/hanabi-1, which has a file called \"fear_greed_index_enhanced.csv\" in the \"fear_greed_data\" folder. This might contain the full dataset I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ll open the repo and click on the file to inspect its contents.\n\n**Inspecting example_data folder for dataset**\n\nIt seems the fear_greed_data directory isn't there, but the README mentions \"fear_greed_data/fear_greed_index_enhanced.csv\". Maybe it's located in the example_data folder instead. I'll check by opening the example_data folder to see if the dataset is there. Let's click and see.\n\n**Looking for file listing in example_data directory**\n\nThe example_data directory isn't showing the file list fully because our view is truncated due to line limits. Lines 0 to 186 are displayed, but the file listing might be further along or hidden. I'll try searching in this view using a pattern like \u201chourly\u201d or \"README\".\n\n**Issue with viewing file list on GitHub**\n\nThe example_data page isn't showing the file list, likely because it's hidden by dynamic content or needs JavaScript to display. Since the full page contains more than 200 words, the file listing might be collapsed or out of view due to the limit. I might need to adjust how I'm viewing the content.\n\n**Investigating where to find the file listing**\n\nIt seems the file listing might not appear within the first 200 words, and using the \"find\" method didn\u2019t help. The page might be blocked or simply not show the directory list. Maybe the file URL can be guessed directly, but we might also consider other dataset sources in case it's not present.\n\n**Exploring alternative data sources for sentiment indicators**\n\nCoinMarketCap's Fear and Greed Index could be useful, especially with API docs for historical data. However, it might require an API key. We could also look into sentiment indicators like the Bitcoin Misery Index or NUPL, but for the user\u2019s needs, qualitative analysis of indicators might suffice to estimate sentiment changes.\n\n**Identifying bearish sentiment and duration from past cycles**\n\nFor the 2017/2018 bear market, after the 2017 high, concerns over regulation and a fading \"mania\" led the market down through 2018. The bearish sentiment lasted until April 2019, marked by a breakout above $5k. A similar cycle continued in 2021-2022, with sentiment shifting in line with macroeconomic changes.\n\n**Identifying bearish sentiment and recovery periods**\n\nIn 2022, bearish sentiment deepened due to events like Terra/Luna and FTX. Glassnode noted weakness in recovery during April and July reports. The next major upswing began in early 2023 with Bitcoin regaining its 200-day moving average. To support this, I'll look for public analyses of this 2023 rally.\n\n**Using quality sources to define upticks and bear end**\n\nI found some solid references: CoinDesk January 2023 mentions Bitcoin retaking $20k, marking the start of the next major upswing. Fidelity's Q1 2023 report talks about Bitcoin holding above the 200-day moving average. I'll focus on high-quality sources like CoinDesk and Fidelity to define the end of the bear market.\n\n**Searching for sources on 2017/2018 sentiment shift**\n\nI need sources on the 2017/2018 sentiment shift, such as Google search trends (down 75%, per Investopedia) or Bloomberg\u2019s take on the fading pop culture moment in March 2018. I'll also include anecdotal debates around the bubble. I'll search for relevant articles, including those addressing the January 2018 crash.\n\n**Identifying sources for sentiment analysis**\n\nI want to use several sources for sentiment analysis: Alternative.me\u2019s Fear & Greed index for concept and numbers, Google Trends showing public interest decline (from Investopedia, Bloomberg), and Yahoo Finance for the 2019 breakout. For 2021/2022, I'll use on-chain analysis like Glassnode, and for 2017/2018, I might include commentary from CNN or search for pieces about the \"Bitcoin bubble burst\" in early 2018.\n\n**Assessing bear market durations and sentiment shifts**\n\nI can use Guardian (January 2018) discussing the bubble bursting, and Bankrate for the \"crypto winter\" term from 2018 to trace sentiment turning bearish. The 2017 peak sentiment lasted around 14.5 months until the April 2019 breakout, including a $3k to $14k rally by June. For 2021, bearish sentiment may have begun in December 2021 or January 2022, influenced by extreme fear and references to \"crypto winter.\"\n\n**Deciding on the 2021 and 2017 downturns**\n\nFor the 2021 downturn, it might be easier to focus on the extreme fear zone from May-July, followed by a rally from July to October. As for the 2017 downturn, the user refers to 2017, meaning they might be asking about the cycle peak in late 2017, not just the 2018 crash. I'll focus on both downturns.\n\n**Clarifying downturns in 2017 and 2021**\n\nIt seems the user is referring specifically to downturns following the 2017 and 2021 peaks, not necessarily bear markets starting later. The downturns could be the sharp drops right after those cycle tops in each respective year. I think they mean the bearish phases right after each peak, so I'll focus on those.\n\n**Structuring the answer based on cycle analysis**\n\nWe\u2019ll break the analysis into two cycles:\n\n- 2017 peak -> 2018 crypto winter -> 2019 rebound\n- 2021 peak -> 2022 bear market -> 2023 rebound\n\nWe might mention the mid-cycle crashes in 2021 and 2017 as extra context but will focus on the major downturns. These key moments will answer the question of when sentiment turned bearish and the duration before the next upswing.\n\n**Defining sentiment shifts and downturns**\n\nFor 2017/2018, sentiment turned bearish in January 2018 when Bitcoin's decline accelerated after the December 2017 high. The bearish mood lasted roughly 15 months until April 2019, when the price bounced above $5,200. For 2021/2022, sentiment likely started turning bearish in December 2021 or January 2022, when key support levels were breached. I'll reference mainstream articles to confirm this timing.\n\n**Identifying sentiment turn using Fear & Greed**\n\nTo pinpoint the sentiment shift for 2022, I can use the \"Crypto Winter\" article from Al Jazeera (January 2022) and reference the Fear & Greed Index, which likely indicates extreme fear in January 2022. I'll check the index value for that period through official images or reliable sources like Yahoo Finance to back up this data.\n\n**Clarifying sentiment shift with the Fear & Greed Index**\n\nI found a credible Reuters article from January 18, 2022, about the Fear & Greed index fluctuating between 10 and 29, signaling market fear. This aligns with defining the sentiment shift as bearish starting in early December 2021, when the index was at 25. I'll solidify this conclusion using these sources.\n\n**Defining bearish mood duration based on crypto market data**\n\nThe bearish mood most likely started in early December 2021, following the significant price drop. The next major upswing began in January 2023, or possibly March 2023. This sets the bearish phase at about 13-14 months, leading up to the first major rally in January 2023 above $20k.\n\n**Confirming the dates of Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high and lowest point**\n\nThe all-time high occurred in November 2021, with reports confirming a $69,000 price. The market bottomed out around November 2022 with a dip to roughly $15,500-$15,476. References from sources like Reuters, CoinDesk, and others are needed for precision and citations.\n\n**Estimating bottom and upswing dates for Bitcoin**\n\nNovember 2022 saw Bitcoin drop near $15,500, though not exactly at its bottom. A Yahoo Finance article on Nov 9, 2022, cites Bitcoin at $15,985, and there\u2019s another snippet from WSJ mentioning $15,787. While we may not need the exact bottom, the bearish sentiment lasted from November 2022 to January 2023.\n\n**Defining bearish sentiment and upswing**\n\nThe bearish mood lasted from December 2021 to January 2023 (about 13 months). To mark the upswing, we can show Bitcoin surpassing the $20k mark in January 2023 (CoinDesk). We'll reference a Reuters article from January 2022 about the Fear & Greed index and possibly find more info about the index in December 2021.\n\n**Summarizing sources and timeline for sentiment**\n\nThe sources are useful for tracking sentiment. We have: \n- CoinDesk (Dec 1, 2021) saying the Fear & Greed index showed extreme fear in December.\n- Yahoo Canada (Dec 29, 2021) confirming persistent fear below 25.\n- Reuters (Jan 18, 2022) showing fluctuating fear.\nWe can use these for both 2021 downturns, plus May 2021\u2019s crash. We\u2019ll look for alternatives for 2017.\n\n**Considering alternative metrics for 2018 bear market**\n\nWe might use alternative metrics, like the Bitcoin Misery Index from 2018, to highlight sentiment during that time. For the 2017 downturn, we can look at the media bubble burst around January 2018 and use Google Trends data, possibly referencing the drop in searches after January 2018. Let's gather sources.\n\n**Gathering missing sources for 2019 breakout and bottom**\n\nWe have sources like Investopedia from June 2018 about Google searches down 75%, and Bloomberg from March 2018 about fading interest. We also have Investing.com\u2019s December 2018 review. I still need to find sources for Bitcoin's price bottom and breakout above $5K, especially Yahoo Finance from April 2019.\n\n**Finding 2023 upswing sources**\n\nWe have good sources for the 2019 breakout, like Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, citing Bitcoin\u2019s rise above $5K. Now, I need similar sources for the 2023 upswing, such as CoinDesk about Bitcoin going above $20K. I'll look up Reuters for additional coverage of Bitcoin\u2019s strong start in 2023.\n\n**Finalizing 2023 upswing and turning bearish in 2018**\n\nThe Reuters sources for January 2023 confirm Bitcoin's upswing starting from early January. We'll consider January 1 as the low, with the rally gaining momentum. For 2017\u20132018, mid-January 2018 seems like the time sentiment turned bearish, with sources like The Guardian and Bloomberg. I'll search for more on early 2018.\n\n**Assessing 2017 market sentiment for bearish turn**\n\nThe Reuters article from February 2018 shows prices falling below $6,000, indicating bearish sentiment. We also have info from the 2020 surge, but that's less relevant for 2018. For the 2017 cycle, sentiment likely shifted in December 2017 or early January 2018 after the price drop. We\u2019ll check for credible public sources.\n\n**Defining sentiment turn and start of upswing**\n\nSentiment likely turned bearish between late December 2017 and January 2018, marked by the price peak in mid-December and indicators like South Korean regulation news. The bearish mood lasted until the major upswing on April 2, 2019, when Bitcoin broke above $5k, signaling a shift in market sentiment.\n\n**Defining bearish sentiment duration and 2021 cycle mood**\n\nFrom January 18, 2018, to April 2, 2019, bearish sentiment lasted roughly 439 days (14.4 months). While there may have been variations like the December 2018 bottom, we can consider the mood as bearish until April 2019 when sentiment and price improved. For 2021, sentiment started turning bearish by late November, hinted by the \"extreme fear\" index from December.\n\n**Assessing the end of bearish mood and upswing**\n\nThe major upswing started around January 2023 when Bitcoin surpassed $20k for the first time in over two months, with a 26.4% rise from January 1. If we trace sentiment from November 2021's all-time high, the duration from that point to January 2023 is about 14 months. We need to finalize this choice.\n\n**Defining bearish mood and upswing periods clearly**\n\nFor the sentiment shift, I\u2019m choosing early December 2021, when the Fear & Greed index signaled extreme fear, marking one of the first clear signs of bearish sentiment. I\u2019ll reference a range, from late Nov 2021 to early Dec 2021. We\u2019ll also clarify that rallies, like in 2022, aren\u2019t major upswing markers, while early 2023's sustained rally above $20k represents a more significant shift.\n\n**Incorporating broader sentiment indicators and events**\n\nI\u2019ll mention how discussions and debates colored sentiment during market downturns. In 2018, there was the \u201cBitcoin is dead\u201d narrative, and debates around Bitcoin Cash also impacted sentiment. For 2022, I can reference the critique of crypto as a safe haven and other sentiment indicators like Google Trends, trading interest, and futures positioning. I'll also include relevant articles from Reuters and Axios to illustrate sentiment improvements.\n\n**Defining key terms and 2017-2019 cycle**\n\nTo clarify, I\u2019ll define key terms: Sentiment turning bearish means a sustained shift into fear, with a drop in the Fear & Greed Index. Bearish mood lasts until there's a breakout and sentiment turns neutral/greedy. For the 2017-2019 cycle, sentiment shifted early January 2018, confirming turning points with sources from the Guardian, Reuters, and Bloomberg. The bearish mood persisted through 2018, until signs of sentiment improvement in early 2019.\n\n**Defining bearish mood duration for 2021-2023 cycle**\n\nFor the 2021-2023 cycle, sentiment turns bearish around December 2021, with the Fear & Greed index in extreme fear. The \"crypto winter\" continued through 2022, marked by events like the Terra and FTX collapses. The major upswing starts in January 2023 when Bitcoin breaks above $20k with a sentiment shift. The bearish period lasts about 13-14 months.\n\n**Highlighting mid-2021 downturn and recovery**\n\nIf the user meant the May\u2013July 2021 drawdown, sentiment data shows the Fear & Greed index dropped from 73 to 21 around May 18, 2021, signaling a bearish shift. The market bottomed in late July 2021, with sentiment returning to more neutral territory by the surge to $69k in November 2021. This suggests a bearish mood lasting around 2-3 months.\n\n**Clarifying 2017 and 2021 downturns**\n\nFor the 2021 downturn, we can cite CoinDesk's May 18, 2021 article for the drop in the Fear & Greed index to 21 and Reuters' January 2022 report that ties the market's July 2021 bottom to a score of 19. We can infer the fearful period spanned from mid-May to July. For 2017, if we include the mid-year dip, we\u2019ll mention the accurate peak and bear market analysis.\n\n**Computing 2017 cycle duration**\n\nTo compute the duration of the 2017 cycle, I'll calculate the difference between January 18, 2018, and April 2, 2019. Using Python to find the precise number of days and months will give us a more accurate estimate.\n\n**Calculating the duration in months**\n\nThe duration is 439 days, which is approximately 14.4 months (439/30.44). I'll now confirm that by computing the months precisely to ensure we're accurate. Let me double-check everything to make sure this is correct.\n\n**Listing sources for 2017 downturn**\n\nFor the 2017 downturn, I\u2019ll use sources including:\n\n- The Guardian (Jan 18, 2018) on the Bitcoin bubble and bearish sentiment.\n- Reuters (Feb 6, 2018) on Bitcoin dropping below $6k.\n- Bloomberg (March 15, 2018) discussing Bitcoin's fading popularity due to decreased search interest.\n- Investopedia (June 2018) on a 75% drop in Google searches since January.\n- Reuters (Nov 19, 2018) about Bitcoin falling below $5k.\n- Wired (Nov 21, 2018) on investor unease due to the hard fork.\n- Axios (Feb 19, 2019) on the resurgence of trading interest.\n- Yahoo Finance (April 2, 2019) on Bitcoin's breakout above $5,200.\n- MarketWatch (April 2, 2019) on Bitcoin price rising 20%.\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to cite these sources appropriately.\n\n**Citing sources for 2021-2022 downturn**\n\nFor the 2021/2022 downturn, I'll include:\n\n- Reuters (May 24, 2022) on Bitcoin losing half its value and the fear & greed index at 13.\n- CoinDesk (Dec 1, 2021) about extreme fear in the market.\n- Reuters (Jan 18, 2022) regarding fluctuating fear & greed index.\n- Reuters (Jan 13, 2023) about Bitcoin's 26% rise in January.\n- Reuters (Jan 17, 2023) about the potential end of crypto winter.\n\nI might also cite Reuters (Nov 9, 2022) if relevant.\n\n**Finalizing mid-2021 downturn duration**\n\nWe may cite CoinDesk (May 18, 2021) for the fear index drop. For computing durations, the downturn likely lasted from mid-May to late July 2021 (about 8-10 weeks). While exact dates are unclear, it's safe to approximate two months based on data.\n\nI'll include a bullet timeline in the final response for clarity.\n\n**Finalizing the response with chart and info**\n\nI plan to include a finance chart widget at the top, which will help the user see the price graph. It might show a full range, not necessarily restricted to 2017. I'll craft the final answer with the analysis, timeline, and durations, adding disclaimers if necessary. Let\u2019s proceed!\n\n**Ensuring precise references and calculations**\n\nI'll make sure all citations are properly formatted, avoiding bold or code fences and excluding raw URLs. Since the user is a math researcher, I'll provide precise calculations and a clearer breakdown. I'll compute the durations for the 2018, 2022, and 2021 bear markets and include the results in text. I'll also mention any relevant methodology."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 19m

$31,000 if the current market evolves into a full-fledged \"crypto winter.\" In a report to clients, chief thematic strategist Pat Tschosik and analyst Philippe Mouls note that Bitcoin has already fallen 44% from its October peak to around $69,180 and could fall another 55% from current levels in a worsened bear scenario. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced an average 84% drop during past crypto winters, with such periods lasting around 225 days. The current downturn has lasted just 129 days so far.\n\nHowever, they also mention that increased institutional adoption may help reduce volatility, making future declines less severe. Other analysts, including those from Zacks Investment Research and Stifel, also forecast deeper drops, with estimates ranging from $38,000 to $40,000. Despite the bearish sentiment, NDR hints that the declining severity of past winters may suggest some resilience in the current cycle.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1771011281.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"charts.bitbo.io","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://charts.bitbo.io/fear-greed/","title":"Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index [Live & History Chart]","snippet":"Cycle Extreme Indicators Pro.

Scored on a scale from 0 to 100, the BMI is a contrarian indicator: a low score closer to zero is viewed as a \"buy\" signal, suggesting market pessimism and potential price recovery. The index combines factors like the percentage of winning trades and market volatility. A BMI below 27 indicates investor misery, while scores above 67 reflect happiness.\n\nThe index emerged during a period of extreme Bitcoin volatility, particularly after its 2017 peak and subsequent crash. Despite its popularity and record high of $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin has faced challenges like regulatory threats, hacking incidents (e.g., Mt. Gox, Coincheck), and inherent risks like transaction and country risks due to its decentralized nature. The BMI is retrospective and reflects past market sentiment rather than predicting future events.

Market sentiment was weighed down by concerns over inflated artificial intelligence (AI) stock valuations, particularly ahead of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report. Other worries included the faltering hopes for a U.S. interest rate cut in December and fears of an AI bubble bursting.\n\nMajor tech firms like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia fell significantly. Cryptocurrencies also took a hit, with Bitcoin plunging to a seven-month low below $90,000, marking a nearly 30% decline from October highs. Over $1.2 trillion was wiped from the global crypto market in six weeks. The U.S. S&P 500 and Dow Jones indices suffered losses, with volatility indices spiking, indicating rising investor anxiety.\n\nElsewhere, Ireland's finance minister Paschal Donohoe announced his departure to join the World Bank, triggering a political reshuffle. OCADO shares dropped 14% after U.S. partner Kroger closed warehouses. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s CMA launched investigations into eight firms over hidden online fees.

However, by mid-2018, its value had sharply declined to below $6,000, prompting fears of a collapsing bubble. Regulatory threats worldwide, particularly in Japan and South Korea, and incidents like major exchange hacks, contributed to the decline. Analysts suggest that without new innovations or regulatory developments, there's little impetus for price recovery. Still, some experts believe that the crash could help stabilize Bitcoin, making it more viable for mainstream use as a trusted store of value or medium of exchange. Optimists, including financial leaders like Mohamed El-Erian, suggest that further price drops may attract committed buyers and institutional investors if a more stable price floor can be established.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51},"pub_date":1530303926.926,"attribution":"www.vanityfair.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6991ba804638832aafaa01a2d86d36f3","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c61406bc27cccb597eef00b9c7658","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"a698bb15-c877-4155-ba1f-f5f58fd9a47d","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Bitcoin sentiment and market indicators trends","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"54b38b56-c570-49b8-9e26-cd5b3a4eb99b","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"54b38b56-c570-49b8-9e26-cd5b3a4eb99b","children":["ba87e358-88ed-4665-9852-144086628c1a"]},"ba87e358-88ed-4665-9852-144086628c1a":{"id":"ba87e358-88ed-4665-9852-144086628c1a","message":{"id":"ba87e358-88ed-4665-9852-144086628c1a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771158163.042683,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating Bitcoin sentiment shifts during downturns","content":"The user focuses on downturns in Bitcoin after 2017 and 2021.

The piece explores Bitcoin\u2019s extreme price volatility across years, including its peaks in December 2017, November 2021 ($69,000), and March 2024 ($73,794), as well as significant crashes.

Bears cite regulatory scrutiny, high transaction fees, slow adoption of scaling technologies like the Lightning Network, and scandals such as the FTX debacle. Bulls, on the other hand, believe in Bitcoin's long-term growth, citing adoption by major corporations, regulatory advancements like ETF approvals, and cyclical factors like Bitcoin halvings. The article concludes by highlighting that while Bitcoin\u2019s future remains uncertain, historical trends give hope to those who choose to \"HODL.\"","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1522776180.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/02/28/bitcoin-soars-above-60k-as-spot-etfs-drive-trending-frenzy-lead-to-coinbase-crash/","title":"Bitcoin soars above $60K as spot ETFs drive trending frenzy, lead to Coinbase crash","snippet":"Bitcoin surged past $60,000 on February 28, 2024, for the first time in over two years, fueled by the popularity of newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. The price peaked near $64,000 before settling around $61,000, marking an 18% increase over the past week and 40% over the past month. This bullish rally led to technical issues on Coinbase, a top crypto exchange, as trading volume spiked, causing wallet balance display errors that the company reassured users wouldn\u2019t impact their actual funds.\n\nExperts attribute the surge to increasing investment momentum created by institutional entry through ETFs, which added legitimacy to the market, alongside easing regulatory concerns. BlackRock\u2019s ETF alone saw a record $520 million in single-day inflows. However, analysts warned of a potential sharp correction amid high leverage. The total cryptocurrency market cap reached $2.31 trillion, surpassing $2 trillion for the first time in two years. Additional optimism stems from expectations of Fed interest rate cuts and the upcoming Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d event in April, historically linked to price increases. Crypto's resurgence is also supported by the perceived removal of bad actors like FTX and Binance, restoring investor trust.","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1709161041.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/c5d6d4b09e93bbc22222fab3231bdf59","title":"Bitcoin briefly hits an all-time high, less than two years after FTX scandal clobbered crypto","snippet":"Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, briefly surpassing $68,800, nearly two years after the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange caused widespread skepticism about digital currencies. Although its value dipped slightly afterward to below $62,000, this still marks a dramatic 175% increase from a year earlier. This surge is attributed largely to the U.S. approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in January, which allowed broader investor access and drove massive institutional demand. These ETFs, unlike earlier versions, hold actual bitcoin, and have seen significant inflows\u2014$7.5 billion since launch, with $1.7 billion just last week.\n\nAnother factor behind bitcoin\u2019s rise is the anticipation of its upcoming \u201chalving\u201d event in April, which reduces the rate of new coin creation, constraining supply\u2014a trend that historically aligns with price increases, albeit with potential volatility. Despite the excitement, experts warn that crypto remains highly volatile, sensitive to external shifts like regulations and market sentiment, and investors should proceed with caution. Bitcoin's past includes dramatic price swings, such as its plunge following aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes and the FTX collapse, though investor confidence returned as inflation cooled and traditional finance faltered in 2023.","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1709652948.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/02/bitcoin-price-falls-biggest-monthly-loss-since-june-2022","title":"Bitcoin price falls by 17.5% in biggest monthly loss since 2022","snippet":"In February 2025, Bitcoin experienced a 17.5% drop\u2014its most significant monthly loss since June 2022\u2014falling into a technical bear market after its value declined over 20% from its January peak of $109,071 to around $84,252. The drop was fueled by increased financial market volatility, investor fears sparked by President Donald Trump's announcement of new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and a $1.5 billion cyberattack on the Bybit exchange. Optimism around Trump\u2019s expected pro-crypto stance following his election win had initially boosted prices but waned through February. Market sentiment improved slightly after Trump announced the inclusion of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) in a new U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, causing a rebound that brought Bitcoin back to $94,000.

With only a $2,000 gap between these averages, the signal could be triggered within days. This crossover typically indicates a potential reversal in trend and has sparked concerns that Bitcoin's recent gains\u2014over 20% post-election\u2014may unravel. Historically, such signals have led to declines, as seen last August when Bitcoin dropped 16% before rebounding to record highs. Analysts caution that while every major decline begins with a death cross, not every death cross leads to significant losses. Still, bearish signals and decreasing momentum suggest a potential prolonged correction. Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies advises investors to reduce exposure on any short-term rebound, projecting Bitcoin may test support at $73,800\u2014a possible 13% drop from current levels.","ref_id":{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1743526641.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6991ba804638832aafaa01a2d86d36f3","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c61406bc27cccb597eef00b9c7658","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"a698bb15-c877-4155-ba1f-f5f58fd9a47d","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Bitcoin sentiment shift and rally indicators","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"cfc1f490-1207-49bc-ae67-c8323ea41db8","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cfc1f490-1207-49bc-ae67-c8323ea41db8","children":["373fc336-9d8e-4934-8ad9-36f029ce18ed"]},"373fc336-9d8e-4934-8ad9-36f029ce18ed":{"id":"373fc336-9d8e-4934-8ad9-36f029ce18ed","message":{"id":"373fc336-9d8e-4934-8ad9-36f029ce18ed","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771158413.555753,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Using quality sources to define upticks and bear end","content":"I found some solid references: CoinDesk January 2023 mentions Bitcoin retaking $20k, marking the start of the next major upswing.

Investors who bought Bitcoin as far back as April 2021 have seen no returns, in stark contrast to the S&P 500 and gold, which have risen by approximately 64% and 174%, respectively. AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver attributes the downturn to Bitcoin\u2019s typical four-year cycle, driven by halving events that initially boost prices before triggering bear markets. This recent sell-off coincided with broader market declines and increasing correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks, particularly as fears of AI disruption hit companies like Microsoft and Salesforce.\n\nDespite Bitcoin reaching a high of $126,000 in October, it has since plummeted by 50%, reflecting its high volatility. While considered a hedge against currency debasement, Bitcoin behaves more as a speculative asset than as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d As global economic and geopolitical tensions rise, investors have favored gold over Bitcoin. Oliver suggests a small, risk-managed allocation to Bitcoin may still be reasonable for certain portfolios, though its place in mainstream investing remains volatile.","ref_id":{"turn_index":16,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1770334080.0,"attribution":"www.news.com.au"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6991ba804638832aafaa01a2d86d36f3","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c61406bc27cccb597eef00b9c7658","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"a698bb15-c877-4155-ba1f-f5f58fd9a47d","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for 2018 Bitcoin market sentiment and analysis","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"e40568a0-aec4-438b-b206-9b375afa7b2c","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e40568a0-aec4-438b-b206-9b375afa7b2c","children":["15072cba-ff03-4e42-8dd5-95b0044967a6"]},"15072cba-ff03-4e42-8dd5-95b0044967a6":{"id":"15072cba-ff03-4e42-8dd5-95b0044967a6","message":{"id":"15072cba-ff03-4e42-8dd5-95b0044967a6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771158430.969588,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Assessing bear market durations and sentiment shifts","content":"I can use Guardian (January 2018) discussing the bubble bursting, and Bankrate for the \"crypto winter\" term from 2018 to trace sentiment turning bearish.

lender BlockFills suspends withdrawals amid faltering bitcoin price","snippet":"BlockFills, a Chicago-based crypto liquidity provider and lender, has suspended client deposits and withdrawals due to a recent plunge in bitcoin prices. While the company continues to support spot and derivatives trading, it is actively working to restore platform liquidity and is in discussions with its institutional clients, including crypto hedge funds and asset managers. The Financial Times initially reported the withdrawal freeze, which began the previous week. BlockFills has raised $43 million from investors, including CME Ventures and Susquehanna Capital. The company handled over $61 billion in trading volume in 2025 across more than 2,000 institutional clients. The downturn in digital assets followed market jitters after U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, sparking fears of reduced demand for crypto due to expected balance sheet tightening.

These events triggered a broader \"crypto winter,\" slashing the market's value and undermining beliefs in the security and stability of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nPositively, Ethereum underwent a significant transformation with \"The Merge,\" shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, cutting its energy use by 99.95%. Crypto also proved its real-world utility during the Russia-Ukraine war, with millions raised in aid.\n\nRegulatory developments gained momentum globally: the U.S. explored a digital dollar, the EU passed the MiCA bill, and countries like India, China, and Brazil advanced digital and crypto-friendly policies.

Much of UST\u2019s use\u201475%\u2014was tied to the Anchor protocol, which offered nearly 20% interest on UST deposits. When large investors withdrew hundreds of millions from a Curve liquidity pool, it reduced the pool\u2019s size, making it easier for UST\u2019s value to destabilize.

A total of ten individuals connected to Terra have been charged, with authorities seizing approximately $184.7 billion in assets. TerraUSD, a stablecoin meant to maintain a $1 value, crashed to 35 cents on May 9, 2022, prompting the dramatic fall of Luna and a $60 billion collapse in market value. This event triggered a broader crash in the crypto market in 2022, known as the \"crypto winter,\" causing significant price drops and several exchange failures, including FTX. Daniel Shin\u2019s lawyer maintains that he left Terra two years before its crash and has returned to South Korea to cooperate fully.

Although its value dipped slightly afterward to below $62,000, this still marks a dramatic 175% increase from a year earlier. This surge is attributed largely to the U.S. approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in January, which allowed broader investor access and drove massive institutional demand. These ETFs, unlike earlier versions, hold actual bitcoin, and have seen significant inflows\u2014$7.5 billion since launch, with $1.7 billion just last week.\n\nAnother factor behind bitcoin\u2019s rise is the anticipation of its upcoming \u201chalving\u201d event in April, which reduces the rate of new coin creation, constraining supply\u2014a trend that historically aligns with price increases, albeit with potential volatility.

Here's Why That Matters","snippet":"In November 2022, Binance, the world\u2019s largest centralized crypto exchange, announced an agreement to acquire its rising competitor, FTX, amid a liquidity crisis triggered by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s public concerns over FTX\u2019s financial health. The revelation caused a sharp market downturn, with Bitcoin falling more than 10%. The dramatic turn of events dealt a considerable blow to FTX\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who had been a prominent figure in the crypto industry. Allegations emerged that FTX mismanaged funds and rapidly scaled without proper safeguards, forcing it into a bailout.\n\nThis acquisition reshaped the crypto landscape, making Binance even more dominant and attracting potential regulatory scrutiny. Simultaneously, it raised concerns about the increased centralization in a sector that champions decentralization. The incident highlighted the urgent need for greater transparency and regulation of centralized crypto exchanges, potentially accelerating legislative action. Crypto insiders were shocked by the speed and scale of FTX\u2019s fall, especially given Bankman-Fried\u2019s previous efforts to stabilize struggling crypto firms. The deal excluded FTX\u2019s U.S. branch, FTX.US, which operates separately. Ultimately, the collapse served as a sobering moment for the crypto industry and a turning point in its regulatory future.","ref_id":{"turn_index":18,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":46},"pub_date":1667933981.0,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.welt.de","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.welt.de/242032699","title":"Mehr als 17 Prozent Verlust - Bitcoin sinkt auf Zweijahrestief","snippet":"Am 8.

The slump followed an earlier rally that had seen Bitcoin more than double in value since early December, peaking at a record $42,000. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also dropped significantly, falling as much as 23% to $985. The decline coincided with a broader recovery of the U.S. dollar amid expectations of higher U.S. interest rates, which affected riskier assets. While some investment banks like BofA warned of a bubble, comparing Bitcoin to past investment manias, others like J.P. Morgan suggested it could rival gold and reach up to $146,000 if widely adopted as a safe-haven asset.","ref_id":{"turn_index":20,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1610342573.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-misery-index.asp","title":"Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI): Meaning, Goals, FAQs","snippet":"The Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) is a tool developed in 2018 by Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors to gauge investor sentiment related to Bitcoin's price action. Scored on a scale from 0 to 100, the BMI is a contrarian indicator: a low score closer to zero is viewed as a \"buy\" signal, suggesting market pessimism and potential price recovery. The index combines factors like the percentage of winning trades and market volatility. A BMI below 27 indicates investor misery, while scores above 67 reflect happiness.\n\nThe index emerged during a period of extreme Bitcoin volatility, particularly after its 2017 peak and subsequent crash. Despite its popularity and record high of $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin has faced challenges like regulatory threats, hacking incidents (e.g., Mt. Gox, Coincheck), and inherent risks like transaction and country risks due to its decentralized nature. The BMI is retrospective and reflects past market sentiment rather than predicting future events. Additionally, other metrics like the 200-day moving average help assess Bitcoin\u2019s long-term performance. As of early 2022, approximately 2 million Bitcoins remain to be mined.","ref_id":{"turn_index":20,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1521478800.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2021/01/02/bitcoin-30000-new-year-rally","title":"Bitcoin tops $30,000 for first time","snippet":"Bitcoin surpassed $30,000 for the first time on January 2, 2021, signaling a strong start to the new year for the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Scored on a scale from 0 to 100, the BMI is a contrarian indicator: a low score closer to zero is viewed as a \"buy\" signal, suggesting market pessimism and potential price recovery. The index combines factors like the percentage of winning trades and market volatility. A BMI below 27 indicates investor misery, while scores above 67 reflect happiness.\n\nThe index emerged during a period of extreme Bitcoin volatility, particularly after its 2017 peak and subsequent crash. Despite its popularity and record high of $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin has faced challenges like regulatory threats, hacking incidents (e.g., Mt. Gox, Coincheck), and inherent risks like transaction and country risks due to its decentralized nature. The BMI is retrospective and reflects past market sentiment rather than predicting future events. Additionally, other metrics like the 200-day moving average help assess Bitcoin\u2019s long-term performance. As of early 2022, approximately 2 million Bitcoins remain to be mined.","ref_id":{"turn_index":21,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1521478800.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/bitcoin-pop-culture-moment-fades-as-fad-gives-way-to-regulators","title":"The Bitcoin Fad Is Fading\u2014for Now","snippet":"15 Mar 2018 \u2014 Google searches and tweets about bitcoin decline sharply \u00b7 The number of stories proclaiming death of bitcoin rises.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":21,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1521068405.0,"attribution":"www.bloomberg.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/searches-for-bitcoin-on-google-drop-to-lowest-since-october","title":"Google Searches for Bitcoin Drop to Lowest Since October","snippet":"6 Mar 2018 \u2014 ...

According to the Wall Street Journal, investors are realizing that prior enthusiasm may have driven prices up in a speculative frenzy, raising concerns about the inherent risks.

Bitcoin's value had fallen to less than half its peak price, with a 25% drop occurring in just a few days. This instability prompted business leaders, including Visa CEO Al Kelly, to question its viability as a stable currency, especially for advance purchases like airline tickets or hotel bookings. Although virtual currencies were previously seen as a threat to companies like Visa, only 3 out of the top 500 e-commerce websites accepted bitcoin in late 2017, down from 5 in 2016. Compounding the issue were average transaction fees exceeding $25, driven by speculative trading, making bitcoin an impractical method of exchange for both consumers and businesses.","ref_id":{"turn_index":21,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1516211922.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/why-bitcoin-is-plunging-this-time","title":"Why Bitcoin Is Plunging (This Time)","snippet":"As of November 21, 2018, Bitcoin's value has sharply declined, dropping 10% in a single day and falling 33% over the past month and 46% over the year. While volatile cycles are characteristic of Bitcoin, the recent plunge concerns investors due to deeper underlying issues. Some of the current unease stems from divisions within the Bitcoin community, especially after a second \u201chard fork\u201d in Bitcoin Cash, a spinoff of Bitcoin. This further fragmentation may be spooking investors. Additionally, a U.S. Department of Justice investigation is probing allegations that last year's Bitcoin price surge may have been manipulated, possibly using the cryptocurrency Tether. Experts note that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility stems from the difficulty in valuing it, unlike traditional stocks or fiat currencies. More consistent transaction times, regulatory recognition, and wider adoption could help stabilize Bitcoin, but such changes are hindered by its inherent instability, creating a cycle of uncertainty regarding its long-term future.","ref_id":{"turn_index":21,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1542818200.005,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.vanityfair.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/has-bitcoin-entered-the-doom-loop","title":"Has Bitcoin Entered the Doom Loop?","snippet":"In 2017, Bitcoin experienced a dramatic surge, with prices peaking at over $20,000 per coin, driven by speculation, amateur investment fervor, and market manipulation. However, by mid-2018, its value had sharply declined to below $6,000, prompting fears of a collapsing bubble. Regulatory threats worldwide, particularly in Japan and South Korea, and incidents like major exchange hacks, contributed to the decline. Analysts suggest that without new innovations or regulatory developments, there's little impetus for price recovery. Still, some experts believe that the crash could help stabilize Bitcoin, making it more viable for mainstream use as a trusted store of value or medium of exchange. Optimists, including financial leaders like Mohamed El-Erian, suggest that further price drops may attract committed buyers and institutional investors if a more stable price floor can be established.","ref_id":{"turn_index":21,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":50},"pub_date":1530303926.926,"attribution":"www.vanityfair.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6991ba804638832aafaa01a2d86d36f3","hide_inline_actions":true,"disable_turn_actions":true,"chime_version":1,"request_id":"wfr_019c61406bc27cccb597eef00b9c7658","message_type":"next","turn_exchange_id":"a698bb15-c877-4155-ba1f-f5f58fd9a47d","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":120,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-pro","thinking_effort":"extended","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for sources on Bitcoin sentiment decline 2018","classifier_response":"default","parent_id":"ec92f494-5cb2-4b41-8d0b-fffae5fcc82f","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ec92f494-5cb2-4b41-8d0b-fffae5fcc82f","children":["4e17d625-af54-4c5a-8f88-11edd97ad500"]},"4e17d625-af54-4c5a-8f88-11edd97ad500":{"id":"4e17d625-af54-4c5a-8f88-11edd97ad500","message":{"id":"4e17d625-af54-4c5a-8f88-11edd97ad500","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1771158533.372193,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering missing sources for 2019 breakout and bottom","content":"We have sources like Investopedia from June 2018 about Google searches down 75%, and Bloomberg from March 2018 about fading interest.

This downturn follows profit-taking by investors who benefited from earlier rallies and recent investment via new exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin is currently 22% below its March record high of $73,803, though it's still 35% up for the year. Ether also weakened, down 3.6% to $2,857.\n\nMarket sentiment has been cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, with expectations shifting toward no rate cuts in 2024. This has led to a significant withdrawal from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, with an estimated $496 million in weekly outflows. Crypto-related stocks also declined in premarket trading, with Coinbase, Riot, and Marathon Digital dropping over 4%.\n\nAltcoins have similarly suffered, with Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu all losing significant value. The recent bitcoin halving event has not provided the expected price boost, as the token has dropped 15% since it occurred.

It reached a low of $8,370.80 before slightly recovering to $9,077. This marks the second instance in 2018 that Bitcoin has dropped beneath the $9,000 threshold. The downturn follows a broader trend where the cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum after peaking above $19,000 in December 2017.\n\nA primary factor contributing to the decline is increasing regulatory scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges earlier in the week, which coincided with the start of the drop in value. Despite the short-term negative impact, experts like Bartek Ringwelski, COO of bitFlyer, suggest that regulation is ultimately beneficial, as it addresses the challenges of growing popularity and aims to provide a more secure and stable market environment.","ref_id":{"turn_index":22,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1520611849.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2019/02/19/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-trading-interest-price","title":"Trading interest in Bitcoin bounces back","snippet":"Trading interest in Bitcoin has seen a resurgence, with bullish positions reaching their highest level in 11 months, according to Bitfinex data. Over the past three weeks, long positions have surged by 35%, signaling renewed confidence from speculators, even as short positions have held steady. While the number of long bets is near historical highs, it remains 8% below the peak reached in March 2018.\n\nYves Lamoureux, head of Lamoureux & Co., projects a substantial Bitcoin rally, citing macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish stance and potential future quantitative easing. He believes these conditions might drive considerable investments into Bitcoin. Lamoureux previously predicted Bitcoin would reach $25,000 when it was at $950 in 2017; however, it peaked at under $20,000 in December 2017. Despite some historically exaggerated price forecasts, including one for $1 million, Bitcoin recently rose to its highest point in over five weeks at $3,911.","ref_id":{"turn_index":22,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1550582226.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/feb/28/thames-water-lobbying-higher-bills-lower-fines-avoid-bailout-report-claims-somerset-gigafactory-bridgend-tata-us-gdp-business-live","title":"Bitcoin surges through $60,000 in biggest monthly rally since late 2020 - as it happened","snippet":"In February 2024, Bitcoin experienced a significant rally, surging over 7.5% in a single day to reach around $60,900, marking its strongest monthly performance since late 2020. The cryptocurrency has risen by approximately 40% during the month, nearing its all-time high of over $68,000 set in November 2021. The gains are attributed to growing demand for newly launched US spot bitcoin ETFs and enthusiasm ahead of April\u2019s anticipated halving event.\n\nIn broader economic and corporate developments, Thames Water is lobbying the UK government and regulators to raise customer bills by 40% by 2030 and reduce regulatory fines as it attempts to avoid a financial collapse. The company has amassed over \u00a314bn in debt and faces criticism for underinvestment and environmental failures.\n\nMeanwhile, Direct Line received a \u00a33.1bn takeover bid from Belgian insurer Ageas; Taylor Wimpey and Halfords issued profit warnings; and Reckitt Benckiser saw shares drop 11% due to a sales decline. FTSE reshuffles may boost firms like easyJet and Kier Group while demoting Endeavour Mining and Tullow Oil. Additionally, Tata confirmed a \u00a34bn EV battery gigafactory in Somerset.","ref_id":{"turn_index":22,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1709132473.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/news/should-you-hodl-bitcoin/","title":"Should You HODL Bitcoin?","snippet":"The article titled \u201cShould You HODL Bitcoin?\u201d explores the term \u201cHODL,\u201d which originated from a 2013 misspelling of \u201chold\u201d on a Bitcoin forum and has since become a rallying cry for long-term cryptocurrency investors. The piece explores Bitcoin\u2019s extreme price volatility across years, including its peaks in December 2017, November 2021 ($69,000), and March 2024 ($73,794), as well as significant crashes. The article presents both bearish and bullish cases for Bitcoin. Bears cite regulatory scrutiny, high transaction fees, slow adoption of scaling technologies like the Lightning Network, and scandals such as the FTX debacle. Bulls, on the other hand, believe in Bitcoin's long-term growth, citing adoption by major corporations, regulatory advancements like ETF approvals, and cyclical factors like Bitcoin halvings.

Although its value dipped slightly afterward to below $62,000, this still marks a dramatic 175% increase from a year earlier. This surge is attributed largely to the U.S. approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in January, which allowed broader investor access and drove massive institutional demand. These ETFs, unlike earlier versions, hold actual bitcoin, and have seen significant inflows\u2014$7.5 billion since launch, with $1.7 billion just last week.\n\nAnother factor behind bitcoin\u2019s rise is the anticipation of its upcoming \u201chalving\u201d event in April, which reduces the rate of new coin creation, constraining supply\u2014a trend that historically aligns with price increases, albeit with potential volatility. Despite the excitement, experts warn that crypto remains highly volatile, sensitive to external shifts like regulations and market sentiment, and investors should proceed with caution. Bitcoin's past includes dramatic price swings, such as its plunge following aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes and the FTX collapse, though investor confidence returned as inflation cooled and traditional finance faltered in 2023.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1709652948.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.investopedia.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-market-rebounds-7095795","title":"Bitcoin Bull is Back With a 25% Jump","snippet":"In mid-January 2023, Bitcoin experienced a significant rebound, rising 25% from recent lows triggered by the FTX collapse. This surge was buoyed in part by cooling inflation data from the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which raised hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve might ease interest rate hikes. Bitcoin reached a two-month high of $18,856, and later traded at $21,130. Concurrently, Bitcoin mining difficulty hit a record high of 37.59 trillion, indicating increased network activity.\n\nEthereum also saw notable gains, with its Ether token rising over 17% to $1,568. This climb was partly driven by anticipation of the upcoming Shanghai upgrade, expected in March 2023, which will allow users to withdraw staked Ether following the network's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during 'The Merge' in 2022.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche, NEAR, Aave, Polkadot, and Solana, also contributed to the crypto market's overall recovery, pushing its total valuation back above $1 trillion. Despite recent setbacks such as layoffs and bankruptcies, optimism is returning, with institutions like Bank of America recognizing crypto's long-term potential in revolutionizing value transfer.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1673976903.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-assets-rise-q1-2023-7373812","title":"U.S. Stocks, Bonds, Gold All Rise in Q1 Amid Volatility","snippet":"In the first quarter of 2023, U.S. financial markets experienced notable gains amid significant volatility driven by shifting expectations on interest rates and fears of a banking crisis. Early optimism that the Federal Reserve might pause or reverse interest rate hikes gave way to concerns after stronger-than-expected economic data in February. The collapse of two major U.S. banks and the forced sale of Credit Suisse in March further unnerved markets, prompting a flight to safer assets. However, those fears moderated by the end of the quarter, restoring hope for a Fed policy shift.\n\nEquity markets rebounded, with the Nasdaq Composite surging 16.8%, the S&P 500 rising 7%, and the Dow Jones Industrials edging up 0.4%. Tech stocks led gains, while bank stocks suffered steep losses. U.S. bonds also recovered slightly, with falling Treasury yields boosting bond prices. Gold, a traditional safe haven, climbed 8.5% to near record highs. Oil prices declined 3.6% amid volatility, and real estate saw modest losses due to high mortgage rates and lingering pandemic effects. Cryptocurrencies soared, with Bitcoin rising 71% and Ethereum up 52%, reflecting renewed investor risk appetite toward the end of the quarter.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1680350400.0,"attribution":"www.investopedia.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/5fb04e8a-6939-43ae-9a47-be81ea75b1a1","title":"Bitcoin price tops $60,000 for first time since 2021","snippet":"Bitcoin's price has surged past $60,000 for the first time since 2021, reaching as high as $63,968 before settling near $60,000. This marks a 42% rise in just the first two months of 2024. The rally reignites memories of its 2021 peak of nearly $69,000, driven largely by investor fear of missing out (FOMO). Contributing to this surge is the January approval by U.S. regulators of spot bitcoin ETFs from major asset managers like BlackRock and Invesco. These 11 funds now hold $18 billion worth of bitcoin, about 1.5% of total supply.\n\nAnalysts believe a new all-time high could be imminent, as traditional financial markets also experience gains, bolstered by enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. High user traffic disrupted Coinbase\u2019s services temporarily. Despite regulatory crackdowns and skepticism, including harsh criticism from the European Central Bank, the crypto industry sees this rally as a sign of recovery from past scandals involving firms like Binance and FTX. Binance was fined $4.3 billion in 2023, and FTX\u2019s founder faces sentencing after fraud convictions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":23,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1709135852.357,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.axios.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.axios.com/2023/04/11/crypto-winter-bitcoin-30000","title":"Crypto winter shows hint of thaw, bitcoin tops $30,000","snippet":"Bitcoin surpassed $30,000 for the first time since June, signaling a potential turnaround in the cryptocurrency market after a steep decline in late 2022 tied to scandals like the FTX collapse.

The surge in attention toward DeepSeek raised fears about the future dominance of Western tech firms, leading to what some dubbed AI\u2019s \u201cSputnik moment.\u201d This sentiment contributed to a 6% drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value, which hit $98,852.17.\n\nThe recent downturn follows a rally linked to U.S. President Donald Trump's election, which had pushed Bitcoin above $100,000. However, investor enthusiasm waned after Trump\u2019s administration failed to mention cryptocurrencies in its initial policy announcements, leading to disappointment. Although a working group was initiated to examine new crypto rules, and the SEC withdrew guidance criticized for hindering adoption, these steps didn\u2019t immediately reassure markets.\n\nFurther weighing on digital assets were falling Nasdaq futures, lingering inflation concerns, and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain higher interest rates.

Optimism around Trump\u2019s expected pro-crypto stance following his election win had initially boosted prices but waned through February. Market sentiment improved slightly after Trump announced the inclusion of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) in a new U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, causing a rebound that brought Bitcoin back to $94,000.

Scored on a scale from 0 to 100, the BMI is a contrarian indicator: a low score closer to zero is viewed as a \"buy\" signal, suggesting market pessimism and potential price recovery. The index combines factors like the percentage of winning trades and market volatility. A BMI below 27 indicates investor misery, while scores above 67 reflect happiness.\n\nThe index emerged during a period of extreme Bitcoin volatility, particularly after its 2017 peak and subsequent crash. Despite its popularity and record high of $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin has faced challenges like regulatory threats, hacking incidents (e.g., Mt. Gox, Coincheck), and inherent risks like transaction and country risks due to its decentralized nature. The BMI is retrospective and reflects past market sentiment rather than predicting future events. Additionally, other metrics like the 200-day moving average help assess Bitcoin\u2019s long-term performance.
