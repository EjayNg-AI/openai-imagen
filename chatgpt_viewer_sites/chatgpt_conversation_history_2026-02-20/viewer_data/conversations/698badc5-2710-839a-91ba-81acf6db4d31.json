If agents become ubiquitous, the platform that can provide secure, permissioned, auditable access to enterprise truth\\u2014without data export\\u2014has durable pricing power. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn21view5\\ue202turn26view0\\ue201\\n\\n**Key risks/failure modes:**  \\n- **Competition from alternative data planes:** other governed data platforms could offer similar \\u201cagent in the data cloud\\u201d primitives.  \\n- **Model access equalization:** partnerships help, but model differentiation may compress; Snowflake must win on governance, performance, and developer ergonomics.  \\n- **Over-reliance on partners for agent UX/application surfaces:** Snowflake is infrastructure-first; enterprises may still buy agent platforms from hyperscalers while using Snowflake primarily as storage/compute.\\n\\n### Palo Alto Networks\\n\\n**Where it captures value across the stack:**  \\nGovernance/security: Palo Alto Networks is turning \\u201cagentic AI adoption\\u201d into an enforceable security problem:  \\n- AI Access Security is documented as preventing data leakage in prompts and malicious content in responses, using a GenAI app dictionary, fine-grained access control, monitoring, and DLP-enforced protection. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view1\\ue201  \\n- Prisma AIRS is positioned as an end-to-end platform securing \\u201call apps, agents, models and data,\\u201d including model scanning, posture management, red teaming (with an automated agent), runtime security (prompt injection, data leaks), and agent security (identity impersonation, tool misuse). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view0\\ue201  \\nPalo Alto\\u2019s SEC filing describes Prisma AIRS similarly, reinforcing that this is a core platform narrative, not just marketing collateral. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn21view4\\ue201\\n\\n**OS-layer advantage:**  \\nNo direct OS distribution control. However, security platforms often sit at chokepoints (network edges, secure access, DLP enforcement) that are OS-agnostic, which can be durable precisely because enterprises are heterogeneous.\\n\\n**Shipping today vs credible 24\\u201336 months:**  \\nShipping: Prisma AIRS capabilities and an active update cadence are visible on product pages; AI Access Security is documented with operational requirements (NGFW/Prisma Access integration). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view0\\ue202turn25view1\\ue201  \\n24\\u201336 months: Reuters reports Palo Alto\\u2019s expansion of AI-driven security offerings and notes \\u201cAgentiX\\u2026slated for launch in early 2026,\\u201d indicating near-term product expansion in agentic security operations. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn18news40\\ue201\\n\\n**Core competitive advantage:** As agents multiply, the marginal cost of a security failure rises. Palo Alto\\u2019s moat is building a **security control plane** that can govern agent usage across shadow AI, sanctioned apps, and custom agents\\u2014especially via DLP/policy enforcement and lifecycle security (scan \\u2192 posture \\u2192 runtime). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view1\\ue202turn25view0\\ue201\\n\\n**Key risks/failure modes:**  \\n- **Platform bypass:** if agent interactions move to encrypted/private channels or local-only execution without network chokepoints, enforcement could weaken.  \\n- **Fast-moving threat landscape:** agent-specific attacks (prompt injection, tool abuse) evolve; the platform must continuously update detection/prevention\\u2014implied by product update cadence but competitively demanding. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn25view0\\ue201  \\n- **Crowded vendor field:** many security vendors will claim \\u201cAI security.\\u201d Palo Alto\\u2019s differentiation must remain measurable in deployments (limited public deployment metrics in primary sources).\\n\\n### Okta\\n\\n**Where it captures value across the stack:**  \\nIdentity/governance: Okta\\u2019s thesis is that agents become \\u201cnon-human identities\\u201d requiring lifecycle governance. Okta\\u2019s materials define \\u201cAI agent identity\\u201d as a verifiable digital identity with privileges and continuous governance, emphasizing least privilege, contextual permissions, auditability, and rapid revocation. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view6\\ue201  \\nPlatform/standards: Okta\\u2019s Oktane 2025 coverage describes expanding the identity platform to include AI agents as \\u201cfirst-class identities\\u201d and introducing **Cross App Access** to control how agents access/interact with organizational resources. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view1\\ue201 Okta\\u2019s \\u201csecure AI\\u201d page frames Cross App Access as replacing ad-hoc consent prompts with policy-based decisions managed by the identity provider. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view0\\ue201\\n\\n**OS-layer advantage:**  \\nNo OS ownership. Okta\\u2019s distribution advantage comes from being an identity layer spanning SaaS and enterprise apps; in a mature agent world, identity becomes more central (agents act at machine speed and scale). \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view6\\ue202turn24view2\\ue201\\n\\n**Shipping today vs credible 24\\u201336 months:**  \\nShipping: Okta\\u2019s public materials now explicitly productize agent identity governance and cross-app access, not just generic IAM. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view2\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn24view0\\ue201  \\n24\\u201336 months: Standardization around cross-app agent access is plausible if enterprises demand unified controls. Okta is attempting to frame this as an industry protocol (Cross App Access). The extent of ecosystem adoption is not specified in primary sources; treat adoption rate as uncertain. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view1\\ue202turn24view0\\ue201\\n\\n**Core competitive advantage:** If enterprises treat agents as identities, then **identity becomes the agent control plane**: authentication, authorization, token vaulting, auditing, and deprovisioning. Okta is well-positioned because it is already embedded as an identity hub across heterogeneous SaaS stacks. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn24view2\\ue202turn7view6\\ue201\\n\\n**Key risks/failure modes:**  \\n- **Commoditization by cloud-native IAM:** hyperscalers could offer integrated agent identity controls tied to their platforms.  \\n- **Protocol fragmentation:** if each agent platform implements its own consent/authorization model, a cross-app standard may not emerge.  \\n- **Security trust events:** identity vendors are held to extremely high standards; any breach materially impacts adoption (general industry reality; not claimed as an Okta-specific event here).\\n\\n### Datadog\\n\\n**Where it captures value across the stack:**  \\nMonitoring/evaluation: Datadog\\u2019s LLM Observability is explicitly positioned as end-to-end tracing across AI agents with visibility into inputs/outputs, latency, token usage, errors, and includes structured experiments plus \\u201cquality and security evaluations.\\u201d \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view5\\ue202turn2search16\\ue201 This targets a durable operational need: keeping agent systems reliable and measurable in production.\\n\\n**OS-layer advantage:**  \\nNo OS layer; but observability platforms often win because they are **vendor-neutral**. If enterprises run agents across multiple clouds + endpoints, a neutral observability layer can become the \\u201csingle pane of glass.\\u201d\\n\\n**Shipping today vs credible 24\\u201336 months:**  \\nShipping: the product page explicitly references AI agents and evaluation constructs. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view5\\ue201  \\n24\\u201336 months: expansion is credible because eval/observability complexity grows with multi-agent workflows and tool calls (a structural inference consistent with product direction; roadmap dates not specified in primary sources).\\n\\n**Core competitive advantage:** Datadog can become the \\u201coperational truth\\u201d system for agent behavior\\u2014similar to how it became central for cloud app telemetry\\u2014if it maintains broad integrations and keeps evaluation primitives aligned with how agent stacks evolve. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn7view5\\ue201\\n\\n**Key risks/failure modes:**  \\n- **Native observability inside hyperscaler agent platforms:** AWS/Google/Microsoft embed tracing/eval features into their managed runtimes (e.g., Google notes tracing/monitoring/logging integration in Agent Builder), which could reduce the need for an external platform in some accounts. \\ue200cite\\ue202turn6view5\\ue201  \\n- **Open-source tooling pressure:** LLM observability has active open-source competition; Datadog must defend via integration breadth and enterprise sales motion (not quantified in primary sources here).\\n\\n## Comparison table and synthesis\\n\\n### Finalist comparison table\\n\\n| Finalist | Stack layers monetized (compute\\u2192OS) | OS leverage / distribution control | Evidence shipping today | Credible positioning in 24\\u201336 months | Core moat | Key risks |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Microsoft | Compute, models/catalog, orchestration (multi-agent), tooling, governance/compliance, OS-local AI + connector registry | Strong (Windows local AI + ODR;

\"Palo Alto Networks is strengthening its cybersecurity capabilities by expanding its artificial intelligence-driven offerings to counter increasingly frequent cyberattacks. The company is integrating AI tools with its planned acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity firm CyberArk Software to bolster its defense solutions. In response to recent high-profile breaches involving firms like F5 and UnitedHealth Group, Palo Alto launched enhanced versions of its security platforms\\u2014Cortex Cloud 2.0 and Prisma AIRS 2.0.\\n\\nPrisma AIRS 2.0 now incorporates technology from the recently acquired startup Protect AI, securing AI applications through all development stages and detecting vulnerabilities in other AI systems. Cortex Cloud 2.0 includes the new Cortex AgentiX platform and a cloud command center for a unified view of cloud-based risks, allowing users to customize virtual agents based on specific roles. CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized that the AI agents will maintain human oversight to prevent autonomous actions without user control. These agents are trained with data from 1.2 billion real-world security incident responses. The standalone AgentiX platform is slated for launch in early 2026. Pricing for the new AI offerings will align with the company's existing Cortex XSOAR incident response platform.\", \"attribution_segments\": null, \"supporting_websites\": [], \"refs\":
