That all of this is real.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:04\r\n\r\nMeaning what?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:05\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t you think so? All this AI stuff and all this Bay Area\u2026 that it\u2019s happening. Isn\u2019t it straight out of science fiction?\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:14\r\n\r\nAnother thing that\u2019s crazy is how normal the slow takeoff feels. The idea that we\u2019d be investing 1% of GDP in AI, I feel like it would have felt like a bigger deal, whereas right now it just feels...\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:26\r\n\r\nWe get used to things pretty fast, it turns out. But also it\u2019s kind of abstract. What does it mean? It means that you see it in the news, that such and such company announced such and such dollar amount. That\u2019s all you see. It\u2019s not really felt in any other way so far.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:45\r\n\r\nShould we actually begin here? I think this is an interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:47\r\n\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:48\r\n\r\nI think your point, about how from the average person\u2019s point of view nothing is that different, will continue being true even into the singularity.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:57\r\n\r\nNo, I don\u2019t think so.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:58\r\n\r\nOkay, interesting.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:01:00\r\n\r\nThe thing which I was referring to not feeling different is, okay, such and such company announced some difficult-to-comprehend dollar amount of investment. I don\u2019t think anyone knows what to do with that.\r\n\r\nBut I think the impact of AI is going to be felt. AI is going to be diffused through the economy. There\u2019ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:01:30\r\n\r\nWhen do you expect that impact? I think the models seem smarter than their economic impact would imply.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:01:38\r\n\r\nYeah. This is one of the very confusing things about the models right now. How to reconcile the fact that they are doing so well on evals? You look at the evals and you go, \u201cThose are pretty hard evals.\u201d They are doing so well. But the economic impact seems to be dramatically behind. It\u2019s very difficult to make sense of, how can the model, on the one hand, do these amazing things, and then on the other hand, repeat itself twice in some situation?\r\n\r\nAn example would be, let\u2019s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, \u201cCan you please fix the bug?\u201d And the model says, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.\u201d And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, \u201cYou have this new second bug,\u201d and it tells you, \u201cOh my God, how could I have done it? You\u2019re so right again,\u201d and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I\u2019m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.\r\n\r\nI have two possible explanations. The more whimsical explanation is that maybe RL training makes the models a little too single-minded and narrowly focused, a little bit too unaware, even though it also makes them aware in some other ways. Because of this, they can\u2019t do basic things.\r\n\r\nBut there is another explanation. Back when people were doing pre-training, the question of what data to train on was answered, because that answer was everything. When you do pre-training, you need all the data. So you don\u2019t have to think if it\u2019s going to be this data or that data.\r\n\r\nBut when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, \u201cOkay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.\u201d From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.\r\n\r\nOne thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, \u201cHey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?\u201d I think that is something that happens, and it could explain a lot of what\u2019s going on.\r\n\r\nIf you combine this with generalization of the models actually being inadequate, that has the potential to explain a lot of what we are seeing, this disconnect between eval performance and actual real-world performance, which is something that we don\u2019t today even understand, what we mean by that.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:05:00\r\n\r\nI like this idea that the real reward hacking is the human researchers who are too focused on the evals.\r\n\r\nI think there are two ways to understand, or to try to think about, what you have just pointed out. One is that if it\u2019s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you\u2019re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.\r\n\r\nAnother, maybe this is what you\u2019re hinting at, is to say, \u201cWhy should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn\u2019t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?\u201d Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:06:08\r\n\r\nI have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let\u2019s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.\r\n\r\nStudent number two thought, \u201cOh, competitive programming is cool.\u201d Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:06:56\r\n\r\nThe second.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:06:57\r\n\r\nRight. I think that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let\u2019s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let\u2019s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you\u2019ve got this great competitive programmer.\r\n\r\nWith this analogy, I think it\u2019s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it\u2019s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it\u2019s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:07:39\r\n\r\nBut then what is the analogy for what the second student is doing before they do the 100 hours of fine-tuning?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:07:48\r\n\r\nI think they have \u201cit.\u201d The \u201cit\u201d factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:08:01\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s interesting to distinguish \u201cit\u201d from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it\u2019s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice. It\u2019s just that you get that 10,000 hours of practice for free because it\u2019s already somewhere in the pre-training distribution. But maybe you\u2019re suggesting there\u2019s actually not that much generalization from pre-training. There\u2019s just so much data in pre-training, but it\u2019s not necessarily generalizing better than RL.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:08:31\r\n\r\nThe main strength of pre-training is that: A, there is so much of it, and B, you don\u2019t have to think hard about what data to put into pre-training. It\u2019s very natural data, and it does include in it a lot of what people do: people\u2019s thoughts and a lot of the features. It\u2019s like the whole world as projected by people onto text, and pre-training tries to capture that using a huge amount of data.\r\n\r\nPre-training is very difficult to reason about because it\u2019s so hard to understand the manner in which the model relies on pre-training data. Whenever the model makes a mistake, could it be because something by chance is not as supported by the pre-training data? \u201cSupport by pre-training\u201d is maybe a loose term. I don\u2019t know if I can add anything more useful on this. I don\u2019t think there is a human analog to pre-training.\r\n\r\n00:09:39 \u2013 Emotions and value functions\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:09:39\r\n\r\nHere are analogies that people have proposed for what the human analogy to pre-training is. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on why they\u2019re potentially wrong. One is to think about the first 18, or 15, or 13 years of a person\u2019s life when they aren\u2019t necessarily economically productive, but they are doing something that is making them understand the world better and so forth. The other is to think about evolution as doing some kind of search for 3 billion years, which then results in a human lifetime instance.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m curious if you think either of these are analogous to pre-training. How would you think about what lifetime human learning is like, if not pre-training?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:10:22\r\n\r\nI think there are some similarities between both of these and pre-training, and pre-training tries to play the role of both of these. But I think there are some big differences as well. The amount of pre-training data is very, very staggering.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:10:39\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:10:40\r\n\r\nSomehow a human being, after even 15 years with a tiny fraction of the pre-training data, they know much less. But whatever they do know, they know much more deeply somehow. Already at that age, you would not make mistakes that our AIs make.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing. You might say, could it be something like evolution? The answer is maybe. But in this case, I think evolution might actually have an edge. I remember reading about this case. One way in which neuroscientists can learn about the brain is by studying people with brain damage to different parts of the brain. Some people have the most strange symptoms you could imagine. It\u2019s actually really, really interesting.\r\n\r\nOne case that comes to mind that\u2019s relevant. I read about this person who had some kind of brain damage, a stroke or an accident, that took out his emotional processing. So he stopped feeling any emotion. He still remained very articulate and he could solve little puzzles, and on tests he seemed to be just fine. But he felt no emotion. He didn\u2019t feel sad, he didn\u2019t feel anger, he didn\u2019t feel animated. He became somehow extremely bad at making any decisions at all. It would take him hours to decide on which socks to wear. He would make very bad financial decisions.\r\n\r\nWhat does it say about the role of our built-in emotions in making us a viable agent, essentially? To connect to your question about pre-training, maybe if you are good enough at getting everything out of pre-training, you could get that as well. But that\u2019s the kind of thing which seems... Well, it may or may not be possible to get that from pre-training.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:12:56\r\n\r\nWhat is \u201cthat\u201d? Clearly not just directly emotion. It seems like some almost value function-like thing which is telling you what the end reward for any decision should be. You think that doesn\u2019t sort of implicitly come from pre-training?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:13:15\r\n\r\nI think it could. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not 100% obvious.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:13:19\r\n\r\nBut what is that? How do you think about emotions? What is the ML analogy for emotions?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:13:26\r\n\r\nIt should be some kind of a value function thing. But I don\u2019t think there is a great ML analogy because right now, value functions don\u2019t play a very prominent role in the things people do.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:13:36\r\n\r\nIt might be worth defining for the audience what a value function is, if you want to do that.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:13:39\r\n\r\nCertainly, I\u2019ll be very happy to do that. When people do reinforcement learning, the way reinforcement learning is done right now, how do people train those agents? You have your neural net and you give it a problem, and then you tell the model, \u201cGo solve it.\u201d The model takes maybe thousands, hundreds of thousands of actions or thoughts or something, and then it produces a solution. The solution is graded.\r\n\r\nAnd then the score is used to provide a training signal for every single action in your trajectory. That means that if you are doing something that goes for a long time\u2014if you\u2019re training a task that takes a long time to solve\u2014it will do no learning at all until you come up with the proposed solution. That\u2019s how reinforcement learning is done naively. That\u2019s how o1, R1 ostensibly are done.\r\n\r\nThe value function says something like, \u201cMaybe I could sometimes, not always, tell you if you are doing well or badly.\u201d The notion of a value function is more useful in some domains than others. For example, when you play chess and you lose a piece, I messed up. You don\u2019t need to play the whole game to know that what I just did was bad, and therefore whatever preceded it was also bad.\r\n\r\nThe value function lets you short-circuit the wait until the very end. Let\u2019s suppose that you are doing some kind of a math thing or a programming thing, and you\u2019re trying to explore a particular solution or direction. After, let\u2019s say, a thousand steps of thinking, you concluded that this direction is unpromising. As soon as you conclude this, you could already get a reward signal a thousand timesteps previously, when you decided to pursue down this path. You say, \u201cNext time I shouldn\u2019t pursue this path in a similar situation,\u201d long before you actually came up with the proposed solution.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:15:52\r\n\r\nThis was in the DeepSeek R1 paper\u2014 that the space of trajectories is so wide that maybe it\u2019s hard to learn a mapping from an intermediate trajectory and value. And also given that, in coding for example you\u2019ll have the wrong idea, then you\u2019ll go back, then you\u2019ll change something.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:16:12\r\n\r\nThis sounds like such a lack of faith in deep learning. Sure it might be difficult, but nothing deep learning can\u2019t do. My expectation is that a value function should be useful, and I fully expect that they will be used in the future, if not already.\r\n\r\nWhat I was alluding to with the person whose emotional center got damaged, it\u2019s more that maybe what it suggests is that the value function of humans is modulated by emotions in some important way that\u2019s hardcoded by evolution. And maybe that is important for people to be effective in the world.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:17:00\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the thing I was planning on asking you. There\u2019s something really interesting about emotions of the value function, which is that it\u2019s impressive that they have this much utility while still being rather simple to understand.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:17:15\r\n\r\nI have two responses. I do agree that compared to the kind of things that we learn and the things we are talking about, the kind of AI we are talking about, emotions are relatively simple. They might even be so simple that maybe you could map them out in a human-understandable way. I think it would be cool to do.\r\n\r\nIn terms of utility though, I think there is a thing where there is this complexity-robustness tradeoff, where complex things can be very useful, but simple things are very useful in a very broad range of situations. One way to interpret what we are seeing is that we\u2019ve got these emotions that evolved mostly from our mammal ancestors and then fine-tuned a little bit while we were hominids, just a bit. We do have a decent amount of social emotions though which mammals may lack. But they\u2019re not very sophisticated. And because they\u2019re not sophisticated, they serve us so well in this very different world compared to the one that we\u2019ve been living in.\r\n\r\nActually, they also make mistakes. For example, our emotions\u2026 Well actually, I don\u2019t know. Does hunger count as an emotion? It\u2019s debatable. But I think, for example, our intuitive feeling of hunger is not succeeding in guiding us correctly in this world with an abundance of food.\r\n\r\n00:18:49 \u2013 What are we scaling?\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:18:49\r\n\r\nPeople have been talking about scaling data, scaling parameters, scaling compute. Is there a more general way to think about scaling? What are the other scaling axes?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:19:00\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a perspective that I think might be true. The way ML used to work is that people would just tinker with stuff and try to get interesting results. That\u2019s what\u2019s been going on in the past.\r\n\r\nThen the scaling insight arrived. Scaling laws, GPT-3, and suddenly everyone realized we should scale. This is an example of how language affects thought. \u201cScaling\u201d is just one word, but it\u2019s such a powerful word because it informs people what to do. They say, \u201cLet\u2019s try to scale things.\u201d So you say, what are we scaling? Pre-training was the thing to scale. It was a particular scaling recipe.\r\n\r\nThe big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, \u201cHey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you\u2019ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.\u201d This is also great. Companies love this because it gives you a very low-risk way of investing your resources.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that. If you research, you need to be like, \u201cGo forth researchers and research and come up with something\u201d, versus get more data, get more compute. You know you\u2019ll get something from pre-training.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it looks like, based on various things some people say on Twitter, maybe it appears that Gemini have found a way to get more out of pre-training. At some point though, pre-training will run out of data. The data is very clearly finite. What do you do next? Either you do some kind of souped-up pre-training, a different recipe from the one you\u2019ve done before, or you\u2019re doing RL, or maybe something else. But now that compute is big, compute is now very big, in some sense we are back to the age of research.\r\n\r\nMaybe here\u2019s another way to put it. Up until 2020, from 2012 to 2020, it was the age of research. Now, from 2020 to 2025, it was the age of scaling\u2014maybe plus or minus, let\u2019s add error bars to those years\u2014because people say, \u201cThis is amazing. You\u2019ve got to scale more. Keep scaling.\u201d The one word: scaling.\r\n\r\nBut now the scale is so big. Is the belief really, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?\u201d It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. So it\u2019s back to the age of research again, just with big computers.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:22:06\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a very interesting way to put it. But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I\u2019m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss. What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:22:38\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve already witnessed a transition from one type of scaling to a different type of scaling, from pre-training to RL. Now people are scaling RL. Now based on what people say on Twitter, they spend more compute on RL than on pre-training at this point, because RL can actually consume quite a bit of compute. You do very long rollouts, so it takes a lot of compute to produce those rollouts. Then you get a relatively small amount of learning per rollout, so you really can spend a lot of compute.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t even call it scaling. I would say, \u201cHey, what are you doing? Is the thing you are doing the most productive thing you could be doing? Can you find a more productive way of using your compute?\u201d We\u2019ve discussed the value function business earlier. Maybe once people get good at value functions, they will be using their resources more productively. If you find a whole other way of training models, you could say, \u201cIs this scaling or is it just using your resources?\u201d I think it becomes a little bit ambiguous.\r\n\r\nIn the sense that, when people were in the age of research back then, it was, \u201cLet\u2019s try this and this and this. Let\u2019s try that and that and that. Oh, look, something interesting is happening.\u201d I think there will be a return to that.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:24:10\r\n\r\nIf we\u2019re back in the era of research, stepping back, what is the part of the recipe that we need to think most about? When you say value function, people are already trying the current recipe, but then having LLM-as-a-Judge and so forth. You could say that\u2019s a value function, but it sounds like you have something much more fundamental in mind. Should we even rethink pre-training at all and not just add more steps to the end of that process?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:24:35\r\n\r\nThe discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that\u2019s going to make RL more efficient, and I think that makes a difference. But I think anything you can do with a value function, you can do without, just more slowly. The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people. It\u2019s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.\r\n\r\n00:25:13 \u2013 Why humans generalize better than models\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:25:13\r\n\r\nSo this is the crux: generalization. There are two sub-questions. There\u2019s one which is about sample efficiency: why should it take so much more data for these models to learn than humans? There\u2019s a second question. Even separate from the amount of data it takes, why is it so hard to teach the thing we want to a model than to a human? For a human, we don\u2019t necessarily need a verifiable reward to be able to\u2026 You\u2019re probably mentoring a bunch of researchers right now, and you\u2019re talking with them, you\u2019re showing them your code, and you\u2019re showing them how you think. From that, they\u2019re picking up your way of thinking and how they should do research.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to set a verifiable reward for them that\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, this is the next part of the curriculum, and now this is the next part of your curriculum. Oh, this training was unstable.\u201d There\u2019s not this schleppy, bespoke process. Perhaps these two issues are actually related in some way, but I\u2019d be curious to explore this second thing, which is more like continual learning, and this first thing, which feels just like sample efficiency.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:26:19\r\n\r\nYou could actually wonder that one possible explanation for the human sample efficiency that needs to be considered is evolution. Evolution has given us a small amount of the most useful information possible. For things like vision, hearing, and locomotion, I think there\u2019s a pretty strong case that evolution has given us a lot.\r\n\r\nFor example, human dexterity far exceeds\u2026 I mean robots can become dexterous too if you subject them to a huge amount of training in simulation. But to train a robot in the real world to quickly pick up a new skill like a person does seems very out of reach. Here you could say, \u201cOh yeah, locomotion. All our ancestors needed great locomotion, squirrels. So with locomotion, maybe we\u2019ve got some unbelievable prior.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou could make the same case for vision. I believe Yann LeCun made the point that children learn to drive after 10 hours of practice, which is true. But our vision is so good. At least for me, I remember myself being a five-year-old. I was very excited about cars back then. I\u2019m pretty sure my car recognition was more than adequate for driving already as a five-year-old. You don\u2019t get to see that much data as a five-year-old. You spend most of your time in your parents\u2019 house, so you have very low data diversity.\r\n\r\nBut you could say maybe that\u2019s evolution too. But in language and math and coding, probably not.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:28:00\r\n\r\nIt still seems better than models. Obviously, models are better than the average human at language, math, and coding. But are they better than the average human at learning?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:28:09\r\n\r\nOh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. What I meant to say is that language, math, and coding\u2014and especially math and coding\u2014suggests that whatever it is that makes people good at learning is probably not so much a complicated prior, but something more, some fundamental thing.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:28:29\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I understood. Why should that be the case?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:28:32\r\n\r\nSo consider a skill in which people exhibit some kind of great reliability. If the skill is one that was very useful to our ancestors for many millions of years, hundreds of millions of years, you could argue that maybe humans are good at it because of evolution, because we have a prior, an evolutionary prior that\u2019s encoded in some very non-obvious way that somehow makes us so good at it.\r\n\r\nBut if people exhibit great ability, reliability, robustness, and ability to learn in a domain that really did not exist until recently, then this is more an indication that people might have just better machine learning, period.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:29:29\r\n\r\nHow should we think about what that is? What is the ML analogy? There are a couple of interesting things about it. It takes fewer samples. It\u2019s more unsupervised. A child learning to drive a car\u2026 Children are not learning to drive a car. A teenager learning how to drive a car is not exactly getting some prebuilt, verifiable reward. It comes from their interaction with the machine and with the environment. It takes much fewer samples. It seems more unsupervised. It seems more robust?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:30:07\r\n\r\nMuch more robust. The robustness of people is really staggering.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:30:12\r\n\r\nDo you have a unified way of thinking about why all these things are happening at once? What is the ML analogy that could realize something like this?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:30:24\r\n\r\nOne of the things that you\u2019ve been asking about is how can the teenage driver self-correct and learn from their experience without an external teacher? The answer is that they have their value function. They have a general sense which is also, by the way, extremely robust in people. Whatever the human value function is, with a few exceptions around addiction, it\u2019s actually very, very robust.\r\n\r\nSo for something like a teenager that\u2019s learning to drive, they start to drive, and they already have a sense of how they\u2019re driving immediately, how badly they are, how unconfident. And then they see, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then, of course, the learning speed of any teenager is so fast. After 10 hours, you\u2019re good to go.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:31:17\r\n\r\nIt seems like humans have some solution, but I\u2019m curious about how they are doing it and why is it so hard? How do we need to reconceptualize the way we\u2019re training models to make something like this possible?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:31:27\r\n\r\nThat is a great question to ask, and it\u2019s a question I have a lot of opinions about. But unfortunately, we live in a world where not all machine learning ideas are discussed freely, and this is one of them. There\u2019s probably a way to do it. I think it can be done. The fact that people are like that, I think it\u2019s a proof that it can be done.\r\n\r\nThere may be another blocker though, which is that there is a possibility that the human neurons do more compute than we think. If that is true, and if that plays an important role, then things might be more difficult. But regardless, I do think it points to the existence of some machine learning principle that I have opinions on. But unfortunately, circumstances make it hard to discuss in detail.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:32:28\r\n\r\nNobody listens to this podcast, Ilya.\r\n\r\n00:35:45 \u2013 Straight-shotting superintelligence\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:35:45\r\n\r\nI\u2019m curious. If you say we are back in an era of research, you were there from 2012 to 2020. What is the vibe now going to be if we go back to the era of research?\r\n\r\nFor example, even after AlexNet, the amount of compute that was used to run experiments kept increasing, and the size of frontier systems kept increasing. Do you think now that this era of research will still require tremendous amounts of compute? Do you think it will require going back into the archives and reading old papers?\r\n\r\nYou were at Google and OpenAI and Stanford, these places, when there was more of a vibe of research? What kind of things should we be expecting in the community?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:36:38\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the age of scaling is that scaling sucked out all the air in the room. Because scaling sucked out all the air in the room, everyone started to do the same thing. We got to the point where we are in a world where there are more companies than ideas by quite a bit. Actually on that, there is this Silicon Valley saying that says that ideas are cheap, execution is everything. People say that a lot, and there is truth to that. But then I saw someone say on Twitter something like, \u201cIf ideas are so cheap, how come no one\u2019s having any ideas?\u201d And I think it\u2019s true too.\r\n\r\nIf you think about research progress in terms of bottlenecks, there are several bottlenecks. One of them is ideas, and one of them is your ability to bring them to life, which might be compute but also engineering. If you go back to the \u201890s, let\u2019s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.\r\n\r\nThen in the age of scaling, compute has increased a lot. Of course, there is a question of how much compute is needed, but compute is large. Compute is large enough such that it\u2019s not obvious that you need that much more compute to prove some idea. I\u2019ll give you an analogy. AlexNet was built on two GPUs. That was the total amount of compute used for it. The transformer was built on 8 to 64 GPUs. No single transformer paper experiment used more than 64 GPUs of 2017, which would be like, what, two GPUs of today? The ResNet, right? You could argue that the o1 reasoning was not the most compute-heavy thing in the world.\r\n\r\nSo for research, you definitely need some amount of compute, but it\u2019s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever for research. You might argue, and I think it is true, that if you want to build the absolutely best system then it helps to have much more compute. Especially if everyone is within the same paradigm, then compute becomes one of the big differentiators.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:39:41\r\n\r\nI\u2019m asking you for the history, because you were actually there. I\u2019m not sure what actually happened. It sounds like it was possible to develop these ideas using minimal amounts of compute. But the transformer didn\u2019t immediately become famous. It became the thing everybody started doing and then started experimenting on top of and building on top of because it was validated at higher and higher levels of compute.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:40:06\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:40:07\r\n\r\nAnd if you at SSI have 50 different ideas, how will you know which one is the next transformer and which one is brittle, without having the kinds of compute that other frontier labs have?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:40:22\r\n\r\nI can comment on that. The short comment is that you mentioned SSI. Specifically for us, the amount of compute that SSI has for research is really not that small. I want to explain why. Simple math can explain why the amount of compute that we have is comparable for research than one might think. I\u2019ll explain.\r\n\r\nSSI has raised $3 billion, which is a lot by any absolute sense. But you could say, \u201cLook at the other companies raising much more.\u201d But a lot of their compute goes for inference. These big numbers, these big loans, it\u2019s earmarked for inference. That\u2019s number one. Number two, if you want to have a product on which you do inference, you need to have a big staff of engineers, salespeople. A lot of the research needs to be dedicated to producing all kinds of product-related features. So then when you look at what\u2019s actually left for research, the difference becomes a lot smaller.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:42:02\r\n\r\nThere have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they\u2019re spending on inference and so forth. So it seems like they\u2019re spending more a year running research experiments than you guys have in total funding.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:42:22\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s a question of what you do with it. It\u2019s a question of what you do with it. In their case, in the case of others, there is a lot more demand on the training compute. There\u2019s a lot more different work streams, there are different modalities, there is just more stuff. So it becomes fragmented.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:42:44\r\n\r\nHow will SSI make money?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:42:46\r\n\r\nMy answer to this question is something like this. Right now, we just focus on the research, and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:43:01\r\n\r\nIs SSI\u2019s plan still to straight shot superintelligence?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:43:04\r\n\r\nMaybe. I think that there is merit to it. I think there\u2019s a lot of merit because it\u2019s very nice to not be affected by the day-to-day market competition. But I think there are two reasons that may cause us to change the plan. One is pragmatic, if timelines turned out to be long, which they might. Second, I think there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world. I think this is a meaningfully valuable thing.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:43:48\r\n\r\nSo then why is your default plan to straight shot superintelligence? Because it sounds like OpenAI, Anthropic, all these other companies, their explicit thinking is, \u201cLook, we have weaker and weaker intelligences that the public can get used to and prepare for.\u201d Why is it potentially better to build a superintelligence directly?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:44:08\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll make the case for and against. The case for is that one of the challenges that people face when they\u2019re in the market is that they have to participate in the rat race. The rat race is quite difficult in that it exposes you to difficult trade-offs which you need to make. It is nice to say, \u201cWe\u2019ll insulate ourselves from all this and just focus on the research and come out only when we are ready, and not before.\u201d But the counterpoint is valid too, and those are opposing forces. The counterpoint is, \u201cHey, it is useful for the world to see powerful AI. It is useful for the world to see powerful AI because that\u2019s the only way you can communicate it.\u201d\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:44:57\r\n\r\nWell, I guess not even just that you can communicate the idea\u2014\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:45:00\r\n\r\nCommunicate the AI, not the idea. Communicate the AI.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:45:04\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean, \u201ccommunicate the AI\u201d?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:45:06\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s suppose you write an essay about AI, and the essay says, \u201cAI is going to be this, and AI is going to be that, and it\u2019s going to be this.\u201d You read it and you say, \u201cOkay, this is an interesting essay.\u201d Now suppose you see an AI doing this, an AI doing that. It is incomparable. Basically I think that there is a big benefit from AI being in the public, and that would be a reason for us to not be quite straight shot.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:45:37\r\n\r\nI guess it\u2019s not even that, but I do think that is an important part of it. The other big thing is that I can\u2019t think of another discipline in human engineering and research where the end artifact was made safer mostly through just thinking about how to make it safe, as opposed to, why airplane crashes per mile are so much lower today than they were decades ago. Why is it so much harder to find a bug in Linux than it would have been decades ago? I think it\u2019s mostly because these systems were deployed to the world. You noticed failures, those failures were corrected and the systems became more robust.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure why AGI and superhuman intelligence would be any different, especially given\u2014and I hope we\u2019re going to get to this\u2014it seems like the harms of superintelligence are not just about having some malevolent paper clipper out there. But this is a really powerful thing and we don\u2019t even know how to conceptualize how people interact with it, what people will do with it. Having gradual access to it seems like a better way to maybe spread out the impact of it and to help people prepare for it.\r\n\r\n00:46:47 \u2013 SSI\u2019s model will learn from deployment\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:46:47\r\n\r\nWell I think on this point, even in the straight shot scenario, you would still do a gradual release of it, that\u2019s how I would imagine it. Gradualism would be an inherent component of any plan. It\u2019s just a question of what is the first thing that you get out of the door. That\u2019s number one.\r\n\r\nNumber two, I believe you have advocated for continual learning more than other people, and I actually think that this is an important and correct thing. Here is why. I\u2019ll give you another example of how language affects thinking. In this case, it will be two words that have shaped everyone\u2019s thinking, I maintain. First word: AGI. Second word: pre-training. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nThe term AGI, why does this term exist? It\u2019s a very particular term. Why does it exist? There\u2019s a reason. The reason that the term AGI exists is, in my opinion, not so much because it\u2019s a very important, essential descriptor of some end state of intelligence, but because it is a reaction to a different term that existed, and the term is narrow AI. If you go back to ancient history of gameplay and AI, of checkers AI, chess AI, computer games AI, everyone would say, look at this narrow intelligence. Sure, the chess AI can beat Kasparov, but it can\u2019t do anything else. It is so narrow, artificial narrow intelligence. So in response, as a reaction to this, some people said, this is not good. It is so narrow. What we need is general AI, an AI that can just do all the things. That term just got a lot of traction.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that got a lot of traction is pre-training, specifically the recipe of pre-training. I think the way people do RL now is maybe undoing the conceptual imprint of pre-training. But pre-training had this property. You do more pre-training and the model gets better at everything, more or less uniformly. General AI. Pre-training gives AGI.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that happened with AGI and pre-training is that in some sense they overshot the target. If you think about the term \u201cAGI\u201d, especially in the context of pre-training, you will realize that a human being is not an AGI. Yes, there is definitely a foundation of skills, but a human being lacks a huge amount of knowledge. Instead, we rely on continual learning.\r\n\r\nSo when you think about, \u201cOkay, so let\u2019s suppose that we achieve success and we produce some kind of safe superintelligence.\u201d The question is, how do you define it? Where on the curve of continual learning is it going to be?\r\n\r\nI produce a superintelligent 15-year-old that\u2019s very eager to go. They don\u2019t know very much at all, a great student, very eager. You go and be a programmer, you go and be a doctor, go and learn. So you could imagine that the deployment itself will involve some kind of a learning trial-and-error period. It\u2019s a process, as opposed to you dropping the finished thing.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:50:45\r\n\r\nI see. You\u2019re suggesting that the thing you\u2019re pointing out with superintelligence is not some finished mind which knows how to do every single job in the economy. Because the way, say, the original OpenAI charter or whatever defines AGI is like, it can do every single job, every single thing a human can do. You\u2019re proposing instead a mind which can learn to do every single job, and that is superintelligence.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:51:15\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:51:16\r\n\r\nBut once you have the learning algorithm, it gets deployed into the world the same way a human laborer might join an organization.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:51:25\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:51:26\r\n\r\nIt seems like one of these two things might happen, maybe neither of these happens. One, this super-efficient learning algorithm becomes superhuman, becomes as good as you and potentially even better, at the task of ML research. As a result the algorithm itself becomes more and more superhuman.\r\n\r\nThe other is, even if that doesn\u2019t happen, if you have a single model\u2014this is explicitly your vision\u2014where instances of a model which are deployed through the economy doing different jobs, learning how to do those jobs, continually learning on the job, picking up all the skills that any human could pick up, but picking them all up at the same time, and then amalgamating their learnings, you basically have a model which functionally becomes superintelligent even without any sort of recursive self-improvement in software. Because you now have one model that can do every single job in the economy and humans can\u2019t merge our minds in the same way. So do you expect some sort of intelligence explosion from broad deployment?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:52:30\r\n\r\nI think that it is likely that we will have rapid economic growth. I think with broad deployment, there are two arguments you could make which are conflicting. One is that once indeed you get to a point where you have an AI that can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong force to deploy them in the economy unless there will be some kind of a regulation that stops it, which by the way there might be.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of very rapid economic growth for some time, I think it\u2019s very possible from broad deployment. The question is how rapid it\u2019s going to be. I think this is hard to know because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big and there\u2019s a lot of stuff, and that stuff moves at a different speed. But then on the other hand, now the AI could\u2026 So I think very rapid economic growth is possible. We will see all kinds of things like different countries with different rules and the ones which have the friendlier rules, the economic growth will be faster. Hard to predict.\r\n\r\n00:55:07 \u2013 Alignment\r\nDwarkesh Patel 00:55:07\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this is a very precarious situation to be in. In the limit, we know that this should be possible. If you have something that is as good as a human at learning, but which can merge its brains\u2014merge different instances in a way that humans can\u2019t merge\u2014already, this seems like a thing that should physically be possible. Humans are possible, digital computers are possible. You just need both of those combined to produce this thing.\r\n\r\nIt also seems this kind of thing is extremely powerful. Economic growth is one way to put it. A Dyson sphere is a lot of economic growth. But another way to put it is that you will have, in potentially a very short period of time... You hire people at SSI, and in six months, they\u2019re net productive, probably. A human learns really fast, and this thing is becoming smarter and smarter very fast. How do you think about making that go well? Why is SSI positioned to do that well? What is SSI\u2019s plan there, is basically what I\u2019m trying to ask.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 00:56:10\r\n\r\nOne of the ways in which my thinking has been changing is that I now place more importance on AI being deployed incrementally and in advance. One very difficult thing about AI is that we are talking about systems that don\u2019t yet exist and it\u2019s hard to imagine them.\r\n\r\nI think that one of the things that\u2019s happening is that in practice, it\u2019s very hard to feel the AGI. It\u2019s very hard to feel the AGI. We can talk about it, but imagine having a conversation about how it is like to be old when you\u2019re old and frail. You can have a conversation, you can try to imagine it, but it\u2019s just hard, and you come back to reality where that\u2019s not the case. I think that a lot of the issues around AGI and its future power stem from the fact that it\u2019s very difficult to imagine. Future AI is going to be different. It\u2019s going to be powerful. Indeed, the whole problem, what is the problem of AI and AGI? The whole problem is the power. The whole problem is the power.\r\n\r\nWhen the power is really big, what\u2019s going to happen? One of the ways in which I\u2019ve changed my mind over the past year\u2014and that change of mind, I\u2019ll hedge a little bit, may back-propagate into the plans of our company\u2014is that if it\u2019s hard to imagine, what do you do? You\u2019ve got to be showing the thing. You\u2019ve got to be showing the thing. I maintain that most people who work on AI also can\u2019t imagine it because it\u2019s too different from what people see on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nI do maintain, here\u2019s something which I predict will happen. This is a prediction. I maintain that as AI becomes more powerful, people will change their behaviors. We will see all kinds of unprecedented things which are not happening right now. I\u2019ll give some examples. I think for better or worse, the frontier companies will play a very important role in what happens, as will the government. The kind of things that I think you\u2019ll see, which you see the beginnings of, are companies that are fierce competitors starting to collaborate on AI safety. You may have seen OpenAI and Anthropic doing a first small step, but that did not exist. That\u2019s something which I predicted in one of my talks about three years ago, that such a thing will happen. I also maintain that as AI continues to become more powerful, more visibly powerful, there will also be a desire from governments and the public to do something. I think this is a very important force, of showing the AI.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s number one. Number two, okay, so the AI is being built. What needs to be done? One thing that I maintain that will happen is that right now, people who are working on AI, I maintain that the AI doesn\u2019t feel powerful because of its mistakes. I do think that at some point the AI will start to feel powerful actually. I think when that happens, we will see a big change in the way all AI companies approach safety. They\u2019ll become much more paranoid. I say this as a prediction that we will see happen. We\u2019ll see if I\u2019m right. But I think this is something that will happen because they will see the AI becoming more powerful. Everything that\u2019s happening right now, I maintain, is because people look at today\u2019s AI and it\u2019s hard to imagine the future AI.\r\n\r\nThere is a third thing which needs to happen. I\u2019m talking about it in broader terms, not just from the perspective of SSI because you asked me about our company. The question is, what should the companies aspire to build? What should they aspire to build? There has been one big idea that everyone has been locked into, which is the self-improving AI. Why did it happen? Because there are fewer ideas than companies. But I maintain that there is something that\u2019s better to build, and I think that everyone will want that.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the AI that\u2019s robustly aligned to care about sentient life specifically. I think in particular, there\u2019s a case to be made that it will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient. And if you think about things like mirror neurons and human empathy for animals, which you might argue it\u2019s not big enough, but it exists. I think it\u2019s an emergent property from the fact that we model others with the same circuit that we use to model ourselves, because that\u2019s the most efficient thing to do.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:02:06\r\n\r\nSo even if you got an AI to care about sentient beings\u2014and it\u2019s not actually clear to me that that\u2019s what you should try to do if you solved alignment\u2014it would still be the case that most sentient beings will be AIs. There will be trillions, eventually quadrillions, of AIs. Humans will be a very small fraction of sentient beings. So it\u2019s not clear to me if the goal is some kind of human control over this future civilization, that this is the best criterion.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:02:37\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s possible it\u2019s not the best criterion. I\u2019ll say two things. Number one, care for sentient life, I think there is merit to it. It should be considered. I think it would be helpful if there was some kind of short list of ideas that the companies, when they are in this situation, could use. That\u2019s number two.\r\n\r\nNumber three, I think it would be really materially helpful if the power of the most powerful superintelligence was somehow capped because it would address a lot of these concerns. The question of how to do it, I\u2019m not sure, but I think that would be materially helpful when you\u2019re talking about really, really powerful systems.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:03:35\r\n\r\nBefore we continue the alignment discussion, I want to double-click on that. How much room is there at the top? How do you think about superintelligence? Do you think, using this learning efficiency idea, maybe it is just extremely fast at learning new skills or new knowledge? Does it just have a bigger pool of strategies? Is there a single cohesive \u201cit\u201d in the center that\u2019s more powerful or bigger? If so, do you imagine that this will be sort of godlike in comparison to the rest of human civilization, or does it just feel like another agent, or another cluster of agents?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:04:10\r\n\r\nThis is an area where different people have different intuitions. I think it will be very powerful, for sure. What I think is most likely to happen is that there will be multiple such AIs being created roughly at the same time. I think that if the cluster is big enough\u2014like if the cluster is literally continent-sized\u2014that thing could be really powerful, indeed. If you literally have a continent-sized cluster, those AIs can be very powerful. All I can tell you is that if you\u2019re talking about extremely powerful AIs, truly dramatically powerful, it would be nice if they could be restrained in some ways or if there were some kind of agreement or something.\r\n\r\nWhat is the concern of superintelligence? What is one way to explain the concern? If you imagine a system that is sufficiently powerful, really sufficiently powerful\u2014and you could say you need to do something sensible like care for sentient life in a very single-minded way\u2014we might not like the results. That\u2019s really what it is.\r\n\r\nMaybe, by the way, the answer is that you do not build an RL agent in the usual sense. I\u2019ll point several things out. I think human beings are semi-RL agents. We pursue a reward, and then the emotions or whatever make us tire out of the reward and we pursue a different reward. The market is a very short-sighted kind of agent. Evolution is the same. Evolution is very intelligent in some ways, but very dumb in other ways. The government has been designed to be a never-ending fight between three parts, which has an effect. So I think things like this.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that makes this discussion difficult is that we are talking about systems that don\u2019t exist, that we don\u2019t know how to build. That\u2019s the other thing and that\u2019s actually my belief. I think what people are doing right now will go some distance and then peter out. It will continue to improve, but it will also not be \u201cit\u201d. The \u201cIt\u201d we don\u2019t know how to build, and a lot hinges on understanding reliable generalization.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll say another thing. One of the things that you could say about what causes alignment to be difficult is that your ability to learn human values is fragile. Then your ability to optimize them is fragile. You actually learn to optimize them. And can\u2019t you say, \u201cAre these not all instances of unreliable generalization?\u201d Why is it that human beings appear to generalize so much better? What if generalization was much better? What would happen in this case? What would be the effect? But those questions are right now still unanswerable.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:07:21\r\n\r\nHow does one think about what AI going well looks like? You\u2019ve scoped out how AI might evolve. We\u2019ll have these sort of continual learning agents. AI will be very powerful. Maybe there will be many different AIs. How do you think about lots of continent-sized compute intelligences going around? How dangerous is that? How do we make that less dangerous? And how do we do that in a way that protects an equilibrium where there might be misaligned AIs out there and bad actors out there?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:07:58\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s one reason why I liked \u201cAI that cares for sentient life\u201d. We can debate on whether it\u2019s good or bad. But if the first N of these dramatic systems do care for, love, humanity or something, care for sentient life, obviously this also needs to be achieved. This needs to be achieved. So if this is achieved by the first N of those systems, then I can see it go well, at least for quite some time.\r\n\r\nThen there is the question of what happens in the long run. How do you achieve a long-run equilibrium? I think that there, there is an answer as well. I don\u2019t like this answer, but it needs to be considered.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, you might say, \u201cOkay, if you have a world where powerful AIs exist, in the short term, you could say you have universal high income. You have universal high income and we\u2019re all doing well.\u201d But what do the Buddhists say? \u201cChange is the only constant.\u201d Things change. There is some kind of government, political structure thing, and it changes because these things have a shelf life. Some new government thing comes up and it functions, and then after some time it stops functioning. That\u2019s something that we see happening all the time.\r\n\r\nSo I think for the long-run equilibrium, one approach is that you could say maybe every person will have an AI that will do their bidding, and that\u2019s good. If that could be maintained indefinitely, that\u2019s true. But the downside with that is then the AI goes and earns money for the person and advocates for their needs in the political sphere, and maybe then writes a little report saying, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, here\u2019s the situation,\u201d and the person says, \u201cGreat, keep it up.\u201d But the person is no longer a participant. Then you can say that\u2019s a precarious place to be in.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to preface by saying I don\u2019t like this solution, but it is a solution. The solution is if people become part-AI with some kind of Neuralink++. Because what will happen as a result is that now the AI understands something, and we understand it too, because now the understanding is transmitted wholesale. So now if the AI is in some situation, you are involved in that situation yourself fully. I think this is the answer to the equilibrium.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:10:47\r\n\r\nI wonder if the fact that emotions which were developed millions\u2014or in many cases, billions\u2014of years ago in a totally different environment are still guiding our actions so strongly is an example of alignment success.\r\n\r\nTo spell out what I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s more accurate to call it a value function or reward function\u2014but the brainstem has a directive where it\u2019s saying, \u201cMate with somebody who\u2019s more successful.\u201d The cortex is the part that understands what success means in the modern context. But the brainstem is able to align the cortex and say, \u201cHowever you recognize success to be\u2014and I\u2019m not smart enough to understand what that is\u2014 you\u2019re still going to pursue this directive.\u201d\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:11:36\r\n\r\nI think there\u2019s a more general point. I think it\u2019s actually really mysterious how evolution encodes high-level desires. It\u2019s pretty easy to understand how evolution would endow us with the desire for food that smells good because smell is a chemical, so just pursue that chemical. It\u2019s very easy to imagine evolution doing that thing.\r\n\r\nBut evolution also has endowed us with all these social desires. We really care about being seen positively by society. We care about being in good standing. All these social intuitions that we have, I feel strongly that they\u2019re baked in. I don\u2019t know how evolution did it because it\u2019s a high-level concept that\u2019s represented in the brain.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say you care about some social thing, it\u2019s not a low-level signal like smell. It\u2019s not something for which there is a sensor. The brain needs to do a lot of processing to piece together lots of bits of information to understand what\u2019s going on socially. Somehow evolution said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you should care about.\u201d How did it do it?\r\n\r\nIt did it quickly, too. All these sophisticated social things that we care about, I think they evolved pretty recently. Evolution had an easy time hard-coding this high-level desire. I\u2019m unaware of a good hypothesis for how it\u2019s done. I had some ideas I was kicking around, but none of them are satisfying.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:13:26\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s especially impressive is it was desire that you learned in your lifetime, it makes sense because your brain is intelligent. It makes sense why you would be able to learn intelligent desires. Maybe this is not your point, but one way to understand it is that the desire is built into the genome, and the genome is not intelligent. But you\u2019re somehow able to describe this feature. It\u2019s not even clear how you define that feature, and you can build it into the genes.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:13:55\r\n\r\nEssentially, or maybe I\u2019ll put it differently. If you think about the tools that are available to the genome, it says, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s a recipe for building a brain.\u201d You could say, \u201cHere is a recipe for connecting the dopamine neurons to the smell sensor.\u201d And if the smell is a certain kind of good smell, you want to eat that.\r\n\r\nI could imagine the genome doing that. I\u2019m claiming that it is harder to imagine. It\u2019s harder to imagine the genome saying you should care about some complicated computation that your entire brain, a big chunk of your brain, does. That\u2019s all I\u2019m claiming. I can tell you a speculation of how it could be done. Let me offer a speculation, and I\u2019ll explain why the speculation is probably false.\r\n\r\nSo the brain has brain regions. We have our cortex. It has all those brain regions. The cortex is uniform, but the brain regions and the neurons in the cortex kind of speak to their neighbors mostly. That explains why you get brain regions. Because if you want to do some kind of speech processing, all the neurons that do speech need to talk to each other. And because neurons can only speak to their nearby neighbors, for the most part, it has to be a region.\r\n\r\nAll the regions are mostly located in the same place from person to person. So maybe evolution hard-coded literally a location on the brain. So it says, \u201cOh, when the GPS coordinates of the brain such and such, when that fires, that\u2019s what you should care about.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s what evolution did because that would be within the toolkit of evolution.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:15:35\r\n\r\nYeah, although there are examples where, for example, people who are born blind have that area of their cortex adopted by another sense. I have no idea, but I\u2019d be surprised if the desires or the reward functions which require a visual signal no longer worked for people who have their different areas of their cortex co-opted.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you no longer have vision, can you still feel the sense that I want people around me to like me and so forth, which usually there are also visual cues for.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:16:12\r\n\r\nI fully agree with that. I think there\u2019s an even stronger counterargument to this theory. There are people who get half of their brains removed in childhood, and they still have all their brain regions. But they all somehow move to just one hemisphere, which suggests that the brain regions, their location is not fixed and so that theory is not true.\r\n\r\nIt would have been cool if it was true, but it\u2019s not. So I think that\u2019s a mystery. But it\u2019s an interesting mystery. The fact is that somehow evolution was able to endow us to care about social stuff very, very reliably. Even people who have all kinds of strange mental conditions and deficiencies and emotional problems tend to care about this also.\r\n\r\n01:18:13 \u2013 \u201cWe are squarely an age of research company\u201d\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:18:13\r\n\r\nWhat is SSI planning on doing differently? Presumably your plan is to be one of the frontier companies when this time arrives. Presumably you started SSI because you\u2019re like, \u201cI think I have a way of approaching how to do this safely in a way that the other companies don\u2019t.\u201d What is that difference?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:18:36\r\n\r\nThe way I would describe it is that there are some ideas that I think are promising and I want to investigate them and see if they are indeed promising or not. It\u2019s really that simple. It\u2019s an attempt. If the ideas turn out to be correct\u2014these ideas that we discussed around understanding generalization\u2014then I think we will have something worthy.\r\n\r\nWill they turn out to be correct? We are doing research. We are squarely an \u201cage of research\u201d company. We are making progress. We\u2019ve actually made quite good progress over the past year, but we need to keep making more progress, more research. That\u2019s how I see it. I see it as an attempt to be a voice and a participant.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:19:29\r\n\r\nYour cofounder and previous CEO left to go to Meta recently, and people have asked, \u201cWell, if there were a lot of breakthroughs being made, that seems like a thing that should have been unlikely.\u201d I wonder how you respond.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:19:45\r\n\r\nFor this, I will simply remind a few facts that may have been forgotten. I think these facts which provide the context explain the situation. The context was that we were fundraising at a $32 billion valuation, and then Meta came in and offered to acquire us, and I said no. But my former cofounder in some sense said yes. As a result, he also was able to enjoy a lot of near-term liquidity, and he was the only person from SSI to join Meta.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:20:27\r\n\r\nIt sounds like SSI\u2019s plan is to be a company that is at the frontier when you get to this very important period in human history where you have superhuman intelligence. You have these ideas about how to make superhuman intelligence go well. But other companies will be trying their own ideas. What distinguishes SSI\u2019s approach to making superintelligence go well?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:20:49\r\n\r\nThe main thing that distinguishes SSI is its technical approach. We have a different technical approach that I think is worthy and we are pursuing it.\r\n\r\nI maintain that in the end there will be a convergence of strategies. I think there will be a convergence of strategies where at some point, as AI becomes more powerful, it\u2019s going to become more or less clearer to everyone what the strategy should be. It should be something like, you need to find some way to talk to each other and you want your first actual real superintelligent AI to be aligned and somehow care for sentient life, care for people, democratic, one of those, some combination thereof.\r\n\r\nI think this is the condition that everyone should strive for. That\u2019s what SSI is striving for. I think that this time, if not already, all the other companies will realize that they\u2019re striving towards the same thing. We\u2019ll see. I think that the world will truly change as AI becomes more powerful. I think things will be really different and people will be acting really differently.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:22:14\r\n\r\nSpeaking of forecasts, what are your forecasts to this system you\u2019re describing, which can learn as well as a human and subsequently, as a result, become superhuman?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:22:26\r\n\r\nI think like 5 to 20.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:22:28\r\n\r\n5 to 20 years?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:22:29\r\n\r\nMhm.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:22:30\r\n\r\nI just want to unroll how you might see the world coming. It\u2019s like, we have a couple more years where these other companies are continuing the current approach and it stalls out. \u201cStalls out\u201d here meaning they earn no more than low hundreds of billions in revenue? How do you think about what stalling out means?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:22:49\r\n\r\nI think stalling out will look like\u2026it will all look very similar among all the different companies. It could be something like this. I\u2019m not sure because I think even with stalling out, I think these companies could make a stupendous revenue. Maybe not profits because they will need to work hard to differentiate each other from themselves, but revenue definitely.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:23:20\r\n\r\nBut something in your model implies that when the correct solution does emerge, there will be convergence between all the companies. I\u2019m curious why you think that\u2019s the case.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:23:32\r\n\r\nI was talking more about convergence on their alignment strategies. I think eventual convergence on the technical approach is probably going to happen as well, but I was alluding to convergence to the alignment strategies. What exactly is the thing that should be done?\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:23:46\r\n\r\nI just want to better understand how you see the future unrolling. Currently, we have these different companies, and you expect their approach to continue generating revenue but not get to this human-like learner. So now we have these different forks of companies. We have you, we have Thinking Machines, there\u2019s a bunch of other labs. Maybe one of them figures out the correct approach. But then the release of their product makes it clear to other people how to do this thing.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:24:09\r\n\r\nI think it won\u2019t be clear how to do it, but it will be clear that something different is possible, and that is information. People will then be trying to figure out how that works. I do think though that one of the things not addressed here, not discussed, is that with each increase in the AI\u2019s capabilities, I think there will be some kind of changes, but I don\u2019t know exactly which ones, in how things are being done. I think it\u2019s going to be important, yet I can\u2019t spell out what that is exactly.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:24:49\r\n\r\nBy default, you would expect the company that has that model to be getting all these gains because they have the model that has the skills and knowledge that it\u2019s building up in the world. What is the reason to think that the benefits of that would be widely distributed and not just end up at whatever model company gets this continuous learning loop going first?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:25:13\r\n\r\nHere is what I think is going to happen. Number one, let\u2019s look at how things have gone so far with the AIs of the past. One company produced an advance and the other company scrambled and produced some similar things after some amount of time and they started to compete in the market and push the prices down. So I think from the market perspective, something similar will happen there as well.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about the good world, by the way. What\u2019s the good world? It\u2019s where we have these powerful human-like learners that are also\u2026 By the way, maybe there\u2019s another thing we haven\u2019t discussed on the spec of the superintelligent AI that I think is worth considering. It\u2019s that you make it narrow, it can be useful and narrow at the same time. You can have lots of narrow superintelligent AIs.\r\n\r\nBut suppose you have many of them and you have some company that\u2019s producing a lot of profits from it. Then you have another company that comes in and starts to compete. The way the competition is going to work is through specialization. Competition loves specialization. You see it in the market, you see it in evolution as well. You\u2019re going to have lots of different niches and you\u2019re going to have lots of different companies who are occupying different niches. In this world we might say one AI company is really quite a bit better at some area of really complicated economic activity and a different company is better at another area. And the third company is really good at litigation.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:27:18\r\n\r\nIsn\u2019t this contradicted by what human-like learning implies? It\u2019s that it can learn\u2026\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:27:21\r\n\r\nIt can, but you have accumulated learning. You have a big investment. You spent a lot of compute to become really, really good, really phenomenal at this thing. Someone else spent a huge amount of compute and a huge amount of experience to get really good at some other thing. You apply a lot of human learning to get there, but now you are at this high point where someone else would say, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to start learning what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:27:48\r\n\r\nI guess that would require many different companies to begin at the human-like continual learning agent at the same time so that they can start their different tree search in different branches. But if one company gets that agent first, or gets that learner first, it does then seem like\u2026 Well, if you just think about every single job in the economy, having an instance learning each one seems tractable for a company.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:28:19\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a valid argument. My strong intuition is that it\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to go. The argument says it will go this way, but my strong intuition is that it will not go this way. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. I think that\u2019s going to be one of those.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:28:41\r\n\r\nA lot of people\u2019s models of recursive self-improvement literally, explicitly state we will have a million Ilyas in a server that are coming up with different ideas, and this will lead to a superintelligence emerging very fast.\r\n\r\nDo you have some intuition about how parallelizable the thing you are doing is? What are the gains from making copies of Ilya?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:29:02\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know. I think there\u2019ll definitely be diminishing returns because you want people who think differently rather than the same. If there were literal copies of me, I\u2019m not sure how much more incremental value you\u2019d get. People who think differently, that\u2019s what you want.\r\n\r\n01:29:23 \u2013 Self-play and multi-agent\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:29:23\r\n\r\nWhy is it that if you look at different models, even released by totally different companies trained on potentially non-overlapping datasets, it\u2019s actually crazy how similar LLMs are to each other?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:29:38\r\n\r\nMaybe the datasets are not as non-overlapping as it seems.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:29:41\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s some sense in which even if an individual human might be less productive than the future AI, maybe there\u2019s something to the fact that human teams have more diversity than teams of AIs might have. How do we elicit meaningful diversity among AIs? I think just raising the temperature just results in gibberish. You want something more like different scientists have different prejudices or different ideas. How do you get that kind of diversity among AI agents?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:30:06\r\n\r\nSo the reason there has been no diversity, I believe, is because of pre-training. All the pre-trained models are pretty much the same because they pre-train on the same data. Now RL and post-training is where some differentiation starts to emerge because different people come up with different RL training.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:30:26\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard you hint in the past about self-play as a way to either get data or match agents to other agents of equivalent intelligence to kick off learning. How should we think about why there are no public proposals of this kind of thing working with LLMs?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:30:49\r\n\r\nI would say there are two things to say. The reason why I thought self-play was interesting is because it offered a way to create models using compute only, without data. If you think that data is the ultimate bottleneck, then using compute only is very interesting. So that\u2019s what makes it interesting.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that self-play, at least the way it was done in the past\u2014when you have agents which somehow compete with each other\u2014it\u2019s only good for developing a certain set of skills. It is too narrow. It\u2019s only good for negotiation, conflict, certain social skills, strategizing, that kind of stuff. If you care about those skills, then self-play will be useful.\r\n\r\nActually, I think that self-play did find a home, but just in a different form. So things like debate, prover-verifier, you have some kind of an LLM-as-a-Judge which is also incentivized to find mistakes in your work. You could say this is not exactly self-play, but this is a related adversarial setup that people are doing, I believe.\r\n\r\nReally self-play is a special case of more general competition between agents. The natural response to competition is to try to be different. So if you were to put multiple agents together and you tell them, \u201cYou all need to work on some problem and you are an agent and you\u2019re inspecting what everyone else is working,\u201d they\u2019re going to say, \u201cWell, if they\u2019re already taking this approach, it\u2019s not clear I should pursue it. I should pursue something differentiated.\u201d So I think something like this could also create an incentive for a diversity of approaches.\r\n\r\n01:32:42 \u2013 Research taste\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:32:42\r\n\r\nFinal question: What is research taste? You\u2019re obviously the person in the world who is considered to have the best taste in doing research in AI. You were the co-author on the biggest things that have happened in the history of deep learning, from AlexNet to GPT-3 to so on. What is it, how do you characterize how you come up with these ideas?\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:33:14\r\n\r\nI can comment on this for myself. I think different people do it differently. One thing that guides me personally is an aesthetic of how AI should be, by thinking about how people are, but thinking correctly. It\u2019s very easy to think about how people are incorrectly, but what does it mean to think about people correctly?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll give you some examples. The idea of the artificial neuron is directly inspired by the brain, and it\u2019s a great idea. Why? Because you say the brain has all these different organs, it has the folds, but the folds probably don\u2019t matter. Why do we think that the neurons matter? Because there are many of them. It kind of feels right, so you want the neuron. You want some local learning rule that will change the connections between the neurons. It feels plausible that the brain does it.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the distributed representation. The idea that the brain responds to experience therefore our neural net should learn from experience. The brain learns from experience, the neural net should learn from experience. You kind of ask yourself, is something fundamental or not fundamental? How things should be.\r\n\r\nI think that\u2019s been guiding me a fair bit, thinking from multiple angles and looking for almost beauty, beauty and simplicity. Ugliness, there\u2019s no room for ugliness. It\u2019s beauty, simplicity, elegance, correct inspiration from the brain. All of those things need to be present at the same time. The more they are present, the more confident you can be in a top-down belief.\r\n\r\nThe top-down belief is the thing that sustains you when the experiments contradict you. Because if you trust the data all the time, well sometimes you can be doing the correct thing but there\u2019s a bug. But you don\u2019t know that there is a bug. How can you tell that there is a bug? How do you know if you should keep debugging or you conclude it\u2019s the wrong direction? It\u2019s the top-down. You can say things have to be this way. Something like this has to work, therefore we\u2019ve got to keep going. That\u2019s the top-down, and it\u2019s based on this multifaceted beauty and inspiration by the brain.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:35:31\r\n\r\nAlright, we\u2019ll leave it there.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:35:33\r\n\r\nThank you so much.\r\n\r\nDwarkesh Patel 01:35:34\r\n\r\nIlya, thank you so much.\r\n\r\nIlya Sutskever 01:35:36\r\n\r\nAlright.

The puzzle: smart on evals, dumb in the world  \nIlya starts from the core tension: frontier models crush benchmarks yet still fail in weird, \u201cjagged\u201d ways (e.g., fixing one bug while re-introducing another). That gap, he thinks, is not a minor annoyance but a clue that current training recipes (pre-training + eval-driven RL) are fundamentally mis-specified. He even suggests that the *real* reward hacking is humans over-optimizing models for public evals, not for broad real-world competence.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Generalization: humans vs models  \nHe argues the central problem is *generalization*:\n\n- Humans learn with far fewer samples and are vastly more robust across domains.  \n- Evolution gives us strong priors for vision, locomotion, etc., but that can\u2019t explain how well humans learn *modern* skills like math and coding, which didn\u2019t exist in our ancestral environment.  \n- Therefore, humans probably embody a deeper, more powerful learning principle, not just a richer prior.  \n\nIlya believes such a principle *exists* and is implementable in ML, but he explicitly refuses to say what he thinks it is, citing the competitive environment.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Emotions, value functions, and continual learning  \nHe connects neuroscience and RL:\n\n- Emotions behave like a built-in value function: they give humans dense, ongoing feedback about whether decisions and trajectories are good or bad.  \n- Current RL for LLMs is largely \u201csparse\u201d (reward at the end of a long trajectory); he expects explicit value functions to become much more central for efficiency and robustness.  \n- He also reframes AGI: instead of a fully \u201cfinished\u201d mind that knows how to do every job, he imagines a *superhuman learner*\u2014like an ultra-talented 15-year-old: extremely fast at learning any job, then continually learning in deployment.  \n\nThis pushes him toward a world where models *must* learn on the job, not just be pre-trained once and frozen.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. From the age of scaling back to the age of research  \nIlya slices recent AI history into phases:\n\n- **2012\u20132020:** \u201cAge of research\u201d \u2014 many ideas, relatively modest compute.  \n- **~2020\u20132025:** \u201cAge of scaling\u201d \u2014 pre-training plus scaling laws gave a simple recipe: more data, bigger models, more compute. Everyone converged on essentially the same paradigm.  \n- **Now:** he thinks we are exiting pure scaling. Data is finite, and simply 100\u00d7-ing compute will not magically fix generalization. We\u2019re re-entering an \u201cage of research\u201d, but *with* enormous compute.  \n\nCrucially, he thinks future progress depends less on raw scaling and more on discovering better training principles and architectures.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. SSI\u2019s thesis and strategy  \nFor Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), he frames the core bet as:\n\n- Focus nearly entirely on **research**, not on a sprawling product/inference business.  \n- Use their $3B to get *enough* compute to validate a different technical path, not to compete head-on in inference scale.  \n- Aim to crack the generalization/learning-efficiency problem and build systems that learn like humans from deployment.  \n\nHe insists SSI has a distinct technical approach (especially around reliable generalization), though he keeps the details opaque. The company\u2019s identity is \u201csquarely an age-of-research company.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Superintelligence, deployment, and economic impact  \nOn timelines and dynamics:\n\n- He gives **5\u201320 years** for a system that can learn as well as a human and thereby become superhuman via deployment.  \n- He expects **rapid economic growth** once such systems exist, but notes the world is large and physical, so growth will still be constrained by non-digital bottlenecks.  \n- He increasingly believes **gradual, visible deployment** of increasingly powerful AI is necessary so society, governments, and companies can *feel* the power and react appropriately, rather than relying purely on abstract argument.  \n\nEven in his \u201cstraight shot\u201d vision, deployment would still be gradual\u2014just starting from a much more capable base model.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Alignment: caring about sentient life and capping power  \nHis alignment picture has a few key pieces:\n\n- He thinks the *first* really powerful systems should be **robustly aligned to care about sentient life**, not just human life\u2014partly because AIs themselves will be sentient, and empathy-like mechanisms (\u201cmirror neurons\u201d analogues) may emerge more naturally if the object of concern includes them.  \n- He worries about extremely powerful, continent-scale clusters and suggests it would be \u201cmaterially helpful\u201d if the maximum power of superintelligence could somehow be capped or constrained.  \n- He expects that as models visibly become more powerful, AI labs will become **much more paranoid** and there will be more real collaboration on safety between fierce competitors, plus strong pressure from governments and the public.  \n\nFor the very long run, he speculates that to maintain meaningful human agency, humans may need to become **part-AI** (Neuralink++ style), so we don\u2019t end up with AIs acting purely as proxies while humans fade into passive observers.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. Multi-agent setups, self-play, and diversity  \nOn training setups:\n\n- He notes that current LLMs are strikingly similar because pre-training data and recipes are similar.  \n- RL and post-training start to differentiate them; multi-agent and adversarial setups (debate, prover-verifier, LLM-as-judge) are, in his view, a kind of generalized self-play.  \n- True diversity will likely come from **agents competing and specializing**\u2014different agents (or companies) exploring different economic and cognitive niches rather than everyone building the same monolith.  \n\n---\n\n### 9. Research taste and method  \nFinally, he describes his research taste:\n\n- Guided by an aesthetic of **beauty, simplicity, and correct inspiration from the brain**.  \n- He looks for ideas that feel structurally right\u2014like neurons, distributed representations, learning from experience\u2014and avoids \u201cugly\u201d hacks.  \n- This yields a strong **top-down belief** that something *has* to work, which then keeps him pushing through experimental setbacks and bugs instead of abandoning promising directions too early.  \n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, next step could be:  \n- a thematic map (e.g. \u201cgeneralization\u201d, \u201cdeployment & economy\u201d, \u201calignment & governance\u201d) with direct quotes under each, or  \n- a critical analysis of where his story is strongest vs where it looks hand-wavy or strategically self-serving."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":97,"end_ix":118,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"Ilya Sutskever.txt","id":"file-BodW9J5Ab53FkGgxM6oGj2","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":7,"cited_message_id":"1855aab2-047b-44c2-aa57-a6d5cb8819f9","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null}}}],"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201","start_idx":97,"end_idx":118,"alt":null,"type":"file","name":"Ilya Sutskever.txt","id":"file-BodW9J5Ab53FkGgxM6oGj2","source":"my_files","snippet":"","cloud_doc_url":null,"medical_file_reference":{"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null,"journal_homepage_url":null},"input_pointer":{"message_index":0,"message_id":"1855aab2-047b-44c2-aa57-a6d5cb8819f9","file_index":0,"line_range_start":null,"line_range_end":null},"fff_metadata":null,"connector_id":null}],"gizmo_id":"g-p-69268b6ae1e88191a2897848dd05b756","request_id":"333ec6b6-47ab-4ef4-9359-7215257b0a09","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"a155af6b-8e33-4eef-aef1-76d777d29a81","turn_exchange_id":"8d409cda-d557-461c-bcda-d03d272a3624","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"a155af6b-8e33-4eef-aef1-76d777d29a81","children":["8b4d4e97-e28f-4582-81eb-49243f92460b","cb1565d8-548e-4420-bd78-165c195f4069","6dcc3e01-9ab8-49da-a920-9d4c5490144d"]},"8b4d4e97-e28f-4582-81eb-49243f92460b":{"id":"8b4d4e97-e28f-4582-81eb-49243f92460b","message":{"id":"8b4d4e97-e28f-4582-81eb-49243f92460b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764162347.724,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Verify if these points were mentioned by Ilya in his interview\n\n---\n\n- superintelligence in 5-20 years\r\n- current scaling will stall hard;

All this AI stuff and all this Bay Area\u2026 that it\u2019s happening. Isn\u2019t it straight out of science fiction?\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:14\\n\\nAnother thing that\u2019s crazy is how normal the slow takeoff feels. The idea that we\u2019d be investing 1% of GDP in AI, I feel like it would have felt like a bigger deal, whereas right now it just feels...\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:26\\n\\nWe get used to things pretty fast, it turns out. But also it\u2019s kind of abstract. What does it mean? It means that you see it in the news, that such and such company announced such and such dollar amount. That\u2019s all you see. It\u2019s not really felt in any other way so far.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:45\\n\\nShould we actually begin here? I think this is an interesting discussion.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:47\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:48\\n\\nI think your point, about how from the average person\u2019s point of view nothing is that different, will continue being true even into the singularity.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:57\\n\\nNo, I don\u2019t think so.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:58\\n\\nOkay, interesting.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:01:00\\n\\nThe thing which I was referring to not feeling different is, okay, such and such company announced some difficult-to-comprehend dollar amount of investment. I don\u2019t think anyone knows what to do with that.\\n\\nBut I think the impact of AI is going to be felt. AI is going to be diffused through the economy. There\u2019ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:01:30\\n\\nWhen do you expect that impact? I think the models seem smarter than their economic impact would imply.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:01:38\\n\\nYeah. This is one of the very confusing things about the models right now. How to reconcile the fact that they are doing so well on evals? You look at the evals and you go, \u201cThose are pretty hard evals.\u201d They are doing so well. But the economic impact seems to be dramatically behind. It\u2019s very difficult to make sense of, how can the model, on the one hand, do these amazing things, and then on the other hand, repeat itself twice in some situation?\\n\\nAn example would be, let\u2019s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, \u201cCan you please fix the bug?\u201d And the model says, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.\u201d And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, \u201cYou have this new second bug,\u201d and it tells you, \u201cOh my God, how could I have done it? You\u2019re so right again,\u201d and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I\u2019m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.\\n\\nI have two possible explanations. The more whimsical explanation is that maybe RL training makes the models a little too single-minded and narrowly focused, a little bit too unaware, even though it also makes them aware in some other ways. Because of this, they can\u2019t do basic things.\\n\\nBut there is another explanation. Back when people were doing pre-training, the question of what data to train on was answered, because that answer was everything. When you do pre-training, you need all the data. So you don\u2019t have to think if it\u2019s going to be this data or that data.\\n\\nBut when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, \u201cOkay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.\u201d From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.\\n\\nOne thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, \u201cHey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?\u201d I think that is something that happens, \""}}},{"msg_type":"status","parent_header":{"msg_id":"8e0518c9-13df0745b281e56da2ce56d2_3_2","version":"5.3"},"content":{"execution_state":"idle"}}],"timeout_triggered":null},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Verifying bullet points in interview transcript","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"08f90d4b-e209-4a89-8c99-fc779db10a85","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e385e0fd-0f98-4f33-a0be-6f741fa7711f","turn_exchange_id":"1387c7dc-c47c-4494-abcd-91028c62a0c5","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e385e0fd-0f98-4f33-a0be-6f741fa7711f","children":["84195843-5b10-437f-9d53-74dd7d55f806"]},"d4037233-3b10-4e4d-b6e1-051d9a983fbc":{"id":"d4037233-3b10-4e4d-b6e1-051d9a983fbc","message":{"id":"d4037233-3b10-4e4d-b6e1-051d9a983fbc","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1764162372.6147895,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"system_error","name":"MissingSourceFilter","text":"Missing source_filter. source_filter must be a non-empty list[str] of valid source names.

All this AI stuff and all this Bay Area\u2026 that it\u2019s happening. Isn\u2019t it straight out of science fiction?\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:14\\n\\nAnother thing that\u2019s crazy is how normal the slow takeoff feels. The idea that we\u2019d be investing 1% of GDP in AI, I feel like it would have felt like a bigger deal, whereas right now it just feels...\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:26\\n\\nWe get used to things pretty fast, it turns out. But also it\u2019s kind of abstract. What does it mean? It means that you see it in the news, that such and such company announced such and such dollar amount. That\u2019s all you see. It\u2019s not really felt in any other way so far.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:45\\n\\nShould we actually begin here? I think this is an interesting discussion.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:47\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:48\\n\\nI think your point, about how from the average person\u2019s point of view nothing is that different, will continue being true even into the singularity.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:00:57\\n\\nNo, I don\u2019t think so.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:00:58\\n\\nOkay, interesting.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:01:00\\n\\nThe thing which I was referring to not feeling different is, okay, such and such company announced some difficult-to-comprehend dollar amount of investment. I don\u2019t think anyone knows what to do with that.\\n\\nBut I think the impact of AI is going to be felt. AI is going to be diffused through the economy. There\u2019ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.\\n\\nDwarkesh Patel 00:01:30\\n\\nWhen do you expect that impact? I think the models seem smarter than their economic impact would imply.\\n\\nIlya Sutskever 00:01:38\\n\\nYeah. This is one of the very confusing things about the models right now. How to reconcile the fact that they are doing so well on evals? You look at the evals and you go, \u201cThose are pretty hard evals.\u201d They are doing so well. But the economic impact seems to be dramatically behind. It\u2019s very difficult to make sense of, how can the model, on the one hand, do these amazing things, and then on the other hand, repeat itself twice in some situation?\\n\\nAn example would be, let\u2019s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, \u201cCan you please fix the bug?\u201d And the model says, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.\u201d And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, \u201cYou have this new second bug,\u201d and it tells you, \u201cOh my God, how could I have done it? You\u2019re so right again,\u201d and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I\u2019m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.\\n\\nI have two possible explanations. The more whimsical explanation is that maybe RL training makes the models a little too single-minded and narrowly focused, a little bit too unaware, even though it also makes them aware in some other ways. Because of this, they can\u2019t do basic things.\\n\\nBut there is another explanation. Back when people were doing pre-training, the question of what data to train on was answered, because that answer was everything. When you do pre-training, you need all the data. So you don\u2019t have to think if it\u2019s going to be this data or that data.\\n\\nBut when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, \u201cOkay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.\u201d From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.\\n\\nOne thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, \u201cHey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?\u201d I think that is something that happens, \""}}},{"msg_type":"status","parent_header":{"msg_id":"13a14672-223ca2bdd0d12a69c8ab0831_3_4","version":"5.3"},"content":{"execution_state":"idle"}}],"timeout_triggered":null},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Accessing user-uploaded file via Python","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"4e787b5d-1b53-463c-b290-00b304d3dfb6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8e4cce3c-7643-40cc-9e74-31a1ff2f704b","turn_exchange_id":"5c689a8a-674a-481d-8921-c9b84b273494","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8e4cce3c-7643-40cc-9e74-31a1ff2f704b","children":["6cf8e154-0381-4b28-8392-03d488d2c9c8"]},"072528c3-1976-4011-8766-7231578caf60":{"id":"072528c3-1976-4011-8766-7231578caf60","message":{"id":"072528c3-1976-4011-8766-7231578caf60","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1764162847.768798,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["No search results matched your queries.\n\nNote that a source being available does not imply that the user has synced data from that source yet; in case they haven't synced / connected a source yet, no documents will be returned from that source.

No single transformer paper \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}},{"msg_type":"status","parent_header":{"msg_id":"8e0518c9-13df0745b281e56da2ce56d2_3_8","version":"5.3"},"content":{"execution_state":"idle"}}],"timeout_triggered":null},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for \"age of scaling\" references","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"08f90d4b-e209-4a89-8c99-fc779db10a85","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ca07099b-8b37-4162-8c33-917055193c25","turn_exchange_id":"1387c7dc-c47c-4494-abcd-91028c62a0c5","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ca07099b-8b37-4162-8c33-917055193c25","children":["65268568-5c8f-4897-81fb-03d72a2f93d3"]},"6be95c6d-62bb-4702-b005-85ec43da11cb":{"id":"6be95c6d-62bb-4702-b005-85ec43da11cb","message":{"id":"6be95c6d-62bb-4702-b005-85ec43da11cb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764162411.263259,"update_time":1764162411.2711,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["for pat in [\"5\u201320\", \"5- 20\", \"5 to 20\", \"5, 20\", \"five to twenty\", \"5-10 years\", \"10-20 years\", \"ten to twenty\"]:\n    print(\"PAT\", pat)\n    find_snippets(pat)"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-69268b6ae1e88191a2897848dd05b756","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for alternative form patterns","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"4e787b5d-1b53-463c-b290-00b304d3dfb6","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"103bb164-b767-4bf5-873a-798db4c57d9f","turn_exchange_id":"5c689a8a-674a-481d-8921-c9b84b273494","can_save":true},"recipient":"python","channel":null},"parent":"103bb164-b767-4bf5-873a-798db4c57d9f","children":["73529db5-ad08-4123-af01-fbc7c220aa0e"]},"383169b5-da43-46ef-ac8e-e2210c46f45b":{"id":"383169b5-da43-46ef-ac8e-e2210c46f45b","message":{"id":"383169b5-da43-46ef-ac8e-e2210c46f45b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764162865.78504,"update_time":1764162865.819167,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["import re, textwrap, math, statistics, itertools, json"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200012]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-69268b6ae1e88191a2897848dd05b756","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for key concepts and numbers in text","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"dd964205-eacf-45ab-8ea1-1544458964fc","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"73b459ee-30c2-4759-8cd3-5f5b2a4cf036","turn_exchange_id":"010650cb-dc4c-4854-86b1-5532c80502e0","can_save":true},"recipient":"python","channel":null},"parent":"73b459ee-30c2-4759-8cd3-5f5b2a4cf036","children":["1d517103-7d1a-43ab-a7ef-adc599ccf698"]},"65268568-5c8f-4897-81fb-03d72a2f93d3":{"id":"65268568-5c8f-4897-81fb-03d72a2f93d3","message":{"id":"65268568-5c8f-4897-81fb-03d72a2f93d3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764175525.890057,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Checking for more context on research statement","content":"I\u2019ve located a part around 19516 where Ilya mentions, \"in some sense we are back to the age of research.\" I need more context on this to fully understand his point.

When you do pre-training, you need all the data. So you don\u2019t have to think if it\u2019s going to be this data or that data.\n\nBut when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, \u201cOkay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.\u201d From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.\n\nOne thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, \u201cHey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?\u201d I think that is something that happens, and it could explain a lot of what\u2019s going on.\n\nIf you combine this with generalization of the models actually being inadequate, that has the potential to explain a lot of what we are seeing, this disconnect between eval performance and actual real-world performance, which is something that we don\u2019t today even understand, what we mean by that.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:05:00\n\nI like this idea that the real reward hacking is the human researchers who are too focused on the evals.\n\nI think there are two ways to understand, or to try to think about, what you have just pointed out. One is that if it\u2019s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you\u2019re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.\n\nAnother, maybe this is what you\u2019re hinting at, is to say, \u201cWhy should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn\u2019t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?\u201d Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:06:08\n\nI have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let\u2019s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.\n\nStudent number two thought, \u201cOh, competitive programming is cool.\u201d Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:06:56\n\nThe second.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:06:57\n\nRight. I think that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let\u2019s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let\u2019s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you\u2019ve got this great competitive programmer.\n\nWith this analogy, I think it\u2019s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it\u2019s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it\u2019s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:07:39\n\nBut then what is the analogy for what the second student is doing before they do the 100 hours of fine-tuning?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:07:48\n\nI think they have \u201cit.\u201d The \u201cit\u201d factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:08:01\n\nI think it\u2019s interesting to distinguish \u201cit\u201d from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it\u2019s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice.

One is that if it\u2019s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you\u2019re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.\n\nAnother, maybe this is what you\u2019re hinting at, is to say, \u201cWhy should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn\u2019t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?\u201d Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:06:08\n\nI have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let\u2019s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.\n\nStudent number two thought, \u201cOh, competitive programming is cool.\u201d Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:06:56\n\nThe second.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:06:57\n\nRight. I think that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let\u2019s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let\u2019s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you\u2019ve got this great competitive programmer.\n\nWith this analogy, I think it\u2019s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it\u2019s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it\u2019s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:07:39\n\nBut then what is the analogy for what the second student is doing before they do the 100 hours of fine-tuning?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:07:48\n\nI think they have \u201cit.\u201d The \u201cit\u201d factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:08:01\n\nI think it\u2019s interesting to distinguish \u201cit\u201d from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it\u2019s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice.

Maybe not profits because they will need to work hard to differentiate each other from themselves, but revenue definitely.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 01:23:20\n\nBut something in your model implies that when the correct solution does emerge, there will be convergence between all the companies.

From that, they\u2019re picking up your way of thinking and how they should do research.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to set a verifiable reward for them that\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, this is the next part of the curriculum, and now this is the next part of your curriculum. Oh, this training was unstable.\u201d There\u2019s not this schleppy, bespoke process. Perhaps these two issues are actually related in some way, but I\u2019d be curious to explore this second thing, which is more like continual learning, and this first thing, which feels just like sample efficiency.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:26:19\n\nYou could actually wonder that one possible explanation for the human sample efficiency that needs to be considered is evolution. Evolution has given us a small amount of the most useful information possible. For things like vision, hearing, and locomotion, I think there\u2019s a pretty strong case that evolution has given us a lot.\n\nFor example, human dexterity far exceeds\u2026 I mean robots can become dexterous too if you subject them to a huge amount of training in simulation. But to train a robot in the real world to quickly pick up a new skill like a person does seems very out of reach. Here you could say, \u201cOh yeah, locomotion. All our ancestors needed great locomotion, squirrels. So with locomotion, maybe we\u2019ve got some unbelievable prior.\u201d\n\nYou could make the same case for vision. I believe Yann LeCun made the point that children learn to drive after 10 hours of practice, which is true. But our vision is so good. At least for me, I remember myself being a five-year-old. I was very excited about cars back then. I\u2019m pretty sure my car recognition was more than adequate for driving already as a five-year-old. You don\u2019t get to see that much data as a five-year-old. You spend most of your time in your parents\u2019 house, so you have very low data diversity.\n\nBut you could say maybe that\u2019s evolution too. But in language and math and coding, probably not.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:28:00\n\nIt still seems better than models. Obviously, models are better than the average human at language, math, and coding. But are they better than the average human at learning?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:28:09\n\nOh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. What I meant to say is that language, math, and coding\u2014and especially math and coding\u2014suggests that whatever it is that makes people good at learning is probably not so much a complicated prior, but something more, some fundamental thing.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:28:29\n\nI\u2019m not sure I understood. Why should that be the case?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:28:32\n\nSo consider a skill in which p\n"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_complete":true,"aggregate_result":{"status":"success","run_id":"8fcc0395-f679-4762-ae04-d28267bf7ff2","start_time":1764175617.6090076,"update_time":1764175619.293065,"code":"print(text[23000:26000])","end_time":1764175619.293065,"final_expression_output":null,"in_kernel_exception":null,"system_exception":null,"messages":[{"message_type":"stream","time":1764175619.0123658,"stream_name":"stdout","sender":"server","text":"ke so much more data for these models to learn than humans?

So do you expect some sort of intelligence explosion from broad deployment?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:52:30\n\nI think that it is likely that we will have rapid economic growth. I think with broad deployment, there are two arguments you could make which are conflicting. One is that once indeed you get to a point where you have an AI that can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong  \n\nthat can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong force to deploy them in the economy unless there will be some kind of a regulation that stops it, which by the way there might be.\n\nBut the idea of very rapid economic growth for some time, I think it\u2019s very possible from broad deployment. The question is how rapid it\u2019s going to be. I think this is hard to know because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big an \n\nw because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big and there\u2019s a lot of stuff, and that stuff moves at a different speed. But then on the other hand, now the AI could\u2026 So I think very rapid economic growth is possible. We will see all kinds of things like different countries with different rules and the ones which have the friendlier rules, the economic growth will be faster.

You just need both of those combined to produce this thing.\n\nIt also seems this kind of thing is extremely powerful. Economic growth is one way to put it. A Dyson sphere is a lot of economic growth. But another way to put it is that you will have, in potentially a very short period of time... You hire people at SSI, and in six months, they\u2019re net productive, probably. A human learns really fast, and this thing is becoming smarter and smarter v \n\n--- GDP ---\n\u2019t you think so?

I\u2019ll explain.\n\nSSI has raised $3 billion, which is a lot by any absolute sense. But you could say, \u201cLook at the other companies raising much more.\u201d But a lot of their compute goes for inference. These big numbers, these big loans, it\u2019s earmarked for inference. That\u2019s number one. Number two, if you want to have a product on which you do inference, you need to have a big staff of engineers, salespeople. A lot of the research needs to be dedicated to producing all kinds of product-related features. So then when you look at what\u2019s actually left for research, the difference becomes a lot smaller.\n\nThe other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:42:02\n\nThere have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they\u2019re spending on inference and so forth. So it seems like they\u2019re spending more a year running research experiments than you guys have in total funding.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:42:22\n\nI think it\u2019s a question of what you do with it. It\u2019s a question of what you do with it. In their case, in the case of others, there is a lot more demand on the training compute. There\u2019s a lot more different work streams, there are different modalities, there is just more stuff. So it becomes fragmented.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:42:44\n\nHow will SSI make money?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:42:46\n\nMy answer to this question is something like this. Right now, we just focus on the research, and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:43:01\n\nIs SSI\u2019s plan still to straight shot superintelligence?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:43:04\n\nMaybe. I think that there is merit to it. I think there\u2019s a lot of merit because it\u2019s very nice to not be affected by the day-to-day market competition. But I think there are two reasons that may cause us to change the plan. One is pragmatic, if timelines turned out to be long, which they might.

If you go back to the \u201890s, let\u2019s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.\n\nThen in the age of scaling, compute has increased a lot. Of course, there is a question of how much compute is needed, but compute is large. Compute is large enough such that it\u2019s not obvious that you need that much more compute to prove some idea. I\u2019ll give you an analogy. AlexNet was built on two GPUs. That was the total amount of compute used for it. The transformer was built on 8 to 64 GPUs. No single transformer paper experiment used more than 64 GPUs of 2017, which would be like, what, two GPUs of today? The ResNet, right?

Sutskever, who now leads Safe Superintelligence Inc., argued that while increasing compute and data access has fueled AI advancements over the last five years, this strategy may be nearing its limits. According to him, the industry\u2019s reliance on scaling\u2014building larger models with more GPUs and data\u2014has been low risk and efficient, but is no longer sufficient for transformative progress. He emphasized that data is finite and compute availability is already vast, questioning whether 100x more scale would significantly change results. Instead, Sutskever advocates returning to foundational research, pointing out the need for AI models to improve at generalization\u2014the ability to learn efficiently from small datasets, as humans do. He concluded that compute remains essential, but future breakthroughs will depend on how creatively research leverages that compute.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},"pub_date":1764123213.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"substack.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://substack.com/home/post/p-179924094?autoPlay=true&source=queue","title":"Ilya Sutskever \u2013 The age of scaling is over","snippet":"The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people.

Do you think now that this era of research will still require tremendous amounts of compute?

One of them is ideas, and one of them is your ability to bring them to life, which might be compute but also engineering. If you go back to the \u201890s, let\u2019s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.\n\nThen in the age of scaling, compute has increased a lot. Of course, there is a question of how much compute is needed, but compute is large. Compute is large enough such that it\u2019s not obvious that you need that much more compute to prove some idea. I\u2019ll give you an analogy. AlexNet was built on two GPUs. That was the total amount of compute used for it. The transformer was built on 8 to 64 GPUs. No single transformer paper experiment used more than 64 GPUs of 2017, which would be like, what, two GPUs of today? The ResNet, right? You could argue that the o1 reasoning was not the most compute-heavy thing in the world.\n\nSo for research, you definitely need some amount of compute, but it\u2019s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever for research. You might argue, and I think it is true, that if you want to build the absolutely best system then it helps to have much more compute. Especially if everyone is within the same paradigm, then compute becomes one of the big differentiators.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:39:41\n\nI\u2019m asking you for the history, because you were actually there. I\u2019m not sure what actually happened. It sounds like it was possible to develop these ideas using minimal amounts of compute. But the transformer didn\u2019t immediately become famous. It became the thing everybody started doing and then started experimenting on top of and building on top of because it was validated at higher and higher levels of compute.\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:40:06\n\nCorrect.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:40:07\n\nAnd if you at SSI have 50 different ideas, how will you know which one is the next transformer and which one is brittle, without having the kinds of compute that other frontier labs have?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:40:22\n\nI can comment on that. The short comment is that you mentioned SSI. Specifically for us, the amount of compute that SSI has for research is really not that small. I want to explain why. Simple math can explain why the amount of compute that we have is comparable for research than one might think. I\u2019ll explain.\n\nSSI has raised $3 billion, which is a lot by any absolute sense. But you could say, \u201cLook at the other companies raising much more.\u201d But a lot of their compute goes for inference. These big numbers, these big loans, it\u2019s earmarked for inference. That\u2019s number one. Number two, if you want to have a product on which you do inference, you need to have a big staff of engineers, salespeople. A lot of the research needs to be dedicated to producing all kinds of product-related features. So then when you look at what\u2019s actually left for research, the difference becomes a lot smaller.\n\nThe other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:42:02\n\nThere have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they\u2019re spending on inference and so forth.

What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:22:38\n\nWe\u2019ve already witnessed a transition from one type of scaling to a different type of scaling, from pre-training to RL. Now people are scaling RL. Now based on what people say on Twitter, they spend more compute on RL than on pre-training at this point, because RL can actually consume quite a bit of compute. You do very long rollouts, so it takes a lot of compute to produce those rollouts. Then you get a relatively small amount of learning per rollout, so you really can spend a lot of compute.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even call it scaling. I would say, \u201cHey, what are you doing? Is the thing you are doing the most productive thing you could be doing? Can you find a more productive way of using your compute?\u201d We\u2019ve discussed the value function business earlier. Maybe once people get good at value functions, they will be using their resources more productively. If you find a whole other way of training models, you could say, \u201cIs this scaling or is it just using your resources?\u201d I think it becomes a little bit ambiguous.\n\nIn the sense that, when people were in the age of research back then, it was, \u201cLet\u2019s try this and this and this. Let\u2019s try that and that and that. Oh, look, something interesting is happening.\u201d I think there will be a return to that.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 00:24:10\n\nIf we\u2019re back in the era of research, stepping back, what is the part of the recipe that we need to think most about? When you say value function, people are already trying the current recipe, but then having LLM-as-a-Judge and so forth. You could say that\u2019s a value function, but it sounds like you have something much more fundamental in mind. Should we even rethink pre-training at all and not just add more steps to the end of that process?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:24:35\n\nThe discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that\u2019s going to make RL more efficient, and I think that makes a difference. But I think anything you can do with a value function, you can do without, just more slowly. The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people. It\u2019s super obvious.

Here\u2019s a precise check.\n\n---\n\n### 1. \u201csuperintelligence in 5\u201320 years\u201d\n\n**Status:** Essentially correct.\n\n- Dwarkesh asks for a forecast for *\u201cthis system\u2026 which can learn as well as a human and subsequently\u2026 become superhuman.\u201d*  \n- Ilya answers: *\u201cI think like 5 to 20.\u201d* and confirms *\u201c5 to 20 years?\u201d \u2013 \u201cMhm.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\nSo yes: he gives a 5\u201320 year timeline for a human-level learner that becomes superhuman, i.e. effectively superintelligence.\n\n---\n\n### 2. \u201ccurrent scaling will stall hard; we're back to real research\u201d\n\n**Status:** Half right, half you.\n\nWhat he **does** say:\n\n- He explicitly divides history into an **age of research** (2012\u20132020) and an **age of scaling** (2020\u20132025). \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n- Then: *\u201ccompute is now very big, in some sense we are back to the age of research.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n- And: *\u201cIs the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. So it\u2019s back to the age of research again, just with big computers.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\nHe **does not** literally say \u201cscaling will stall hard.\u201d He\u2019s saying:\n\n- returns to just scaling pre-training are limited,  \n- data will run out,  \n- and further progress will need new ideas.\n\nHe also discusses a \u201cstalling out\u201d scenario in terms of companies\u2019 **revenues** if they keep the current approach, not a physics-level halt to scaling. \ue200cite\ue202turn4view0\ue201  \n\nSo: \u201cback to real research\u201d is spot on; \u201cstall hard\u201d is your interpretive amplification.\n\n---\n\n### 3. \u201csuperintelligence = super-fast continual learner, not finished oracle\u201d\n\n**Status:** Very accurate paraphrase.\n\n- He argues AGI + pre-training \u201covershot the target\u201d: humans aren\u2019t omniscient; they **rely on continual learning.** \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n- On defining safe superintelligence, he imagines *\u201ca superintelligent 15-year-old\u2026 very eager\u2026 go and learn,\u201d* where deployment involves trial-and-error learning rather than dropping a finished artifact. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n- Dwarkesh restates: superintelligence is **not** a finished mind that already does every job, but *\u201ca mind which can learn to do every single job\u201d* and Ilya answers *\u201cYes.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n\nThat\u2019s exactly your slogan: superintelligence as a super-capable continual learner, not a static oracle.\n\n---\n\n### 4. \u201cmodels generalize 100x worse than humans, the biggest AGI blocker\u201d\n\n**Status:** Mixed \u2014 concept right, number invented.\n\nWhat he actually says:\n\n- *\u201cThese models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people\u2026 That seems like a very fundamental thing.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue202turn6view2\ue201  \n- He explicitly calls this **\u201cthe most fundamental\u201d** issue in the recipe, more fundamental than value functions. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view2\ue201  \n- He unpacks it as poor **sample efficiency** and difficulty of teaching models what we want, compared with mentoring humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201  \n\nHe **never** attaches a \u201c100\u00d7\u201d factor in the interview. That\u2019s your own quantification.\n\nSo:\n\n- \u201cGeneralize much worse than humans\u201d + \u201cthis is the fundamental bottleneck\u201d \u2013 **yes.**  \n- \u201c100\u00d7 worse\u201d \u2013 **no, that\u2019s not in the text.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. \u201cneed completely new ML paradigm (i have ideas, can't share rn)\u201d\n\n**Status:** Directionally right, but \u201ccompletely new paradigm\u201d is stronger than what he says.\n\nSupporting lines:\n\n- Dwarkesh asks how we must **\u201creconceptualize the way we\u2019re training models\u201d** to get human-like learning. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- Ilya: this is a question he has *\u201ca lot of opinions about,\u201d* but *\u201cnot all machine learning ideas are discussed freely, and this is one of them.\u201d* He thinks there is *\u201csome machine learning principle\u201d* implied by human learning but won\u2019t go into detail. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\nSo:\n\n- \u201cHe thinks there\u2019s a deeper ML principle and has ideas he won\u2019t share yet\u201d \u2013 **accurate.**  \n- \u201cNeed a completely new paradigm\u201d \u2013 **your extrapolation.** He talks about a new principle / new recipe inside ML, not discarding ML altogether.\n\n---\n\n### 6. \u201cAI impact will hit hard, but only after economic diffusion\u201d\n\n**Status:** Good paraphrase.\n\n- He starts by noting that 1% of GDP in AI feels abstract to people right now. \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n- Then: *\u201cAI is going to be diffused through the economy\u2026 there\u2019ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n\nLater he predicts **rapid economic growth** once human-like continual learners are broadly deployed, tempered by real-world physical bottlenecks. \ue200cite\ue202turn10view0\ue201  \n\nSo the narrative \u201cbig visible impact only once it diffuses through the economy\u201d is exactly his.\n\n---\n\n### 7. \u201cbreakthroughs historically needed almost no compute\u201d\n\n**Status:** Mostly fair but a bit dramatized.\n\nHe explicitly argues that the *research* bottleneck is not maximal compute:\n\n- In the \u201890s, good ideas were limited by small machines; compute was the bottleneck then. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- He points out that **AlexNet** used about two GPUs, and the original **Transformer** used 8\u201364 2017-era GPUs, which he compares to only a couple of modern GPUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- Conclusion: for research *\u201cit\u2019s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever\u201d* even though more helps for the very best systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\nSo \u201calmost no compute\u201d is rhetorical flare, but it\u2019s consistent with his claim that big conceptual breakthroughs historically ran on surprisingly modest hardware.\n\n---\n\n### 8. \u201cSSI has enough focused research compute to win\u201d\n\n**Status:** Half-accurate; \u201cto win\u201d is your gloss.\n\nWhat he actually claims:\n\n- SSI has raised \\$3B; big labs raise more, but much of it is earmarked for **inference** and product work. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- After you subtract inference and product engineering, the **gap in research compute** is much smaller. \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n- *\u201cWe have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn8view0\ue201  \n\nHe **does not** say \u201cwe have enough compute to guarantee we win the race.\u201d The claim is \u201cenough to validate a different technical approach,\u201d not \u201cwe will definitely beat OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 9. \u201ccurrent RL already eats more compute than pre-training\u201d\n\n**Status:** Literally in the interview, with a caveat.\n\nHe says:\n\n- We\u2019ve moved from scaling pre-training to scaling RL.  \n- *\u201cBased on what people say on Twitter, they spend more compute on RL than on pre-training at this point, because RL can actually consume quite a bit of compute\u2026 you do very long rollouts\u2026 you really can spend a lot of compute.\u201d* \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \n\nSo your sentence is accurate, with his explicit disclaimer: he\u2019s reporting what others say, not internal numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Net takeaway\n\n- Bullets **1, 3, 6, 9** are very close to what he actually says.  \n- Bullets **2, 4, 5, 7, 8** are broadly faithful but add some extra spin:  \n  - \u201cstall hard\u201d, \u201c100\u00d7 worse\u201d, \u201ccompletely new paradigm\u201d, \u201calmost no compute\u201d, \u201cto win\u201d are *your* sharpenings, not literal phrasing.\n\nIf you want, next step could be to turn these into two lists: \u201cIlya\u2019s stated claims\u201d vs \u201cmy editorial extrapolations\u201d, so you can keep your mental model clean and know which parts are you vs him.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Further coverage of this interview and its

What is the ML analogy for emotions?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:13:26\n\nIt should be some kind of \n\nt one word, but it\u2019s such a powerful word because it informs people what to do. They say, \u201cLet\u2019s try to scale things.\u201d So you say, what are we scaling? Pre-training was the thing to scale. It was a particular scaling recipe.\n\nThe big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, \u201cHey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you\u2019ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.\u201d This is also great. C \n\ns.\n\nIt\u2019s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that. If you research, you need to be like, \u201cGo forth researchers and research and come up with something\u201d, versus get more data, get more compute. You know you\u2019ll get something from pre-training.\n\nIndeed, it looks like, based on various things some people say on Twitter, maybe it appears that Gemini have found a way to get more out of pre-training. At some point though, pre-training will run out of data. The data is very clearly finite. Wha \n\nup with something\u201d, versus get more data, get more compute.

But now that compute is big, compute is now very big, in some sense we are back to the age of research.\n\nMaybe here\u2019s another way to put it. Up until 2 \n\ninteresting way to put it. But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I\u2019m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss. What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:22:38\n\nWe\u2019ve already witnessed a tra \n\n.

Now people are scaling RL. Now based on what people say on Twitter, they spend more compute on RL than on pre-training at this point, because RL can actually consume quite a bit of compute. You do very long rollouts, so it takes a lot of compute to produce those rollouts. Then you get a relatively small amount of learning per rollout, so you really can spend a lot o \n\nhen you say value function, people are already trying the current recipe, but then having LLM-as-a-Judge and so forth. You could say that\u2019s a value function, but it sounds like you have something much more fundamental in mind. Should we even rethink pre-training at all and not just add more steps to the end of that process?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:24:35\n\nThe discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that\u2019s going to make RL more e \n\ntually think that this is an important and correct thing. Here is why. I\u2019ll give you another example of how language affects thinking. In this case, it will be two words that have shaped everyone\u2019s thinking, I maintain. First word: AGI. Second word: pre-training. Let me explain.\n\nThe term AGI, why does this term exist? It\u2019s a very particular term. Why does it exist? There\u2019s a reason. The reason that the term AGI exists is, in my opinion, not so much because it\u2019s a very important, essential descriptor of som \n\nnce. So in response, as a reaction to this, some people said, this is not good. It is so narrow. What we need is general AI, an AI that can just do all the things. That term just got a lot of traction.\n\nThe second thing that got a lot of traction is pre-training, specifically the recipe of pre-training.

You do more pre-training and the model gets better at everything, more or less uniformly. General AI. Pre-training gives AGI.\n\nBut the thing that happened with AGI and pre-training is that in some sense they overshot the target.

You want something more like different scientists have different prejudices or different ideas. How do you get that kind of diversity among AI agents?\n\nIlya Sutskever 01:30:06\n\nSo the reason there has been no diversity, I believe, is because of pre-training. All the pre-trained models are pretty much the same because they pre-train on the same data. Now RL and post-training is where some differentiation starts to emerge because different people come up with different RL training.\n\nDwarkesh Patel 01:30: \n\n--- First word: AGI.

They say, \u201cLet\u2019s try to scale things.\u201d So you say, what are we scaling? Pre-training was the thing to scale. It was a particular scaling recipe.\n\nThe big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, \u201cHey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you\u2019ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.\u201d This is also great. C \n\ns.\n\nIt\u2019s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that.

But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I\u2019m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss.

You could say that\u2019s a value function, but it sounds like you have something much more fundamental in mind. Should we even rethink pre-training at all and not just add more steps to the end of that process?\n\nIlya Sutskever 00:24:35\n\nThe discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that\u2019s going to make RL more e \n\ntually think that this is an important and correct thing. Here is why.

The reason that the term AGI exists is, in my opinion, not so much because it\u2019s a very important, essential descriptor of some end state of intelligence, but because it is a reaction to a different term that existed, and the term is narrow AI. If you go back to ancient history of gameplay and AI, of checkers AI, chess AI, computer games AI, everyone would say, look at this narrow intelligence. Sure, the chess AI can beat Kasparov, but it can\u2019t do anything else. It is so narrow, artificial narrow intelligence. So in response, as a reaction to this, some people said, this is not good.

I\u2019ll use RL = **reinforcement learning**, AGI = **artificial general intelligence**.\n\n| Claim | Did Ilya actually say this? | What he *did* say / nuance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1. \u201csuperintelligence in 5\u201320 years\u201d** | **Yes, essentially verbatim.** | Dwarkesh asks for a timeline for \u201cthe system you\u2019re describing, which can learn as well as a human and subsequently become superhuman.\u201d Ilya answers \u201cI think like 5 to 20,\u201d and confirms when Dwarkesh clarifies \u201c5 to 20 years?\u201d So this is accurate. |\n| **2. \u201ccurrent scaling will stall hard; we\u2019re back to real research\u201d** | **Half yes, half spin.** | He explicitly says we\u2019re moving from an *\u201cage of scaling\u201d* back to an *\u201cage of research,\u201d* and that pre-training will eventually run out of data. He also questions whether just \u201c100\u00d7 the scale\u201d will keep giving big wins. However, the phrase \u201cstall hard\u201d is your wording; he talks about limits and diminishing returns, not a dramatic brick-wall halt. He also later discusses what \u201cstalling out\u201d might look like economically, and it\u2019s more like *slowing*, not collapse. |\n| **3. \u201csuperintelligence = super-fast continual learner, not finished oracle\u201d** | **Yes, this is very faithful.** | He contrasts a \u201cfinished\u201d mind that already knows every job with a system that can *learn* any job. He says that what matters is a learning algorithm that can rapidly learn to do every job in the economy and become superhuman via deployment, and uses the analogy of a \u201csuperintelligent 15-year-old\u201d that keeps learning on the job. That\u2019s exactly the spirit of your bullet. |\n| **4. \u201cmodels generalize 100\u00d7 worse than humans, the biggest AGI blocker\u201d** | **Core idea yes, the *100\u00d7* and \u201cbiggest blocker\u201d wording no.** | He repeatedly emphasizes that current models *\u201cgeneralize dramatically worse than people\u201d* and calls this a *\u201cvery fundamental thing\u201d* and \u201cthe crux\u201d of the problem. So: generalization gap as central bottleneck is accurate. But he never quantifies it as \u201c100\u00d7 worse,\u201d and he doesn\u2019t literally label it \u201cthe biggest AGI blocker,\u201d even though he treats it as a fundamental issue. The number and the slogan are yours. |\n| **5. \u201cneed completely new ML paradigm (i have ideas, can\u2019t share rn)\u201d** | **Mostly yes in spirit, a bit overstated in wording.** | He argues that humans likely embody a deeper *learning principle* that current models don\u2019t use. He explicitly says this points to the existence of a machine-learning principle he has \u201copinions on\u201d but that \u201ccircumstances make it hard to discuss in detail.\u201d That\u2019s very close to \u201cI have ideas, can\u2019t share right now.\u201d However, he doesn\u2019t literally say \u201ccompletely new paradigm\u201d; it\u2019s framed as a powerful new principle/recipe within ML, not a clear break from machine learning as such. |\n| **6. \u201cAI impact will hit hard, but only after economic diffusion\u201d** | **Directionally yes, wording is yours.** | Early in the interview he notes the weird gap between how smart models feel and how little the world has changed so far, but insists \u201cthe impact of AI is going to be felt \u2026 very strongly.\u201d Later, he predicts *rapid economic growth* once systems that can learn any job are deployed widely, while acknowledging real-world bottlenecks and regulation. He doesn\u2019t use the word \u201cdiffusion,\u201d but your summary captures his view: modest impact now, much larger impact once the technology spreads through the real economy. |\n| **7. \u201cbreakthroughs historically needed almost no compute\u201d** | **Partly, and partly misattributed.** | Dwarkesh is the one who cites examples like AlexNet/ResNet and early transformers using relatively few GPUs. Ilya then agrees that for *research*, you don\u2019t need extreme amounts of compute, and points out that even things like O1-style reasoning weren\u2019t the most compute-heavy efforts. So the idea \u201cpast breakthroughs used comparatively little compute\u201d is indeed in the conversation, but the strong phrasing \u201calmost no compute\u201d is yours, and the specific historical examples come from Dwarkesh, not Ilya. |\n| **8. \u201cSSI has enough focused research compute to win\u201d** | **Partially; \u201cto win\u201d is your extrapolation.** | He walks through SSI\u2019s $3B, argues that if you subtract the huge inference spend of others, the *research* compute gap is smaller than it looks, and says SSI\u2019s compute is *comparable for research* if used efficiently. He clearly believes they have *enough* compute to seriously pursue their distinct approach. But he never says \u201cenough to win,\u201d and he\u2019s careful not to frame it as guaranteed victory\u2014just that they\u2019re not fundamentally compute-bottlenecked on research. |\n| **9. \u201ccurrent RL already eats more compute than pre-training\u201d** | **Not supported by this transcript.** | He does say we\u2019ve seen a transition from scaling pre-training to scaling RL, and notes that RL rollouts can consume a lot of compute per unit of learning. He also contrasts the \u201cjust dump in all the data\u201d simplicity of pre-training with the complexity of choosing RL environments. But in the text we have, he does **not** explicitly say \u201cRL already uses more compute than pre-training,\u201d either in aggregate or as a clean inequality. That looks like an inferred or imported claim, not something he straightforwardly states here. |\n\nShort version:  \n\n- Bullets **1, 2, 3, 4 (minus the 100\u00d7), 5, 6** are basically faithful to what Ilya actually says, with your own rhetoric layered on top.  \n- Bullet **7** reflects a point made in the *exchange* (mostly by Dwarkesh, tacitly endorsed by Ilya), but the \u201calmost no compute\u201d framing is yours.  \n- Bullet **8** captures his confidence about research compute, but \u201cto win\u201d is your gloss, not his words.  \n- Bullet **9** I don\u2019t see stated in this written version; at best it\u2019s an extrapolation from his discussion of RL rollouts, not a direct claim."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-69268b6ae1e88191a2897848dd05b756","request_id":"08f90d4b-e209-4a89-8c99-fc779db10a85","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"36a1eb01-2858-40f3-a65d-3dafbbc7da21","turn_exchange_id":"1387c7dc-c47c-4494-abcd-91028c62a0c5","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"36a1eb01-2858-40f3-a65d-3dafbbc7da21","children":["48ffb90c-db2e-456b-a7e2-8b46e5df1b50"]},"3774d131-ed68-40bb-9fc1-0646656d4a85":{"id":"3774d131-ed68-40bb-9fc1-0646656d4a85","message":{"id":"3774d131-ed68-40bb-9fc1-0646656d4a85","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764163163.970997,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing training recipes and breakthroughs in ML history","content":"It seems the earlier mention of \"souped-up pre-training\" points to different approaches but not a \"completely new ML paradigm.\" The focus shifts to scaling compute power over time.

central assertion is that the main bottleneck to AGI is **generalization**, not \u201craw intelligence\u201d on benchmarks. Current models can ace tests yet fail in brittle, jagged ways in the wild. He claims humans generalize vastly better and learn from far fewer examples, especially in domains (math, coding, modern science) that evolution never saw. From this he infers there must be a **deeper learning principle**\u2014a more powerful way to turn experience into competence\u2014that current ML does not yet exploit.\n\nHe argues we are exiting the **age of pure scaling** and re-entering an **age of research**. Pre-training on internet-scale data and scaling parameters/compute gave huge gains, but data is finite and simple scaling will hit diminishing returns. Future progress will come from new training principles and architectures, not just bigger models. In this context he positions SSI as a research-first organization: by not running a massive inference business, they can devote most of their (still large) compute to experimentation, which he claims is *enough* to explore a distinct path to superintelligence.\n\nOn what AGI/superintelligence actually is, his main claim is that it will not be a \u201cfinished oracle\u201d that already knows how to do every job. Instead, it will be a **superhuman continual learner**: a system that can learn any economically relevant task at least as well as a talented human teenager, then keep improving on the job. He gives a timeline of roughly **5\u201320 years** for such systems. He expects their deployment to drive very fast economic growth once they diffuse through real-world workflows, though constrained by physical and institutional bottlenecks.\n\nMethodologically, he asserts that **value functions and RL-like signals** must play a more central role. He draws an analogy between human emotions and an internal value function that constantly evaluates trajectories, arguing that current RL for LLMs is too sparse and eval-centric. He believes better, richer feedback signals are key to robust, out-of-distribution generalization. On alignment and governance, he insists that early superintelligences must be made to **care about sentient life** (including AIs themselves), suggests society should consider ways to cap extreme concentrations of compute, and speculates that in the very long run humans may need to become partly AI-augmented to retain meaningful agency."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-69268b6ae1e88191a2897848dd05b756","request_id":"5352a769-1bed-4ca0-b149-4bb41dbafd6c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4c4bcde5-912d-46d0-8b13-104a6f9ee432","turn_exchange_id":"ffba1926-8d05-4868-88ad-5841af99ced1","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"4c4bcde5-912d-46d0-8b13-104a6f9ee432","children":["48d774c5-248c-4710-8cb5-710fac703117"]},"8d4eb6b1-920e-4ab4-afb4-0eb5c8cf852e":{"id":"8d4eb6b1-920e-4ab4-afb4-0eb5c8cf852e","message":{"id":"8d4eb6b1-920e-4ab4-afb4-0eb5c8cf852e","author":{"role":"tool","name":"python","metadata":{}},"create_time":1764163165.0292337,"update_time":1764163166.877444,"content":{"content_type":"execution_output","text":"5\n\nI\u2019m curious.

does suggest that something strange is going on.\n\nI have two possible explanations. The more whimsical explanation is that maybe RL training makes the models a little too single-minded and narrowly focused, a little bit too unaware, even though it also makes them aware in some other ways. Because of this, they can\u2019t do basic things.\n\nBut there is another explanation.
