Students may contact their schools for assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy.\r\n\r\nPrivate candidates who are eligible for Singpass can use their Singpass account to obtain their results online via SEAB\u2019s Candidates Portal from 2.45pm on Jan 14 until 11pm on Jan 28. \r\n\r\nThose who are not eligible for Singpass can view their results in the portal using the account that they have created during their examination registration.\r\n\r\nStudents may apply for admission to junior colleges, Millennia Institute (MI), polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) using their GCE O-Level examination results.\r\n\r\nEligible school and private candidates will receive a digital copy of Form A via their registered email addresses from 2.45pm on Jan 14. \r\n\r\nForm A lists the applicant's gross aggregate scores for junior college, MI, polytechnic, ITE aggregate types and courses that he or she is eligible to apply for under the JAE.\r\n\r\nAll candidates eligible for JAE may also download a copy of Form A from the JAE-Internet System during the application period.\r\n\r\nThe JAE-Internet System will be accessible from 4pm on Jan 14 until 4.30pm on Jan 19 for applicants to submit their course choices through the JAE website. \r\n\r\nApplicants are encouraged to complete the JAE worksheet before submitting their online application. The JAE-Internet System can be accessed using Singpass. \r\n\r\nThe posting results of the JAE application will be released on Feb 3 via the JAE-Internet System, which is accessible through the JAE website; and via SMS to the Singapore mobile phone number provided by the applicant during application.\r\n\r\nApplicants posted to JCs and MI are to report to their posted institutions on Feb 4. \r\n\r\nIf they are unable to do so due to valid reasons, they should contact their posted school directly to confirm that they are taking up the place, and the school will reserve the place for them.\r\n\r\nApplicants posted to ITE will receive an email with enrolment instructions on Feb 3, and applicants posted to polytechnics will receive their enrolment email by the end of February.\r\n\r\nDIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION FOR JUNIOR COLLEGE\r\n\r\nStudents who have accepted offers through the 2025 DSA-JC will be admitted to their chosen JC if they have met the JC admission criteria based on their GCE O-Level examination results. \r\n\r\nThese students will not be eligible to participate in the JAE.\r\n\r\nStudents who do not meet the JC admission criteria may take part in the JAE to apply for other courses that they are eligible for.\r\n\r\nPOLYTECHNIC, ITE EARLY ADMISSION\r\n\r\nFor students who have accepted conditional offers to a polytechnic course through the Polytechnic Early Admissions Exercise in 2025, their offers would have been confirmed, and they will not be eligible to participate in the JAE if:\r\n\r\nThey have a net ELR2B2 score of 26 points or lower for the GCE O-Level examinations;\r\nAnd they meet minimum entry requirements for the respective polytechnic courses.\r\n\r\nStudents who do not meet the above criteria may instead apply for polytechnic admission via the JAE for courses that they are eligible for.\r\n\r\nFor students who have accepted conditional offers to an ITE course through the ITE Early Admissions Exercise in 2025, their offers would have been confirmed based on their GCE O-Level examination results once they meet the subject-specific minimum entry requirements for the course.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY 4 NORMAL (ACADEMIC) STUDENTS\r\nSecondary 4 Normal (Academic) students who have sat for GCE O-Level subjects in 2025 can use their GCE O-Level results to apply for a place in the Polytechnic Foundation Programme and Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme.\r\n\r\nThe Polytechnic Foundation Programme is an alternative to the Secondary 5 Normal (Academic) year. \r\n\r\n\"It is a one-year foundation programme offered at the polytechnics which provides students with a practice-oriented approach to prepare them for entry into the relevant diploma courses,\" said MOE and SEAB.\r\n\r\nStudents are eligible to apply for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme if they obtain a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 12 points or lower and meet the subject-specific requirements for their chosen cluster.\r\n\r\nStudents will receive a form from their respective secondary schools in person. Interested students are required to submit their applications online via the Polytechnic Foundation Programme website using their Singpass account.\r\n\r\nApplications for the programme will open from 1.30pm on Jan 14 until 4.30pm on Jan 19. The posting results will be released at 1.30pm on Jan 26 through the programme website. \r\n\r\nStudents will be required to indicate whether they wish to accept, reject or appeal for a change of course by 4.30pm on Jan 29.\r\n\r\nStudents are eligible to apply for the Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme if they obtain a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 19 points or lower and meet the subject-specific requirements for their chosen course. \r\n\r\nThe Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme prepares students for progression into selected polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year Higher Nitec course at ITE, according to MOE and SEAB. \r\n\r\nEligible Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students may submit their applications online via the DPP application portal. Applications for the programme will be open from 12am on Jan 14 until 11.59pm on Jan 19.\r\n\r\nThe posting results for Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme applications made under the final application phase will be released at 9am on Jan 21 through the programme's application portal.

Students will be informed by the respective polytechnics on the enrolment dates for the programme.\r\n\r\nStudents who have accepted a place in the earlier application phase of the Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme in December but decide to take up a Polytechnic Foundation Programme offer must withdraw from the former programme first before they are able to take up the latter offer. \r\n\r\nStudents enrolled in the Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme should check with their ITE class advisor for more details on the withdrawal process and deadlines for withdrawal."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95db924f-f79c-46f6-9140-f61b8cbe2b19","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"2dbfe45f-26b5-4d38-b68a-f1df691fae83","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d8b8d73d-9874-4567-b116-ae6bf6fcfd5b","children":["c5808f5d-95db-45f5-957d-3d7fc4811d7c"]},"c5808f5d-95db-45f5-957d-3d7fc4811d7c":{"id":"c5808f5d-95db-45f5-957d-3d7fc4811d7c","message":{"id":"c5808f5d-95db-45f5-957d-3d7fc4811d7c","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767848124.7799032,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"95db924f-f79c-46f6-9140-f61b8cbe2b19","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"687a490e-85e9-438b-8c69-8f0461078917","turn_exchange_id":"2dbfe45f-26b5-4d38-b68a-f1df691fae83","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"687a490e-85e9-438b-8c69-8f0461078917","children":["bad8f0c3-b997-4369-a8eb-7b6c0a161191"]},"bad8f0c3-b997-4369-a8eb-7b6c0a161191":{"id":"bad8f0c3-b997-4369-a8eb-7b6c0a161191","message":{"id":"bad8f0c3-b997-4369-a8eb-7b6c0a161191","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767848125.5001638,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"95db924f-f79c-46f6-9140-f61b8cbe2b19","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"c5808f5d-95db-45f5-957d-3d7fc4811d7c","turn_exchange_id":"2dbfe45f-26b5-4d38-b68a-f1df691fae83","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c5808f5d-95db-45f5-957d-3d7fc4811d7c","children":["0a1da83c-bace-4255-8517-07ef77640ad2"]},"0a1da83c-bace-4255-8517-07ef77640ad2":{"id":"0a1da83c-bace-4255-8517-07ef77640ad2","message":{"id":"0a1da83c-bace-4255-8517-07ef77640ad2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767848124.864978,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here is a **clear, parent- and student-focused summary** that retains all essential dates, options, and decision points.\n\n---\n\n## 2025 GCE O-Level Results & Post-Results Pathways \u2014 What You Need to Know\n\n### **O-Level Results Release**\n- **Date & time:** **14 January 2025 (Tuesday), 2.00pm**\n- **School candidates:** Collect results from their **secondary schools** (schools will share collection details).\n- **Unable to collect in person:** A **proxy** may collect the results with required verification documents;
