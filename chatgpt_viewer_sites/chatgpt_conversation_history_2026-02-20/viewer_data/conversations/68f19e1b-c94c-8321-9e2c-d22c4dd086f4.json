It emphasizes selecting natural peanut butter made solely from peanuts and salt, as many commercial brands contain additives like sugars, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and emulsifiers such as lecithin. Added sugars and hydrogenated oils can raise the risk for health issues including diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, while preservatives can negatively affect taste and nutritional value. Though lecithins are generally safe in small amounts and may offer some health benefits, they often accompany other less desirable ingredients. The article also encourages making homemade peanut butter to better control its components. Additionally, it compares peanut butter with other nut butters, highlighting peanuts as the highest in protein among common nuts, and emphasizes their part in heart-healthy diets. Finally, practical suggestions for incorporating peanut butter into meals are included, underlining its role in supporting satiety and blood sugar control.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":48},"pub_date":1755583200.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/tyson-foods-stop-using-corn-syrup-products-us-by-end-2025-2025-09-15/","title":"Tyson Foods to stop using corn syrup in products in US by end of 2025","snippet":"Tyson Foods announced it will eliminate high-fructose corn syrup and several other ingredients from its U.S. products by the end of 2025.

Kennedy Jr., which encourages the removal of artificial dyes and excess sugar from American diets. Tyson will stop using ingredients such as sucralose, titanium dioxide, and synthetic antioxidants BHA/BHT across brands like Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. Although these substances are FDA-approved, the company is responding to consumer demand for simpler, more natural ingredient lists. This move mirrors similar changes in the food industry, such as Coca-Cola's switch to cane sugar following President Trump\u2019s endorsement.

Below is a breakdown of what to watch out for, plus evidence.\n\n---\n\n## What peanut butter *is* and typical ingredient allowances\n\n- By definition (e.g. U.S. regulatory standard), peanut butter must contain at least 90% peanuts. The remaining \u2264 10% may include salt, \u201csweeteners,\u201d and hydrogenated (i.e. fully hydrogenated) vegetable oils. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search36\ue201  \n- The \u201csweeteners\u201d part is where added sugars or syrups (like sucrose, HFCS, molasses, etc.) can appear. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search36\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search41\ue202turn0search13\ue201  \n- On more \u201cnatural\u201d or minimalist peanut butters, the ingredients may be just peanuts (and sometimes salt) \u2014 no added sugar or syrups. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search35\ue202turn0search42\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search41\ue201  \n\nSo in principle, a peanut butter *could* have **no** HFCS or refined sugar except what is naturally in peanuts. But many brands do add sugar or sweeteners to enhance flavor or sweeten slightly.\n\n---\n\n## What the evidence/documented examples say\n\n- Medical News Today states that many peanut butter manufacturers **do** add sugar (and in some cases HFCS). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search41\ue201  \n- Healthline notes that many commercial peanut butters \u201cmay contain added sugar and trans fats.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n- The Environmental Working Group (EWG) remarks that \u201ctoday's processed brands often contain copious amounts of both added sugars and added salt.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search45\ue201  \n- On a brand level:  \n\u2002 \u2022 Jif\u2019s classic creamy peanut butter lists \u201cRoasted Peanuts, Sugar \u2026\u201d and clearly states \u201cNo High Fructose Corn Syrup.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search17\ue201  \n\u2002 \u2022 SKIPPY says it uses 100 % cane sugar (not HFCS). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search39\ue201  \n\u2002 \u2022 Peter Pan markets its \u201cNatural Creamy Peanut Butter Spread\u201d as containing *no high-fructose corn syrup*. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search44\ue201  \n\u2002 \u2022 Many \u201cnatural\u201d peanut butters are pitched on the basis of having no added sugar; their difference is just peanuts (and sometimes salt). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search42\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n\nThese examples show that **some** brands add sugar (but usually cane sugar or sucrose), and **some** explicitly avoid HFCS. HFCS is not universally present in peanut butter, and when it is, it's typically a smaller component, not the dominant one.\n\n---\n\n## So: \u201ca lot of HFCS / refined sugar\u201d \u2014 is that true?\n\n- It is **not typical** for peanut butter to contain *a lot* of **high-fructose corn syrup** in many mainstream brands: HFCS is less common than \u201cnormal\u201d sugar (sucrose or cane sugar).  \n- However, many peanut butters do have **some added refined sugar** to adjust taste. The amount is usually modest (a few grams per serving).  \n- The amount of sugar (including refined sugar) is usually quite small relative to the fats and proteins in peanut butter. It is not like sugary spreads, but the \u201csweetened\u201d ones are sweeter than \u201cnatural\u201d ones.\n\nSo the statement \u201cpeanut butter contains a lot of HFCS / refined sugar\u201d is **too strong** in general. A more accurate statement is:\n\n> Some commercial peanut butters include refined sweeteners (sugar, syrups), but high-fructose corn syrup is not universally used. Many brands now explicitly avoid HFCS, and you can find peanut butters with no added sugars at all.\n\n---\n\n## How to check your peanut butter\n\nTo see whether a specific peanut butter has a lot of refined sugar or HFCS:\n\n1. **Read the ingredients list**:  \n\u2002 \u2022 If \u201chigh-fructose corn syrup\u201d or \u201ccorn syrup\u201d appears, then yes, it contains that.  \n\u2002 \u2022 If \u201csugar,\u201d \u201ccane sugar,\u201d \u201cbrown sugar,\u201d \u201cmolasses,\u201d etc., appear (especially early in the list), then there is added refined sweetener.\n\n2. **Look at the nutrition facts**:  \n\u2002 Check \u201cAdded sugars\u201d or the grams of total sugar. If most of the sugar is additive (beyond the peanuts\u2019 natural sugar), that\u2019s a red flag.\n\n3. **Prefer \u201cno added sugar\u201d / \u201cjust peanuts (\u00b1 salt)\u201d** labels** for minimal refined sugar content.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can check common peanut butter brands sold in Singapore (or in your market) to see how many use HFCS or refined sugar, so you know what to watch out for locally. Would you like me to do that?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search36\ue201","start_idx":549,"end_idx":583,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://nationalpeanutboard.org/news/mythbusters-natural-peanut-butter-vs-regular-peanut-butter/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([nationalpeanutboard.org](https://nationalpeanutboard.org/news/mythbusters-natural-peanut-butter-vs-regular-peanut-butter/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Mythbusters: Natural vs Regular Peanut Butter","url":"https://nationalpeanutboard.org/news/mythbusters-natural-peanut-butter-vs-regular-peanut-butter/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The only other allowable ingredients are salt, sweeteners and hydrogenated vegetable oils.
