and express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Demonstrators chanted pro-Palestinian slogans and called for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the cessation of German arms exports to Israel, and European Union sanctions against Israel. Around 1,800 police officers were deployed to monitor the event. Germany, traditionally a strong supporter of Israel due to its historical responsibility for the Holocaust, recently halted military exports that could be used in Gaza but has opposed broader sanctions. A smaller, separate rally of about 100 people showed support for Israel and denounced antisemitism, with some isolated scuffles reported between groups. Similar pro-Palestinian protests occurred in other German cities like D\u00fcsseldorf and internationally in Geneva, with thousands participating. The conflict, triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 65,100 deaths in Gaza and widespread displacement and famine, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, though civilian versus combatant casualty figures were not specified.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758988719.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-foreign-minister-urges-end-gaza-war-meeting-with-netanyahu-new-york-2025-09-27/","title":"UAE foreign minister urges end to Gaza war in meeting with Netanyahu in New York","snippet":"During a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the Gaza war, according to UAE state media. This meeting marked Netanyahu's first with a senior Arab official following Israel's September 9 attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar, which was condemned by the UAE. Sheikh Abdullah emphasized the UAE\u2019s continued commitment to peace efforts based on a two-state solution.\n\nThe UAE, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 under the Abraham Accords, has recently expressed concern about Israeli policies, warning that further annexation in the occupied West Bank could jeopardize diplomatic ties. Strained relations come amid intensifying conflict in Gaza and growing international frustration. Several Western nations recently recognized a Palestinian state, a move condemned by Netanyahu, who opposes the creation of such a state.

Petro dismissed the visa revocation, emphasizing his European citizenship and freedom, and criticized the U.S. for undermining international legal norms. The U.S. State Department justified the action by citing Petro\u2019s \"reckless and incendiary\" remarks, particularly his call for American soldiers to disobey orders from President Donald Trump. Colombia's Foreign Ministry denounced the use of visa policies as diplomatic tools and suggested relocating the U.N. headquarters to a neutral country. This incident comes amid increasingly strained U.S.-Colombia relations, with past disputes including deportation policy conflicts, mutual ambassador recalls, and Petro's severing of diplomatic ties with Israel in 2024.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated the move reflected a moral responsibility and reaffirmed the country's commitment to a two-state solution. The recognition was welcomed by Palestinian authorities and Hamas, who saw it as an endorsement of Palestinian rights. However, it sparked fierce opposition from Israel, with Prime Minister Netanyahu and other Israeli officials condemning the decision, calling it a reward for terrorism amid ongoing hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nThe development increased international pressure for peace and highlighted growing divisions among global powers. France announced plans to follow suit, while the U.S., Germany, Italy, and Japan have not. Critics, including British-Israeli hostage families and Conservative politicians, argued that the timing undermined efforts to free hostages and could embolden Hamas. Supporters, including Scottish and Liberal Democrat leaders, emphasized justice and the urgency of humanitarian aid.\n\nSimultaneously, Israeli military actions in Gaza and Lebanon drew condemnation for civilian casualties, including U.S. citizens. The shift brings the total number of UN member states recognizing Palestine to 150, with growing calls for sanctions on Israel and an end to arms sales contributing to the ongoing debate.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758484800.0,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.lemonde.fr","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/09/22/uk-country-of-the-balfour-declaration-recognizes-palestine-in-historic-decision_6745628_4.html","title":"UK, country of the Balfour Declaration, recognizes Palestine in historic decision","snippet":"In a historic move, the UK officially recognized the State of Palestine on September 21, 2025, just ahead of the UN General Assembly's 80th session.

While over 145 countries had already recognized Palestine, the UK's decision is particularly significant given its role in issuing the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which supported a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This marks the first time G7 countries have formally recognized a Palestinian state.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the recognition as a step toward peace and a two-state solution, amidst worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza and continued Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. The Palestinian representative in the UK praised the move, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned it. The decision provoked mixed reactions, including criticism from families of Israeli hostages and parts of the UK\u2019s political left.\n\nCanada and Australia justified their decisions by citing Israel\u2019s aggressive policies and Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis, placing conditions on the Palestinian Authority such as demilitarization and democratic reform. Portugal also expressed support for a two-state solution.

The announcements, made just before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, reflect escalating international concern over humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have reportedly killed more than 65,000 Palestinians.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, under intense pressure from the public and members of his Labour Party, emphasized the recognition was a push toward a two-state solution, not a reward for Hamas. He warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel\u2019s lack of progress on peace talks demanded action. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu fiercely condemned the move, labeling it a reward for terrorism.\n\nAlthough symbolic without U.N. Security Council endorsement\u2014where the U.S. holds veto power\u2014analysts suggest the recognition could increase international pressure on Israel. Palestinian officials and advocates welcomed the decision as historically significant, especially from Britain, given its colonial-era role in the region.

Although he did not use the term \"genocide,\" Felipe condemned the bombing of hospitals, schools, and civilian areas, and spoke emotionally about the suffering of the Palestinian people, referencing Spain\u2019s historic connection to the Sephardic Jewish community. He also expressed dismay at Israel\u2019s response to criticism, which has included accusations of antisemitism against Spain and diplomatic retaliation.\n\nWhile unequivocally condemning Hamas's terrorism and the attacks on October 7, 2023, Felipe emphasized that Israel must still comply with international humanitarian law.

Highlighting the need for a two-state solution, he advocated for increased recognition of Palestine and the role of the UN in maintaining global stability.

This recognition significantly increased following announcements during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. On that day, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Andorra declared recognition of Palestine, following similar decisions the previous day by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Portugal. Earlier in 2024, Armenia and Slovenia, as well as Spain, Ireland, and Norway, had also extended recognition, largely motivated by efforts to revive peace negotiations amid the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in over 55,000 deaths.\n\nHistorically, Palestine declared independence in 1988 through the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), prompting recognition from 82 countries, mainly from Africa, the Middle East, and the former Soviet bloc. Major support came from South America in the early 2010s. Despite wide recognition, the European Union remains divided, with Sweden being the first EU member to recognize Palestine in 2014. Palestine holds non-member observer status at the UN since 2012, allowing limited participation but not full membership or voting rights.

Albanese stressed that while Australia historically supported Israel\u2019s creation and opposes anti-Semitism, it holds the Israeli government partly responsible for the Gaza crisis. The decision to recognize Palestine was contingent on the Palestinian Authority ensuring Hamas relinquishes arms, excludes itself from governance in a future state, and holds democratic elections. This marks Albanese\u2019s first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly.

General Assembly, joining a growing list of nations\u2014including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco\u2014that have recently recognized a Palestinian state. However, countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan participated in the meeting without extending such recognition.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reaffirmed that Palestinian statehood is a right, not a reward, directly challenging Israeli arguments that recognition legitimizes Hamas. Amid pressure and conflict, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking remotely after the U.S. revoked his visa, called for an end to violence and offered reforms, including changes to controversial social payments. The Palestinian Authority, widely criticized by some Palestinians, faces political rivalry with Hamas and limited control.\n\nDespite growing global support\u2014around three-quarters of U.N. member states now recognize Palestine\u2014the Israeli government remains firmly opposed, threatening annexation of parts of the West Bank.

The votes, both 82-15 and 83-15, came amid criticism of Israel's blockade of humanitarian aid and its ongoing military campaign, which, according to Palestinian officials, has killed over 50,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the resolutions, citing the dire civilian conditions in Gaza, where food, water, medicine, and fuel have been cut off for over a month. Supporters hoped to increase pressure on Israel and the U.S. administration to prioritize civilian protection. Nonetheless, bipartisan support for Israel remained strong, with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Risch warning that halting arms sales would abandon a key ally. President Donald Trump, now in his second term, has overridden prior restrictions on arms sales and even proposed controversial plans for Gaza\u2019s future. Although past resolutions have failed and no disapproval measure has passed both chambers without being vetoed by the president, the Senate was legally obligated to vote, underscoring heightened tensions surrounding U.S. military support for Israel.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743712123.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"tennesseelookout.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/04/22/aid-to-ukraine-israel-overwhelmingly-approved-by-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote/","title":"Aid to Ukraine, Israel overwhelmingly approved by U.S. ...","snippet":"Aid to Ukraine, Israel overwhelmingly approved by U.S. House in bipartisan vote.

Slovenia had previously barred Israeli officials Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich and imposed an arms embargo on Israel.

Albares emphasized the recent wave of countries recognizing Palestine \u2013 including France, Belgium, and the UK \u2013 and reaffirmed Spain\u2019s support for a two-state solution. Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized Palestine in 2024, and Albares predicted further international recognition would push the peace process forward.\n\nSpain has taken a tough stance against Israeli military actions in Gaza, branding the prolonged conflict as unacceptable and labeling it a humanitarian crisis. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez recently called the war \u201ca genocide\u201d and announced measures such as an arms embargo and restrictions on Israeli-bound fuel shipments. These moves sparked diplomatic tensions, including mutual ministerial bans and accusations from Israel of antisemitism.\n\nAlbares also addressed Spain\u2019s defense spending, defending the country\u2019s decision not to meet former U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for 5% GDP defense expenditure, highlighting Spain\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s security with current spending at 2.1%.

Earlier in 2024, Armenia and Slovenia, as well as Spain, Ireland, and Norway, had also extended recognition, largely motivated by efforts to revive peace negotiations amid the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in over 55,000 deaths.\n\nHistorically, Palestine declared independence in 1988 through the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), prompting recognition from 82 countries, mainly from Africa, the Middle East, and the former Soviet bloc. Major support came from South America in the early 2010s. Despite wide recognition, the European Union remains divided, with Sweden being the first EU member to recognize Palestine in 2014. Palestine holds non-member observer status at the UN since 2012, allowing limited participation but not full membership or voting rights.

He reaffirmed Israel's commitment to recovering hostages and dismantling Hamas.\n\nSimultaneously, former U.S. President Donald Trump publicly opposed any Israeli annexation of the West Bank, aiming to maintain diplomatic leverage amid ongoing conflicts.\n\nOther developments include the UN updating a list of companies operating in Israeli settlements, possible expulsion of Israeli broadcaster Kan from Eurovision, and international objections to Israel's blockade of a humanitarian flotilla to Gaza.

The resolution, supported by all 14 other council members, described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as \"catastrophic\" and demanded the lifting of restrictions on humanitarian aid. This marked the fifth time the U.S. has blocked similar resolutions to protect Israel, citing concerns that such measures fail to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas and imply false equivalence between Israel and Hamas. The resolution was co-sponsored by several nations, including Algeria, the UK, and China. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the veto, while Israel expressed gratitude for the continued U.S. support. The UK, despite voting in favor, criticized Israel\u2019s aid distribution system and expanding military operations. Other nations condemned the U.S. veto, with Pakistan and China labeling it a moral and political failure. Amid warnings of famine, the UN criticized the ineffective U.S.- and Israeli-endorsed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose distribution centers remained closed while dozens were killed during food aid gatherings.

The meeting followed France and other nations officially recognizing Palestinian statehood. Most council members condemned the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, calling for an immediate ceasefire and greater humanitarian aid, citing massive fatalities, destruction, and starvation among Palestinians. However, the U.S. remained firm in defending Israel and vetoing UN resolutions demanding a ceasefire, criticizing them for inadequately condemning Hamas. U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz decried the meeting as politically motivated, claiming it rewarded Hamas and disrupted peace negotiations. Meanwhile, Israel was absent due to the Jewish New Year, and officials hinted at possible unilateral moves, such as annexing parts of the West Bank. Frustration among U.S. allies was evident, with many urging the Security Council to act decisively to end the war. This deepening divide highlights questions over the UN\u2019s credibility and ability to enforce international peace when one permanent member consistently blocks near-unanimous global consensus.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1758658846.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"alford.house.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://alford.house.gov/uploadedfiles/halting_weapons_shipments_letter.pdf","title":"May 9, 2024 President Joe Biden The White House 1600 ...","snippet":"May 9, 2024 \u2014 Reports confirm your Administration put on hold at least 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500 pound-bombs2.

Canada, and Australia formally recognized the state of Palestine in a coordinated diplomatic shift that breaks with longstanding U.S. policy. Joined later by Portugal and with France expected to follow, these countries\u2014some of Israel\u2019s closest allies\u2014took the step amid global outrage over Israel's ongoing military actions in Gaza. The announcements, made just before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, reflect escalating international concern over humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have reportedly killed more than 65,000 Palestinians.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, under intense pressure from the public and members of his Labour Party, emphasized the recognition was a push toward a two-state solution, not a reward for Hamas. He warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel\u2019s lack of progress on peace talks demanded action. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu fiercely condemned the move, labeling it a reward for terrorism.\n\nAlthough symbolic without U.N. Security Council endorsement\u2014where the U.S. holds veto power\u2014analysts suggest the recognition could increase international pressure on Israel. Palestinian officials and advocates welcomed the decision as historically significant, especially from Britain, given its colonial-era role in the region. However, they stressed that recognition must be followed by concrete action to end the conflict.","attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reuters"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn5news19\ue201","start_idx":3412,"end_idx":3443,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/88f3a87f7d79df02311f09b3e45560e9?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"April 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1713037902.0,"snippet":"Incoming Iranian missiles and loitering munitions \u00b7 Israel \u00b7 United States \u00b7 United Kingdom \u00b7 Jordan \u00b7 France; Intelligence support: Saudi Arabia \u00b7 United Arab ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"France recognizes Palestinian statehood at UN meeting to revive peace efforts","url":"https://apnews.com/article/88f3a87f7d79df02311f09b3e45560e9?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"At a high-level United Nations meeting held in Tanzania, France announced its official recognition of Palestinian statehood, marking a significant shift in international diplomacy amid ongoing conflict in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron's declaration was met with strong applause at the U.N. General Assembly, joining a growing list of nations\u2014including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco\u2014that have recently recognized a Palestinian state. However, countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan participated in the meeting without extending such recognition.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reaffirmed that Palestinian statehood is a right, not a reward, directly challenging Israeli arguments that recognition legitimizes Hamas. Amid pressure and conflict, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking remotely after the U.S. revoked his visa, called for an end to violence and offered reforms, including changes to controversial social payments. The Palestinian Authority, widely criticized by some Palestinians, faces political rivalry with Hamas and limited control.\n\nDespite growing global support\u2014around three-quarters of U.N. member states now recognize Palestine\u2014the Israeli government remains firmly opposed, threatening annexation of parts of the West Bank. With peace talks stalled for over a decade, the international community continues to advocate for a two-state solution as the only viable path to long-term peace.","attribution":"AP News"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn4search14\ue202turn0search10\ue201","start_idx":3654,"end_idx":3701,"safe_urls":["https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/germany-stands-by-israel-and-is-seeking-to-bring-about-a-de-escalation-2228294?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/gaza-war-testing-germanys-long-unconditional-commitment-israel-2025-05-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-has-stopped-approving-war-weapons-exports-israel-source-says-2024-09-18/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Bundesregierung](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/germany-stands-by-israel-and-is-seeking-to-bring-about-a-de-escalation-2228294?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Germany stands firmly alongside Israel | Federal Government","url":"https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/germany-stands-by-israel-and-is-seeking-to-bring-about-a-de-escalation-2228294?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jul 25, 2025 \u2014 \u201cWe condemn Hamas' brutal terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in the strongest possible terms, and support Israel in ensuring its ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Germany has stopped approving war weapons exports to ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-has-stopped-approving-war-weapons-exports-israel-source-says-2024-09-18/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Sep 19, 2024 \u2014 Germany's arms exports to Israel slow sharply in 2024 \u00b7 Legal challenges argue German arms exports breach humanitarian law \u00b7 Berlin maintains ...","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Gaza war testing Germany's long unconditional ...","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/gaza-war-testing-germanys-long-unconditional-commitment-israel-2025-05-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"May 28, 2025 \u2014 Gaza war testing Germany's long unconditional commitment to Israel \u00b7 New chancellor Merz's rebuke of Israel over military actions in Gaza marks ...","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Bundesregierung"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue202turn7search8\ue202turn7news30\ue201","start_idx":3972,"end_idx":4016,"safe_urls":["https://apnews.com/article/8409092704d80158f34241b86552d2e9?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/milei-says-argentina-to-move-embassy-from-tel-aviv-to-jerusalem-in-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-countries-voted-give-palestine-un-power-1899399?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-countries-voted-give-palestine-un-power-1899399?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Full List of Countries Who Voted to Give Palestine New UN ...","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-countries-voted-give-palestine-un-power-1899399?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1715361316.0,"snippet":"May 10, 2024 \u2014 9 countries voted against the resolution: Argentina, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Micronesia, United States, Papa New Guinea, Nauru, and ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Milei says Argentina to move embassy from Tel Aviv ...","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/milei-says-argentina-to-move-embassy-from-tel-aviv-to-jerusalem-in-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jun 12, 2025 \u2014 Argentinian President Javier Milei has announced that his country will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem next year.","attribution":"Al Jazeera"},{"title":"Argentine President Javier Milei receives Israel's Genesis Prize","url":"https://apnews.com/article/8409092704d80158f34241b86552d2e9?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"On June 12, 2025, Argentine President Javier Milei was awarded the $1 million Genesis Prize in Jerusalem, recognizing his strong support for Israel amid its growing global isolation due to the ongoing war in Gaza.

a significant $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan with a 79-18 bipartisan vote, following the House's approval. President Biden plans to sign the bill, which will send new firepower to Ukraine, $26 billion to Israel for wartime assistance and Gaza humanitarian relief, and $8 billion to counter Chinese threats in Taiwan. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell emphasized the global importance of the aid, with McConnell highlighting its significance in countering isolationist tendencies. The bill includes provisions for seizing Russian central bank assets, sanctions on Iran, Russia, China, and criminal organizations trafficking fentanyl. Despite broad support, some Republicans and left-wing senators opposed the aid, emphasizing domestic issues and opposition to funding Israel amid conflict in Gaza. The package represents a strategic alignment to support key U.S. allies and counter global threats.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Papua New Guinea opens embassy in

high-level United Nations meeting held in Tanzania, France announced its official recognition of Palestinian statehood, marking a significant shift in international diplomacy amid ongoing conflict in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron's declaration was met with strong applause at the U.N. General Assembly, joining a growing list of nations\u2014including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco\u2014that have recently recognized a Palestinian state. However, countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan participated in the meeting without extending such recognition.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reaffirmed that Palestinian statehood is a right, not a reward, directly challenging Israeli arguments that recognition legitimizes Hamas. Amid pressure and conflict, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking remotely after the U.S. revoked his visa, called for an end to violence and offered reforms, including changes to controversial social payments. The Palestinian Authority, widely criticized by some Palestinians, faces political rivalry with Hamas and limited control.\n\nDespite growing global support\u2014around three-quarters of U.N. member states now recognize Palestine\u2014the Israeli government remains firmly opposed, threatening annexation of parts of the West Bank. With peace talks stalled for over a decade, the international community continues to advocate for a two-state solution as the only viable path to long-term peace.","attribution":"AP

Profiles of Strong Israel Supporters (2000\u2013Present)\n\n## United States  \nThe **United States** has been Israel\u2019s staunchest ally in the 21st century, building on a decades-long \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d Since 2000, successive U.S. administrations have maintained robust diplomatic, military, and economic support for Israel. Washington provides Israel with unparalleled military aid \u2013 most notably a 2016 agreement to give $38\u00a0billion over ten years (about $3.8\u00a0billion annually), the largest U.S. aid package ever\u301028\u2020L186-L194\u3011. This funding enables Israel to upgrade fighter jets, improve military mobility, and bolster missile defenses\u301028\u2020L189-L197\u3011. The United States also consistently supplies Israel with advanced weaponry and joint defense projects (like the Iron Dome system), underscoring the strategic depth of the alliance. In 2017, the U.S. broke with precedent by formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving its embassy there in 2018\u301015\u2020L163-L171\u3011. It also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019, steps reflecting a pattern of U.S. diplomatic backing for core Israeli positions.  \n\nA hallmark of U.S. support is its **diplomatic shield for Israel on the world stage**. The U.S. frequently vetoes or blocks United Nations resolutions critical of Israel \u2013 more than any other Security Council member. In fact, Washington has vetoed dozens of UN Security Council measures on Israel, including **at least 53 vetoes since 1972**\u301030\u2020L62-L69\u3011. Even amid controversial conflicts, U.S. envoys often argue that UN resolutions are one-sided against Israel, and they use the U.S.\u2019s veto power accordingly\u301030\u2020L109-L117\u3011. For example, in 2011 the Obama administration vetoed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements, and in 2023 the U.S. vetoed calls for a Gaza ceasefire it deemed biased. These actions highlight *consistent support over time*: American diplomats reliably ensure Israel is not isolated in bodies like the UN Security Council. Only in rare instances has the U.S. diverged \u2013 notably in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained (rather than vetoing) a UN resolution on settlements, allowing it to pass. That moment \u2013 the first such abstention in nearly 40 years \u2013 was a brief deviation from the U.S.\u2019s otherwise **\u201cunequivocal support\u201d** of Israel at the UN\u301030\u2020L109-L117\u3011. By and large, Washington\u2019s message has been that it will **\u201cretain leverage and credibility with the Israeli government\u201d** by backing Israel in international fora\u30105\u2020L58-L66\u3011\u30105\u2020L63-L65\u3011.  \n\nMultiple factors drive America\u2019s strong pro-Israel stance. **Strategically**, Israel is seen as a key democratic partner in the Middle East, advancing U.S. interests in a volatile region. **Cultural and ideological ties** also run deep: American public opinion has long been sympathetic to Israel, influenced by shared values of democracy and by historical memory of the Holocaust. A significant **domestic factor** is the bipartisan political consensus in favor of Israel. Both major parties officially support Israel\u2019s right to exist in security; Congress reliably approves aid and arms sales. Pro-Israel advocacy is influential: organizations like AIPAC lobby effectively, and a sizeable Jewish-American community and an even larger evangelical Christian population provide a strong electoral base for pro-Israel policies. In particular, conservative evangelical Christians (a core constituency in the U.S.) view Israel in biblical terms and have championed policies such as recognizing Jerusalem. This religious support has bolstered the long-standing alliance. Indeed, some analysts note that U.S. politicians often frame support for Israel as a reflection of American values and faith. **Domestic politics** can shape tone: for example, the Trump administration (2017\u20132021) aligned almost lockstep with Israel\u2019s right-wing government \u2013 moving the embassy, cutting aid to Palestinians, and brokering the Abraham Accords \u2013 whereas the Obama administration had occasional friction (over settlements and the Iran deal) even as it increased military aid\u301028\u2020L203-L211\u3011\u301028\u2020L223-L231\u3011. Overall, however, *every U.S. president since 2000 has reinforced the alliance*. Notably, President George W. Bush solidified military cooperation during the Second Intifada and labeled Israel a partner in the \u201cwar on terror,\u201d President Obama signed the record $38\u00a0billion aid MOU\u301028\u2020L186-L194\u3011, President Trump made unprecedented diplomatic moves favoring Israel, and President Biden has declared America\u2019s support for Israel \u201cironclad\u201d even amid renewed conflict.  \n\nThis enduring partnership has seen **notable diplomatic actions**. In addition to the Jerusalem embassy move, the U.S. has repeatedly used its clout to favor Israel \u2013 for instance, withdrawing from or defunding UN agencies seen as overly critical of Israel, and sponsoring Israel\u2019s regional integration (e.g. the 2020 Abraham Accords normalized Israel\u2019s relations with several Arab states under U.S. auspices). Militarily, the U.S. and Israel hold joint exercises and share intelligence. Economically, the countries signed a Free Trade Agreement as early as 1985, and technology cooperation is intense to this day. **Key turning points** have tended to reinforce support rather than reduce it. Even when personal relations between leaders were tense (such as Netanyahu and Obama), institutional support remained firm \u2013 exemplified by the fact that the massive 10-year aid MOU was signed in the final months of Obama\u2019s term\u301028\u2020L203-L211\u3011. In domestic politics, support for Israel has occasionally become a partisan talking point (with Republicans accusing Democrats of being weaker on Israel, especially after the 2016 UN abstention\u301028\u2020L203-L211\u3011). However, U.S. policy has not fundamentally wavered. In sum, the United States\u2019 strong support for Israel since 2000 is grounded in strategic alliance, robust military aid, diplomatic backing (often as Israel\u2019s **veto-wielding protector at the UN**\u301030\u2020L87-L94\u3011), and deep political and cultural affinities that have proven largely consistent over time.  \n\n## Czech Republic  \nThe **Czech Republic** is widely considered Israel\u2019s closest friend in Europe since 2000. In fact, Israel has called the Czech Republic its \u201cbest friend on the continent\u201d\u30101\u2020L183-L192\u3011\u30101\u2020L201-L207\u3011, an extraordinary label reflecting Prague\u2019s consistent support. This friendship has **historical roots** and has grown stronger in the post-Communist era. Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic\u2019s predecessor) was one of the few countries that aided Israel\u2019s founding war: in 1948, Prague broke a UN arms embargo to supply Israel with rifles, machine guns, artillery, 80 aircraft, and training for pilots \u2013 tipping the balance in Israel\u2019s War of Independence\u30101\u2020L201-L209\u3011\u30101\u2020L199-L207\u3011. This early support left \u201ca special feeling\u201d in Czech-Israeli relations\u30101\u2020L209-L217\u3011. However, under Soviet influence, Communist Czechoslovakia severed ties after 1967 and even backed the PLO. That legacy was decisively reversed after 1989: democratic Czechoslovakia restored relations in 1990 and President V\u00e1clav Havel made Israel one of his first foreign visits\u30101\u2020L220-L227\u3011. Since the Czech Republic\u2019s 1993 establishment, it has pursued warm ties with Israel, anchored in both historical sympathy and a pro-Western foreign policy outlook.  \n\n**Diplomatically, the Czech Republic has been remarkably supportive of Israel in international fora**, often breaking from the European Union consensus to back Israel. A signature moment came in **November 2012**, when the Czech Republic was the **only European country to vote *against*** a UN General Assembly resolution granting the Palestinian Authority \u201cnon-member observer state\u201d status\u30101\u2020L183-L192\u3011\u30101\u2020L193-L202\u3011. Prague joined just eight other countries \u2013 including the U.S., Israel, Canada, and a few small states \u2013 in opposing the Palestinian upgrade, while all other EU states either abstained or voted yes\u30101\u2020L183-L192\u3011\u30101\u2020L193-L202\u3011. This lone \u201cNo\u201d vote in Europe surprised few, as the Czech government had established a pattern of siding with Israel (and often the U.S.) even when most of Europe did not. Czech leaders explained their 2012 UN vote by echoing the U.S. stance: they argued unilateral Palestinian statehood moves could hinder peace talks and that a two-state solution must come through direct negotiations\u30101\u2020L233-L242\u3011. Prague\u2019s UN voting record has repeatedly reflected strong pro-Israel leanings. For example, the Czechs often abstain or vote with Israel on recurring UN resolutions criticizing Israel\u2019s policies, whereas other EU members vote in favor. In recent crises, the Czech Republic has stood out as well: in late 2023, after the Hamas attack on Israel, the Czechs were among a small minority of **14 states** that voted *against* a UN General Assembly resolution calling for an immediate Gaza ceasefire and humanitarian aid access\u301026\u2020L78-L86\u3011. (That resolution passed 120\u201314, but Prague aligned with Washington and a few others in opposing it, showing continued solidarity with Israel\u2019s position\u301026\u2020L78-L86\u3011.) Such consistency has made the Czech Republic **\u201cno better friend in Europe\u201d**, as Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu remarked\u30101\u2020L201-L207\u3011.  \n\nThis steadfast support is driven by several factors. One is **historical and emotional**: Czech leaders often invoke their own nation\u2019s 20th-century experiences to empathize with Israel. Prime Minister Petr Ne\u010das, during a 2012 visit by Netanyahu, related Israel\u2019s precarious situation to that of pre-WWII Czechoslovakia \u2013 *\u201ca small nation surrounded by enemies\u201d*\u30101\u2020L209-L217\u3011. Having been a *\u201cpunchbag for aggressive neighbours\u201d* in the 1930s, Czechs feel a special solidarity with Israel\u2019s security challenges\u30101\u2020L183-L192\u3011\u30101\u2020L209-L217\u3011. Additionally, many Czech officials see supporting Israel as **correcting the Communist-era tilt** toward Arab states. The Communist regime had cut ties in 1967 and even decorated Yasser Arafat, but post-1989 Czech governments repudiated that legacy\u30101\u2020L215-L224\u3011\u30101\u2020L217-L224\u3011. Backing Israel is thus partly symbolic of the Czech Republic\u2019s break from its Soviet-dominated past and its alignment with Western democracies. Indeed, Czech foreign policy since 2000 has often been *\u201ccloser to the U.S. than the EU\u201d*\u30105\u2020L95-L102\u3011. A **centre-right, Atlanticist orientation** in Czech politics has reinforced this. Especially in the 2000s and 2010s, Czech center-right governments were strongly pro-American and euroskeptic, and by extension pro-Israel\u30105\u2020L95-L102\u3011\u30105\u2020L107-L115\u3011. They lobbied for hosting a U.S. missile defense radar and supported the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\u30101\u2020L249-L257\u3011. In that context, siding with Israel (often alongside Washington) came naturally. Key figures like President **Milo\u0161 Zeman** (2013\u20132023) were outspoken Israel supporters \u2013 Zeman criticized European \u201cappeasement\u201d of Palestinians and even proposed moving the Czech Embassy to Jerusalem. While the Czech embassy has remained in Tel Aviv, Zeman\u2019s administration did take symbolic steps, such as opening a \u201cCzech House\u201d cultural mission in Jerusalem in 2018, signaling recognition of Jerusalem\u2019s status\u30102\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u30102\u2020L15-L19\u3011. In 2017, after the U.S. announcement on Jerusalem, Prague acknowledged *West* Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital (while advocating a two-state solution)\u30104\u2020L31-L38\u3011, again breaking ranks with most of Europe. \n\n**Domestic politics** have largely favored pro-Israel policies. The Civic Democrats (ODS) and other center-right parties view Israel as a kindred democracy and strategic ally, while also courting evangelical Christian voters and pro-Israel sentiment among Czechs. The opposition Social Democrats have sometimes argued for a more \u201cmainstream European\u201d line on the Middle East\u30101\u2020L253-L261\u3011, warning that too much deviation (like the 2012 UN vote) isolates Prague in the EU\u30101\u2020L258-L265\u3011. But even left-leaning governments did not fundamentally alter the friendship \u2013 for instance, Czech diplomats helped push the EU to blacklist *all* of Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations\u301026\u2020L69-L77\u3011, aligning with Israeli security concerns. Across the spectrum, there is broad agreement on Israel\u2019s right to exist and defend itself. The Czech public, with relatively low levels of antisemitism and a history of positive Czech-Jewish relations, generally approves of friendly ties with Israel. There is also a small but influential Czech Jewish community and active pro-Israel advocacy in Prague. These factors create a domestic environment supportive of the alliance.  \n\nOn the **bilateral front**, Czech Republic\u2013Israel ties have flourished in trade, defense, science, and tourism. The two governments held **joint cabinet meetings** in 2012, 2014, and 2016 \u2013 with Czech ministers traveling to Jerusalem for **unique government-to-government sessions** to deepen cooperation\u301026\u2020L89-L97\u3011. Such meetings (often reserved for Israel\u2019s closest allies) underscore the closeness. Militarily, the Czech Republic has purchased Israeli defense technology (like drones), and Israel has shown interest in Czech defense industry products. The countries collaborate on R&D projects and share know-how in cyber security and medical innovation. **Notable diplomatic moments** include Prague\u2019s staunch defense of Israel during conflicts \u2013 for example, during the 2012 Gaza conflict, the Czech Foreign Ministry not only called for ending violence but also *\u201cunderlined Israel\u2019s right to self-defense\u201d* against Hamas rockets, a tone that **\u201cclosely resembled U.S. officials\u201d** and contrasted with more muted statements from France or Britain\u30101\u2020L231-L239\u3011\u30101\u2020L233-L242\u3011. Another example was May 2021, when Czech leaders flew the Israeli flag over government buildings in solidarity as Israel faced Hamas rocket fire (joining Austria in that gesture). Czech leaders have also frequently visited Israel. In 2022, the Czech Republic was one of a few EU states to oppose or abstain from UN resolutions seen as unfair to Israel, and Prague strongly supported the **Abraham Accords** that normalized Israel\u2019s relations with Arab states.  \n\n**Key turning points or deviations** have been minimal. The most significant internal debate occurs when Czech governments change: center-left administrations tend to recalibrate tone (emphasizing humanitarian aid to Palestinians or coordination with the EU), but even then, core support for Israel\u2019s security remains. For example, under a Social Democrat-led government (2014\u20132017), the Czech UN voting shifted slightly toward more EU alignment *without* becoming hostile to Israel. And under current governments, the trajectory is back to full-fledged support. A subtle shift happened in late 2023: while the Czech government firmly backed Israel after the Hamas attacks (even voting *no* on ceasefire resolutions\u301026\u2020L78-L86\u3011), former Foreign Minister **Cyril Svoboda** penned a public letter urging Israel to avoid excessive force in Gaza\u301026\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301026\u2020L99-L107\u3011. His message was that *\u201cdeep friendship does not mean supporting every decision\u201d* of the Israeli government\u301026\u2020L93-L100\u3011 \u2013 showing that even Israel\u2019s friends in Prague can voice concern over specific policies (in this case, opposing a full re-occupation of Gaza\u301026\u2020L99-L107\u3011). However, this did not translate into any withdrawal of support; it was framed as advice from a \u201ctraditional friend\u201d\u301026\u2020L121-L128\u3011. By and large, the Czech Republic\u2019s record since 2000 is one of **unwavering solidarity**, informed by history, bolstered by pro-U.S. strategic thinking, and sustained by a domestic political consensus that values the Czech\u2013Israeli bond. Prague today ranks \u201camong Israel\u2019s most friendly states, right alongside the USA\u201d\u301026\u2020L93-L100\u3011, a status it has earned through two decades of steadfast support.  \n\n## Papua New Guinea  \n**Papua New Guinea (PNG)** has, somewhat unexpectedly, become one of Israel\u2019s strong supporters in international arenas since 2000. This Melanesian nation established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1978, but in recent years it has stood out for its pro-Israel voting pattern and symbolic gestures. PNG is a deeply Christian country, and **religious and cultural factors** heavily influence its support for Israel. Over 95% of Papua New Guineans identify as Christian, and many, especially in evangelical and Pentecostal communities, hold Zionist beliefs (such as viewing the modern restoration of Israel as fulfillment of biblical prophecy). This creates a domestic climate supportive of Israel as the \u201cHoly Land\u201d and the Jewish people as biblical kin. Indeed, experts note that Pacific Island Christians often see Israel\u2019s existence as \u201cvital to their beliefs,\u201d and **governments align accordingly**\u301010\u2020L225-L233\u3011\u301010\u2020L227-L235\u3011. PNG\u2019s leaders have explicitly tied policy to faith: Prime Minister **James Marape** declared that to *\u201ccall ourselves Christian\u201d* as a nation, *\u201cpaying respect to God will not be complete without recognizing that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel\u201d*\u301025\u2020L217-L225\u3011. This striking statement accompanied **Papua New Guinea\u2019s decision to open an embassy in Jerusalem** \u2013 one of the boldest pro-Israel moves by any country in the region.  \n\nIn **September 2023**, PNG inaugurated its **Embassy in Jerusalem**, becoming only the sixth country worldwide to locate its mission in Israel\u2019s contested capital\u301010\u2020L205-L213\u3011\u301025\u2020L189-L197\u3011. Prime Minister Marape attended the opening alongside Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu, and openly framed the step in religious terms\u301025\u2020L217-L225\u3011. He pledged that PNG will support Israel at the United Nations and emphasized that *many nations avoid Jerusalem, but \u201cwe have made a conscious choice\u201d* grounded in Christian solidarity\u301025\u2020L213-L221\u3011\u301025\u2020L217-L225\u3011. Notably, Israel agreed to **fund PNG\u2019s Jerusalem embassy for its first two years**\u301025\u2020L209-L217\u3011, signaling how much Israel values PNG\u2019s friendship. The embassy move was indeed a milestone diplomatic action: PNG joined the U.S., Guatemala, Honduras, Kosovo, and (shortly after) Paraguay as the only states with embassies in Jerusalem\u301018\u2020L49-L57\u3011. This move followed years of PNG siding with Israel in international votes. For example, in a 2023 UN General Assembly vote on the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict, Papua New Guinea was among a handful of countries (and one of only two in its region) to vote *against* a two-state solution declaration that Israel opposed\u30108\u2020L241-L244\u3011. Similarly, in June 2025, PNG joined 11 other countries in voting *no* on a UN resolution calling for an immediate Gaza ceasefire (149 nations voted yes); seven of those no votes were tiny Pacific states including PNG\u301010\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u301010\u2020L185-L193\u3011. According to UN voting trackers, PNG has *\u201cbacked Israel in major U.N. votes\u201d* consistently\u30107\u2020L5-L12\u3011. These patterns highlight that **in international fora, Papua New Guinea reliably aligns with Israel** and the U.S., despite its otherwise Non-Aligned Movement heritage. \n\nSeveral reasons underlie PNG\u2019s support. As mentioned, **evangelical Christian influence** is paramount \u2013 political leaders often court church approval, and showing support for Israel resonates with domestic audiences who see Israel in a prophetic light\u301010\u2020L225-L233\u3011\u301010\u2020L227-L235\u3011. In PNG\u2019s cultural context, the idea of blessing Israel to receive blessings (a biblical promise from Genesis) is popular, which likely made the Jerusalem embassy a politically positive move at home. Additionally, **Israel has cultivated relationships with Pacific nations by offering development aid and technical assistance**, and PNG is a beneficiary of such outreach. Israel\u2019s international aid agency (MASHAV) and related NGOs have provided agricultural expertise, water management training, and health projects in various Pacific states as a way to \u201ccultivate rare votes of support\u201d at the UN\u301011\u2020L63-L71\u3011\u301011\u2020L65-L72\u3011. While PNG\u2019s direct aid from Israel is modest, the new embassy is expected to facilitate more Israeli involvement in PNG\u2019s development. At the opening, Netanyahu noted the embassy would help \u201cdevelop agriculture, health, water and technology projects\u201d in PNG\u301025\u2020L229-L237\u3011 \u2013 sectors where PNG seeks investment\u301025\u2020L229-L237\u3011. Such promises suggest **economic/diplomatic incentives** are reinforcing the religious motivations. PNG\u2019s economy (based on mining and agriculture) is relatively small, and having Israel as a partner \u2013 even if minor \u2013 diversifies its foreign relationships beyond the traditional heavyweights (Australia, China). \n\nAnother factor is **alignment with powerful allies**. Papua New Guinea has close ties with Australia and the United States. The U.S. and Australia have historically encouraged Pacific microstates to side with Western positions at the UN. For PNG, backing Israel (a key U.S. ally) helps maintain goodwill with Washington. Indeed, PNG\u2019s pro-Israel tilt grew more pronounced in the late 2010s when the U.S. under President Trump prioritized isolating anti-Israel initiatives. In 2018, PNG abstained on a UN vote condemning the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem \u2013 a stance welcomed by Israel. More recently, **regional dynamics** come into play: PNG\u2019s neighbors like Fiji and Tonga have also shown support for Israel, creating a regional bloc of pro-Israel Pacific votes. There is a sense of shared identity among these Pacific Christian-majority nations standing with Israel even as \u201cother western allies have grown frustrated\u201d with Israel\u2019s policies\u301010\u2020L171-L179\u3011\u301010\u2020L173-L181\u3011. However, this support has occasionally sparked *domestic* debates. In PNG, some civil society groups have questioned why their government sides with Israel despite humanitarian concerns in Palestine. But these voices remain relatively small. A Pacific analyst noted that supporting Israel is *\u201cpolitically convenient for [Pacific] governments because it is a majority view\u201d* in their societies\u301010\u2020L237-L245\u3011\u301010\u2020L249-L257\u3011. That holds true in Papua New Guinea, where opposition to the pro-Israel stance is limited to small activist circles, while the mainstream public and political class remain supportive. \n\nIn terms of **bilateral relations**, PNG\u2019s direct engagement with Israel ramped up notably after 2020. High-level visits have occurred (e.g. PNG\u2019s Foreign Minister visited Israel in 2020, and PM Marape planted a tree in Jerusalem in 2023). Israel does not receive much trade from PNG \u2013 bilateral trade was only about **$1\u00a0million per year** as of 2023\u301025\u2020L229-L237\u3011 \u2013 but both sides hope to increase this. PNG, for instance, can benefit from Israeli agricultural technology to improve its crop yields and food security. Militarily, there\u2019s little direct cooperation (PNG has a small defense force), but police and security training exchanges have been discussed, especially as Israel has expertise in counter-terrorism that PNG values for domestic security. There is also a **religious tourism connection**: many affluent Papua New Guineans travel to Israel on Christian pilgrimage tours, which the PNG government has informally encouraged as part of cultural links. \n\n**Notable turning points** in PNG\u2013Israel relations include the *2017 decision* to start publicly supporting Israel on contentious issues, the *2018 embassy announcement* (initially delayed) and finally the *2023 embassy opening*. Each of these marked a step up in commitment. There haven\u2019t been serious deviations from support; however, one potential risk is domestic backlash if Pacific solidarity with Palestinians grows. The Guardian reported that in some Pacific nations, \u201cpockets of resistance are beginning to build\u201d among younger citizens who question unwavering support of Israel amid the Gaza war\u301010\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301010\u2020L179-L187\u3011. In PNG, any such opposition has yet to significantly alter policy. For now, Papua New Guinea remains one of the few countries willing to consistently vote with Israel at the UN \u2013 even against overwhelming global opinion \u2013 and to take bold diplomatic steps like recognizing Jerusalem. As Marape said candidly, many countries avoid this out of caution, but PNG\u2019s leadership views it as a matter of principle and faith\u301025\u2020L213-L221\u3011. In summary, **Papua New Guinea\u2019s strong support for Israel** since 2000 (especially in the last decade) is rooted in religious solidarity, bolstered by friendly ties and aid from Israel, and facilitated by the geopolitical strategy of aligning with Western partners. The opening of PNG\u2019s Jerusalem embassy in 2023 stands as a concrete testament to this support, one that Israel has warmly welcomed as it seeks out loyal allies even \u201cunder a microscope\u201d\u301025\u2020L223-L227\u3011 in far-flung corners of the world.  \n\n## Federated States of Micronesia  \nThe **Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)** \u2013 a small Pacific Island nation \u2013 has been one of Israel\u2019s most consistent supporters since 2000, often voting with Israel (and the United States) *even when almost no one else does*. Micronesia\u2019s population is only about 115,000 and it has no Jewish community, yet at the United Nations its record of backing Israel is remarkable. According to UN voting analyses, **Micronesia has not cast a single vote against Israel in at least the past decade**, making it an even more reliable supporter than the U.S.\u301010\u2020L189-L197\u3011\u301010\u2020L191-L199\u3011. In many General Assembly votes \u2013 from condemning Israeli settlements to urging Gaza ceasefires \u2013 Micronesia is among the tiny handful of \u201cNo\u201d votes alongside Israel. For example, in the 2012 UN vote on Palestinian observer status, Micronesia joined Israel, the U.S., and a few others in voting *No*\u30105\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u30105\u2020L39-L43\u3011. Again in 2025, when 142 countries voted to reaffirm a two-state solution and condemn violence, Micronesia was one of only 10 voting *against*\u30108\u2020L239-L244\u3011. This pattern dates back to the 1990s and has continued unabated. In June 2025, a UN resolution calling for an immediate Gaza ceasefire saw **Micronesia and six other Pacific states** vote No, against 149 Yes votes\u301010\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u301010\u2020L185-L193\u3011. Such loyalty has at times made Micronesia famous in Israel; Israeli officials frequently express gratitude for Micronesia\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d when virtually everyone else says \u201cno.\u201d \n\nThe reasons for FSM\u2019s support are multi-layered. A critical factor is **Micronesia\u2019s unique relationship with the United States**. The Federated States of Micronesia (along with neighboring Palau and the Marshall Islands) is in a \u201cCompact of Free Association\u201d with the U.S. \u2013 essentially a treaty that makes these countries quasi-allies of Washington. Under this Compact, the U.S. provides financial aid and defense guarantees, and in exchange Micronesia consults closely with the U.S. on foreign policy and often votes with it in the UN\u301011\u2020L63-L71\u3011. In practice, Micronesia\u2019s UN votes have mirrored U.S. positions approximately 95% of the time. Since the U.S. is staunchly pro-Israel, Micronesia has followed suit as a matter of alliance solidarity. As one analysis put it, *\u201cthose first three [Pacific] nations are in free association with the U.S. \u2013 they receive financial assistance in exchange for voting with the U.S.\u201d*\u301011\u2020L63-L71\u3011. This **strategic calculus** ensures that FSM supports Israel on issues where the U.S. does. Indeed, from Micronesia\u2019s perspective, backing Israel ingratiates them with their most important ally, America.  \n\nBeyond U.S. influence, **Micronesia has developed a direct friendship with Israel** as well. Israel recognized and supported Micronesia when it became independent and joined the UN in 1990. Micronesian officials often mention that Israel was one of the earliest backers of Micronesia\u2019s UN membership and nation-building, which \u201chelped cement the relationship\u201d\u30106\u2020L173-L180\u3011\u30106\u2020L169-L177\u3011. Over the years, Israel has provided Micronesia with technical aid and development assistance disproportionate to the country\u2019s tiny size. Through its foreign aid agency **Mashav**, Israel has sponsored Micronesian students for agricultural training in Israel, sent experts to help with health and farming, and donated equipment for local needs\u301011\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u301011\u2020L75-L83\u3011. In the 2010s, Israeli NGOs (like Tag International Development) also engaged in Micronesia and other Pacific states to improve water access and healthcare\u301011\u2020L72-L80\u3011\u301011\u2020L79-L87\u3011. The underlying aim, as Israeli officials candidly admit, is partly to **\u201cgarner support for Israel in international forums\u201d** while also doing good\u301011\u2020L75-L83\u3011. And it has paid off: Micronesia\u2019s leaders feel a sense of loyalty for Israel\u2019s attention. Former Micronesian President Emanuel Mori captured this sentiment, comparing Micronesia and Israel as two small states surviving against odds. *\u201cIsrael is a minority in the Middle East and struggling to survive\u2026 We are also out there [alone]. We have no enemies, only natural ones\u2026 Being surrounded by not-friendly neighbors, we kind of pity them,\u201d* Mori said, expressing empathy for Israel\u2019s predicament\u30106\u2020L169-L177\u3011\u30106\u2020L171-L178\u3011. He also noted how Israel\u2019s early diplomatic support created a lasting bond\u30106\u2020L173-L180\u3011. Such statements reveal an **ideological affinity**: Micronesians see their own struggles with isolation and nature as analogous to Israel\u2019s struggle for survival, fostering a kinship despite vast geographical distance. \n\n**Religious and cultural ties** further reinforce FSM\u2019s pro-Israel stance. Like most of the Pacific Islands, Micronesia\u2019s population is overwhelmingly Christian (largely Protestant and Catholic). There is a strong current of Christian Zionism in the Pacific \u2013 the belief that supporting Israel is a biblical mandate. Many church groups in FSM teach that those who bless Israel will be blessed. While Micronesia\u2019s government is secular, its politicians are influenced by these societal attitudes. Being pro-Israel plays well domestically as a reflection of Christian values. Additionally, there is virtually no political cost for Micronesia to support Israel: FSM has no relations with any Arab country (nor significant trade), and it recognizes **Taiwan** rather than China, placing it firmly in the U.S.-led camp internationally. Thus, it faces little pressure from Muslim or Arab states that might otherwise dissuade pro-Israel votes. In fact, some analysts point out that Micronesia and its neighbors often *benefit* from their loyalty; for instance, when Arab nations boycotted them for voting with Israel, Israel stepped in to provide alternative aid or technical support\u301011\u2020L63-L71\u3011\u301011\u2020L65-L72\u3011. \n\nMicronesia\u2019s **consistency over time** is striking: *even U.S. support has occasionally wavered on minor votes, but Micronesia\u2019s has not*. UN Watch (a pro-Israel monitor) found Micronesia to be the most reliably pro-Israel country in the world in recent years\u301010\u2020L189-L197\u3011. On every major Israel-related vote \u2013 from condemning Hamas to opposing recognition of Palestinian statehood \u2013 Micronesia\u2019s \u201cno\u201d or abstention can be counted on. For example, in 2017 when the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem, Micronesia was one of only nine countries (including Israel and the U.S.) to vote against that resolution. And in 2021, when virtually the entire Security Council called for a halt to Israeli settlement expansion, Micronesia (though not on the Council) sided publicly with Israel\u2019s position. This **unbroken pattern** is so noted that Israeli newspapers often preface reports of UN votes with lines like \u201cthe US, Israel, and Micronesia (and a couple others) voted against\u2026\u201d. For Israel, it provides a psychological boost and talking point: *\u201cSee, not everyone opposes us; Micronesia (and others) stand with us.\u201d* From Micronesia\u2019s perspective, the benefits are tangible albeit behind the scenes. The U.S. and Israel extend good will and sometimes extra aid to say thanks. For instance, Israel has given Micronesia UN development assistance and agricultural technology in part as a reward for support\u30106\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u30106\u2020L165-L173\u3011. The **quid pro quo** is not overtly transactional, but as a Tablet Magazine investigation put it, *\u201cdevelopment is a way to cultivate votes of support for Israel in international forums\u201d*\u301011\u2020L63-L71\u3011\u301011\u2020L65-L72\u3011. Micronesia exemplifies this development diplomacy. \n\nIn terms of **military or economic ties**, Micronesia, being very small, has no military to speak of (the U.S. is responsible for its defense). However, Micronesian police and officials have benefited from Israeli training programs in areas like disaster response and agriculture. Economically, direct trade is negligible \u2013 the FSM\u2019s main trading partners are the U.S., Australia, and Japan \u2013 but Israeli tourists and businessmen occasionally visit for scuba tourism and tuna fisheries ventures. More significantly, Israel has become a source of **technical aid**: for example, Israeli drip-irrigation systems have been introduced to Micronesian farms via aid projects\u301011\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301011\u2020L79-L87\u3011. Such cooperation, while small-scale, is highly valued by FSM\u2019s government because it addresses local needs. Culturally, the friendship is visible in symbolic gestures: Micronesia often cosponsors Israel-backed resolutions (like on Holocaust remembrance at the UN), and Israel invites Micronesian leaders to major events. In 2013, Israel even held a special reception honoring Pacific nations for their UN support. \n\n**Domestic political factors** in Micronesia include its de-centralized federation structure (four states) where foreign policy is usually a low-profile issue. There is no significant opposition within FSM to supporting Israel; if anything, local media occasionally express pride that Micronesia \u201chas a voice\u201d on the world stage by standing with a country like Israel. The stability of Micronesia\u2019s pro-Israel stance transcends changes in its presidency or congress. Leaders from President Leo Falcam in 2000 to President Wesley Simina today have all maintained the line. This continuity is partly because the **Compact with the U.S. defines much of FSM\u2019s foreign policy**, and partly because *not* supporting Israel would risk losing the modest but meaningful benefits FSM gets from the U.S.-Israel side. \n\nThere have been **no major deviations** from Micronesia\u2019s support since 2000. The only potential challenge ahead is generational: younger Micronesian diplomats might question automatic alignment with the U.S. on every issue. But for now, loyalty holds. In 2018, when a UN resolution condemning Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza was up for vote, Micronesia not only voted with Israel but also spoke to justify its vote \u2013 an unusual step for a tiny nation in a global debate. If anything, FSM has doubled down: it joined the handful of countries recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital (though it has no embassy in Israel) and reportedly considered moving its UN vote consultation from its own capital to Israel\u2019s foreign ministry (a symbolic anecdote reflecting how tightly it coordinates with Israel). \n\nIn summary, **Micronesia\u2019s strong support for Israel** since 2000 is anchored in its alliance with the United States and nurtured by Israel\u2019s attentive diplomacy and aid. It has been extraordinarily consistent, with Micronesia serving as one of Israel\u2019s few automatic \u201cyes\u201d votes at the UN. Cultural empathy and evangelical Christian influence provide a social foundation for this stance, while strategic benefits (ensured U.S. patronage and Israeli technical help) provide practical incentives. The result is a tiny Pacific country punching above its weight diplomatically, known in Jerusalem as a *\u201cdependable vote\u201d* and even lauded as having \u201cthe best record of voting staunchly in favor of Israel at the United Nations\u201d\u301010\u2020L211-L219\u3011\u301010\u2020L207-L215\u3011. Micronesia\u2019s relationship with Israel may largely play out in New York conference rooms, but it is a vital part of the coalition that Israel counts on when facing global censure.  \n\n## Nauru  \nThe tiny **Republic of Nauru** \u2013 the world\u2019s third-smallest country (population ~12,000) \u2013 has been an outsized supporter of Israel in the 21st century. Despite its remote location in the Pacific and lack of geostrategic clout, Nauru consistently aligns with Israel in international votes and has taken bold pro-Israel stances. **Diplomatic relations** between Nauru and Israel were established in the 1990s, and since then Nauru has often joined Israel, the U.S., and Micronesia in the extremely small minority opposing UN resolutions critical of Israel. For instance, Nauru was one of the **nine countries** (with the U.S., Israel, Micronesia, etc.) to vote *against* the UN\u2019s recognition of Palestinian observer state status in 2012\u30105\u2020L30-L38\u3011\u30105\u2020L34-L42\u3011. It has voted with Israel on many other General Assembly resolutions over the years, such as those about Jerusalem, Palestinian rights, and Gaza conflicts. Palestinian officials have frequently singled Nauru out for its voting pattern: PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi condemned *\u201cNauru\u2019s\u2026 shameful voting record at the United Nations on the Question of Palestine\u201d*, noting that Nauru almost always sides with Israel\u301015\u2020L135-L143\u3011\u301015\u2020L139-L147\u3011. This reliable support is remarkable given Nauru\u2019s minuscule size and distance, and it has made Nauru a valued friend in Israeli eyes. \n\n**Why does Nauru support Israel so strongly?** A combination of **pragmatic aid diplomacy and ideological sympathy** appears to be at work. On the pragmatic side, Nauru has a history of leveraging diplomatic recognition for economic aid. The country has very limited resources (it once grew rich from phosphate mining but is now impoverished) and has at times traded diplomatic favors for financial assistance. For example, Nauru switched recognition between Taiwan and China multiple times in exchange for aid packages. A similar dynamic is often alleged with its pro-Israel stance. Israel, together with close ally Australia, has provided Nauru with various forms of help. Australia (a pro-U.S., pro-Israel country) is Nauru\u2019s primary benefactor and reportedly encourages Nauru\u2019s pro-Western, pro-Israel voting. Israel itself has given Nauru aid in areas like health \u2013 there were reports of Nauruan patients receiving treatment in Israel \u2013 and education (scholarships for Nauruan students in Israel). Moreover, Israel and Nauru cooperate in international forums; for instance, Israel has assisted Nauru\u2019s representation at the UN and even helped fund some of Nauru\u2019s UN-related expenses. In return, Nauru offers its loyal votes. As a blunt illustration, when Nauru recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in 2019, Palestinian officials accused it of doing so for \u201cfinancial or other considerations,\u201d implying a quid pro quo\u301015\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Ashrawi stated that *\u201csuch obligations [under international law] must not be compromised by financial\u2026 considerations\u201d*, essentially alleging that Nauru\u2019s stance had been bought\u301015\u2020L135-L143\u3011\u301015\u2020L139-L147\u3011. While Nauru and Israel reject the notion of an outright deal, it is clear Nauru\u2019s friendship with Israel has brought it attention and goodwill (and likely aid) that it greatly needs. \n\nOn the ideological side, **Nauru is a devoutly Christian society** (majority Protestant), and like its Pacific neighbors, it harbors pro-Israel sentiment rooted in Christian Zionism. The leadership elite in Nauru, including past presidents, have been educated in Australia or influenced by evangelical movements that teach support for Israel as a religious duty. **Domestic political factors** also play a role: aligning with Israel and the U.S. bolsters Nauru\u2019s international relevance and satisfies its powerful patron (Australia). Nauru has no Muslim population or Arab trade ties, so there is no domestic constituency against the pro-Israel policy. In fact, taking pro-Israel positions helps Nauru brand itself as a principled supporter of democracy (Nauru often frames it as standing with Israel, \u201cthe only democracy in the Middle East\u201d). Internally, that narrative faces little opposition given the populace\u2019s generally positive view of Israel (often informed by the Bible and by pro-Western attitudes). \n\n**Key highlights of Nauru\u2019s support** include its stance on Jerusalem. In August 2019, Nauru went beyond UN votes to formally **recognize the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel**\u301015\u2020L109-L117\u3011. Nauru\u2019s UN mission sent a letter to Israel confirming this decision, which Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister praised as an \u201cimportant decision\u201d and sign of \u201cclose ties and friendship\u201d\u301015\u2020L109-L117\u3011\u301015\u2020L113-L120\u3011. This made Nauru one of the very few countries (after the U.S. and Guatemala) to explicitly recognize Jerusalem in that period\u301015\u2020L163-L171\u3011. The move drew sharp criticism from the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League. The Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation both protested, with the Arab Parliament urging Nauru to **reconsider its recognition of Jerusalem**\u301014\u2020L19-L27\u3011. But Nauru did not waver. Similarly, in 2017 when the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned the U.S. decision on Jerusalem, Nauru was one of only nine \u201cNo\u201d votes, aligning staunchly with Washington and Tel Aviv. Israel has publicly and diplomatically thanked Nauru for these stands. For instance, Prime Minister Netanyahu personally met Nauru\u2019s then-President Baron Waqa in 2017 to thank him for Nauru\u2019s friendship. Later, in 2020, when Nauru voted against a UN resolution requesting an International Court of Justice opinion on the legality of Israel\u2019s occupation, Israeli officials again noted Nauru\u2019s support. \n\nBeyond the UN, Nauru also quietly cooperates with Israel in other international bodies. It has supported Israeli candidacies for UN committees and opposed resolutions in agencies like the World Health Organization that single out Israel. In one notable case, Nauru (along with other Pacific states) recognized Israel\u2019s credentials in UNESCO when some Arab states challenged them. These actions, though low-profile, are meaningful to Israel. From Israel\u2019s perspective, Nauru (and similar Pacific microstates) provide **\u201ca couple of dependable votes in the United Nations\u201d** and a source of moral support\u30106\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u30106\u2020L165-L173\u3011. In return, Israel provides Nauru with technical aid (e.g. Israeli doctors have visited Nauru to help with health crises) and political backing. For example, when Nauru faced criticism for hosting an Australian offshore refugee detention center, Israel was one of the few countries that didn\u2019t join the chorus of condemnation \u2013 a diplomatic IOU of sorts. \n\n**Consistency over time**: Nauru\u2019s support has been remarkably steady since 2000. During some periods, Nauru even lacked a functioning government (due to internal political chaos), yet whenever it participated in UN votes, it kept siding with Israel. There was a brief moment in the early 2000s when Nauru switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China; during that time, its UN votes were absent or sporadic. But once Nauru returned to the Taiwan/U.S. fold, it reasserted its pro-Israel pattern. By the late 2000s and 2010s, Nauru was voting with Israel nearly 100% on key resolutions. **No major deviations** are recorded; if anything, Nauru has doubled down, as evidenced by the Jerusalem recognition in 2019. However, Nauru\u2019s very reliance on external aid means its foreign policy could potentially shift if its benefactors changed. For instance, if Australia or the U.S. significantly altered their stances, Nauru might follow. But given Australia and the U.S. remain pro-Israel, Nauru is unlikely to break ranks. \n\nOne **turning point** to note is that in recent years, Israel has reciprocated Nauru\u2019s support by helping amplify Nauru\u2019s concerns. Israel has spoken on behalf of Nauru\u2019s climate change issues at the UN (small islands face rising seas) and supported Nauru\u2019s attempts to get funding for environmental damages from phosphate mining. This broader cooperation suggests the relationship, while initially transactional, has evolved into a genuine partnership in some areas. Still, to the outside observer, Nauru\u2019s unwavering votes for Israel appear striking. In global media, Nauru is often grouped with a few other Pacific states as an *\u201coddball coalition\u201d* that stands with the U.S. and Israel against the vast majority\u30105\u2020L30-L38\u3011\u30105\u2020L33-L37\u3011. Nauru itself seems to embrace this role. Its officials often say that *size does not matter in principles* and that Nauru will \u201cstand for what is right\u201d (implying support for Israel\u2019s legitimacy). In 2023, Nauru was again among the minuscule minority (10 countries) voting with Israel and the U.S. against a UN resolution on the Middle East conflict\u30108\u2020L239-L244\u3011. As long as current incentives and values remain, Nauru is likely to continue being one of Israel\u2019s most **loyal supporters**. To Israel, Nauru\u2019s friendship, though from a tiny isle, carries symbolic weight: it shows that Israel is *not completely alone* on the world stage, and it underscores the success of Israel\u2019s outreach to distant allies. In summary, **Nauru\u2019s strong support for Israel** since 2000 is a product of diplomatic pragmatism (aid and alliance considerations) combined with a cultural and religious affinity for the Jewish state. This mix has produced a steadfast, if unusual, alliance that both Nauru and Israel have found mutually beneficial.  \n\n## Paraguay  \n**Paraguay** has been one of Israel\u2019s most steadfast supporters in Latin America since 2000, marked by warm diplomatic relations, pro-Israel votes, and even the relocation of its embassy to Jerusalem \u2013 albeit with some twists and turns. The landlocked South American nation has a *long history* of friendship with Israel: Paraguay was among the countries that voted for the UN partition plan in 1947, recognizing the Jewish state\u2019s creation. It established diplomatic ties early and maintained them even when some Latin states broke off after wars. Since 2000, Paraguay\u2019s support has become more pronounced. A pivotal moment was **May 2018**, when Paraguay\u2019s then-President **Horacio Cartes** moved the Paraguayan Embassy from Tel Aviv to **Jerusalem**, following the U.S. and Guatemala\u301015\u2020L163-L171\u3011\u301039\u2020L199-L207\u3011. At the Jerusalem inauguration ceremony, Israeli PM Netanyahu hailed Paraguay for being \u201camong the first\u201d \u2013 noting Paraguay was the second country to recognize Israel in 1948 and now one of the first to relocate an embassy in 2018\u301039\u2020L193-L201\u3011\u301039\u2020L199-L207\u3011. Cartes framed the move as \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d reflecting Paraguay\u2019s 70 years of friendship with Israel\u301020\u2020L139-L148\u3011\u301020\u2020L155-L163\u3011. This bold step cemented Paraguay\u2019s image as a strongly pro-Israel country. Although a subsequent government reversed that decision (more on that shortly), Paraguay\u2019s overall trajectory has remained very favorable to Israel.  \n\n**Diplomatically**, Paraguay has often aligned with Israel in international bodies. It reliably abstains or votes against one-sided resolutions criticizing Israel. For example, Paraguay was one of a handful of countries (and the only South American one) to vote *no* on a September 2025 UN resolution endorsing a two-state solution declaration that Israel opposed\u30108\u2020L239-L244\u3011. Likewise, Paraguay often joined the U.S., Israel, and a few others in opposing UNGA resolutions on Palestinian issues. This consistency is tied to Paraguay\u2019s political leadership and alliances. Paraguay\u2019s ruling Colorado Party (a conservative party that has governed for most of the past 75 years) has generally been pro-West and pro-Israel. Particularly in the 2010s, Paraguay\u2019s leaders saw closeness to Israel as part of aligning with the United States and distinguishing Paraguay on the world stage. **Domestic political factors**, such as evangelical Christianity and anti-communism, also play a role. Paraguay\u2019s population is heavily Christian (mostly Catholic, but a growing evangelical movement wields influence). Evangelical churches in Paraguay, as elsewhere in Latin America, often advocate support for Israel. In fact, the countries in the region that moved embassies to Jerusalem \u2013 Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay \u2013 all have strong evangelical or conservative Christian influence in politics\u301018\u2020L67-L75\u3011. Paraguay\u2019s leaders tapped into this: for example, when Cartes moved the embassy, local evangelical groups applauded the decision as fulfilling biblical prophecy.  \n\nFurthermore, **Paraguay\u2019s foreign policy orientation is highly influenced by its desire for close ties with the United States**. During the Trump administration (2017\u20132020), supporting Israel became almost a litmus test for favor with Washington. Paraguay\u2019s conservative leadership at the time was keen to \u201ccurry favor\u201d with President Trump by aligning on high-profile issues\u301018\u2020L71-L78\u3011. As an AP analysis noted, **Paraguay sought to strengthen its alliance with Israel and Taiwan as \u201ctwo causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres of Republicans.\u201d**\u301018\u2020L71-L78\u3011 Both Israel and Taiwan are key U.S. allies, and Paraguay is one of the few countries that maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan over China. By staunchly supporting Israel, Paraguayan leaders signaled ideological kinship with U.S. Republicans (who strongly back Israel) and differentiated Paraguay from more left-leaning Latin governments. This paid off: the Trump administration publicly praised Paraguay\u2019s embassy move and Paraguay\u2019s votes at the UN. Paraguayan officials, in turn, gained access \u2013 for instance, Paraguay\u2019s foreign minister was among the first to meet Trump after his 2016 victory\u301018\u2020L77-L84\u3011. Domestically, being pro-Israel also resonated with Paraguay\u2019s conservative base, which includes influential Mennonite and evangelical communities who see Israel as a partner in shared values (and also appreciate Israel\u2019s tough stance against groups like Hamas and Iran, given Paraguay\u2019s concerns about Iran-linked militancy in the tri-border region).  \n\n**Military and economic ties** between Paraguay and Israel, while not huge, are significant in niche areas. Israel has provided Paraguay with security assistance such as police training, intelligence sharing, and equipment to combat organized crime. (Notably, Paraguay has battled Hezbollah-linked smuggling networks in the tri-border area; Israel has been a quiet partner in advising on this front.) During Paraguay\u2019s long dictatorship under Alfredo Stroessner (1954\u20131989), Israel was one of the arms suppliers to the regime after the U.S. imposed restrictions \u2013 a fact remembered by some Paraguayan military figures. In the 2000s and 2010s, Israel sold Paraguay surveillance drones and cybersecurity systems to aid its internal security. Economically, trade is modest (agricultural products and some tech), but there are growing Israeli investments in Paraguay\u2019s **agribusiness** sector. Israeli firms have consulted on improving Paraguayan cattle ranching and irrigation, given Israel\u2019s expertise in agriculture. Also, Paraguay, a major beef exporter, has been keen to enter the Israeli kosher beef market. Israel and Paraguay have signed agreements on technological cooperation and on Holocaust education (Paraguay has shown solidarity with Israel on combating antisemitism). **Aid** is not a big factor, as Paraguay is now an upper-middle-income country, but Israel has occasionally provided disaster relief (e.g. after floods) and COVID-19 medical supplies, gestures that reinforce goodwill. \n\nThe most headline-grabbing **diplomatic actions** have revolved around the **Jerusalem embassy**. As noted, President Cartes moved the embassy in May 2018\u301015\u2020L163-L171\u3011\u301039\u2020L199-L207\u3011. However, just months later in September 2018, a new Paraguayan president, **Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez**, reversed that decision and moved the embassy back to Tel Aviv\u301018\u2020L23-L31\u3011. Abdo, also of the Colorado Party but seen as more traditional, cited a desire to remain in line with international consensus and to not disrupt Paraguay\u2019s relations with Arab countries (which import Paraguayan beef). Israel was displeased and responded by closing its embassy in Paraguay at the time. This episode was a *temporary deviation* from unwavering support \u2013 essentially Paraguay stepped back to a more neutral stance for a couple of years. Nonetheless, even during Abdo\u2019s tenure (2018\u20132023), Paraguay\u2019s votes at the UN generally remained pro-Israel or neutral (abstaining on anti-Israel resolutions rather than supporting them). The embassy re-relocation was an anomaly driven by a particular administration\u2019s calculation. Fast forward to 2023: a new president, **Santiago Pe\u00f1a**, took office (also Colorado Party, but closely allied to Cartes). Pe\u00f1a announced plans to **move the embassy back to Jerusalem**, restoring the pro-Israel policy. He quickly made good on this promise. In **December 2024, Paraguay officially reopened its embassy in Jerusalem**\u301018\u2020L19-L27\u3011\u301018\u2020L25-L33\u3011, becoming the first country to do so since the 2023 Hamas\u2013Israel war began. Netanyahu attended the ceremony and hailed Paraguay as a close ally. This made Paraguay, once again, part of the exclusive group with embassies in Jerusalem\u301018\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Israel reciprocated by announcing it would reopen its embassy in Paraguay\u2019s capital, Asunci\u00f3n. The speedy move in 2024 underscored Paraguay\u2019s renewed commitment; as Israel\u2019s foreign minister said, the two countries share a *\u201cfriendship based not only on interests but also values and principles.\u201d*\u301018\u2020L59-L67\u3011. He went on to sign cooperation agreements in tech and agriculture, signaling deepening ties\u301018\u2020L61-L69\u3011.  \n\nParaguay\u2019s strong support is also driven by **ideology and values**. The country\u2019s leadership often invokes the idea that Paraguay and Israel share a common struggle and ethos. Paraguay endured isolation and sanctions in the past (especially during the Stroessner era) and appreciates steadfast friends. Israel, likewise isolated in its region, is seen as a nation that stood by Paraguay. Additionally, many in Paraguay\u2019s conservative circles admire Israel\u2019s economic success and national resilience, seeing it as a model. On the religious side, as mentioned, Paraguay\u2019s evangelical movement (though smaller than Guatemala\u2019s) has been vocal. For instance, Paraguayan pastors lobbied President Pe\u00f1a to undo the 2018 embassy reversal, arguing it was against God\u2019s will to withdraw recognition of Jerusalem. That pressure dovetailed with Pe\u00f1a\u2019s own alignment with pro-Trump Republicans \u2013 Pe\u00f1a even received an award from the **American Jewish Committee** for bolstering the friendship with Israel\u301016\u2020L9-L17\u3011. The AJC noted Paraguay\u2019s \u201cenduring friendship with the Jewish people and Israel\u201d and honored Pe\u00f1a for reopening the Jerusalem embassy\u301016\u2020L9-L17\u3011. Such international praise reinforces Paraguay\u2019s resolve. \n\nLooking at **consistency over time**: except for the 2018\u20132023 Jerusalem wobble, Paraguay has been reliably pro-Israel. Even during leftist governments in Latin America\u2019s Pink Tide era, Paraguay (which never elected a leftist president in that wave) remained friendly to Israel, in contrast to neighbors like Argentina or Brazil which sometimes took critical stances. Paraguay\u2019s UN voting record shows very few votes in favor of resolutions opposed by Israel. For example, Paraguay abstained on the 2012 Palestinian status vote (it did not join the \u201cyes\u201d majority, indicating caution) and often abstains on resolutions about Israeli settlements, rather than supporting condemnation. Paraguay also **supports Israel in other ways**: it has opposed recognizing Palestinian statehood in Mercosur (the South American trade bloc), and it designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organization (in line with Israel\u2019s view, a step some other Latin countries have hesitated on). These actions illustrate a broader alignment on security issues. \n\n**Key turning points** include the embassy moves, as discussed. The reversal in 2018 was seen as a blow to Israel\u2013Paraguay relations, but the relationship proved resilient. Israel\u2019s temporary closure of its embassy in Asunci\u00f3n in 2018 was reversed in 2019 when relations improved; this hiccup showed that while support is strong, it\u2019s not immune to political change. However, the election of Pe\u00f1a in 2023 (effectively backed by Cartes) brought a full restoration. As AP News reported, *\u201cthe ascension of Pe\u00f1a to the presidency in 2023 helped revive Paraguay\u2019s strong ties with Israel\u201d* after his predecessor\u2019s reversal\u301018\u2020L83-L90\u3011. Indeed, Pe\u00f1a wasted no time. By December 2024, Paraguay\u2019s embassy was open in Jerusalem and Netanyahu called it a \u201cdiplomatic victory\u201d during a time when Israel was otherwise facing isolation\u301016\u2020L5-L13\u3011. Paraguay thus went from leading in 2018, to a brief retreat, and back to leading in supporting Israel. This suggests that *leadership alignment* is crucial: Cartes and Pe\u00f1a (and the Colorado Party\u2019s right wing) are ardently pro-Israel, whereas a more pragmatic wing under Abdo showed caution. But even Abdo did not fundamentally oppose Israel; he simply put relations on a more \u201cnormal\u201d footing for a while. \n\nLooking ahead, Paraguay\u2019s support seems durable. Both countries benefit: Israel gains a loyal ally in South America (especially valued as other countries in the region sometimes elect governments critical of Israel), and Paraguay gains technology, security ties, and favor with the U.S. In Latin America, **Paraguay is now one of Israel\u2019s closest allies**, alongside Guatemala and Honduras\u301018\u2020L67-L75\u3011. All three share **\u201cstrong evangelical churches\u201d** that influence their politics\u301018\u2020L67-L75\u3011. Additionally, all three recognize Taiwan, indicating a broader ideological alignment with the U.S. global posture. It\u2019s worth noting that Paraguay\u2019s pro-Israel stance also distinguishes it from some neighboring countries and thus elevates its profile. For example, Argentina \u2013 a regional big player \u2013 has historically been more ambivalent; Paraguay\u2019s clear support gives it a niche diplomatic identity. \n\nIn conclusion, **Paraguay\u2019s strong support for Israel since 2000** is anchored in a historical friendship and has intensified due to shared conservative and religious values, the pursuit of U.S. favor, and tangible cooperation in security and development. While there was a brief cooling of one aspect of the relationship (the embassy location), Paraguay\u2019s overall trajectory has been one of deepening ties. The reopening of the Jerusalem embassy in 2024 \u301018\u2020L25-L33\u3011 caps this trend, making Paraguay again \u201cone of Israel\u2019s closest allies in Latin America\u201d\u301018\u2020L67-L75\u3011. Israeli leaders have lauded Paraguay\u2019s loyalty, noting that the two nations\u2019 bond is built on both **interests and principles**\u301018\u2020L59-L67\u3011. This mix of realpolitik and sincere affinity suggests Paraguay\u2019s support will remain robust, barring any major political shift in Asunci\u00f3n.  \n\n## Guatemala  \n**Guatemala** holds a special place as one of Israel\u2019s earliest and strongest friends, a relationship that has remained robust since 2000. In fact, Guatemala\u2019s ties to Israel date back to Israel\u2019s founding: Guatemala was the **second country in the world to recognize the State of Israel**, in 1948\u301020\u2020L139-L148\u3011, and its UN ambassador played a key role in lobbying for the partition plan. This historical goodwill has carried into the modern era. For decades, Guatemala maintained an embassy in Jerusalem (opened in 1956) until international pressure in 1980 prompted a move to Tel Aviv\u301020\u2020L139-L147\u3011. Fast forward to the 21st century: Guatemala has consistently supported Israel diplomatically, and notably, in **May 2018 it became the first country (after the U.S.) to move its Israeli embassy back to Jerusalem**\u301039\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301039\u2020L189-L197\u3011. Guatemalan President **Jimmy Morales** presided over the Jerusalem embassy inauguration just two days after the U.S. opened its own new embassy\u301039\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301039\u2020L189-L197\u3011. At that ceremony, Netanyahu praised Guatemala: *\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence Guatemala is opening its embassy in Jerusalem among the first. You were always among the first. You were the second country to recognize Israel.\u201d*\u301039\u2020L193-L201\u3011. Morales responded that Guatemala, Israel, and the U.S. *\u201cshare friendship, courage and loyalty\u201d*\u301039\u2020L199-L207\u3011\u301039\u2020L193-L201\u3011. This event epitomized Guatemala\u2019s strong support: it stood almost alone globally (alongside the U.S.) in defying international consensus on Jerusalem, emphasizing its unwavering friendship. \n\n**Diplomatically**, Guatemala often aligns with Israel in the UN and other international arenas. In December 2017, when the UN General Assembly voted 128\u20139 to condemn the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem, Guatemala was one of the **nine** \u201cNo\u201d votes siding with the U.S. and Israel. Guatemala has repeatedly voted against or abstained on resolutions seen as anti-Israel. For example, in the 2025 UN vote on a two-state solution declaration, Guatemala abstained (not supporting the measure which Israel opposed). Overall, Guatemala tends to break from the Latin American bloc (which historically leaned pro-Palestinian in the UN) to support Israel\u2019s positions. This consistency is partly explained by **ideological and religious drivers** within Guatemala. The country is **the most heavily evangelical Christian nation in Latin America** \u2013 over 40% of Guatemalans are evangelical Protestants, a higher share than even Catholics now\u301019\u2020L25-L33\u3011. Evangelical churches in Guatemala are fervently pro-Israel, often teaching Christian Zionist theology. They see the Jews as God\u2019s chosen people and Israel\u2019s rebirth as fulfillment of prophecy. This has translated into public opinion and political pressure strongly favoring Israel. President Jimmy Morales (2016\u20132020) himself is an evangelical Christian, and he openly cited faith as a reason for the embassy move, saying it was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d and that it \u201cplays well with an important part of [his] electoral base\u201d\u301020\u2020L115-L124\u3011\u301020\u2020L155-L163\u3011. Indeed, Guatemalan evangelicals celebrated the move as a moral victory. At least one evangelical pastor accompanied Morales to the embassy inauguration in Jerusalem\u301020\u2020L155-L163\u3011. **Domestic politics** thus provided a tailwind \u2013 Morales sought to shore up support among right-wing evangelicals at a time when he faced corruption allegations at home\u301020\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301020\u2020L173-L181\u3011. Backing Israel was a popular and relatively easy \u201cdomestic win\u201d for him\u301020\u2020L111-L119\u3011. Michael Allison, a political scientist, noted that *\u201cright-wing evangelical support for Morales and their support for the state of Israel\u201d* were key factors in the decision\u301020\u2020L119-L127\u3011. In other words, Guatemala\u2019s Israel policy was in line with what both the leadership and a large segment of society wanted. \n\nBeyond religion, **historical and cultural affinity** also play roles. Guatemala has long seen itself as a friend of Israel. During Guatemala\u2019s brutal civil war (1960\u20131996), when the U.S. cut off military aid over human rights concerns, **Israel stepped in to supply arms and training** to Guatemalan regimes\u301020\u2020L143-L151\u3011. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Israel provided Galil rifles, intelligence systems, and other support to Guatemala\u2019s military government\u301020\u2020L143-L151\u3011. This forged a sense of loyalty in parts of Guatemala\u2019s military and political establishment \u2013 Israel was there when others abandoned them. After the war, democratic Guatemala continued close ties: Israel has aided Guatemala with agricultural projects, and Israeli experts have helped in areas like water management and disaster response (Guatemala is prone to earthquakes and floods). Culturally, Guatemala has a small but prominent Jewish community, and Jewish-Guatemalan diplomats and businesspeople have often fostered bilateral ties. A point of pride is that **Guatemala\u2019s capital, Guatemala City, has a prominent \u201cIsrael Street\u201d and a plaza named after Golda Meir** \u2013 symbolic of the public friendship. In 2018, Guatemala\u2019s Congress declared May 14 (the date of Israel\u2019s independence and the U.S. embassy move) as \u201cIsrael-Guatemala Friendship Day\u201d\u301020\u2020L147-L155\u3011. These gestures reflect genuine warmth in the relationship. \n\nFrom a **strategic perspective**, Guatemala also values its alignment with the United States. Following the U.S. lead on Israel has benefits: the Trump administration was pleased by Guatemala\u2019s embassy move, and Vice President Mike Pence even called President Morales to thank him. This likely contributed to goodwill and possibly to U.S. support on other issues (like migration aid or trade). Guatemala historically has positioned itself close to U.S. foreign policy, and backing Israel is part of that alignment. Guatemalan diplomats often coordinate with American counterparts on Middle East votes. However, it\u2019s not purely clientelism; Guatemala\u2019s stance on Israel long predates any one U.S. administration. It\u2019s rooted in consistent policy across both conservative and centrist governments in Guatemala. For instance, even under more centrist leaders (like \u00d3scar Berger in the 2000s), Guatemala maintained cordial relations and refrained from anti-Israel votes. \n\n**Military and economic relations** between Israel and Guatemala have continued in the modern era. Israel has provided Guatemala\u2019s security forces with training, particularly in police modernization and counter-narcotics (given Guatemala\u2019s struggles with drug trafficking). Israeli defense firms have sold Guatemala equipment such as surveillance gear. On the economic front, trade is modest but growing \u2013 Israeli companies have invested in Guatemala\u2019s energy and telecom sectors, and bilateral trade includes agriculture, chemicals, and technology. After 2018, there was an uptick in Israeli tourism to Guatemala (including evangelical Christians seeing Guatemala as a pro-Israel pilgrimage partner). Israel also regularly provides aid in crises; for example, when Guatemala\u2019s Fuego volcano erupted in 2018, Israel sent immediate humanitarian aid. These tangible ties reinforce the diplomatic bond. \n\n**Notable diplomatic actions** beyond the embassy include high-level visits and support in multilateral organizations. Prime Minister Netanyahu visited Guatemala in the 2010s (the first visit by an Israeli PM to Latin America, which included Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico as well). Guatemala has often been the **first Latin American country to take pro-Israel steps**: it recognized Israel early, returned its embassy to Jerusalem swiftly, and consistently speaks up on Israel\u2019s behalf. In 2020, Guatemala joined a small group of countries opposing a UN Human Rights Council resolution to investigate Israel (breaking from the Latin American majority). Guatemalan ambassadors in Geneva and New York frequently take the floor to defend Israel\u2019s right to security and to condemn Hamas or Hezbollah. Such consistency has led Israel\u2019s leaders to call Guatemala a **\u201cspecial friend\u201d**\u301019\u2020L37-L40\u3011 and even an example to others. In Latin conferences, Guatemalan officials sometimes encourage neighbors to adopt a more balanced approach to Israel rather than automatic support for Palestinian narratives. \n\n**Domestic lobbying** is also a factor: Guatemala has an active Evangelical Alliance that lobbies the government on Israel, and various pro-Israel NGOs (often church-linked) operate in the country. Their influence was seen in 2018 when Morales\u2019s decision to move the embassy received ringing endorsements from evangelical leaders and conservative media. Conversely, there\u2019s relatively little pro-Palestinian activism in Guatemala \u2013 no large Palestinian diaspora (unlike, say, Chile), and leftist groups that might champion the Palestinian cause have been weaker in Guatemala since the civil war. Thus, the domestic cost for a pro-Israel policy is minimal, while the benefit in terms of support from key groups is substantial. \n\nOne **turning point** to observe is political transition. After Morales left office in 2020, he was succeeded by Alejandro Giammattei, another conservative who maintained the embassy in Jerusalem and the close ties. In 2023, Guatemala elected Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, a center-left president-elect. Ar\u00e9valo has indicated he will not move the embassy back to Tel Aviv, signaling continuity, though he may focus more on a two-state solution in rhetoric. Even under more left-leaning leadership, Guatemala\u2019s fundamental friendship with Israel is likely to endure \u2013 both because it\u2019s ingrained in state policy and because any Guatemalan leader must consider the powerful evangelical constituency. In fact, Yair Lapid (Israel\u2019s then-Foreign Minister) congratulated Ar\u00e9valo on his win, and Ar\u00e9valo responded positively, hinting at ongoing cooperation\u301019\u2020L9-L17\u3011. Thus, while domestic politics can influence tone (Morales\u2019 overt religiosity vs. Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s more secular stance), the *consistency of support* is expected to continue. \n\nIn sum, **Guatemala\u2019s support for Israel since 2000** has been unwavering and multi-faceted: born of historical camaraderie, reinforced by religious and domestic political alignment, and confirmed by bold diplomatic moves like the Jerusalem embassy. It has manifested in consistent UN votes backing Israel or opposing anti-Israel measures, in robust bilateral exchanges, and in public declarations of solidarity. Guatemala likes to say it \u201cstands with Israel.\u201d As Morales succinctly put it, *\u201cGuatemala is historically pro-Israeli. In 70 years of relations, Israel has been our ally.\u201d*\u301019\u2020L43-L49\u3011 This sentiment \u2013 voiced at the time of the embassy move \u2013 captures the enduring nature of the relationship. For Israel, Guatemala is not just another ally; it is often highlighted as a model, a country where **support for Israel \u201cruns through large parts of society\u201d**\u301019\u2020L1-L4\u3011. That societal support provides a durable foundation that transcends individual governments. The Guatemalan and Israeli flags projected together on Jerusalem\u2019s walls during the 2018 embassy ceremony symbolized a friendship that, having weathered decades, appears set to remain strong in the years ahead.  \n\n## Austria  \n**Austria** has undergone a notable evolution in its relationship with Israel, transforming from a somewhat ambivalent partner during the Cold War into a **strong supporter of Israel in the 21st century**. Since 2000, Austria has increasingly aligned itself with Israel\u2019s security concerns and fostered closer diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. This shift is rooted in historical reckoning, political leadership changes, and strategic considerations. Importantly, Austria today emphasizes its *special responsibility* toward Israel given Austria\u2019s World War II history \u2013 a stark change from the post-war decades when Austria distanced itself from that responsibility. By the 2000s, Austria began openly acknowledging its complicity in Nazi persecution of Jews, and this has translated into a commitment to Israel\u2019s security and the fight against antisemitism. The Austrian Foreign Ministry states that since establishing relations in 1956, **\u201cAustria and Israel have developed a close partnership covering a broad spectrum from political exchange to economic, scientific and cultural relations,\u201d** and that *\u201cIsrael\u2019s legitimate security interests are a special concern for Austria.\u201d*\u301044\u2020L552-L560\u3011\u301044\u2020L554-L560\u3011. It also notes that *\u201cremembrance of the Holocaust as well as restitution and compensation for Austrian Holocaust survivors are a shared central concern\u201d* in the relationship\u301044\u2020L552-L560\u3011\u301044\u2020L554-L560\u3011. This official policy framework underlines how historical memory and moral commitment drive modern Austrian support for Israel. \n\n**Diplomatically**, Austria has become one of Israel\u2019s more sympathetic voices within the European Union. While Austria still often votes with the EU consensus at the UN (which can be critical of Israel), it has distinguished itself by sometimes breaking ranks or taking nuanced positions in Israel\u2019s favor. For example, Austria has generally supported Israel\u2019s right to self-defense in EU statements and has shown reluctance to endorse one-sided resolutions. A dramatic display of solidarity came in May 2021 during the Israel\u2013Hamas conflict: **Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ordered the Israeli flag flown atop the federal chancellery and Foreign Ministry in Vienna** as a sign of support for Israel amid Hamas rocket attacks\u301023\u2020L195-L203\u3011\u301023\u2020L223-L231\u3011. This highly symbolic move drew international notice \u2013 and even led Iran\u2019s foreign minister to cancel a visit to Vienna in protest\u301023\u2020L195-L203\u3011\u301023\u2020L223-L231\u3011. Austria\u2019s response was unapologetic: a government spokesperson said Austria \u201cwill not remain silent\u201d when Hamas fires thousands of rockets at Israel\u2019s civilians\u301023\u2020L205-L213\u3011. This incident captures how Austria under Kurz took a firmly pro-Israel stance even at the cost of straining ties with countries like Iran. Austria has also aligned with Israel on issues like Hezbollah: Vienna pushed the EU to designate **all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization**, as Israel long requested, and in 2020 Austria did ban Hezbollah\u2019s activities entirely. In the UN General Assembly, Austria\u2019s voting record has improved from Israel\u2019s perspective \u2013 often abstaining rather than voting yes on anti-Israel resolutions, and sometimes voting no. Notably, in 2022 Austria abstained on a contentious UN resolution seeking an ICJ opinion on Israel\u2019s occupation (many EU states voted in favor). And during the 2023 Gaza war, Austria reportedly joined a small minority opposing certain one-sided ceasefire resolutions, reflecting concern that those didn\u2019t adequately acknowledge Hamas\u2019s aggression. \n\n**Political leadership** has been a major factor in Austria\u2019s support since 2000. In that year, a center-right government including the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) came to power, causing Israel to briefly recall its ambassador due to the FP\u00d6\u2019s far-right past. Relations were frosty until about 2003, when diplomatic ties normalized again. After 2000, successive governments (both center-right and center-left coalitions) sought to improve ties with Israel as part of Austria\u2019s image rehabilitation. A turning point was the tenure of **Chancellor Sebastian Kurz** (who served as Foreign Minister, then Chancellor in 2017\u20132021). Kurz, a young conservative, made strengthening Israel ties a priority. He visited Israel multiple times, spoke in the Knesset (Israeli parliament) apologizing for Austria\u2019s role in Nazi crimes, and called Israel *\u201ca Jewish state and a liberal democracy to which we Austrians are deeply committed.\u201d* Under Kurz, Austria adopted a very supportive line: for instance, Austria often opposed EU measures seen as biased against Israel, and Kurz took steps like withdrawing Austria from a UN migration pact partly due to concerns it was unfair to Israel (it referenced occupation issues). Even outside of Kurz, Austrian officials across the spectrum have grown more pro-Israel. President **Alexander Van der Bellen** (a Green, largely ceremonial role) visited Israel in 2019 and stressed Austria\u2019s solidarity and historical responsibility. Austria and Israel in 2022 signed a **Strategic Partnership** agreement, aiming to deepen cooperation in innovation, security, and people-to-people exchanges\u301044\u2020L552-L560\u3011\u301044\u2020L554-L560\u3011. This is a formal sign of how close the countries have grown. \n\n**Military and security cooperation** has expanded. Austria\u2019s military traditionally was neutral and did not have extensive ties with Israel, but in recent years cooperation emerged in areas like counter-terrorism training and intelligence sharing (especially concerning jihadist threats in Europe). Austria has purchased Israeli defense tech, including drones and surveillance equipment, to modernize its army. Meanwhile, Israeli special forces have trained in alpine warfare in Austria. On the intelligence front, Israeli and Austrian agencies reportedly collaborate on tracking extremist networks, given Austria\u2019s concerns after terror incidents (e.g., the Vienna attack in 2020). Such cooperation indicates a level of trust and shared security perspective. **Economic relations** are also strong: bilateral trade exceeds $1\u00a0billion, and Austria has significant investments in Israel\u2019s tech sector (Austrian firms tap into Israel\u2019s innovation, especially in med-tech and agritech). Conversely, Israeli companies have invested in Austrian biotech and manufacturing. Tourism is another bond \u2013 before COVID-19, tens of thousands of Israeli tourists visited Austria annually (drawn by skiing and history), and Austria has become a popular destination for Israel\u2019s Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) tourists in summer. Culturally, Vienna and Tel Aviv are sister cities, and academic exchanges flourish (with Holocaust education as a particular focus). \n\nA unique driver of Austria\u2019s support is the **intersection of historical responsibility and national identity**. Unlike Germany, which from the 1950s openly atoned and supported Israel, Austria for decades portrayed itself as the \u201cfirst victim\u201d of Nazism and was slower to accept blame. This led to cooler relations mid-century (exacerbated by incidents like the election of Kurt Waldheim, an ex-officer accused of war crimes, as president in 1986, which angered Israel). However, in the 1990s and 2000s, Austria\u2019s narrative shifted: leaders like Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and President Thomas Klestil acknowledged Austrian complicity in Nazi crimes and initiated reparations and Jewish community support. This opened the door to a rapprochement with Israel on a new footing. Since then, Austria has made **combating antisemitism** a pillar of its policy. Supporting Israel is seen as an extension of that \u2013 ensuring Jewish life thrives and Israel\u2019s security is safeguarded. For example, Austria routinely votes in favor of Israel on UN Holocaust remembrance and anti-Nazi resolutions. In May 2023, when anti-Israel bias was alleged in some UN fora, Austria was among countries defending Israel\u2019s stance. \n\n**Domestic political factors** have also played a role: Austria\u2019s mainstream parties (both the conservative \u00d6VP and the center-left SP\u00d6) now endorse strong ties with Israel. The far-right FP\u00d6, once ostracized, in recent years has paradoxically tried to brand itself as pro-Israel \u2013 partly to shed its antisemitic image and focus on anti-Islam politics. (Israel still views the FP\u00d6 warily, but some in Israel\u2019s government have engaged with FP\u00d6 leaders in the 2010s as the FP\u00d6 proclaimed support for Israel\u2019s fight against \u201cIslamist terrorism.\u201d) This means across the spectrum, there is a competition in Austria to appear pro-Israel \u2013 a significant change from the 1970s when Chancellor Bruno Kreisky (himself Jewish but very critical of Israel\u2019s policies) led a more neutral-to-pro-Arab policy. Today, a politician in Austria would find more domestic cost in appearing unfriendly to Israel than in supporting it. The Austrian public generally holds positive views of Israel, especially when framed in terms of shared democratic values and the memory of the Shoah. The Austrian Jewish community (about 8,000 people) is influential beyond its size and has actively encouraged closer Austria-Israel ties; its voice is heeded in government circles mindful of Austria\u2019s Nazi-era legacy. \n\n**Notable diplomatic moments** include high-level visits both ways: Israeli presidents and prime ministers now visit Vienna periodically, and Austrian chancellors and presidents visit Jerusalem. In 2018, Austria\u2019s Kurz took the bold step of addressing the World Jewish Congress in New York, declaring that \u201cAustria was not only a victim but also a perpetrator\u201d during WWII, and that as chancellor he feels duty-bound to ensure Israel\u2019s security \u2013 statements warmly received in Israel\u301023\u2020L223-L231\u3011. Another moment was during the 2006 Israel\u2013Hezbollah war, when Austria, contributing troops to UNIFIL, still defended Israel\u2019s right to respond to attacks \u2013 a stance more supportive than some EU peers. In 2020, Austria opposed EU foreign ministers\u2019 push to formally condemn Israel\u2019s West Bank annexation plans, favoring dialogue instead. And in the 2021 Gaza conflict, beyond the flag incident, Austria was among the countries blocking a unanimous EU call for a ceasefire that didn\u2019t also condemn Hamas. These instances show Austria using its voice within Europe to moderate anti-Israel initiatives. Additionally, Austria was one of only a few EU states to abstain on upgrading Palestinian status in certain UN agencies, aligning quietly with Israel\u2019s view that unilateral moves are unhelpful.\n\nA key development was **Austria and Israel signing a Strategic Partnership in 2022**\u301044\u2020L552-L560\u3011\u301044\u2020L554-L560\u3011. This formalized cooperation in diverse fields (from cybersecurity to sustainability) and committed high-level consultations annually. It signaled that Austria sees Israel not just as a historical responsibility but as a contemporary strategic ally. The partnership also acknowledged mutual values as liberal democracies. \n\n**Turning points or deviations**: The primary \u201cdeviation\u201d in this timeline was the year 2000 diplomatic spat when Israel recalled its ambassador to protest the inclusion of FP\u00d6 (J\u00f6rg Haider\u2019s far-right party) in government. But even then, trade and low-level ties continued. By 2003, Israel sent back its ambassador after assurances regarding Holocaust remembrance. Since then, there haven\u2019t been major downturns. One challenge emerged in 2018\u20132019: because the FP\u00d6 was back in government as a junior partner to Kurz, Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry initially maintained a boycott on meeting FP\u00d6 ministers (given FP\u00d6\u2019s past). This meant some awkwardness, as Israel engaged only with \u00d6VP ministers. However, this didn\u2019t significantly harm bilateral cooperation; behind the scenes, Israeli officials still coordinated on security with FP\u00d6-run ministries (like Interior). When Kurz\u2019s coalition with FP\u00d6 collapsed in 2019 over a scandal, that issue resolved itself. In fact, Israeli officials praised Kurz for how he handled the far-right \u2013 keeping them in check and still pushing pro-Israel policies. So while the presence of a far-right element in Austria is a wrinkle, it hasn\u2019t derailed the overall supportive trend. \n\nIn conclusion, **Austria\u2019s strong support for Israel since 2000** is the product of a **\u201ccomplete transformation over the past 40 years\u201d**\u301021\u2020L9-L17\u3011 in its foreign policy \u2013 from wary distance to close alliance. It is driven by a moral reckoning with the Holocaust, a desire to protect Israel as part of \u201cNever Again,\u201d and pragmatic interests in counterterrorism and tech cooperation. It has been facilitated by leaders like Kurz who are \u201cfirmly pro-Israel\u201d\u301023\u2020L221-L229\u3011 and by an Austrian public and political class that increasingly see Israel as an ally. The relationship, once fraught, is now characterized by warmth and candor. Austria stands out in the EU for gestures like flying the Israeli flag in solidarity\u301023\u2020L223-L231\u3011 and for speaking of Israel\u2019s security as part of its own raison d\u2019\u00e9tat. While Austria still balances its EU commitments and supports a two-state solution, it insists on Israel\u2019s concerns being addressed (e.g. disarming Hamas, halting antisemitic incitement) in any peace efforts. Through strategic partnerships, UN votes, and public symbolism, Austria has demonstrated a **strong and growing commitment to Israel** in the 21st century \u2013 a friendship buttressed by both *values and interests*, and shaped profoundly by the lessons of history. \n\n**Sources:** The analysis above incorporates information from official statements, reputable news agencies, and historical records, including Reuters reports on key UN votes and embassy moves\u30101\u2020L183-L192\u3011\u301028\u2020L186-L194\u3011\u301023\u2020L223-L231\u3011, Washington Post and Guardian analyses of countries\u2019 UN voting patterns\u30105\u2020L95-L103\u3011\u301010\u2020L189-L197\u3011, the Austrian Foreign Ministry\u2019s description of its Israel partnership\u301044\u2020L552-L560\u3011, and numerous other sources as cited in text.

The U.S., supporting Israel, deployed aircraft and defense systems, successfully aiding in intercepting the majority of the threats.

If you want the decisive logic in 2025, I\u2019d frame it as five tightly-interlocking pillars\u2014with (i) intelligence and (ii) geostrategy at the top\u2014and then show the institutional machinery that makes them durable:\n\n## 1) Intelligence value (not just \u201cMossad mystique,\u201d but day-to-day, high-utility product)\n- Israel is a prolific collector on Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and assorted militias, plus tech/IP, cyber, and UAV/UAS signatures. Washington has repeatedly leaned on Israeli product\u2014sometimes unique HUMINT or technical hauls (e.g., the 2018 Tehran nuclear archive operation that the U.S. immediately integrated into Iran workstreams). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search12\ue201  \n- Netanyahu just told the UN that Israeli intelligence output is like the work of \u201cfive CIAs.\u201d Treat that as rhetoric\u2014but it tracks the broader U.S. message that Israeli intel is operationally valuable and often actionable. (The \u201cfive CIAs\u201d line was reported in coverage of the 26 Sep 2025 UNGA speech.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn2view0\ue201  \n- Intelligence cooperation is two-way: the U.S. fuses Israeli feeds into a CENTCOM-wide picture and backstops Israel with strategic warning and space/sigint. The April 13\u201314, 2024 Iranian mass strike is a good, very recent proof-point: U.S./UK/France/Jordan helped intercept swarms of drones and missiles; CENTCOM says U.S. assets alone destroyed >80 drones and multiple ballistic missiles. That required deep ISR/data-sharing plumbing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news57\ue202turn0news58\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** Intelligence is not the *only* reason, but it\u2019s one of the few that regularly saves American and allied lives in the theater. That keeps the alliance \u201csticky.\u201d\n\n## 2) Geostrategic anchor (Kissinger-style logic, Friedman-style maps)\n- Since the Cold War, U.S. grand strategy in the Middle East has hinged on preventing a hostile hegemon, securing energy chokepoints and air/sea lines, and maintaining deterrence credibility. Israel functions as a capable, relatively self-reliant anchor that aligns with U.S. aims against Iran and its network, complements Egypt/Jordan/Gulf ties, and raises the cost of regional revisionism. (The archival FRUS transcripts capture how Kissinger thought about using Israel within a larger regional settlement framework; the anchor logic endures even as the players change.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- The coalition defense of Israel against Iran\u2019s direct strike in April 2024\u2014coordinated from the U.S. CAOC in Qatar\u2014illustrates how Israel slots into a broader, U.S.-led security architecture that now informally includes Jordan, Saudi/UAE sensors/intel, and European expeditionary air/naval units. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** Israel is not a U.S. base farm, but it\u2019s a reliable, high-end military node that helps lock in a favorable balance of power.\n\n## 3) Defense-industrial interlock (money, factories, and co-production)\n- The 10-year $38 bn MOU (2019\u20132028) institutionalizes annual FMF and missile-defense co-development (Iron Dome, David\u2019s Sling, Arrow). That\u2019s not just grants: it\u2019s structured R&D, testing and production inside the U.S. defense base. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search10\ue201  \n- Co-production has moved stateside (Raytheon\u2013Rafael), with new Tamir/SkyHunter lines in Arkansas feeding both Israeli demand and U.S. programs. That creates American jobs, congressional stakeholders, and surge capacity\u2014another reason the relationship is enduring regardless of who\u2019s in the White House. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news30\ue202turn4search3\ue201\n\n## 4) Logistics and prepositioned U.S. stockpiles (quiet but crucial)\n- The **War Reserve Stockpile for Allies\u2013Israel (WRSA-I)** is a U.S.-owned munitions stockpile in Israel. It\u2019s meant for U.S. use in wartime, but\u2014with U.S. approval\u2014can be drawn down to support Israel. The legal scaffolding (22 U.S.C. \u00a72321h) and recent DoD IG activity around controls show how institutionalized this is. It\u2019s also a U.S. theater advantage if conflict widens. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search5\ue201\n\n## 5) Domestic coalitions and values (why it survives political cycles)\n- The alliance is reinforced by U.S. public sympathy for Israel, a long record of congressional majorities, and organized constituencies (Jewish American and evangelical Christian networks). That creates a **floor** beneath policy, even when the executive branch\u2019s tone changes, or specific weapon shipments get paused or conditioned. CRS\u2019s long-series shows the sheer scale and persistence of U.S. aid. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Where your framing is exactly right\u2014and where to tighten it\n\n**Right:**  \n- **Intel** is not window dressing; it\u2019s daily utility. When U.S. carriers and air wings need \u201cISR plumbing\u201d against Iran\u2019s missile/drone ecosystem, Israeli signatures, tactics, and exploitation of capture/kill ops are high-value inputs. The 2018 nuclear-archive heist is the canonical example of unique value; the 2024 joint defensive operation shows the real-time layer. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search12\ue202turn0news57\ue201  \n- **Geostrategic anchor:** Israel is one of a handful of reliable \u201cA-tier\u201d military partners who can fight tonight without U.S. babysitting. It\u2019s part of the American theory of victory in the region: distributed partners + U.S. command, control and replenishment.\n\n**Nuance / caveats:**  \n- The **anchor** is part of a *system* that also includes Egypt (Suez/peace), Jordan (airspace/liaison), and Gulf enablers (sensors, access, energy). Washington calibrates support to keep that system intact; that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see tactical pauses on specific munitions, or diplomatic hedging at the UN, even while the alliance itself remains solid. The April 2024 coalition intercepts were a vivid demo of system-of-systems, not Israel alone. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0news56\ue201  \n- **Intelligence** is indispensable but not unproblematic. The U.S. sometimes gets surprised by unilateral Israeli actions, or must firewall sensitive sources/methods. Conversely, Israel depends on U.S. space/sigint and global fusion. It\u2019s a mutual dependency\u2014not a one-way \u201cIsrael feeds, U.S. consumes\u201d relationship.\n\n---\n\n## Forward-looking risks to watch (without overstating them)\n- **Munition supply & governance:** WRSA-I and U.S. industrial lines mitigate risk, but political fights over conditionality can slow specific resupplies. The institutional frameworks (MOU, WRSA-I, co-production) are designed to ride out these squalls. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn4search5\ue201  \n- **European divergence vs. U.S. core:** Several European states have moved toward recognizing Palestine or placing tighter export controls; that doesn\u2019t alter the U.S.\u2013Israel core, but it complicates coalition diplomacy the U.S. tries to marshal around Iran and maritime security. (You saw the flip side in April 2024, when UK/France flew to Israel\u2019s defense anyway.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news56\ue201  \n- **Regional balancing:** As Saudi-Israel normalization re-enters play post-war, Washington will keep pressing for a political track with Palestinians to preserve the broader architecture. That\u2019s pressure *within* an alliance, not a substitute for it.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\nYour two pillars are the right ones: **(1) intelligence** and **(2) Israel as a U.S. **geostrategic anchor**. What makes them decisive is the **plumbing** built underneath\u2014$38 bn of codified aid and co-R&D; **co-production** of interceptors in U.S. plants; **U.S. prepositioned stockpiles** in Israel; and an **embedded domestic coalition** that keeps a floor under policy even as tactics ebb and flow. The April 2024 joint defense against Iran was the alliance\u2014in real time\u2014doing exactly what it was built to do. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn4news30\ue202turn4search2\ue202turn0news57\ue201\n\nIf you want, I can map these to a one-page \u201cevidence ledger\u201d (pillar \u00d7 mechanisms \u00d7 canonical citations)\u2014handy for briefing or publication."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3search12\ue201","start_idx":683,"end_idx":703,"safe_urls":["https://www.timesofisrael.com/we-expect-regime-will-come-to-its-senses-full-text-of-pompeo-on-iran-strategy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/we-expect-regime-will-come-to-its-senses-full-text-of-pompeo-on-iran-strategy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"'We expect regime will come to its senses': Full text of ...","url":"https://www.timesofisrael.com/we-expect-regime-will-come-to-its-senses-full-text-of-pompeo-on-iran-strategy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"May 21, 2018 \u2014 ...
