Relating the two matrices via a change of basis\n\nLet \\(P\\) be the \\(\\,n \\times n\\) matrix whose columns are precisely the coordinates of the vectors \\(v_1, \\dots, v_n\\) of the basis \\(C\\) **with respect to the standard basis**.  Concretely,\n\n\\[\nP \\;=\\; \\bigl[\\,v_1\\mid v_2\\mid \\cdots\\mid v_n \\bigr]\n\\]\nwhere each \\(v_j\\) is written in standard coordinates (so \\(P\\) is invertible).\n\n1. If \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) has coordinates \\([x]_C\\) in the basis \\(C\\), then in standard coordinates (basis \\(E\\)) we have:\n   \\[\n     x \\;=\\; P \\,[x]_C.\n   \\]\n2. Applying \\(T\\) and then expressing \\(T(x)\\) in the same basis \\(C\\), we have:\n   \\[\n     [T(x)]_C \n     \\;=\\;\n     [\\,P^{-1} \\,T\\,P\\,] \\,[x]_C.\n   \\]\n   By definition, the matrix of \\(T\\) in basis \\(C\\) is exactly the linear map \\([x]_C \\mapsto [T(x)]_C\\).

Is \\(P\\) (and thus \\(C\\)) determined uniquely?\n\nSuppose you found **one** invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(M_c = P^{-1} M_e \\,P\\).  Could there be a **different** invertible matrix \\(Q\\) that also satisfies\n\\[\n  M_{c} \\;=\\; Q^{-1}\\,M_{e}\\,Q \\, ?\n\\]\nIf so, that would mean that the columns of \\(Q\\)\u2014which would represent a different basis\u2014give the **same** pair \\((M_e, M_c)\\). Let us see what forces \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) to be related.\n\nFrom\n\\[\n  M_c\n  \\;=\\;\n  Q^{-1} M_e\\, Q\n  \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n  M_c\n  \\;=\\;\n  P^{-1} M_e\\, P,\n\\]\nwe have\n\\[\n  P^{-1} M_e\\, P\n  \\;=\\;\n  Q^{-1} M_e\\, Q.\n\\]\nRearranging gives\n\\[\n  Q^{-1} \\,P^{-1} \\,M_e\\,P\\,Q\n  \\;=\\;\n  M_e.\n\\]\nOr equivalently (multiplying by \\(Q\\) on the left and \\(P\\) on the right),\n\\[\n  (P\\,Q)^{-1} \\, M_e \\,(P\\,Q)\n  \\;=\\;\n  M_e.\n\\]\nLet us define \\(Z = P^{-1}Q\\).  Then\n\\[\n   M_c\n   \\;=\\;\n   Q^{-1}M_e\\,Q\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\bigl(PZ\\bigr)^{-1} M_e \\,\\bigl(PZ\\bigr)\n   \\;=\\;\n   Z^{-1} \\bigl(P^{-1}M_e\\,P\\bigr)\\,Z\n   \\;=\\;\n   Z^{-1}\\,M_c\\,Z.\n\\]\nSo \\(Z\\) must commute with \\(M_c\\).  In symbols:\n\\[\n  Z\\,M_c \\;=\\; M_c\\,Z\n  \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\n  Z \\,\\in\\,\\mathrm{Comm}(M_c),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{Comm}(M_c)\\) denotes the *centralizer* of \\(M_c\\) (the set of all matrices commuting with \\(M_c\\)).\n\nThus,\n\\[\n   Q \n   \\;=\\;\n   P\\,Z,\n   \\quad\n   \\text{where } Z\\text{ commutes with }M_c \\text{ and is invertible}.\n\\]\n\n### In other words\n\n- **If** \\(P\\) is a valid change-of-basis matrix (so that \\(M_c = P^{-1}M_e\\,P\\)),\n- **Then** *any* other valid change-of-basis matrix \\(Q\\) must be of the form\n  \\[\n    Q \\;=\\; P \\,Z,\n    \\quad\n    \\text{for some invertible }Z\\text{ with }Z\\,M_c = M_c\\,Z.\n  \\]\n\nHence the columns of \\(Q\\) (which would be another candidate for the basis \\(C\\)) differ from the columns of \\(P\\) by exactly that factor \\(Z\\). \n\nBecause \\(Z\\) commutes with \\(M_c\\), the effect on the *action* of \\(T\\) in that new basis does not change \\(M_c\\).  This means the same matrix \\(M_c\\) could have come from many different ordered bases \\(C\\), exactly those whose coordinate matrix is of the form \\(P\\,Z\\) with \\(Z \\in \\mathrm{Comm}(M_c)\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Geometric implications\n\n1. **You cannot in general recover \\(C\\) *uniquely* from \\((M_e, M_c)\\).**  \n   Indeed, there can be infinitely many choices of invertible matrices \\(Z\\) that commute with \\(M_c\\), especially if \\(T\\) has eigenvalue multiplicities or is non-diagonalizable, etc.\n\n2. **You *can* recover \\(C\\) up to an invertible matrix that centralizes \\(M_c\\).**  \n   Concretely, once you find *one* valid \\(P\\) satisfying \\(M_c = P^{-1}M_e\\,P\\), *any* other valid change of basis is \\(P\\,Z\\) where \\(Z\\) commutes with \\(M_c\\).\n\n3. **When there is more structure, there can be fewer symmetries.**  \n   - If \\(T\\) (and hence \\(M_c\\)) is diagonalizable with *distinct* eigenvalues, then the centralizer of \\(M_c\\) is \u201csmall\u201d (it is typically just diagonal block scalars on each distinct eigenvalue block), so you might be able to pin down the basis vectors up to fairly simple scalings or permutations.  \n   - If \\(T\\) has large Jordan blocks or multiple eigenvalue multiplicities, the centralizer is bigger, so more freedom remains.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary of the answer\n\n- **Short answer**: No, in general you cannot uniquely recover the original ordered basis \\(C\\) from the pair \\(\\bigl(M_e, M_c\\bigr)\\).  There is an entire family of bases that yield the same matrix \\(M_c\\), namely all bases corresponding to \\(\\;P\\,Z\\;\\) with \\(Z\\) commuting with \\(M_c\\). \n- **What *is* determined**: Up to that \u201ccentralizer freedom,\u201d the basis \\(C\\) *is* determined.  In more algebraic terms:\n  \\[\n     \\text{All possible change-of-basis matrices }Q \\text{ satisfy } \n     Q = P\\,Z, \n     \\text{ for some }Z\\text{ with }Z\\,M_c = M_c\\,Z.\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, unless further constraints or normalizing conditions are imposed on \\(C\\) (for example, specifying eigenvector normalizations, or imposing orthonormality, or restricting to certain Jordan forms), you cannot pin down the vectors \\(\\{v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\}\\) uniquely. You only know them up to exactly those transformations that commute with \\(M_c\\)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"744b5e82-16c2-45df-9d4c-e868c98c8576","request_id":"90f940ad4e3cfdc5-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"744b5e82-16c2-45df-9d4c-e868c98c8576","children":["d6324ae5-2e4e-4c11-b295-341b243aecc1"]},"d6324ae5-2e4e-4c11-b295-341b243aecc1":{"id":"d6324ae5-2e4e-4c11-b295-341b243aecc1","message":{"id":"d6324ae5-2e4e-4c11-b295-341b243aecc1","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739162043.559569,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what if T is both invertible and diagonializable?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"90f962712bff401c-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d4adbbee-4971-4e99-a60c-619251d6e199","children":["6d1dfb45-0120-4fbc-957b-e107334553a4"]},"6d1dfb45-0120-4fbc-957b-e107334553a4":{"id":"6d1dfb45-0120-4fbc-957b-e107334553a4","message":{"id":"6d1dfb45-0120-4fbc-957b-e107334553a4","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1739162150.818402,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Linking invertibility with diagonalization**\n\nI\u2019m examining a matrix T.

(Invertible means \\(0\\) is not an eigenvalue, but we will see that the crucial part is the diagonalizability and the eigenvalue structure.)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Diagonalizability, change of basis, and commuting matrices\n\nIf \\(T\\) is diagonalizable, then there exists some basis \\(B\\) in which the matrix of \\(T\\) is diagonal.  In that basis, the centralizer of the diagonal matrix plays a key role in understanding how many different bases can yield the *same* matrix representation \\(M_c\\).  \n\n- Concretely, if in basis \\(C\\), the matrix of \\(T\\) is\n  \\[\n    M_c \\;=\\; D_1 \\oplus D_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus D_k,\n  \\]\n  where each \\(D_i\\) is a diagonal block corresponding to an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_i\\).  \n\n- Because \\(T\\) is diagonalizable, each eigenspace is a nonzero subspace on which \\(T\\) acts simply by \\(\\lambda_i I\\).  \n\n- The **centralizer** \\(\\mathrm{Comm}(M_c)\\) (the set of all invertible matrices \\(Z\\) that commute with \\(M_c\\)) will be exactly block diagonal in a conforming way (one block for each eigenvalue).  If an eigenvalue is repeated \\(m\\) times, the corresponding block of \\(M_c\\) is \\(\\lambda I_m\\), and *any* \\(m\\times m\\) invertible matrix commutes with \\(\\lambda I_m\\).  \n\nFormally, if \\(\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_k\\) are the *distinct* eigenvalues of \\(T\\), and the multiplicity of \\(\\lambda_i\\) as a root of the characteristic polynomial is \\(m_i\\), then in a suitably chosen diagonal form we can write\n\\[\n  M_c \n  \\;=\\;\n  \\mathrm{diag}(\\underbrace{\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_1}_{m_1},\\;\n                 \\underbrace{\\lambda_2,\\dots,\\lambda_2}_{m_2},\\;\n                 \\dots,\\;\n                 \\underbrace{\\lambda_k,\\dots,\\lambda_k}_{m_k}\n                ).\n\\]\nAny matrix \\(Z\\) that commutes with \\(M_c\\) must preserve each eigenspace.  Hence \\(Z\\) is block diagonal:\n\\[\n  Z \n  \\;=\\; \n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n    Z_1 & 0   & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    0   & Z_2 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0   & 0   & \\cdots & Z_k\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwith each \\(Z_i\\in \\mathrm{GL}(m_i,\\mathbb{R})\\).  (If \\(\\lambda_i \\neq \\lambda_j\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\), those off-diagonal blocks must be zero to commute with \\(M_c\\).)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Consequence for recovering the basis \\(C\\)\n\nAs in the more general argument (without assuming diagonalizability), once you know one valid change-of-basis matrix \\(P\\) giving\n\\[\n  M_c \\;=\\; P^{-1}\\,M_e\\,P,\n\\]\n*any other* valid matrix \\(Q\\) that satisfies \\(M_c = Q^{-1}M_e\\,Q\\) must be\n\\[\n  Q \\;=\\; P\\,Z,\n  \\quad\n  \\text{where } Z \\in \\mathrm{Comm}(M_c)\\text{ and is invertible.}\n\\]\n\nThus, you can only recover the columns of \\(C\\) up to multiplication on the right by some \\(Z\\) that *commutes* with \\(M_c\\).  The diagonalizability of \\(T\\) tells you precisely that \\(\\mathrm{Comm}(M_c)\\) is block diagonal (where each block corresponds to one eigenspace).\n\n### Case A: All eigenvalues *distinct*\n\nIf \\(T\\) is diagonalizable *and* all its eigenvalues are distinct, then each eigenspace is 1-dimensional.  That implies:\n\n1. Each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_i\\) has multiplicity \\(1\\).\n2. In the diagonal form, each \\(\\lambda_i\\) is just a single entry on the diagonal.\n3. A matrix commuting with such a diagonal matrix is *also* diagonal.  \n\nHence \\(Z\\) (the matrix that commutes with \\(M_c\\)) must be diagonal.  That means you can only scale each eigenvector individually by some nonzero scalar.  \n\nTherefore, in the basis that diagonalizes \\(T\\) (and has distinct eigenvalues on the diagonal):\n\n- The vectors are *almost* determined; you can only multiply each eigenvector by a nonzero scalar.  \n- There is *no* freedom to permute them if the eigenvalues are genuinely distinct, because a nontrivial permutation would not commute with a diagonal of distinct entries.\n\nIn that sense, you recover the basis up to nonzero *scalar* multiples of each basis vector.  \n\n### Case B: Repeated eigenvalues\n\nIf some eigenvalues are repeated with (say) multiplicity \\(m_i\\), then each eigenspace is at least \\(m_i\\)-dimensional, and the block \\(\\lambda_i I_{m_i}\\) commutes with *all* invertible \\(m_i\\times m_i\\) matrices.  This means you can \u201cmix\u201d any linearly independent combination of vectors within that eigenspace, and it will still commute with \\(\\lambda_i I_{m_i}\\).  \n\nHence the freedom is larger:\n\n- You cannot single out a *unique* basis of each eigenspace from just the matrix alone.  \n- You only know each eigenspace as a subspace.  \n- Within each repeated-eigenvalue block, you have \\(\\mathrm{GL}(m_i,\\mathbb{R})\\) worth of freedom for how you pick the basis of that eigenspace.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Does invertibility of \\(T\\) help?\n\nBecause \\(T\\) is invertible, *none* of its eigenvalues is zero.  However, this fact alone does not significantly restrict the possible centralizer transformations if an eigenvalue is repeated.  Being invertible simply rules out the possibility of a 0 eigenvalue (which might or might not reduce the dimension of eigenspaces overall).  You still end up with the same \u201cblock diagonal\u201d structure for the centralizer, the blocks being as large as each eigenspace dimension.  \n\nThus:\n\n- **Invertibility** means no zero eigenvalue but does *not* by itself guarantee distinct eigenvalues.  \n- **Diagonalizable** means each Jordan block is 1-by-1 for each eigenvalue, but if that eigenvalue repeats, the eigenspace has dimension > 1.  \n\nHence if any eigenvalue is repeated, you still get a large centralizer (essentially \\(\\mathrm{GL}\\) of each repeated-eigenvalue block).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final summary\n\n1. **If \\(T\\) is diagonalizable with *all distinct* eigenvalues**  \n   Then \\(\\mathrm{Comm}(M_c)\\) is the set of diagonal (nonzero) scalings in that eigenbasis.  In this scenario, you can recover the basis vectors in \\(C\\) *up to* multiplying each eigenvector by a nonzero scalar.  You cannot fix those scalars from just the pair \\((M_e, M_c)\\).\n\n2. **If \\(T\\) is diagonalizable but some eigenvalues are repeated**  \n   Then on each repeated-eigenvalue subspace, *any* invertible linear transformation is allowed.  Thus you only know each eigenspace as a whole, not any particular basis of it.\n\n3. **Invertibility** (no zero eigenvalues) only ensures none of the diagonal entries is zero\u2014*it does not* remove the freedom that arises from repeated eigenvalues.  \n\nIn short, *even if \\(T\\) is invertible and diagonalizable*, you typically *cannot* recover the ordered basis \\(C\\) uniquely from \\(\\bigl(M_e, M_c\\bigr)\\).  You can recover it:\n\n- **Up to** multiplying each distinct-eigenvalue vector by a nonzero scalar (when all eigenvalues are distinct).  \n- **Up to** an invertible transformation on each repeated-eigenvalue eigenspace (when some eigenvalues have multiplicity)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1-pro","default_model_slug":"o1-pro","parent_id":"6d1dfb45-0120-4fbc-957b-e107334553a4","request_id":"90f962712bff401c-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6d1dfb45-0120-4fbc-957b-e107334553a4","children":[]}}}
