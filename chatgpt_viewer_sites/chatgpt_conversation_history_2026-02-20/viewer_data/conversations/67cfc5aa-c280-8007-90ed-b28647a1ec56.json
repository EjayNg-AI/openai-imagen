The term was coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy (former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder) in February 2025\u30105\u2020L221-L224\u3011. Instead of writing and controlling every line of code, a programmer using vibe coding simply describes what they want in natural language (often just a few sentences), and a large language model (LLM) generates the actual code\u30105\u2020L217-L224\u3011. Karpathy described this process as *\u201cnot really coding \u2013 I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works.\u201d*\u301011\u2020L169-L173\u3011 In essence, vibe coding shifts the focus from meticulous syntax and manual debugging to high-level guidance, allowing the AI to fill in the implementation details.\n\n**Principles of Vibe Coding:** The core principle is to **embrace the AI\u2019s output without sweating the small stuff**. Karpathy suggests developers should *\u201cforget that the code even exists\u201d* and trust the AI\u2019s *\u201cexponential\u201d* abilities\u30102\u2020L298-L306\u3011\u301011\u2020L138-L144\u3011. In practice, this means accepting code suggestions and fixes from the AI with minimal intervention. For example, Karpathy would ask the AI to adjust UI padding or add a feature, approve its changes without scrutinizing the code, and if an error occurs, simply feed the error message back to the AI for a fix\u301011\u2020L160-L168\u3011. This **hands-off, iterative flow** contrasts with traditional coding where a developer writes code line-by-line and debugs issues by manually inspecting and understanding the code. In vibe coding, the **programming \u201clanguage\u201d is essentially English** \u2013 you tell the computer what you need in plain language and it writes the code for you\u30102\u2020L310-L313\u3011. The hottest new programming language, as Karpathy quipped, **\u201cis English.\u201d**\u30102\u2020L310-L313\u3011\n\n**How It Differs from Traditional Coding:** Vibe coding upends the conventional wisdom that software development requires full control and deep understanding of the codebase. In a traditional workflow, developers carefully design algorithms, write code, and thoroughly review it to ensure they understand every part. With vibe coding, **developers operate at a higher level of abstraction**, often treating the code as a black box solution generated by the AI. AI researcher Simon Willison draws a clear line: if an LLM wrote every line of your code *but you\u2019ve reviewed, tested, and understood it all, that\u2019s not vibe coding... that\u2019s using an LLM as a typing assistant*\u30105\u2020L246-L250\u3011. In true vibe coding, the user does **not** fully grasp or manually verify each line of code \u2013 they trust the AI to make it work. This represents a mindset shift from **precision and control to speed and \u201cflow.\u201d** Vibe coding is more about rapidly experimenting and building by conversation with the AI, whereas traditional coding is about carefully crafting and reasoning through code. As one report put it, *vibe coding defies the idea that developing software demands virtuoso engineering skill* \u2013 instead, you \u201csurrender\u201d to the AI and let it drive\u30102\u2020L298-L307\u3011.\n\n## Technology and Tools  \nVibe coding has been enabled by advances in AI, particularly large language models and AI-powered developer tools. A variety of **tools and frameworks** support the vibe coding style, often integrating natural language interfaces and code generation. Common technologies include:\n\n- **AI Coding Assistants and IDEs**: Dedicated development environments like **Replit\u2019s AI Agent**, **Cursor Composer**, **Bolt**, **Lovable**, and others are built around LLMs generating code from prompts\u301028\u2020L133-L141\u3011. These tools let a user describe an app or feature, then automatically choose libraries, write code, and even suggest modifications. For instance, Replit\u2019s AI can handle the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d of coding, allowing rapid prototyping of software from just a description\u30102\u2020L288-L292\u3011. Similarly, Cursor (an AI-enhanced code editor) uses a powerful model (nicknamed \u201cSonnet\u201d) to translate high-level instructions into code, so developers can iterate by simply telling the editor what they want\u301011\u2020L148-L155\u3011. Many of these platforms offer a chat-like interface within the IDE where the user types requests in English and the AI writes or edits the code accordingly.\n\n- **Voice Recognition Interfaces**: Some vibe coding practitioners use voice to code hands-free. **SuperWhisper** is one such tool, an advanced speech-to-text system (based on OpenAI\u2019s Whisper) that lets developers *speak* their coding instructions instead of typing\u301021\u2020L22-L28\u3011. Andrej Karpathy demonstrated using SuperWhisper on a Mac together with Cursor\u2019s AI \u201cComposer\u201d \u2013 effectively talking to the computer to build software\u301021\u2020L22-L28\u3011. He could say something like *\u201cdecrease the padding on the sidebar by half\u201d* and the AI would understand and apply that change in code\u301021\u2020L22-L28\u3011. This approach turns programming into a conversational experience. For those not on Mac, open-source equivalents like **VibeVoice** have emerged, enabling voice-to-text coding on any system by running Whisper locally\u301021\u2020L37-L45\u3011\u301021\u2020L46-L54\u3011. These voice tools capture the spirit of vibe coding: making the interaction with code as natural and frictionless as talking through an idea.\n\n- **Automated Debugging and Code Repair**: Vibe coding workflows often include feeding errors back to the AI to fix issues. Tools like **Cursor** and **Replit** support this by allowing users to paste an error message into the chat; the LLM will analyze the error and adjust the code. Some specialized frameworks (e.g. **Pythagora** or **GPT Pilot** for VSCode) focus on iterative development: they generate code, run tests, and refine the output in loops\u301015\u2020L31-L39\u3011\u301015\u2020L35-L43\u3011. The goal is that even debugging \u2013 a task traditionally requiring careful reasoning \u2013 can be handled by the AI to a large extent. For example, Karpathy notes that when a bug arises, he\u2019ll just drop the error message into the AI and let it figure out a fix, rather than manually tracing the problem\u301011\u2020L165-L173\u3011. This tight human-AI collaboration is facilitated by the environment: an always-available AI \u201cpair programmer\u201d that not only writes code but also responds to runtime errors and feedback.\n\n- **Underlying AI Models**: Most vibe coding tools leverage powerful LLMs from OpenAI (like GPT-4) or Anthropic (like Claude), often fine-tuned for coding tasks\u30105\u2020L254-L258\u3011. In some cases, custom models (for instance, the **o3-mini** model mentioned in demos, or a model called \u201cSonnet 3.5\u201d used by Cursor) are deployed to optimize coding performance\u301022\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301022\u2020L23-L29\u3011. Additionally, **Whisper** (for speech) and its optimized versions (SuperWhisper, FasterWhisper) provide the robust voice transcription needed for voice coding\u301021\u2020L44-L53\u3011. The synergy of these technologies \u2013 understanding natural language inputs and producing structured code \u2013 is what makes vibe coding feasible. As AI models continue to improve in code generation ability, the tools built on them become even more capable \u201cco-developers,\u201d further blurring the line between a programmer\u2019s intent and the actual code execution.\n\n## Applications by Amateur Coders  \nOne of the most revolutionary aspects of vibe coding is how it **empowers amateurs and non-programmers** to create software. By offloading the technical details to AI, individuals with little to no coding experience can tackle projects that were once out of reach. Karpathy and others have observed that vibe coding *\u201callows even nontechnical hobbyists to build fully functioning apps and websites, just by typing prompts into a text box.\u201d*\u301028\u2020L102-L110\u3011 In other words, **just having an idea and some patience is enough** \u2013 you describe what you want, and the AI writes the code. This dramatically **lowers the barrier to entry** for software development\u30102\u2020L288-L292\u3011.\n\nAmateur coders are leveraging vibe coding to build a variety of personal and practical projects. Tech columnist Kevin Roose \u2013 who admits *\u201cI can\u2019t write a single line of code\u201d* \u2013 managed to create custom software tools entirely through AI assistance\u301026\u2020L86-L95\u3011\u301028\u2020L102-L110\u3011. Using these methods, he built: a podcast transcription & summarization tool, a utility to organize social media bookmarks into a database, a furniture-fitting dimension calculator website, and an app called \u201cLunchBox Buddy\u201d that analyzes his fridge contents to suggest school lunches\u301026\u2020L91-L99\u3011. All of these were essentially one-man projects accomplished by an \u201camateur\u201d coder with help from AI. Roose calls these creations \u201c**software for one**\u201d \u2013 niche apps that solve specific problems in his life which previously *\u201caren\u2019t the kinds of tools a big tech company would build.\u201d*\u301028\u2020L111-L119\u3011 The key point is that with vibe coding, an individual tinkerer can produce software that **formerly might have required a full engineering team** to develop\u30108\u2020L275-L282\u3011. This has opened the door for hobbyists, designers, or domain experts (with no formal coding background) to bring their software ideas to life.\n\nEarly **applications** of vibe coding by amateurs tend to be in the realm of **prototyping, personal productivity tools, and simple web apps**. These users often start with a creative idea or a problem they face, and use an AI coding assistant to iteratively build a solution. For example, an educator might design a quiz game app by describing the rules and letting the AI generate the game logic, or a small business owner might \u201cvibe code\u201d a basic website for their shop without hiring a developer. Many such projects are shared in online communities, showing how someone with an idea but no coding skills can achieve a working result in hours. **The impact** is a form of democratization of programming \u2013 more people can participate in software creation, much like how the advent of visual website builders enabled non-engineers to build websites. Amateurs gain the ability to prototype and solve their own problems through software, which is prompting some to dub vibe coding a new kind of *\u201cno-code revolution powered by AI.\u201d* This not only accelerates innovation for individuals, but also hints at a future where having coding expertise is no longer a strict prerequisite to implement software ideas.\n\n## Prominent Case Studies of Projects Built via Vibe Coding  \n\nTo illustrate the potential of vibe coding, here are a few notable examples where small or amateur teams accomplished projects that traditionally would demand expert developers:\n\n- **Kevin Roose\u2019s Personal Apps (\u201cSoftware for One\u201d)** \u2013 *Use Case:* A tech journalist with minimal coding experience built several custom apps through vibe coding. **Projects:** Roose created a podcast transcriber/summarizer, a bookmark organizer, a furniture dimension checker, and \u201cLunchBox Buddy\u201d (a lunch-planning app) entirely by prompting AI\u301045\u2020L1-L4\u3011. **Functionality:** For instance, LunchBox Buddy lets him input what\u2019s in his refrigerator and then suggests lunch recipes for his child\u2019s school lunch\u301026\u2020L93-L100\u3011. These apps were developed by simply describing the desired features to an AI tool (such as Bolt or Cursor) and letting it generate the code. Roose did not write the code himself; he guided the AI and tested the results. **Impact:** While these tools are somewhat limited and not polished for a mass audience, they served Roose\u2019s personal needs. He described the process as *\u201cmind-blowing,\u201d* comparing it to the awe of using ChatGPT for the first time\u301028\u2020L116-L124\u3011. The success of these experiments demonstrated that a lone individual, even one who *\u201ccan\u2019t code,\u201d* can produce working software via vibe coding. It\u2019s a proof-of-concept that complex tasks like audio transcription, database management, and image analysis (for the furniture measurement) can be tackled by an amateur with AI guidance \u2013 tasks that would normally require multi-faceted programming skills or a development team.\n\n- **AI-Generated Website by a Solo Developer** \u2013 *Use Case:* A professional developer set out to see how far vibe coding could go in building a real web application. **Project:** An interactive website where most of the code is written by AI as the user browses it (an experiment in generative web content)\u301032\u2020L1-L4\u3011. The developer utilized **Cursor\u2019s compose mode with Anthropic\u2019s Claude (an LLM)**, nicknamed \u201cSonnet 3.5\u201d, to generate about **95% of the entire codebase** for the site\u301032\u2020L1-L4\u3011. **Functionality:** The specifics included using AI to select frameworks, create front-end and back-end logic, and even generate content on the fly as users navigate \u2013 essentially a site that partially builds itself with AI. **Development Process:** The developer\u2019s role was *\u201cmostly just guiding the AI and doing some light debugging.\u201d*\u301046\u2020L1-L3\u3011 He would prompt the AI with what the site should do, accept the code it produced, and intervene only to fix stubborn bugs or refine the behavior. **Impact:** The result was a complex web app built in a fraction of the time it would normally take. This case study highlights that even **sophisticated projects** (with multiple components and real-time generation) can be achieved by one person using vibe coding tools, rather than a team of engineers. It validates Karpathy\u2019s vision that we can *\u201cforget the code\u201d* and still end up with a functioning product. Moreover, it uncovered practical lessons: while the AI can produce a bulk of the code, a human is still needed to troubleshoot and fine-tune the final 5%. The developer noted spending a few **\u201cpainful hours of debugging\u201d** on tricky issues\u301046\u2020L1-L3\u3011 \u2013 showing that vibe coding can accelerate development, but it doesn\u2019t entirely remove the need for programming know-how when things go wrong. Even so, this experiment\u2019s success is seen as a glimpse into how startups or individuals might build software in the near future: with AI generating the majority of code and humans overseeing the higher-level design and fixes.\n\n*(Additional examples are emerging as vibe coding gains popularity. Early adopters have also shared stories like building small games, data analysis tools, or clones of simple apps purely through AI guidance. Y Combinator investor Jared Friedman noted in 2025 that many new startups are embracing this \u2013 in fact, roughly a quarter of the companies in one YC batch had **95% of their codebases generated by AI**\u30108\u2020L281-L289\u3011. This trend reinforces that what a single hobbyist can do, a small startup team can also leverage \u2013 compressing the software development lifecycle dramatically.)*\n\n## Challenges and Limitations  \nDespite its exciting promise, vibe coding comes with significant **drawbacks and limitations**. Developers and experts caution that handing over the reins to an AI can lead to issues in code quality, debugging, and security:\n\n- **Lack of Code Understanding and Maintainability:** By definition, vibe coding implies using code one doesn\u2019t fully understand\u30105\u2020L246-L250\u3011. This can be problematic when software needs to be maintained or expanded. Simon Willison warns that *\u201cvibe coding your way to a production codebase is clearly a terrible idea\u201d* because in professional settings, engineers must be accountable for the code they ship\u301040\u2020L25-L33\u3011. If an application built via vibe coding needs a new feature or has an unexpected bug months later, the person maintaining it might struggle to decipher how it works. In traditional development, readability and clear architecture are crucial; AI-generated code, in contrast, might be convoluted or lack proper documentation. This **opacity of AI-written code** makes collaborating on it or improving it over time much harder. Willison notes that much of real software engineering is about *\u201cevolving existing systems, and for those the quality and understandability of the code is crucial.\u201d*\u301040\u2020L25-L33\u3011 Relying on vibe coding can thus incur technical debt \u2013 you get a quick result, but the codebase might be fragile or inscrutable later.\n\n- **AI-Generated Bugs and Errors:** While modern code-generating AIs are powerful, they are not infallible. They can introduce bugs ranging from syntax errors to logical mistakes and even hallucinated functionality. In vibe coding, when an error occurs, the typical approach is to feed the error message back to the AI and hope it fixes it\u301043\u2020L9-L17\u3011. This works for straightforward issues, but **some bugs can stump the AI**, leading to repetitive failure cycles. Karpathy acknowledged that occasionally *the AI \u201cis not able to repair some bugs,\u201d and he has to resort to making random tweaks until the problem resolves*\u301011\u2020L175-L183\u3011. Debugging in this paradigm can be frustrating for inexperienced users \u2013 if the AI gets stuck, a non-coder might have no idea how to proceed. Kevin Roose experienced such roadblocks when trying more advanced projects; for example, his attempt at an email-autoresponder AI hit a wall when integrating with external services, and he struggled for weeks with no success\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011. In another instance, the AI-built code for a demo website fabricated data (inventing fake product reviews) because it wasn\u2019t properly constrained\u30105\u2020L269-L275\u3011. These examples show that AI can and will make mistakes, and without traditional debugging skills, users can find themselves **unable to diagnose or fix issues** beyond what the AI suggests.\n\n- **Security and Quality Concerns:** Blindly accepting AI-written code can lead to hidden vulnerabilities and poor engineering practices. The AI might use outdated libraries or write code that doesn\u2019t handle edge cases, which a novice user wouldn\u2019t catch\u301049\u2020L58-L66\u3011. Experienced developers point out that vibe-coded projects may **fail to check for performance issues, security risks, or bad architectural decisions**\u301043\u2020L13-L17\u3011. For instance, an AI might generate a web form that doesn\u2019t sanitize inputs properly, leaving a security hole, or create an API endpoint with no authentication if the user didn\u2019t explicitly ask for security. A veteran programmer writing code would normally incorporate security checks and consider edge cases, but an AI, unless prompted, might omit those safeguards. Jovan Cicmil, a software engineer, lampooned this over-reliance on AI, noting that some companies let *\u201cinexperienced programmers ship AI-generated spaghetti [code],\u201d* which keeps senior developers busy fixing issues *\u201cfor $200/hour.\u201d*\u301049\u2020L60-L68\u3011 His point is that vibe coding can produce **messy, inefficient code (a.k.a. \u201cspaghetti code\u201d)** that might work superficially but conceal serious issues. Without thorough testing and code review (steps often skipped in vibe coding\u2019s fast pace), bugs and security flaws can slip into production. Therefore, for anything beyond toy projects or prototypes, this approach is risky. It\u2019s recommended that if vibe coding is used, the resulting code be audited and cleaned up by someone with programming expertise before deploying widely.\n\n- **Not a One-Size-Fits-All Solution:** Even proponents of vibe coding admit its limitations. Karpathy himself notes that this method *\u201cmay not be suitable for long, complicated projects\u201d* and is best applied to *\u201cfast, experimental, or recreational work.\u201d*\u301011\u2020L177-L184\u3011 It excels at quickly spinning up a demo or testing an idea, but **scales poorly for complex systems**. Large software projects require careful design, consistency, and collaboration among multiple developers \u2013 areas where an ad-hoc AI-driven approach falls short. Additionally, certain programming tasks that involve novel algorithms or highly specific optimizations might be beyond the current AI\u2019s capability to generate correctly without human insight. Vibe coding is also constrained by the quality of the prompts; an unclear request can lead the AI down the wrong path, producing irrelevant or overly complex code. In summary, vibe coding trades precision for speed. It\u2019s *\u201cfun to play with the limits of these models\u201d* and great for prototyping, Willison says, but developers must *\u201cstay aware of the very real risk\u201d* if such code is pushed into critical use\u301040\u2020L29-L37\u3011. For now, many treat vibe coding as a complementary technique \u2013 useful in its place, but not a wholesale replacement for traditional software engineering in every scenario.\n\n## Future Implications  \nVibe coding is still in its early days, but its rise suggests profound implications for the future of software development, education, and the tech industry:\n\n- **Transformation of Professional Development:** Industry leaders foresee that programming will change fundamentally as AI takes on more coding tasks. *\u201cSoftware engineering [will] be very different by the end of 2025,\u201d* predicted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u30102\u2020L319-L321\u3011. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has similarly remarked that AI could soon do the work of *\u201cmidlevel [software] engineers\u201d* at his company\u301044\u2020L1-L9\u3011. These predictions hint that routine coding work \u2013 the kind typically done by entry or mid-level developers \u2013 might be largely automated by advanced AI. In the near future, a professional developer\u2019s role may shift more toward **architecting systems, refining AI outputs, and maintaining quality**, rather than writing boilerplate code from scratch. Developers could become more like \u201c**AI orchestrators**,\u201d focusing on crafting good prompts, integrating modules, and reviewing AI contributions. This could boost productivity dramatically: a small team (or even a single dev) equipped with AI copilots might build software in weeks that used to take a large team months. In fact, venture investor Jared Friedman revealed that in one Y Combinator startup batch, **AI generated 95% of the code for 25% of the startups** \u2013 a striking figure that underscores how quickly this approach is being adopted\u30108\u2020L281-L289\u3011. We can expect future software projects to routinely involve AIs in the development loop, potentially leading to shorter development cycles and a **rethinking of team composition** (fewer pure coders, more roles in AI supervision and product design).\n\n- **Evolution of Coding Education and Skills:** As vibe coding gains traction, the skills needed to \u201ccode\u201d may also evolve. If natural language prompts become the primary way to create programs, **proficiency in prompt engineering and understanding AI behavior** might be as important as learning syntax of traditional programming languages. Educational curricula may introduce students to AI coding assistants early on, teaching how to effectively leverage them. This could make programming more accessible to a broader range of people, focusing on problem-solving and logic rather than memorizing syntax. However, there\u2019s a balance to strike: relying too much on AI without learning fundamentals could leave upcoming developers with knowledge gaps. Future programmers might need training in reading and validating AI-generated code to ensure they maintain the ability to think critically about algorithms. We may also see a surge in **AI literacy for non-engineers** \u2013 for example, business analysts or designers learning how to use vibe coding tools to prototype solutions without waiting on engineering teams. Overall, the notion of \u201clearning to code\u201d could shift from writing lines of code to learning how to effectively communicate with an AI to get the desired outcome.\n\n- **Democratization vs. Professional Standards:** Vibe coding promises a more **democratized tech industry** where anyone with an idea can build tech products. This could lead to an explosion of innovation from outside the traditional developer community \u2013 more startups founded by people with domain expertise rather than coding expertise, and more niche software addressing specific needs (since individuals can create \u201csoftware for one\u201d for their unique problems). We might see an uptick in solo entrepreneurs launching apps, or small businesses automating their operations with custom tools built via AI. The flip side is that the **barriers to publishing software will be lower**, potentially flooding the market with applications that haven\u2019t been rigorously tested or engineered. The tech industry may need to adapt by developing new **standards and tools for AI-generated code** \u2013 for example, automated code reviewers, security scanners, and AI auditing systems that can keep an eye on quality as tons of new AI-written programs emerge. Established software companies might integrate vibe coding into their workflows for rapid prototyping, while still enforcing code reviews and tests to maintain reliability. \n\n- **New Challenges and Opportunities:** If AI does handle a bulk of coding tasks, we\u2019ll face new challenges such as **ethical and security oversight of AI contributions**. For instance, ensuring that AI models aren\u2019t plagiarizing licensed code or injecting biased logic will be important. On the other hand, freeing developers from grunt work could unlock more creativity: engineers could spend more time on big-picture design, user experience, or tackling complex problems that AI can\u2019t solve alone. We may also see the role of a \u201csoftware developer\u201d bifurcate into those who specialize in traditional coding (for critical systems, performance optimization, etc.) and those who specialize in high-level AI-assisted development for rapid solutions. In the education realm, programming might be taught alongside AI collaboration skills \u2013 students might pair with an AI to build their first project, learning how to guide it and also when to question it. \n\n**In conclusion**, vibe coding appears to be a significant step in the ongoing evolution of programming. It merges the realms of natural language and code, enabling a more intuitive way to create software. Experts like Karpathy champion it as embracing the *\u201cexponential\u201d* power of AI, while others urge caution to not lose the rigorous practices that ensure quality software\u301011\u2020L138-L144\u3011\u301040\u2020L25-L33\u3011. Its impact is already being felt: hobbyists are building apps once beyond their reach, and companies are rethinking how to develop and staff projects. If current trends continue, the future of software development could indeed run on \u201cvibes\u201d \u2013 with human creativity and AI efficiency working in tandem. The tech industry at large may benefit from faster development cycles and a larger pool of creators, but it will also have to navigate the **responsibilities and risks** of this new paradigm. As one observer noted, vibe coding can feel like *\u201csorcery\u201d* to the uninitiated\u301027\u2020L29-L35\u3011 \u2013 and like any magic, it must be used wisely. With proper oversight, training, and integration of traditional best practices, vibe coding could profoundly shape how we build and think about software in the years to come. \n\n**Sources:** The concept of vibe coding and its ramifications have been discussed by AI researchers, developers, and tech writers in early 2025. Key insights were drawn from Andrej Karpathy\u2019s descriptions on X (Twitter)\u301011\u2020L138-L144\u3011\u301011\u2020L169-L173\u3011, reporting by *Business Insider*\u30102\u2020L298-L307\u3011\u30102\u2020L310-L313\u3011 and *The Times of India* on Karpathy\u2019s approach\u301011\u2020L160-L168\u3011\u301011\u2020L175-L183\u3011, and analysis by *Ars Technica* (Benj Edwards) interviewing experts like Simon Willison\u301040\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301040\u2020L29-L37\u3011.

Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of vibe coding\u2019s emergence \u2013 its innovative potential as well as the challenges it presents. The rise of vibe coding underscores a pivotal moment in programming where human creativity and AI power are increasingly intertwined. \n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":248,"end_ix":261,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Silicon Valley's Next Act: Bringing 'Vibe Coding' to the World - Business Insider","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-ai-silicon-valley-andrej-karpathy-2025-2#:~:text=OpenAI%2C%20is%20capturing%20the%20movement","text":"OpenAI, is capturing the movement.","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":2,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":298,"end_line_num":306},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":261,"end_ix":275,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"What is \u2018vibe coding\u2019?

This is one of the **biggest criticisms** of vibe coding, even from professional developers who acknowledge its usefulness. Here\u2019s a deep dive into the **challenges of maintaining AI-generated code** and potential ways the industry might adapt:\n\n---\n\n## **1. The Maintainability Problem of Vibe Coding**\nVibe coding works by letting an AI generate code based on **natural language instructions**, and the user **accepts and runs the code without deep understanding**. This leads to **three critical problems** for maintenance:\n\n### **(a) No Human Readability or Documentation**\n- Traditionally, code is written **with future maintenance in mind**\u2014developers add comments, follow best practices, and structure code in a way that others (or their future selves) can understand.\n- AI-generated code **often lacks proper documentation**. Since the developer does not fully understand it, they **won\u2019t be able to explain it to others**. If the person who created the project leaves, **new maintainers may struggle to figure out how it works**.\n\n### **(b) Debugging Becomes an AI Black Box**\n- Bugs and unexpected behaviors are inevitable in any software. In a normal workflow, developers use debugging techniques to **trace problems back to their root cause**.\n- Vibe coding, however, often results in a **black-box approach to debugging**. If something breaks, the user **feeds error messages back into the AI** instead of manually understanding the issue.\n- This works **only if the AI correctly identifies the bug**\u2014but in many cases, **it might generate a new, different error instead**.\n\n### **(c) Code Rot and Technical Debt**\n- In software engineering, **technical debt** accumulates when quick, unstructured code is written without planning for future modifications.\n- AI-generated code tends to be **functionally correct but poorly structured**\u2014it often doesn\u2019t follow best practices for modularity, efficiency, or security.\n- Over time, **as the system grows**, adding new features or fixing old ones **gets harder and harder**, leading to **\"code rot\"**\u2014where making changes becomes so difficult that developers prefer to rewrite everything from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## **2. How Can AI-Generated Code Be Maintained?**\nDespite these issues, **several approaches** can improve maintainability while still leveraging AI-generated code.\n\n### **(a) Post-Processing: Review and Refactor AI Code**\n- Instead of blindly accepting AI-generated code, **experienced developers should review and refactor it** to improve readability and maintainability.\n- This means:\n  - **Renaming variables and functions for clarity**\n  - **Adding comments and documentation**\n  - **Refactoring** (splitting large AI-generated functions into smaller, reusable ones)\n  - **Ensuring best practices** (e.g., using proper error handling and security measures)\n- Essentially, AI can be used for **first drafts**, but a human must **clean up** the code.\n\n### **(b) Use AI for Code Explanation**\n- Some developers have suggested that AI could **generate explanations and documentation** alongside the code.\n- Tools like **GitHub Copilot Chat**, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, and Replit\u2019s AI already allow users to ask, *\u201cExplain this code to me\u201d* and get breakdowns of how it works.\n- However, AI explanations are **not always accurate**, so a human review is still necessary.\n\n### **(c) Standardized AI Code Review Pipelines**\n- Large software teams using AI-generated code can enforce **AI-assisted code reviews**:\n  1. AI writes the initial code.\n  2. Another **AI tool or human developer** reviews it for maintainability.\n  3. The code must **pass automated tests and security checks** before it\u2019s accepted.\n- This could help ensure that **AI-written code is structured properly** before it enters production.\n\n### **(d) Hybrid Approach: \u201cAI + Human\u201d Collaboration**\n- Many experts suggest that AI should be used as an **assistant, not a replacement** for developers.\n- The **best approach** may be a **hybrid** where:\n  - AI **writes repetitive, boilerplate code** (e.g., UI layouts, basic API endpoints).\n  - **Humans** handle **complex logic, architecture, and debugging**.\n- This keeps the benefits of AI-generated speed **without losing control over the codebase**.\n\n### **(e) Continuous AI Retraining for Codebase Context**\n- Future AI systems might become **persistent coding partners** that **remember past work**.\n- Instead of generating code in isolation, **AI tools could track a project\u2019s evolution** and suggest changes based on its existing structure.\n- This is **not yet widely available**, but some tools (like Cursor\u2019s \u201cPersistent AI\u201d feature) are working on it.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Should AI-Generated Code Be Used in Critical Systems?**\nFor **low-risk projects** (e.g., hobby projects, prototypes, internal tools), vibe coding can be **a great way to move fast**. However, for **critical applications** (e.g., financial systems, healthcare software, security-sensitive programs), **it\u2019s extremely risky** to use code that **nobody fully understands**.\n\n**Industry experts suggest that AI-generated code should always be:**\n\u2714\ufe0f **Reviewed by human engineers** before deployment.  \n\u2714\ufe0f **Tested with automated security scans** to detect vulnerabilities.  \n\u2714\ufe0f **Modularized and documented** for future maintenance.  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **Where AI-generated code is most dangerous:**  \n\u274c **Security-sensitive applications** (e.g., authentication systems, financial transactions).  \n\u274c **Highly optimized or performance-critical code** (e.g., low-latency trading software).  \n\u274c **Large-scale production systems** that require long-term maintenance.  \n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: AI is a Tool, Not a Magic Fix**\n- **Vibe coding is exciting** but **must be used responsibly**.\n- AI can generate code **quickly**, but **it cannot replace the need for structured software engineering**.\n- Companies and individuals using AI-generated code **must still review, document, and maintain it**.\n- Future AI coding tools **might improve maintainability**, but today, **blindly accepting AI-generated code is a recipe for disaster** in any serious project.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Bottom Line:** AI is a **powerful accelerator**, but **human oversight is still essential**. Using AI wisely means balancing **speed and convenience** with **good software engineering practices**. \ud83d\ude80"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"4bd2f1b0-cff8-4cc9-976f-28fc2684c47e","request_id":"91e8ba4d58cef8ce-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4bd2f1b0-cff8-4cc9-976f-28fc2684c47e","children":[]}}}
