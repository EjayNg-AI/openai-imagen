Introduced by Gennadi G. Kasparov in 1980, KK-theory arose from efforts to overcome limitations of earlier K-theory frameworks in the study of operator algebras\u30101\u2020L126-L134\u3011. It was heavily influenced by M. Atiyah\u2019s concept of **Fredholm modules** (used in formulating the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem) and by the work of Brown, Douglas, and Fillmore on classifying C*-algebra extensions\u30101\u2020L131-L139\u3011. In the decades since its invention, KK-theory has become a central tool in operator algebra theory, yielding major advances in index theory, C*-algebra classification, noncommutative geometry, and even drawing connections to algebraic geometry and motivic homotopy theory. This report provides a structured overview of KK-theory\u2019s origins, its technical development, and its broad-ranging modern scope, from foundational motivations to present-day applications.\n\n## Origins and Motivation  \n**Motivation from K-Theory and Extensions:** By the late 1970s, mathematicians faced the need for a more powerful K-theoretic tool to handle problems in operator algebras that classical topological K-theory could not adequately address. One key impetus was the problem of defining **analytic K-homology** (the \u201cdual\u201d theory to K-theory). In 1977, Brown, Douglas, and Fillmore (BDF) studied extensions of commutative C*-algebras by compact operators and showed that equivalence classes of extensions 0 \u2192 *K* \u2192 *E* \u2192 C(*X*) \u2192 0 (with *X* a compact space, *K* the algebra of compact operators) form an abelian group *Ext*(*X*)\u30106\u2020L38-L46\u3011. Strikingly, they recognized that this *Ext* group coincided with the *K*-homology of *X*, specifically *Ext*(*X*) \u2245 K\u2081(*X*)\u30106\u2020L38-L46\u3011. This result answered Atiyah\u2019s question of giving an analytic definition of K-homology\u30106\u2020L41-L46\u3011, but it was limited to extensions by compact operators and primarily addressed commutative algebras C(*X*). More generally, classical topological K-theory (pioneered by Atiyah and Hirzebruch) provided powerful invariants for spaces and operator algebras (via K\u2080 and K\u2081 groups), but it was a *homotopy-invariant functor in one variable*. It lacked a *composition product* that would allow \u201ccoboundary\u201d operations or the chaining of morphisms between different K-theory groups in a general way. In other words, there was no single unified theory that could take two C*-algebras *A* and *B* and produce an invariant group encompassing both the K-theory of *A* and the K-homology of *B*, or describe mappings between them, while still enjoying functorial composition. These shortcomings motivated a **bivariant** theory that could encode both **cohomological** (contra-variant) and **homological** (covariant) information in a single framework, and handle the general case of noncommutative C*-algebras beyond commutative C(*X*). Kasparov\u2019s invention of KK-theory was driven by these needs. It built on earlier ideas (Atiyah\u2019s Fredholm module formalism for index theory and the BDF extension group) and decisively extended them to a far more general and powerful theory\u301015\u2020L52-L60\u3011.\n\n**Kasparov\u2019s Insight:** In 1980, Kasparov introduced KK-theory as an *additive bivariant functor* `KK(A, B)` defined for any pair of separable C*-algebras *(A, B)*\u30101\u2020L126-L134\u3011. Here `KK(A, B)` is an abelian group associated to the \u201cpair\u201d (A, B), intended to simultaneously generalize:\n- **K-theory of C*-algebras:** If one fixes *A = C* (the base field \u2102 regarded as a trivial C*-algebra), then KK(*C*, *B*) recovers the ordinary K\u2080-group of *B*. In fact, KK\u2080(*C*, *B*) \u2245 K\u2080(*B*) (and similarly KK\u2081(*C*, *B*) \u2245 K\u2081(*B*))\u30101\u2020L193-L197\u3011. Thus the *second* argument plays the role of a \u201ccohomology theory\u201d target, reproducing standard operator K-theory.\n- **K-homology of spaces/algebras:** Dually, if one fixes *B = C*, KK(*A*, *C*) recovers the K-homology (or *analytic homology*) of *A*. For example, if *A* = C(*X*) for a compact space *X*, then KK\u2099(C(*X*), C) is canonically isomorphic to the *K*-homology group K\u208b\u2099(*X*). In particular, Brown\u2013Douglas\u2013Fillmore\u2019s extension group was reinterpreted in KK-theory: BDF showed *Ext*(*X*) \u2245 K\u2081(*X*), and indeed Kasparov\u2019s theory gives *Ext*(*X*) \u2245 KK\u2081(C(*X*), C)\u30106\u2020L38-L46\u3011, identifying extension classes with elements of a KK group. In this way KK-theory subsumes the BDF Ext-classification as a special case (KK\u00b9 for commutative *A*). It also subsumes Atiyah\u2019s *Fredholm module* picture of K-homology: a Fredholm module on *A* is essentially a cycle defining an element in KK(*A*, C). Kasparov\u2019s theory provided the *universal* home for such cycles.\n\nBy encompassing both K-theory and K-homology, KK-theory promised a unified language to tackle problems like extension classification, index pairing, and functorial maps between different K-groups that earlier frameworks could not handle in one go. Importantly, Kasparov defined **bigraded** groups KK\u2080(*A, B*) and KK\u2081(*A, B*) (reflecting the 2-periodicity of complex K-theory), which yield a *\u2124\u2082-graded* (or \u201ceven/odd\u201d) theory. The stage was set to leverage this bivariant functor for new applications in operator algebras.\n\n## Bivariant KK-Theory: Definition and Early Development  \n**Kasparov\u2019s Definition:** The original definition of KK(*A, B*) is technical, blending operator algebra representation theory with functional-analytic \u201cFredholm\u201d conditions. In Kasparov\u2019s formulation, an element of KK(*A, B*) (often called a **Kasparov (A, B)-module**) is represented by a triple *(E, \u03c1, F)*, where \u03c1: *A* \u2192 *B*(E) is a **-representation of *A* on a graded Hilbert B-module *E*, and *F* is an adjointable operator on *E* of degree 1 (odd operator) that is \u201cFredholm-like\u201d relative to \u03c1. The defining conditions require that for every *a* \u2208 *A*, the commutator [*F*, \u03c1(*a*)] and the defect operators (F\u00b2 \u2013 1)\u03c1(*a*) and (F \u2013 F* )\u03c1(*a*) are all compact operators on *E*\u30101\u2020L154-L164\u3011\u30101\u2020L167-L175\u3011. Intuitively, this means *F* almost commutes with *A* and is almost an involution up to compact perturbations, generalizing the notion of a Fredholm operator (the case *B = C*) to a setting of operators on a *B*-module. Two such cycles *(E, \u03c1, F)* and *(E\u2032, \u03c1\u2032, F\u2032)* are considered equivalent in KK if one can be continuously deformed (homotoped) to the other through a family of cycles (including a notion of degenerate/null-homotopic cycles)\u30101\u2020L167-L175\u3011. The set of equivalence classes of cycles is an abelian group, with addition given by the direct sum of Hilbert modules. Kasparov showed that these groups KK\u2080(*A, B*) and KK\u2081(*A, B*) satisfy all the desirable properties of a generalized (extraordinary) homology/cohomology theory in the C*-algebra context, including **homotopy invariance**, **Bott periodicity** (period-2 isomorphism KK\u2099 \u2245 KK\u2099\u208a\u2082), **split-exactness** (excision for split short exact sequences), and the existence of long exact sequences associated to extensions. The theory reduces to ordinary K-theory in special cases as noted above, validating it as a true generalization\u30101\u2020L193-L197\u3011.\n\n**The Kasparov Product:** A cornerstone of KK-theory (and one of Kasparov\u2019s deepest innovations) is the **Kasparov product**, which provides a *composition law* in the bivariant theory. Given an element \u03b1 \u2208 KK(*A, B*) and \u03b2 \u2208 KK(*B, C*), there is a well-defined product \u03b1\u2297_B \u03b2 \u2208 KK(*A, C*)\u301013\u2020L193-L201\u3011. This product is associative, bi-additive, and has an identity element (the class of the identity homomorphism in KK(*A, A*) acts as a unit). The Kasparov product is analogous to composition of morphisms: it allows one to \u201ctensor\u201d a Kasparov (A, B)-module with a Kasparov (B, C)-module along the common *B* to obtain an (A, C)-module. In particular, **KK-theory becomes a category**: objects are separable C*-algebras and morphisms from *A* to *C* are given by KK(*A, C*), with composition given by the product \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2\u301013\u2020L193-L201\u3011. The existence and well-definedness of this product (announced by Kasparov in his early papers) was highly nontrivial \u2013 it required constructing an explicit \u201cconnection\u201d or operator on the module tensor product and proving functional analytic estimates to ensure the resulting cycle meets the Fredholm conditions. Kasparov\u2019s **Associativity Theorem** for the product was a technical tour de force, but it is crucial: it endows KK with an **internal category structure** that greatly amplifies its power. With the Kasparov product, one can compose KK-classes much like one composes morphisms or correspondences, making KK-theory into a kind of \u201cmorphism category\u201d for noncommutative spaces.\n\n**Early Milestones:** After Kasparov\u2019s initial publication (circa 1980), several milestones marked the development of KK-theory in the 1980s:  \n- *Equivariant KK-theory:* Kasparov extended the theory to **KK^G**(*A, B*) for C*-algebras with a continuous action of a locally compact group *G*. Equivariant KK allowed analysis of *G*-C*-algebras and became indispensable in approaches to the **Novikov conjecture** and **Baum\u2013Connes conjecture** (more on these below). In his influential 1988 paper *\u201cEquivariant KK-theory and the Novikov conjecture,\u201d* Kasparov applied KK^G to yield \u201cstriking positive results on the Novikov conjecture\u201d\u301015\u2020L57-L60\u3011 \u2013 specifically, he proved the *injectivity* (and in some cases surjectivity) of the Baum\u2013Connes assembly map for large classes of groups (e.g. groups acting properly on trees or with the Haagerup property, a.k.a. \u201ca-T-menable\u201d groups). This was a breakthrough in geometric topology and operator algebras, using KK-theory as the primary tool.  \n- *Fredholm modules and Index theory:* In 1981\u201384, Kasparov also showed how classical Fredholm operator index pairings could be reinterpreted in KK-theory. An elliptic pseudodifferential operator *P* of order 0 on a compact manifold *M*, which classically defines an element of K-homology of *M*, can be viewed as a class [*P*] in KK(C(*M*), C)\u301010\u2020L7-L15\u3011. Meanwhile, any complex vector bundle (or K-theory class) on *M* gives an element of K\u2080(*M*) = KK(*C*, C(*M*)). The **analytic index** of *P* acting on that bundle is then realized as the Kasparov product [*P*] \u2297 KK(C(*M*), *C(*M*)) [*bundle*] \u2208 KK(*C*, C) = K\u2080(C) \u2245 \u2124, recovering the integer index. In this way, KK-theory furnishes a highly general *index pairing*: elements of KK(*A, C*) (K-homology of *A*) pair with elements of KK(*C, A*) (K-theory of *A*) to give KK(*C, C*) \u2245 \u2124, unifying the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem with a noncommutative generality. Kasparov\u2019s framework provided new conceptual proofs of index theorems (e.g. for families of elliptic operators, for foliations, and for covering spaces) by treating them as computations in KK\u301010\u2020L13-L22\u3011.  \n- *Alternate \u201cPictures\u201d of KK:* Soon after Kasparov\u2019s definition, alternative descriptions of KK-theory were developed to simplify or clarify its construction. Joachim Cuntz provided a picture of KK using purely homomorphism-based data instead of explicit Fredholm operators. In Cuntz\u2019s approach, KK(*A, B*) can be described in terms of homotopy classes of *quasi-homomorphisms* from *A* into the stabilized algebra *K*(H) \u2297 *B*\u30101\u2020L177-L185\u3011. Roughly, a quasi-homomorphism consists of a pair of **-homomorphisms that agree up to compacts, capturing the same essential data as Kasparov\u2019s (\u03c1, F) but in a more algebraic way. This \u201cCuntz picture\u201d eliminates the need to track the operator *F* explicitly and emphasizes the universal property of compact operators. Such simplifications made KK-theory more accessible and paved the way for generalizing the theory beyond C*-algebras (e.g. to Banach algebras or DG algebras).  \n\nBy the late 1980s, KK-theory was firmly established, supported by foundational results like the **Kasparov Stabilization Theorem** (showing any cycle can be dilated to one with a countably generated module), the **Homotopy Invariance Theorem**, and the **Six-Term Exact Sequence** for any extension 0 \u2192 *J* \u2192 *E* \u2192 *Q* \u2192 0 of C*-algebras (KK groups yield a cyclic six-term exact sequence relating KK(*A, J*), KK(*A, E*), KK(*A, Q*) and similarly KK(*E, B*) etc.). Jonathan Rosenberg and Claude Schochet proved the **Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT)** in 1985, expressing KK(*A, B*) in terms of the K-theory of *A* and *B* when *A* belongs to the so-called *bootstrap class* of nuclear algebras\u301034\u2020L34-L42\u3011. The UCT (and its companion K\u00fcnneth theorem) gave computational grip on KK-groups in many cases and was later crucial in the classification of C*-algebras. Nigel Higson in 1987 provided a characterization of KK-theory in abstract categorical terms (discussed next), further solidifying the theory\u2019s foundations\u301026\u2020L34-L42\u3011.\n\n## Properties and Categorical Structure  \nKK-theory enjoys a collection of powerful **functorial properties** that generalize those of ordinary K-theory, making it an extraordinarily robust invariant. Some of the key properties are:\n\n- **Homotopy Invariance:** If two **-homomorphisms f, g: *A* \u2192 *B* are homotopic (through **-homomorphisms), then they determine the same KK-class in KK(*A, B*). Thus KK(*A, B*) depends only on the homotopy class of *A* (as a topological algebra) and similarly on *B*. In particular, if *A* is contractible (homotopy equivalent to the zero algebra), KK(*A, B*) = 0 for any *B*. This mirrors the homotopy invariance of topological K-theory. \n\n- **Stability:** KK-theory is stable under tensoring the algebras with the compact operators *K*. If *A\u2032 = A \u2297 K* (a \u201cstabilized\u201d algebra), then KK(*A, B*) \u2245 KK(*A\u2032, B*) by a canonical isomorphism (and similarly in the second variable). Intuitively, adding infinitely many trivial degrees of freedom (compact operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) does not change the KK-groups. This property generalizes the Bott periodicity isomorphism (since C\u2080(\u211d\u00b2) is Morita equivalent to the compacts).\n\n- **Split-Exactness and Six-Term Exact Sequences:** While KK is not *exact* on all short exact sequences, it is *half-exact* for split sequences. Moreover, for any extension 0 \u2192 *I* \u2192 *E* \u2192 *Q* \u2192 0 (not necessarily split), KK-theory yields a six-term exact sequence of groups connecting KK\u2080 and KK\u2081 of *I, E, Q*\u301013\u2020L169-L178\u3011\u301013\u2020L197-L205\u3011. This generalizes the Mayer\u2013Vietoris or Excision property found in homology theories. The existence of this exact sequence means KK-theory can detect extension information; in fact the extension class of *E* (as an element of *Ext*(*Q*, *I*)) corresponds to a *boundary map* in the KK exact sequence, identifying *Ext* groups as special cases of KK as mentioned.\n\n- **Additivity and Bott Periodicity:** KK(*A, B*) is an additive (actually *triangulated*) category: direct sums of C*-algebras yield direct sum decompositions of KK-groups. Bott periodicity is built into KK via the grading: a shift by one in degree (suspension) is an isomorphism KK\u2099(*A, B*) \u2245 KK_{n+2}(*A, B*). Equivalently, tensoring *A* or *B* with the algebra C\u2080(\u211d) (or C\u2080(\u211d\u00b2)) induces isomorphisms on KK-groups, reflecting the periodicity of complex K-theory\u301013\u2020L179-L187\u3011.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable *structural* fact about KK-theory is its **universal characterization** among \u201creasonable\u201d functors out of the category of C*-algebras. Cuntz and Higson showed that *Kasparov\u2019s KK-functor is the **universal** homotopy-invariant, stable, split-exact functor from separable C*-algebras to an additive category*\u301026\u2020L34-L42\u3011. In other words, if you have *any* functor `F` from the category of C*-algebras to (say) abelian groups or to some additive category that satisfies: (i) homotopy invariance (F(*A*) \u2245 F(*A*') if *A* \u2243 *A*' by homotopy), (ii) stability (F(*A*) \u2245 F(*A* \u2297 K*)), and (iii) split-exactness (preserves split exact sequences, hence yields six-term exact sequences), then necessarily `F` factors through KK-theory\u301026\u2020L34-L42\u3011\u301013\u2020L197-L205\u3011. Concretely, there is a natural transformation from `F` to KK such that for every *A*, one has F(*A*) \u2245 KK(*A, E*) for some image *E* in the KK category. Kasparov\u2019s category KK is thus a *localization* of the ordinary category of C*-algebras: one formally adds inverses to all homotopy equivalences and \u201cstabilization maps\u201d to reach KK\u301026\u2020L37-L45\u3011. This universal property explains KK-theory\u2019s importance: any invariant of C*-algebras satisfying basic \u201cbootstrap\u201d properties must be a (possibly simplified) image of KK. Indeed, the abstract point of view is that KK is a sort of **stable homotopy category** for C*-algebras\u301013\u2020L219-L227\u3011. It has formal analogies to the stable homotopy category in topology, with suspension corresponding to Bott periodicity, and with exact triangles coming from extensions, etc. The category KK is also **symmetric monoidal** (there is a tensor product \u2297 on C*-algebras \u2013 e.g. minimal tensor product \u2013 that descends to KK and gives a monoidal structure consistent with K-theory\u2019s ring structures)\u301012\u2020L31-L36\u3011. All these categorical structures (additive, triangulated, monoidal, universal properties) make KK-theory a flexible *framework* \u2013 one can formulate many constructions in KK without leaving the category, and leverage formal properties to deduce new results. For example, one can talk about **KK-equivalences**: an element \u03b7 \u2208 KK(*A, B*) that has an inverse in KK (under Kasparov product) is called a KK-equivalence, and it behaves like a *weak homotopy equivalence* between noncommutative spaces *A* and *B*. If such an \u03b7 exists, *A* and *B* have isomorphic KK*-groups and are \u201ccategorically the same\u201d from KK\u2019s viewpoint.\n\n## Generalization of Classical K-Theory  \nKasparov\u2019s KK-theory not only recovers classical **topological K-theory** in special cases, but truly *generalizes* it by allowing far more flexibility. We have already seen that taking one argument as the base field \u2102 yields ordinary K-groups: KK\u2080(*C*, *B*) \u2245 K\u2080(*B*) and KK\u2081(*C*, *B*) \u2245 K\u2081(*B*)\u30101\u2020L193-L197\u3011. Dually, taking the second argument as \u2102 gives KK(*A*, *C*) \u2245 K\u2080(*A*) (if we consider *A* as a graded algebra, this corresponds to *K*-homology classes of *A*). In fact, one can characterize classical **K-homology of spaces** via KK: if *X* is a compact space, the analytic K-homology K_*(*X*) defined by Atiyah can be identified with KK_*(C(*X*), C). For example, Brown\u2013Douglas\u2013Fillmore\u2019s extension group is exactly KK\u2081(C(*X*), C) as noted\u30106\u2020L38-L46\u3011. Thus KK-theory provides a single bivariant group KK\u2099(*A, B*) that yields *K-theory* when *A = C*, yields *K-homology* when *B = C*, and more generally yields *twisted* or *relative* K-groups for other choices of *A* and *B*. This unification resolves the earlier disjoint treatment of K-theory and K-homology, putting them under one roof. It also means that KK-theory is a natural setting to discuss **pairings** between K-theory and K-homology: given x \u2208 KK(*A, C*) (a K-homology class of *A*) and y \u2208 KK(*C*, *B*) (a K-theory class of *B*), their Kasparov product x \u2297 y \u2208 KK(*A, B*) can be seen as the result of taking an index pairing or pushforward of one class along the other. In particular, as mentioned, an element of KK(*A, C*) paired with an element of KK(*C, A*) yields an element of KK(*C, C*) \u2245 \u2124, reproducing the **index pairing** that lands in the integers.\n\nAnother way to view KK is as a far-reaching **generalized cohomology theory** on the category of C*-algebras. One can fix one argument and vary the other: for a fixed *A*, the functor *B* \u21a6 KK(*A, B*) is like a homology theory in *B* (covariant, taking disjoint unions to direct sums, etc.), and for fixed *B*, the functor *A* \u21a6 KK(*A, B*) is like a cohomology theory in *A* (contravariant via KK(*A, B*) \u2245 KK(*B*, *A*) under taking adjoint algebras in some cases, and taking pullbacks to pushouts etc.). In fact, when restricting to *commutative* C*-algebras, KK-theory contains ordinary topological cohomology theories. If *A* = C(*X*) and *B* = C(*Y*), with *X, Y* compact spaces, KK(*C(*X*), C(*Y*)) is isomorphic to the **slant product** of the K-homology of *X* with the K-theory of *Y*, which in favorable cases is related to K^*(*X* \u00d7 *Y*). Thus KK can be thought of as **K-theory with two variables**, which in algebraic topology would correspond to a *bivariant (co)homology theory*. Indeed, bivariant theories in algebraic topology (such as Fulton\u2013MacPherson\u2019s bivariant Chow groups, or more fundamentally Grothendieck\u2019s motives) were developed to unify cohomology and homology \u2013 Kasparov\u2019s KK is the operator algebra analogue of this philosophy.\n\nA concrete generalization provided by KK-theory is in the realm of **extension theory of C*-algebras**. Classical K-theory could classify *some* extensions (e.g. AF-algebras are classified by K\u2080 invariants), but it was not sufficient for extensions involving noncommutative quotients. Kasparov showed that *all* (equivalence classes of) extensions of *A* by *B* (i.e. short exact sequences 0\u2192 *B* \u2192 *E* \u2192 *A* \u21920) are classified by a **single** KK-group: namely, the extension defines an element of KK\u2081(*A, B*) (the \u201cYoneda Ext\u201d in this category). In fact, there is an isomorphism KK\u2081(*A, B*) \u2245 *Ext*^1_*{separate}*(*A, B*) for suitable definitions of the extension group. Under this correspondence, the Baer sum of extensions corresponds to addition in KK, and the boundary map in the six-term sequence gives the extension class. If *B* = *K*(H) (compact operators), this recovers BDF\u2019s Ext as a special case. Thus KK-theory *fully subsumes extension classification* problems: an extension is trivial (splits) if and only if its KK-class is zero; two extensions are equivalent if and only if their KK classes coincide, etc. This was a profound generalization \u2013 earlier K-functors could not see all extensions, whereas KK (especially in degree 1) captures them precisely.\n\n## Connections to Index Theory and Assembly Maps  \nOne of the original motivations for KK-theory was to provide a robust toolkit for **index theory** of operators on complex manifolds and foliations, particularly higher-index problems that involve group actions. This goal was spectacularly achieved. As described, an elliptic operator\u2019s analytical index can be encoded as a Kasparov KK-class, and the pairing with a K-theory class produces the index in \u2124\u301010\u2020L7-L15\u3011. In the noncommutative realm, this idea generalizes to index pairings with values in *K-theory of C*-algebras* rather than just integers. For example, if a group *G* acts properly on a space *X*, one can form a Dirac-type operator (from geometry) whose index lies not in \u2124 but in K\u2080 of the reduced group C*-algebra C*<sub>r</sub>(*G*). The **Baum\u2013Connes conjecture** is exactly of this nature: it posits an *assembly map* that takes geometric K-homology classes of the classifying space *EG* (for proper *G*-actions) and produces K-theory classes in K\u2080,\u2081(C*<sub>r</sub>(*G*)) \u2013 conjecturally an isomorphism\u301032\u2020L12-L20\u3011\u301032\u2020L15-L23\u3011. Kasparov\u2019s equivariant KK-theory is the natural home for formulating and studying this assembly map. In KK-theory language, the Baum\u2013Connes assembly map can be realized as a **Kasparov product** with a certain canonical element (the \u201cDirac element\u201d D \u2208 KK^G(C(*EG*), \u2102), paired with the \u201cgamma element\u201d in KK^G(\u2102, \u2102*(*G*))) \u2013 through these products one obtains an element in KK^G(C(*EG*), C*(*G*)) and then descends (via the **descent homomorphism** in equivariant KK) to KK(\u2102, C*<sub>r</sub>(*G*)) = K\u2080(C*<sub>r</sub>(*G*)). This abstract description becomes concrete in cases where assembly is proven: one shows the Dirac element is invertible in a localized KK-category, implying the assembly map is an isomorphism on K-groups. Using this machinery, Kasparov proved the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture for a broad class of groups: notably, for **a-T-menable groups** (those admitting a proper affine isometric action on a Hilbert space, also known as groups with the Haagerup property). The Higson\u2013Kasparov theorem (circa 1997) states that if *G* is second-countable, locally compact and a-T-menable, then *G* satisfies the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture with coefficients\u301030\u2020L1-L8\u3011. This result covers all amenable groups and many others, providing a huge family of groups (including free groups, surface groups, etc.) for which the assembly map is validated. The proof hinges on constructing an explicit KK^G-element (the \u201cDirac-dual Dirac method\u201d) and demonstrating its KK-invertibility\u301030\u2020L27-L35\u3011. Conversely, KK-theory has also been used to find **counterexamples** to Baum\u2013Connes in full generality: in 2002, Higson, Lafforgue, and Skandalis exhibited certain pathological groups (ones containing expanders, etc.) for which the assembly map with coefficients is not injective\u301032\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301032\u2020L28-L36\u3011. These developments underscore KK-theory\u2019s central role in one of the deepest problems linking topology, geometry, and analysis.\n\nBeyond Baum\u2013Connes, KK-theory also connects with **Novikov\u2019s conjecture** on homotopy invariance of higher signatures. In fact, Baum\u2013Connes implies Novikov for group *G*, and Kasparov\u2019s early work with KK (1980s) provided direct proofs of the Novikov conjecture for many groups by constructing specific KK-equivalent Fredholm models for signature operators\u301032\u2020L15-L23\u3011. For foliations (as studied by Connes), the **longitudinal index theorem** can be formulated in KK-theory: Connes and Skandalis (early 1980s) defined a foliation index as a class in KK which then pairs with K-theory of a foliation algebra to give numerical invariants\u301010\u2020L13-L22\u3011. All these instances show that **index theory problems with additional parameters or symmetries become tractable in KK-theory** \u2013 the bivariant framework handles the extra algebraic variables naturally, whereas ordinary K-theory would not. \n\nA concrete example: If *M* is a manifold and *\u0393* is a discrete group acting freely and properly on *M*, one can form the cross-product C*-algebra A = C(*M*) \u22ca *\u0393*. Classical index theory might ask: does an elliptic operator on *M* which is *\u0393*-invariant have an index in K\u2080(C*<sub>r</sub>(*\u0393*)) (the operator algebra of the group)? Using KK-theory, the answer is yes: the operator defines a class in KK^\u0393(C(*M*), \u2102) (an equivariant KK-class), which can be **descended** to KK( A, C*<sub>r</sub>(*\u0393*) ) by Kasparov\u2019s descent principle. Then pairing with the K\u2080-class of an idempotent in A yields an element of K\u2080(C*<sub>r</sub>(*\u0393*)), which is by definition the index in the group algebra. This procedure is essentially the **analytic assembly map**, and its functorial properties are guaranteed by KK-theory. In summary, the abstract machinery of KK provides a unified way to describe **assembly maps, index pairings, and other \u201cpush-forward\u201d or \u201ctransfer\u201d maps** in topology and geometry. It generalizes the classical push-forward (Gysin) in K-theory to noncommutative contexts. Index theory, both on manifolds and in noncommutative spaces, has been revolutionized by being recast in KK-theoretic terms.\n\n## Links to Cyclic Homology and Bivariant Chern\u2013Connes Character  \nKK-theory, while born from operator algebras, has deep connections with **noncommutative differential geometry** \u2013 notably through **cyclic homology and cohomology**, introduced by Alain Connes and Boris Tsygan. Cyclic homology (HC) can be viewed as an analog of de Rham homology for noncommutative algebras. In the 1980s, Connes developed cyclic cohomology partly *motivated by Kasparov\u2019s formalism* for K-homology\u301015\u2020L96-L104\u3011. The concept of a **Fredholm module** (Kasparov module without the C*-algebra target, essentially) appears in Connes\u2019s theory as a **spectral triple**, which provides a cycle in entire cyclic cohomology. In fact, Connes sought an \u201cadditive\u201d (homological) version of K-theory \u2013 and cyclic homology was initially described by Tsygan as *\u201cadditive K-theory\u201d*, highlighting that it behaves like a homology theory related to K-theory\u301015\u2020L100-L108\u3011. There is a classical **Chern character** map from topological K-theory to ordinary cohomology (de Rham or rational cohomology). In the noncommutative setting, one similarly has a **Connes\u2013Chern character** from K-theory (or K-homology) to cyclic homology (or cohomology). For example, an idempotent in a C*-algebra (K\u2080-class) can be sent to a cyclic homology class, and an unbounded Fredholm module (K-homology cycle) gives a cyclic cohomology class. The relationship between KK-theory and cyclic theory was made precise by the construction of a **bivariant Chern\u2013Connes character**. \n\nSpecifically, Connes and others (e.g. J. Cuntz, D. Quillen, and M. Puschnigg) defined a **bivariant periodic cyclic theory** HP\u2099(*A, B*) which is a bivariant functor analogous to KK but taking values in periodic cyclic homology groups. Just as KK was defined first for C*-algebras, *bivariant cyclic cohomology* was introduced (Jones and Kassel, circa late 1980s) for algebras of other types\u301014\u2020L9-L17\u3011. It turns out that periodic cyclic homology (HP) satisfies the same formal properties as KK (homotopy invariance, stability, excision)\u301015\u2020L69-L78\u3011\u301015\u2020L111-L118\u3011. By the universal property of KK-theory, there exists a unique natural transformation (preserving product structures) from KK to HP. This is the **bivariant Chern\u2013Connes character** ch<sub>CC</sub>: KK\u2099(*A, B*) \u2192 HP\u2099(*A, B*), which extends the classical Chern character on K\u2080 and K\u2081. In fact, this transformation is a vast generalization of the usual Chern character: it carries Kasparov products to cup-products in cyclic theory, thus is **multiplicative**\u301015\u2020L113-L118\u3011. For ordinary commutative spaces, this bivariant character recovers the usual Chern character from K^*(X) to H^*(X; \u211a). In noncommutative examples, it connects operator K-theory to Hochschild and cyclic homology invariants that are computable by \u201cdifferentiable\u201d means (e.g. using traces on algebras). The existence of ch<sub>CC</sub> means that KK-theory, though an analytic construct, can be studied via more classical invariants: one can map KK-classes to cyclic homology and try to distinguish them or compute pairings at the level of de Rham-type theory. For instance, Connes\u2019 index formula for foliations can be seen as evaluating the Chern\u2013Connes character of a KK-cycle on a certain cyclic cocycle (a generalized volume form), yielding the numerical index\u301015\u2020L96-L104\u3011.\n\nAnother point of contact is that cyclic cohomology provides **secondary invariants** (like Chern\u2013Simons classes) for KK-theory. If a KK-class (say an extension class or a homomorphism class) becomes trivial in K-theory but not trivial in KK, its image under the Chern\u2013Connes character might be a nonzero cyclic class, which can detect more refined information (e.g. an exotic phase or torsion). Cuntz and Quillen\u2019s work on **algebraic cyclic theory** has shown that for many algebras, the Chern\u2013Connes map from K\u2080 to HP\u2080 is an isomorphism after tensoring with \u211a, indicating that cyclic homology captures the rational part of K-theory. However, KK-theory contains torsion information and analytic subtleties that go beyond cyclic theory. Research continues into understanding the image of the KK\u2013HP character (the \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201crigidity\u201d of the Chern character in various contexts)\u301014\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Nevertheless, the key takeaway is that **KK-theory bridges to homological algebra**: it is deeply linked with **cyclic (co)homology** and **noncommutative de Rham theory**, through the Chern\u2013Connes character. This allows techniques from differential geometry (integration of forms, etc.) to be applied to problems in K-theory. Connes\u2019 *Noncommutative Geometry* (1994) textbook emphasizes this interplay, showing for example that the index of a transverse Dirac operator on a foliation can be computed by pairing a KK-class with a cyclic cocycle (a higher-dimensional analog of integrating the A-hat genus against the fundamental class)\u301032\u2020L15-L23\u3011.\n\nIn summary, KK-theory does not exist in isolation; it is part of a web of *bivariant theories*. Following KK\u2019s success, mathematicians developed **E-theory** (Connes\u2013Higson, an asymptotic version of KK that is simpler in some respects), and **bivariant cyclic theory** (Jones\u2013Kassel, Cuntz, etc.), among others\u30101\u2020L140-L144\u3011. Most of these theories share KK\u2019s category-theoretic flavor and often admit comparisons or maps between them. KK sits at the center as the most general and powerful such theory for C*-algebras, and many others are either refinements or \u201cabelianizations\u201d of it (for instance, E-theory is a universal *functor* like KK but defined via asymptotic homomorphisms, yielding the same groups as KK for nuclear algebras, while periodic cyclic homology is like a decategorified version capturing de Rham-type invariants). The development of these theories has greatly enriched noncommutative topology, providing multiple lenses (analytic, homotopy theoretic, algebraic) to study operator algebras.\n\n## Major Contributors and Technical Milestones  \nKK-theory\u2019s development has been shaped by numerous researchers. Here we highlight a few key figures and their contributions:\n\n- **Gennadi G. Kasparov:** As the inventor of KK-theory, Kasparov wrote the foundational papers (1980\u20131981) defining KK and proving its main properties. He introduced the Kasparov product and proved the difficult theorems ensuring the product\u2019s associativity and the functor\u2019s homotopy invariance. Kasparov also extended the theory to *equivariant KK^G* and applied it to solve longstanding open problems. His 1988 *Inventiones* paper on **equivariant KK and the Novikov conjecture**\u301028\u2020L19-L22\u3011 is a landmark that proved the Novikov higher signature conjecture for a broad class of groups using KK^G. Kasparov\u2019s work also included constructing specific KK-cycles for the Dirac operator in K-homology and the Bott element, and using them to show Bott periodicity internally in KK. In operator algebras, Kasparov proved the **Voiculescu absorption theorem** and other extension results as corollaries of KK-theory. His name is attached to numerous concepts in the field (Kasparov modules, Kasparov\u2019s Technical Theorem, KK-equivalence, etc.), and he set the stage for the classification of nuclear C*-algebras via KK-theoretic invariants.\n\n- **Joachim Cuntz:** Cuntz made seminal contributions by reformulating KK-theory in a more algebraic picture, as mentioned earlier\u30101\u2020L177-L185\u3011. He introduced the concept of **quasi-homomorphisms** and the *\u201cCuntz picture\u201d* of KK, which greatly clarified the nature of KK-cycles and simplified many proofs. Cuntz was also a pioneer in exploring **bivariant theories beyond C*-algebras** \u2013 he defined a version of KK-theory for *locally convex algebras* and for *rings*, laying groundwork for connections to algebraic K-theory. Along with Daniel Quillen, he developed **bivariant periodic cyclic cohomology** and described the bivariant Chern character from KK to cyclic theory. Cuntz\u2019s name is also associated with important C*-algebras (like the Cuntz algebras O_n) which serve as key examples in KK-theory. In the 1990s and 2000s, with Ralf Meyer, he studied the **triangulated category structure of KK** and its localization, and also investigated connections to *motivic* theories (e.g. viewing KK as a model for noncommutative motives). \n\n- **Nigel Higson:** Higson\u2019s 1987 paper *\u201cA Characterization of KK-theory\u201d* provided the first abstract characterization of KK as the universal homotopy-stable, split-exact functor\u301028\u2020L19-L22\u3011, a result that underscores why KK is unavoidable in classification theory. Higson, together with Alain Connes, introduced **E-theory** (early 1990s) as an asymptotic bivariant K-theory that is often easier to compute; E-theory has the advantage of a simpler definition (homotopy classes of asymptotic **-homomorphisms) and is weakly equivalent to KK for nice classes of algebras. Higson also played a central role in Baum\u2013Connes work: the **Higson\u2013Kasparov theorem** proving the conjecture for a-T-menable groups was a monumental achievement\u301030\u2020L5-L8\u3011. Moreover, Higson has contributed to the theory of **analytic K-homology** (he co-authored the book *\u201cAnalytic K-Homology\u201d* with John Roe, which develops KK-theory from the perspective of geometric cycles) and to counterexamples to Baum\u2013Connes (with Lafforgue and Skandalis, 2002). Many of Higson\u2019s ideas bridge topology and analysis, for instance the use of coarse geometry and controlled operator algebras to approach assembly maps (the \u201cDirac dual-Dirac\u201d method).\n\n- **Eberhard Kirchberg and N. Christopher Phillips:** While not working on KK-theory per se, Kirchberg and Phillips used KK as the central invariant in their **classification of purely infinite simple nuclear C*-algebras** (now known as *Kirchberg algebras*). Kirchberg proved that if *A* and *B* are separable, nuclear, purely infinite simple C*-algebras (in the UCT class), then **KK-equivalence implies **-isomorphism**\u301034\u2020L34-L42\u3011. In other words, an invertible KK-class between two such algebras guarantees the algebras are **-isomorphic. Phillips extended this to show that if moreover their K-theory (K\u2080, K\u2081) and the class of the unit agree, then the algebras are isomorphic\u301034\u2020L36-L42\u3011. This classification theorem (published 2000, based on Kirchberg\u2019s 1994 announcements\u301034\u2020L34-L40\u3011) showcased KK\u2019s power: it provided a computable invariant (K-theory, since UCT implies KK(*A, B*) \u2245 Hom(K_*(A), K_*(B)) in this setting) that completely classifies a large class of C*-algebras. It was a triumph for the Elliott classification program and cemented KK (and the UCT) as indispensable in C*-algebra theory. Later classification results for stably finite algebras also rely on KK-theoretic *K*-groups plus additional invariants (like traces), but KK remains in the background ensuring the functoriality and naturality of those invariants.\n\n- **Georges Skandalis:** A collaborator of Kasparov, Skandalis advanced the theory of KK in the equivariant setting and in applications to groupoids and foliations. He introduced the notion of **KK-cycles for groupoids** and was involved in proofs of special cases of Baum\u2013Connes (e.g. for amenable groupoids). Skandalis is also known for counterexamples to a stronger form of the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture (with Higson and Lafforgue). He contributed many technical insights in KK-theory, including simplifying Kasparov\u2019s proofs and exploring the topology on KK-groups (Kasparov groups can be given a natural topology, as studied by BDF and Skandalis, useful in perturbation theory).\n\n- **Claude Schochet & Jonathan Rosenberg:** They formulated and proved the **UCT and K\u00fcnneth theorems** for KK-theory (1984\u201387), which are vital for computations\u301034\u2020L36-L42\u3011. The Rosenberg\u2013Schochet UCT provides a recipe to compute KK(*A, B*) in terms of Ext and Tor functors applied to the K-groups of *A* and *B*, whenever *A* belongs to the bootstrap class (the smallest class of nuclear separable C*-algebras containing \u2102 and closed under certain operations). This result connected KK-theory with algebraic topology tools and was essential in the classification program (since UCT had to be assumed for classification results like Kirchberg\u2013Phillips). It remains an open problem whether every nuclear C*-algebra satisfies the UCT (this is one of the major unsolved questions in the field today).\n\nMany other mathematicians have left their mark on KK-theory \u2013 for instance, **Paul Baum** and **Alain Connes** (Baum\u2013Connes conjecture formulation, noncommutative geometry motivations), **Gennadi Kasparov** (again, his later contributions such as the *\u03b3-element* for BC conjecture), **Vincent Lafforgue** (who developed *Banach KK-theory* to tackle Baum\u2013Connes for groups with property (T)), and more recently researchers like **Ralf Meyer** and **Ryszard Nest** (who studied the categorification and localization of KK, and used KK to derive theorems in assembly maps and dualities). The development of **unbounded KK-theory** by Baaj and Julg (giving a framework of unbounded operators for KK-cycles, analogous to using Dirac-type operators to represent classes) is another technical milestone, linking KK with *spectral triples* in a rigorous way. In essence, KK-theory has grown into a vast subject with contributions spanning index theory, classification, noncommutative geometry, and higher category theory.\n\n## KK-Theory and Noncommutative Motives in Algebraic Geometry  \nA fascinating direction in recent years is the interaction between KK-theory and **algebraic geometry**, particularly through the lens of *motives* and *motivic homotopy theory*. In classical algebraic geometry, **Grothendieck\u2019s motive** philosophy seeks a \u201cuniversal\u201d cohomology theory for varieties, where morphisms in the category of motives are given by algebraic correspondences (cycles on the product of varieties). Noncommutative geometry asks: is there an analogous category of \u201cnoncommutative motives\u201d where objects are (derived) noncommutative spaces (like DG-categories or C*-algebras) and morphisms are given by some kind of correspondences? It turns out that **KK-theory provides exactly such a correspondence category for noncommutative spaces**\u301022\u2020L147-L154\u3011. \n\nIn the noncommutative world, an \u201calgebraic correspondence\u201d between two spaces (say, two C*-algebras *A* and *B*) can be implemented by an *A\u2013B bimodule* \u2013 essentially a Kasparov (A, B)-module. Indeed, in Connes\u2019 viewpoint, a KK-class *\u03b1* \u2208 KK(*A, B*) is like a generalized correspondence (or \u201cnoncommutative algebraic cycle\u201d) from *A* to *B*. In fact, one can recover the classical case: if *X* and *Y* are smooth projective varieties, correspondences (cycles in *X \u00d7 Y*) give rise to relationships in their motives; analogously, if *A = C(X)* and *B = C(Y)*, a KK-class in KK(C(X), C(Y)) can be thought of as a \u201cnoncommutative correspondence\u201d\u301016\u2020L9-L17\u3011\u301022\u2020L147-L154\u3011. In zero-dimensional cases (like Artin motives which are finite direct sums of points), correspondences are literally given by bimodules (finite-dimensional vector spaces with actions), which is in line with KK-theory\u2019s notion that idempotents in *A* give projections in KK(*A, A*) serving as \u201csub-correspondences\u201d. \n\nResearchers such as Alain Connes, Caterina Consani, Matilde Marcolli, and others have proposed frameworks for **noncommutative motives**, where one considers an enlarged category containing both commutative and noncommutative spaces and uses correspondences (KK-classes or bimodules) as morphisms\u301022\u2020L147-L154\u3011. The idea is that this could accommodate *singular* spaces or quotient spaces that do not have classical varieties counterparts. For example, Consani\u2013Marcolli\u2019s theory of **endomotives** uses algebraic and analytic data from noncommutative algebras (like the Bost\u2013Connes system) and their correspondences to construct motivic Galois groups and explain phenomena in number theory\u301018\u2020L73-L82\u3011\u301018\u2020L87-L96\u3011. In that work, **equivariant KK-theory** classes naturally appear as correspondences encoding algebraic cycles in a noncommutative setting\u301022\u2020L147-L154\u3011. One explicit statement is: *\u201cIn noncommutative geometry, algebraic cycles are naturally replaced by bimodules, or by classes in equivariant KK-theory.\u201d*\u301022\u2020L147-L154\u3011. This indicates that to go from classical motives (where a cycle on X\u00d7Y gives a map from motive(X) to motive(Y)) to noncommutative motives, one replaces the cycle with a KK-class in KK^G(*A, B*) (where *A, B* correspond to noncommutative analogs of X, Y, and G accounts for symmetries). The **nLab** formulates this succinctly: *\u201cKK-theory (and E-theory) can be seen as an analogue in noncommutative topology of the category of motives in algebraic geometry.\u201d*\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011. This analogy is powerful: it suggests that many constructions from algebraic geometry (motivic cohomology, etc.) have counterparts in KK-theory. For instance, the **invariant factors** in algebraic K-theory or cyclic homology (like the Bloch\u2013Lichtenbaum conjectures, etc.) might be approachable via KK-categorical methods. Also, **motivic homotopy theory** (\u00e0 la Morel\u2013Voevodsky, which deals with spaces of the form Spec of rings) has inspired new approaches to *algebraic KK-theory* (for DG-categories or ring spectra) that mirror Kasparov\u2019s KK.\n\nIn practical terms, there have been efforts to construct a **stable \u221e-category** whose homotopy category is KK. Very recently, Ulrich Bunke (2024) gave a homotopy-theoretic construction of KK and E-theory via a sequence of model category localizations, producing a stable \u221e-category KK that represents Kasparov\u2019s theory in a way amenable to higher-categorical tools\u301027\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Such a formulation makes KK-theory more directly comparable to other stable homotopy categories (like the motivic stable homotopy category). By doing so, one can attempt to port concepts like *spectra, enrichment, t-structures* from algebraic topology into KK. There is also algebraic work by G. Tabuada and others on **algebraic KK-theory** for DG-categories, aiming to create a universal additive invariant of noncommutative spaces (this is sometimes called *noncommutative motive theory* in the algebraic sense). These approaches have led to the notion that KK-theory for C*-algebras plays a role analogous to *Hom groups in a category of noncommutative motives*, while algebraic KK-theory (for DG-categories over fields) is analogous to Voevodsky\u2019s motives for schemes\u301016\u2020L29-L37\u3011. \n\nFor algebraic geometers, one exciting development is the finding that **KK-theory aligns with motivic cohomology in certain regimes**. For example, in cases where a C*-algebra has an underlying algebraic structure (like coming from a variety or a group algebra), the KK-groups (after tensoring with \u211a or under certain filtrations) may correspond to motivic Ext groups or to *Chow groups*. There is ongoing research into formalizing this, and some partial results connect **KK-theory with the Lurie\u2019s stable \u221e-categorical approach** to motives. The slogan could be: *KK-theory is to noncommutative spaces what Chow motives are to varieties.* Both provide a way to break complicated spaces into simpler pieces via correspondences, and both have rich internal structures (tensor products, gradings, etc.). \n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that these ideas are not just philosophical \u2013 they have concrete payoffs. For instance, in number theory, Connes and Consani have used KK-theoretic correspondences (in the form of bimodules between certain algebras) to build spectral realizations of zeros of L-functions\u301018\u2020L73-L82\u3011\u301018\u2020L85-L94\u3011. The **Bost\u2013Connes system** (an important C*-dynamical system related to the Riemann zeta) was shown to fit naturally into a picture of *Artin motives vs. noncommutative motives*, with KK-correspondences explaining the appearance of Galois groups and L-function zeros\u301018\u2020L75-L84\u3011\u301018\u2020L95-L103\u3011. This hints that KK-theory might eventually serve as a bridge between operator algebras and deep problems in arithmetic geometry.\n\n## Present-Day Applications and Active Research  \nIn the present day, KK-theory continues to be a vibrant area of research, with multiple fronts of development:\n\n- **C*-Algebra Classification:** Even after the monumental classification results of the 1990s\u20132000s, KK-theory remains central. The *Elliott classification program* now largely focuses on classes of algebras satisfying the UCT. A key open question is the **UCT problem**: does every separable nuclear C*-algebra satisfy the UCT (i.e. have KK computable from K-theory)? This is a pure KK-theoretic property. Recent partial progress (or potential counterexamples) on the UCT inevitably involve KK techniques. Moreover, refinements of classification (for example, classifying *flow equivalence of shifts of finite type* via KK, or classifying *actions of groups on C*-algebras up to KK*) are active topics\u301033\u2020L1-L9\u3011. There is ongoing work on *equivariant KK-theory* classification: classifying not just algebras but **dynamical systems (A, G-actions)** up to KK^G-equivalence\u301033\u2020L1-L9\u3011. This has applications in understanding quantum symmetries and crossed product algebras.\n\n- **Baum\u2013Connes and Beyond:** The Baum\u2013Connes conjecture is still open for some significant classes of groups (e.g. lattices in certain Lie groups, some non-amenable discrete groups). Researchers are actively exploring strengthenings or variations of KK-theory to attack these cases. Vincent Lafforgue\u2019s **Banach KK-theory** (which replaces C*-algebras with Banach algebras to circumvent property (T) issues) was one approach that yielded new results for certain groups (like those with property (T) but satisfying other analytic properties). *Controlled KK-theory* and *coarse KK-theory* are being developed to tackle the *coarse Baum\u2013Connes conjecture* (assembly maps for metric spaces or groupoids) and relate to the Novikov conjecture for broader contexts. Even the counterexamples by Higson\u2013Lafforgue\u2013Skandalis have led to refined conjectures (e.g. Baum\u2013Connes without coefficients might still hold for all groups) \u2013 verifying these requires delicate KK computations in equivariant settings. Another line of work involves **KK-theory for quantum groups** or groupoids, extending the assembly conjecture to quantum symmetry realms.\n\n- **New Invariants and Computations:** A lot of current effort goes into computing KK-groups for specific pairs of algebras. Thanks to UCT, this often reduces to computing K-theory and K-homology, but when UCT fails or for equivariant KK, one needs other tools. The development of *spectral sequences* and *filtration converging to KK* is one approach. For instance, the Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence has an analog in KK that can sometimes be leveraged. **Computational KK-theory** is used in areas like topological phases of matter (condensed matter physics) \u2013 where one computes KK (or E-theory) between certain C*-algebras to classify phases or defects. The classification of *topological insulators* can be formulated in KK-theoretic terms (using real KK for algebras with time-reversal symmetries, etc.). \n\n- **Unbounded KK and Index Theory:** There is ongoing refinement of the correspondence between unbounded operators (spectral triples) and KK-classes. The Baaj\u2013Julg theorem guarantees any KK-class can be represented by an unbounded cycle under some conditions, but making this constructive and functorial is an area of research. This is important in index theory on noncompact spaces or with additional structures (e.g. a KK-class in KKG might be represented by a G-equivariant Dirac-type operator; understanding this leads to explicit index formulas). Unbounded KK theory also feeds back into physics, as spectral triples are related to physical Dirac operators.\n\n- **Higher Categories and Homotopy:** As mentioned, a recent thrust is bringing **\u221e-categorical and homotopy theoretic methods** to KK. Viewing KK as a *spectrum-valued* functor or embedding it into a model category allows one to import powerful tools from algebraic topology (like stable homotopy invariants, generalized cohomology theories beyond K-theory, etc.). For example, one can define *KK-spectra* for each algebra, and then study mappings between these spectra. The work of Bunke (2024) provides such a model\u301027\u2020L49-L57\u3011. This might eventually help in comparing KK with other homology theories more directly or in leveraging computational tools like Steenrod operations (if any analog exists) in operator algebra K-theory. Additionally, the interplay with **motivic homotopy** is being actively explored: some researchers try to relate *algebraic KK-theory of DG-categories* (developed by Corti\u00f1as, Thom, etc.) with *Morel\u2013Voevodsky\u2019s A\u00b9-homotopy* in order to find common patterns or even common calculations.\n\n- **Noncommutative Motives and K-Theory of Ring Spectra:** There is cross-pollination between KK-theorists and algebraic geometers in the study of invariants of categories. The concept of *homological mirror symmetry*, for instance, involves equivalences between derived categories which could be detected by KK-like invariants. People like Valerio Toledano Laredo and others have asked if certain equivalences of KK-classes correspond to geometric dualities. Meanwhile, in pure algebraic K-theory, analogues of KK (like Weibel\u2019s homotopy K-theory KH or bivariant motivic cohomology) are being studied; often these reduce to classical KK when tensored with \u211a.\n\n- **Other Areas:** KK-theory finds use in **operator theory** (e.g. classifying essentially normal operators up to shifts, solving multivariate extension problems), in **index theory on singular spaces** (via groupoid KK-theory, one can treat singular foliations or stratified spaces by replacing them with groupoid C*-algebras and using KK to define and compute indices), and in **topological quantum field theory** (certain field theories yield invariants in K-theory that are naturally compositional and hence expressible in KK terms).  \n\nIn closing, KK-theory has proven to be a remarkably **versatile and unifying framework**. Its abstract categorical nature (with Kasparov products as composition) allows it to **absorb ideas from algebraic topology, homological algebra, and operator theory**, while its concrete analytic model (Hilbert modules and Fredholm operators) keeps it connected to analysis and geometry. It has solved problems that were once deemed intractable (like large cases of Novikov and Baum\u2013Connes conjectures), and it continues to illuminate new paths in mathematics. As our understanding deepens, KK-theory stands as a central pillar of noncommutative geometry \u2013 a testament to Kasparov\u2019s insight in inventing a theory \u201cwith two Ks\u201d that has far more than twice the power of one.  \n\n**Sources:** Key sources include Kasparov\u2019s original papers and subsequent expositions and surveys. For instance, Wikipedia\u2019s entry on KK-theory provides a high-level summary\u30101\u2020L126-L136\u3011\u30101\u2020L131-L139\u3011. The slides by Skandalis\u30106\u2020L38-L46\u3011 give historical motivation from BDF\u2019s work. Kasparov\u2019s 1988 paper (Invent. Math.) is referenced for the Novikov application\u301028\u2020L19-L22\u3011. Higson\u2019s characterization of KK is documented in the literature\u301026\u2020L34-L42\u3011. The universal property and category-theoretic viewpoint are discussed in Meyer\u2013Nest\u2019s notes\u301013\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u301013\u2020L219-L227\u3011 and Burgstaller\u2019s remarks\u301026\u2020L34-L42\u3011. Connections to cyclic homology and the bivariant Chern character are described in Cuntz\u2013Quillen\u2019s work\u301015\u2020L113-L118\u3011 and others\u301015\u2020L96-L104\u3011. The role of KK in classification is exemplified by Phillips\u2019 theorem\u301034\u2020L34-L42\u3011. Noncommutative motives are discussed in Consani\u2013Marcolli\u2019s paper\u301022\u2020L147-L154\u3011 and noted on nLab\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011. The Baum\u2013Connes conjecture and KK\u2019s role are elucidated in various sources\u301032\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u301030\u2020L5-L8\u3011.

From the very beginning, generalizations to group actions have played an important role in the development of the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture.","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":32,"cited_message_id":"debf3984-9a2d-4421-a605-7e831ce35263","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":15,"end_line_num":23,"connector_source":null},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":32209,"end_ix":32222,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"KK-theory - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KK-theory#:~:text=KK,or%20incorporating%20%2062%20group","text":"KK-theory was followed by a series of similar bifunctor constructions such as the E-theory and the bivariant periodic cyclic theory , most of them having more  61 flavors, or concerning another class of algebras rather than that of the separable C*-algebras, or incorporating  62 group","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":1,"cited_message_id":"c75bc855-2328-4cc4-b282-fdd98cc9bf7e","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":140,"end_line_num":144,"connector_source":null},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":33572,"end_ix":33584,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Some remarks in C^*- and K-theory","url":"https://files.ele-math.com/articles/oam-15-48.pdf#:~:text=,91%20%281%29%3A%20147%E2%80%93","text":"[10] N.

Of course the general Baum\u2013 Connes conjecture is broader still, applying as it does to every (second countable) locally compact groupoid, or even, in the case of the conjecture \u2018with coefficients\u2019, to every action of a such a groupoid on a C\u2217-algebra.","attribution":"nigel.higson.ca","icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"\u301032\u2020L15-L23\u3011","start_idx":25272,"end_idx":25284,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"hi-la-sk.dvi","url":"https://nigel.higson.ca/uploads/1/2/1/4/121496570/higson_lafforgue_skandalis_-_2002_-_counterexamples_to_the_baum-connes_conjecture.pdf#:~:text=for%20the%20L,development%20of%20the%20Baum%E2%80%93Connes%20conjecture","pub_date":null,"snippet":"for the L-theory of the group ring Z[G].
