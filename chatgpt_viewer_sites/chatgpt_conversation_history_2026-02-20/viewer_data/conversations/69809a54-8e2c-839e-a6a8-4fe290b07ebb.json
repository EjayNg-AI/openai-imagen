Just like the roots of a tree, it will be \r\nat the bottom. So the \u201cn\u201d becomes the \u201croots\u201d of the power and it \r\nbecomes the bottom (denominator) of the power ( )\r\n\u0c2d\r\n\u0cd9. \r\nExample 1: \u03be\u0754 \u0c31 = \u0754\r\n\u0c2d\r\n\u0c31 \r\nExample 2: \u03be\u0754 \u0c2f \u0b38 = (\u0754\u0b38)\r\n\u0c2d\r\n\u0754 = \u0c2f\r\n\u0c30\r\n\u0c2f","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 16>","Unauthorized copying and distribution prohibited.
