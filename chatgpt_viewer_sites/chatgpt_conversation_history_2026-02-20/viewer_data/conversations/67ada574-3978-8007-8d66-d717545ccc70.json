Today, the company is attempting to fully transition into a for-profit (specifically a Public Benefit Corporation) to attract massive investments needed for advanced AI development\u301035\u2020L165-L174\u3011. OpenAI\u2019s leaders have publicly stressed why this shift is critical: *\u201cWe once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness,\u201d* the company explained in late 2024\u301035\u2020L201-L209\u3011. In short, they argue that converting to a for-profit structure is necessary to **secure the capital required to develop the best AI models**\u30101\u2020L185-L192\u3011. \n\nThis report analyzes the potential fallout if OpenAI **does not** make that for-profit transition. It examines impacts on key business partnerships (notably with Microsoft and SoftBank), the fate of the reported **$500\u202fbillion \u201cStargate\u201d AI infrastructure project**, and broader business implications. It also evaluates how staying non-profit could affect OpenAI\u2019s funding, growth, and its ability to build frontier AI systems amid fierce competition from rivals like Google DeepMind and Anthropic. Public statements from OpenAI\u2019s leadership (e.g. CEO Sam Altman) are incorporated to highlight the importance they place on this transition.\n\n## Impact on Business Partnerships  \n\n### Microsoft Partnership  \n**Microsoft** has been OpenAI\u2019s closest corporate partner and investor since 2019, when OpenAI created its for-profit entity to accept a $1\u202fbillion investment from Microsoft\u301010\u2020L193-L200\u3011. Microsoft has since invested **over $13\u202fbillion** (including cash and Azure cloud credits) into OpenAI, obtaining an exclusive cloud provider deal and a significant profit-sharing stake in the venture\u301039\u2020L142-L150\u3011. This partnership has been mutually beneficial: OpenAI gets access to Microsoft\u2019s massive cloud infrastructure and funding, and Microsoft integrates OpenAI\u2019s AI (like ChatGPT) into its products and gains an edge in AI services. Notably, Microsoft\u2019s investment was predicated on OpenAI\u2019s ability to offer equity returns; reports indicate Microsoft secured rights to a **49% stake or profit share** after a certain return threshold\u301027\u2020L1-L8\u3011\u301027\u2020L21-L28\u3011. This underscores that Microsoft treated OpenAI as a for-profit investment from the start.\n\nIf OpenAI fails to **transition fully to a for-profit structure**, it could strain this partnership. Without a conventional equity structure, OpenAI would find it hard to offer Microsoft additional ownership or financial returns in exchange for further investment. Future funding from Microsoft might dry up, or at least **not expand beyond the committed amounts**, because Microsoft (like any investor) expects a return on its multi-billion financing. In fact, OpenAI\u2019s latest $6.6\u202fbillion funding round (late 2024) was *contingent* on plans to remove profit caps and restructure the company\u301035\u2020L185-L194\u3011. If those plans fall through, OpenAI would have to renegotiate with investors at a likely **lower valuation**\u301024\u2020L190-L198\u3011, making the deal less attractive for backers like Microsoft. This suggests Microsoft\u2019s continued support hinges on OpenAI\u2019s ability to operate \u201clike a typical startup\u201d with regular profit potential\u301010\u2020L229-L237\u3011.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s own stance hints that it will not indefinitely prop up OpenAI if the company\u2019s growth falters. In 2024, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly downplayed reliance on OpenAI, saying *\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if OpenAI disappeared tomorrow. We have the data, IP rights, and all the capability.\u201d*\u301039\u2020L142-L150\u3011. Such a statement indicates that Microsoft has secured enough licenses and rights from OpenAI\u2019s technology to carry on, and it is prepared to pivot if needed. **Consequences of no for-profit transition** could include Microsoft focusing its AI investments elsewhere \u2013 indeed, Microsoft has shown interest in other AI startups like Anthropic\u301039\u2020L169-L173\u3011. If OpenAI\u2019s growth is constrained by lack of capital, Microsoft might channel more resources to internal AI projects or competitors that *do* have the funding to push ahead. In summary, not transitioning could mean **losing Microsoft\u2019s future investment and possibly strategic focus**, weakening a partnership that has been central to OpenAI\u2019s success so far.\n\n### SoftBank Partnership and the $500\u202fBillion \u201cStargate\u201d Project  \nIn late 2024, **SoftBank** emerged as a prospective major partner, planning an unprecedented investment in OpenAI. Reports indicate SoftBank is prepared to invest on the order of **$40\u202fbillion** into OpenAI (a deal that would roughly double OpenAI\u2019s valuation to ~$300\u202fbillion)\u30106\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u30106\u2020L116-L124\u3011. This investment would **surpass Microsoft\u2019s stake**, making SoftBank potentially OpenAI\u2019s largest backer\u301039\u2020L124-L132\u3011. Crucially, these funds are tied to a visionary undertaking known as the \u201c**Stargate Project**\u201d \u2013 a plan announced in early 2025 to spend up to **$500\u202fbillion** building cutting-edge AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years\u30104\u2020L97-L105\u3011. Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and investor MGX, with SoftBank\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son as chairman, aiming to construct state-of-the-art data centers for OpenAI\u2019s AI models\u30104\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u30104\u2020L121-L129\u3011. The first phase involves an immediate $100\u202fbillion deployment to begin building massive data centers (e.g. in Texas) to support OpenAI\u2019s computing needs\u30104\u2020L101-L109\u3011\u30104\u2020L121-L129\u3011. This project has been touted as a way to **secure American leadership in AI**, create jobs, and give OpenAI unparalleled infrastructure for developing future models\u30104\u2020L111-L119\u3011. \n\nHowever, SoftBank\u2019s commitment is explicitly conditional on OpenAI\u2019s **corporate restructuring toward a for-profit model**. Investment documents for the $40\u202fbillion deal **require OpenAI to eliminate its non-profit board\u2019s control** and transition into a more typical for-profit governance structure\u301039\u2020L127-L135\u3011. In fact, **SoftBank will not deliver the funds unless OpenAI \u201cmore fully\u201d becomes a for-profit entity**\u301039\u2020L129-L137\u3011. If OpenAI fails to make this transition, the **consequence would likely be the collapse of the SoftBank deal and the Stargate project**. Without a for-profit structure, OpenAI would forfeit the ~$40\u202fbillion infusion, and with it the ability to spend $100+ billion on new AI supercomputing facilities. The ambitious $500\u202fbillion infrastructure plan would be in jeopardy or need significant downsizing. \n\nThe ripple effects of losing SoftBank\u2019s partnership would be severe. First, OpenAI would lose the chance to dramatically expand its computing capacity independent of Microsoft\u2019s Azure. The Stargate project was positioned as a way for OpenAI to **outspend even Microsoft in AI infrastructure in the coming years**\u30104\u2020L85-L92\u3011, reducing sole reliance on Microsoft\u2019s cloud. Without SoftBank\u2019s funding, OpenAI might remain dependent on Microsoft\u2019s cloud resources, potentially limiting flexibility and bargaining power. Second, SoftBank could redirect its massive capital to OpenAI\u2019s competitors. SoftBank\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son is a fervent believer in AI\u2019s future (he often speaks of a coming AI *\u201csingularity\u201d*) and has a track record of bold tech investments\u30106\u2020L89-L98\u3011. If SoftBank cannot invest in OpenAI due to structural issues, it might invest those billions into rival AI ventures or its own projects. That would **strengthen competitors** and leave OpenAI at a relative disadvantage. Finally, backing out of a high-profile project like Stargate \u2013 which was announced at the White House with political support\u30101\u2020L177-L184\u3011\u30104\u2020L111-L119\u3011 \u2013 could damage OpenAI\u2019s reputation and stakeholder trust. In short, **not transitioning to for-profit could cost OpenAI a transformational partnership**, along with $40\u202fbillion in funding and a half-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan central to its future. \n\n## Implications for Funding and Revenue Generation  \n\n### Access to Capital and Investor Funding  \nThe most immediate consequence of staying as a non-profit (or retaining a restrictive capped-profit model) is the **loss of access to massive investor capital**. Developing frontier AI is extremely expensive \u2013 far beyond what philanthropic donations or traditional grants can cover. OpenAI itself acknowledged in 2019 that it would need to invest **\u201cbillions of dollars\u201d** in the coming years on cloud compute and talent to pursue its mission\u301023\u2020L130-L138\u3011. By 2023\u20132024, that estimate ballooned dramatically: OpenAI\u2019s leadership admitted they *\u201chad no idea [earlier] we would need such a crazy amount of capital\u201d* to achieve artificial general intelligence\u301038\u2020L131-L139\u3011. In late 2024, OpenAI stated plainly that the **pursuit of advanced AI now requires capital on the order of \u201chundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d given that major tech companies are investing at that scale**\u301035\u2020L203-L211\u3011. This is why OpenAI has been courting large investors and why it says it must remove structural hurdles to raising money. \n\nIf OpenAI does **not transition to a for-profit structure**, it will struggle to raise the money needed to stay at the cutting edge. Investors of the size OpenAI needs (Big Tech companies, venture firms, sovereign funds, etc.) generally insist on equity stakes and uncapped returns for such risky, long-term bets. Remaining a non-profit would force OpenAI to rely on limited funding sources: perhaps government grants, donations, or revenue reinvestment. Those sources are inadequate for multi-billion-dollar AI projects. OpenAI\u2019s recent $6.6\u202fbillion round \u2013 valuing it at $150+ billion \u2013 was contingent on moving toward a traditional equity model\u301035\u2020L185-L194\u3011. Without that move, **investors could pull out or demand a much lower valuation**\u301024\u2020L190-L198\u3011, meaning less money for OpenAI\u2019s coffers. We have already seen that OpenAI\u2019s hybrid \u201ccapped-profit\u201d model, which limits investor returns, is reaching its limits; the company used it to raise over $10\u202fbillion (mostly from Microsoft) in recent years\u301025\u2020L1-L4\u3011, but now new investors are balking at caps on profit. Simply put, not transitioning would likely **choke off the influx of capital**, leaving OpenAI with perhaps only Microsoft\u2019s existing funds and its own revenue to rely on.\n\nSuch a funding shortfall would quickly impact OpenAI\u2019s finances and operations. While OpenAI has begun to generate significant revenue (projected around $11\u202fbillion in 2025, up from ~$4\u202fbillion in 2024), it is **not yet profitable** and operates at a heavy loss\u301039\u2020L163-L171\u3011. In 2024, OpenAI reportedly spent so aggressively on R&D and infrastructure that it incurred a **$5\u202fbillion loss**\u301039\u2020L165-L173\u3011. These losses reflect the company\u2019s strategy of scaling up AI capabilities ahead of revenue, subsidized by investor cash. If that external funding dries up, OpenAI would be forced to **slash its spending or find money elsewhere**. It might have to slow down research, pause expensive training runs, or cut back on cloud compute usage \u2013 all of which directly hurt its ability to innovate. Alternatively, OpenAI could try to fund itself through revenue alone, but that may require dramatically increasing prices for its products or finding new monetization streams overnight, which could drive away users or stunt adoption.\n\n### Revenue Growth and Technology Acquisition  \nRemaining a non-profit could also indirectly hamper **revenue growth** and **technology acquisition** opportunities. As a for-profit startup, OpenAI has been able to commercialize its technology rapidly \u2013 launching paid products like ChatGPT Plus, enterprise APIs, and licensing deals. These moves have been guided by a need to generate returns for stakeholders and sustain operations. If OpenAI were purely mission-driven without profit motives, it might face pressure to open-source more of its work or limit commercialization, which could reduce revenue potential. Moreover, a non-profit OpenAI might find it **more difficult to attract top talent**, since it could not offer stock options or the promise of a lucrative IPO. (OpenAI\u2019s current structure does allow capped stock grants, but an uncapped for-profit is even more enticing for employees.) The ability to **recruit and retain AI researchers and engineers** is partly a financial competition \u2013 competitors like Google, Meta, and startups offer rich compensation packages. Without competitive equity upside, OpenAI could lose key personnel to rivals, weakening its innovation engine.\n\nAnother consideration is OpenAI\u2019s ability to **acquire new technology or companies**. In the fast-moving AI industry, acquisitions and investments in promising startups are a way to stay ahead. A recent example is OpenAI\u2019s acquisition of Global Illumination (a small AI design studio) in 2023, which bolstered its product design capabilities. If OpenAI lacks access to large pools of capital, it may miss out on acquiring strategic technologies. Non-profits generally do not engage in aggressive M&A, and even OpenAI\u2019s hybrid model might struggle to justify billion-dollar acquisitions without investor backing. In contrast, competitors have deep pockets for acquisitions \u2013 for instance, Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 and has invested heavily in AI chip companies. **Not transitioning to for-profit could leave OpenAI without the means to purchase or invest in cutting-edge tech**, such as specialized AI hardware or breakthrough startups. This could slow its integration of new capabilities that are necessary to improve its AI models or diversify its offerings. \n\nIn summary, failing to transition would constrain OpenAI\u2019s financial flexibility: it would have limited paths to raise large sums, difficulty justifying big expenditures or acquisitions, and potentially a slower revenue growth trajectory. Over time, these factors would compound, making OpenAI a smaller player financially than it aims to be. OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman has emphasized that embracing a for-profit structure (with the proper mission safeguards) is what enables the company to \u201c*rapidly increase our investments in compute and talent*\u201d while still focusing on its mission\u301023\u2020L118-L126\u3011\u301023\u2020L130-L139\u3011. Without that ability to invest at will, OpenAI\u2019s long-term ambitions could be stifled.\n\n## Development of Frontier AI Models and Competitive Pressures  \n\nA core risk of insufficient funding and partnership support is the impact on OpenAI\u2019s **ability to develop and scale frontier AI models**. Cutting-edge AI like GPT-4 and beyond (GPT-5, etc.) requires enormous computational resources, data, and expert researchers \u2013 all of which are expensive. OpenAI has been in a race with other AI labs to build the most advanced models. If OpenAI cannot secure the billions in capital it anticipates needing, it may **fall behind in this race** due to smaller or delayed model improvements. \n\nCompetitive pressure in AI is intense, with several well-funded entities vying for leadership:\n\n- **Google DeepMind:** Backed by the resources of Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), DeepMind and Google\u2019s AI division have virtually unlimited funding from a trillion-dollar company. DeepMind\u2019s CEO Demis Hassabis indicated in 2024 that **Google\u2019s investment in AI will exceed $100\u202fbillion** and that Google already has more computing power dedicated to AI than any competitor\u301041\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301041\u2020L88-L96\u3011. DeepMind is developing its next-generation model (Google\u2019s *Gemini*) to compete with or surpass GPT-4. If OpenAI\u2019s progress stalls for lack of compute or money, **Google\u2019s AI could overtake it** simply by leveraging superior infrastructure and talent funded by Alphabet\u2019s deep coffers. Indeed, Hassabis noted that they joined Google precisely because achieving AGI would require \u201ca lot of compute\u201d and Google had the most computers\u301041\u2020L95-L103\u3011 \u2013 a direct reminder that the race favors those who can spend. OpenAI, without new funding, would be hard-pressed to match the scale of Google\u2019s AI spending and might see its models lag in capability or deployment.\n\n- **Anthropic:** Anthropic is a rival AI startup formed by ex-OpenAI researchers, and it has structured itself as a for-profit Public Benefit Corporation. It has been extremely successful in raising capital: in 2023, Amazon announced a **$4\u202fbillion investment in Anthropic** for minority ownership and to integrate Anthropic\u2019s models into AWS\u301035\u2020L217-L224\u3011. Google had earlier invested $300\u202fmillion in Anthropic in 2022, and other investors have contributed, giving Anthropic a war chest to develop its \u201cClaude\u201d AI models. Anthropic\u2019s substantial funding (and access to cloud compute via Amazon and Google) means it is directly competing with OpenAI on large-model training. If OpenAI could not raise a similar scale of capital due to a restrictive structure, **Anthropic could gain an edge** by training larger or more numerous models and poaching customers who need reliable AI services. Notably, Anthropic\u2019s structure is already the kind OpenAI is now seeking (a for-profit with a public-benefit mission), which enables it to tap conventional investment easily. \n\n- **Emerging Competitors (Meta, xAI, others):** Other players add to the competitive pressure. Meta (Facebook) is open-sourcing powerful large language models (e.g. Llama 2) and investing heavily in AI research, albeit with a different approach (making models freely available to spur innovation). Elon Musk\u2019s new AI venture **xAI** raised around **$6\u202fbillion in funding by late 2024**\u301035\u2020L217-L224\u3011, and aims to compete with OpenAI\u2019s products. Additionally, Chinese tech giants and startups are pouring resources into AI (for example, a Chinese model called DeepSeek was noted as a rival effort\u301039\u2020L169-L173\u3011). All these competitors have access to large amounts of capital and are not constrained by non-profit structures. \n\nGiven this landscape, if OpenAI remained as a non-profit entity without the influx of tens of billions of dollars, its **ability to develop state-of-the-art models could be severely hampered**. Training the next breakthrough model (e.g., **GPT-5**) is expected to require substantially more compute than GPT-4 did. Sam Altman has hinted that GPT-5 is envisioned to be an extraordinary leap, *\u201ca similar leap over GPT-4 as that model was over GPT-3,\u201d* which implies a commensurate increase in research and compute effort\u301039\u2020L162-L170\u3011. Without new funding, OpenAI might have to postpone or scale down GPT-5\u2019s development. This delay would not only be a scientific setback but also a business one, as competitors might introduce superior models first. For instance, if Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude-next outperforms OpenAI\u2019s offerings, OpenAI could lose users and contracts to these rivals.\n\nMoreover, lacking funds could impact **OpenAI\u2019s capacity to scale infrastructure and iterate quickly**. Modern AI development is as much an engineering challenge as a theoretical one \u2013 it requires building huge GPU (or TPU) clusters, optimizing data pipelines, and tuning models through expensive trial-and-error. The planned $500\u202fbillion Stargate infrastructure was meant to give OpenAI a long-term advantage in this area\u30104\u2020L101-L105\u3011. If that falls through, OpenAI would have comparatively limited infrastructure, potentially leading to slower experiment cycles or reliance on rented cloud servers at high cost. Competitors with dedicated infrastructure (Google\u2019s datacenters, Amazon for Anthropic, etc.) could achieve better efficiency or try riskier, compute-intensive approaches that a resource-constrained OpenAI couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nIn addition, OpenAI\u2019s mission includes **safety and alignment research** for AI, which is another resource-intensive endeavor. A reduction in funding might force OpenAI to choose between pushing model performance and ensuring model safety. The company dissolved one of its AI safety teams in 2023 (the Superalignment team) amid resource reallocation\u301010\u2020L229-L237\u3011. A cash crunch could further sideline long-term safety research, which in turn might erode trust among customers and regulators who expect OpenAI to be a leader in responsible AI. Meanwhile, well-funded labs can invest in safety concurrently with capability. \n\nUltimately, the competitive consequence of not transitioning to for-profit is that OpenAI could **lose its leadership in AI**. As one analyst put it, removing investment constraints is the *\u201ccritical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising\u201d* and stay ahead in the costly AI race\u301035\u2020L225-L230\u3011. OpenAI\u2019s own statement underscores this, noting that **major tech companies are investing hundreds of billions in AI**, illustrating *\u201cwhat it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\u201d*\u301035\u2020L203-L211\u3011 If OpenAI cannot marshal comparable resources due to a self-imposed structural limitation, it risks being outspent and outpaced. In the fast-evolving AI field, a year or two of slowed progress can permanently set a company back relative to competitors. \n\n## OpenAI Leadership\u2019s View on the Transition  \nOpenAI\u2019s leadership has been vocal about the importance of transitioning to a for-profit structure (with appropriate safeguards) to achieve the organization\u2019s overarching mission of AGI. CEO **Sam Altman** and President/Co-founder **Greg Brockman** have consistently argued that unprecedented funding is needed to build safe AGI, and that **the non-profit model could not support that scale**. In an internal timeline shared during legal disputes, OpenAI revealed that as early as *2017* they realized **\u201cwe would need billions of dollars for the compute to build AGI\u201d**, leading to the decision that \u201ca for-profit was the next step for OpenAI to advance the mission\u201d\u301022\u2020L469-L477\u3011. Altman has pointed out that even Elon Musk (a co-founder turned critic) initially *supported* raising investment for OpenAI and pushed the team to secure \u201cbillions per year\u201d in funding, recognizing the necessity of substantial capital\u301022\u2020L481-L488\u3011. These insights show that the leadership\u2019s pivot to a profit-seeking model was not about abandoning the mission, but rather about **ensuring the mission could be funded at the required magnitude**.\n\nIn public statements, Sam Altman has framed the transition as a means to an end: *\u201cOur mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization,\u201d* he wrote, *\u201cbut\u2026 [you] can\u2019t sue your way to AGI\u2026 [Musk] should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.\u201d*\u301020\u2020L458-L464\u3011. This comment was in response to lawsuits attempting to block OpenAI\u2019s for-profit evolution, and it underlines Altman\u2019s belief that **market competition and investment are the paths to achieving safe AGI**, not clinging to the original non-profit framework. Furthermore, in late 2024 when outlining the new corporate structure, OpenAI reiterated that the non-profit entity will remain *\u201ccore to our mission\u201d* but that the for-profit *\u201cwill run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business\u201d* \u2014 a restructuring deemed critical to align with how rivals like Anthropic operate and to keep raising funds\u301035\u2020L177-L185\u3011\u301035\u2020L217-L224\u3011. \n\nAltman has been candid that **OpenAI \u201ccannot be a normal company\u201d** given its objectives\u301038\u2020L159-L167\u3011, yet paradoxically it needs to behave like a business to gather resources on a normal company scale. In a blog post, he reflected on the turbulent growth of OpenAI, noting *\u201cwe had no idea we would need such a crazy amount of capital... new things we have to go build now... there will be new things in the future we can barely imagine\u201d*\u301038\u2020L131-L139\u3011. This captures why the leadership views flexibility to raise capital as indispensable \u2014 the challenges on the road to AGI keep expanding, and only a well-funded organization can tackle them. In short, **OpenAI\u2019s leaders publicly emphasize that transitioning to a (capped) for-profit was and is crucial to fulfilling its mission**, by enabling access to the funds, talent, and partners necessary. Not doing so, in their view, would amount to tying one hand behind the company\u2019s back in the sprint toward safe AGI.\n\n## Conclusion  \nIf OpenAI were to remain a non-profit or otherwise shy away from a full for-profit transition, the **potential consequences would be far-reaching**. The company would risk **losing cornerstone partnerships** \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s future investment and close collaboration could wane, and SoftBank\u2019s promised mega-investment (and the entire $500\u202fbillion infrastructure initiative) would likely evaporate. OpenAI would find itself constrained in raising new funds, just as the AI development race demands an unprecedented scale of investment. A limited funding runway would force difficult trade-offs: slower R&D progress, reduced compute resources, and perhaps a pullback in ambitious projects like GPT-5 or global AI infrastructure. Competitors like Google DeepMind and Anthropic, unencumbered and flush with capital, would be poised to surpass OpenAI in technological capability and market share. \n\nIn essence, not transitioning to a for-profit structure could **stall OpenAI\u2019s momentum at the very moment AI advancement accelerates worldwide**. The company might survive on existing revenues and Microsoft\u2019s support, but its ability to **lead in \u201cfrontier AI\u201d development would diminish**. OpenAI\u2019s own public statements convey that this structural evolution is viewed as a matter of survival and impact: it is the **\u201ccritical step\u201d** needed to continue raising the resources to achieve its mission\u301035\u2020L225-L230\u3011. Failing to take that step could leave OpenAI a step behind in the global AI competition. As Sam Altman and his team recognize, ensuring AI *\u201cbenefits all of humanity\u201d* will require not just vision and ethics, but also the pragmatic capacity to marshal vast financial and technical resources\u30101\u2020L185-L192\u3011\u301035\u2020L203-L211\u3011. The for-profit transition is the bridge to those resources \u2013 without it, OpenAI\u2019s influence and ability to shape the future of AI could be severely curtailed. \n\n**Sources:** Public reports and statements on OpenAI\u2019s restructuring and partnerships\u30101\u2020L185-L192\u3011\u301035\u2020L201-L209\u3011\u301039\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301039\u2020L142-L150\u3011\u30104\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301024\u2020L190-L198\u3011\u301041\u2020L87-L95\u3011\u301035\u2020L217-L224\u3011, including commentary from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and industry analysts.

Recent Developments in Elon Musk's Bid to Acquire OpenAI**\n\n\ue203In early February 2025, Elon Musk, co-founder of OpenAI, initiated a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the organization, contingent upon halting its transition to a for-profit entity.\ue204 \ue203Musk's proposal was backed by several prominent venture capital firms.\ue204 \ue203He argued that OpenAI's shift towards profit undermines its original mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity.\ue204 \ue203In response, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, swiftly rejected the offer, suggesting that Musk's actions aim to hinder OpenAI's progress rather than foster healthy competition.\ue204 \ue203Altman emphasized that OpenAI's restructuring is essential to secure the capital necessary for advancing its AI models.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news14\ue202turn0news15\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203Subsequently, Musk proposed withdrawing his bid if OpenAI remains a nonprofit organization.\ue204 \ue203He also filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, Altman, and other key figures, seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the company's restructuring.\ue204 \ue203Musk contends that the move towards a for-profit model deviates from OpenAI's founding principles.\ue204 \ue203OpenAI countered by releasing emails from 2017, indicating that Musk had previously advocated for a for-profit structure and sought majority control.\ue204

Altman downplayed the dispute, announcing upcoming releases of GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models, while Musk's startup xAI plans to release an advanced version of its AI chatbot, Grok 3, which reportedly outperforms current models.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"barrons.com"}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue206","start_idx":2311,"end_idx":2312,"refs":["hidden"],"alt":null,"prompt_text":null,"type":"hidden","invalid":false},{"matched_text":"\ue200navlist\ue202Elon Musk's Bid to Acquire OpenAI Sparks Legal Battle\ue202turn0news14,turn0news15,turn0news16\ue201","start_idx":2314,"end_idx":2413,"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":14},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":15},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":16}],"alt":"- [nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/business/elon-musk-says-hell-withdraw-97-4b-openai-bid-if-sam-altman-abandons-for-profit-plans/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [thetimes.co.uk](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/elon-musk-open-ai-bid-private-sam-altman-latest-r3p2rdcp2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-openai-altman-microsoft-nvidia-f2104883?utm_source=chatgpt.com)","prompt_text":null,"type":"nav_list","title":"Elon Musk's Bid to Acquire OpenAI Sparks Legal Battle","items":[{"title":"Elon Musk says he'll withdraw $97.4B OpenAI bid if Sam Altman abandons for-profit plans","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/business/elon-musk-says-hell-withdraw-97-4b-openai-bid-if-sam-altman-abandons-for-profit-plans/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","thumbnail_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/elon-musk-speaks-next-u-98479114.jpg?quality=90&resize=500&strip=all","pub_date":1739463994.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"},{"title":"Elon Musk proposes to drop $97bn OpenAI bid","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/elon-musk-open-ai-bid-private-sam-altman-latest-r3p2rdcp2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","thumbnail_url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fbf7a0297-e7b3-44a6-9670-775b863bfbb9.jpg?crop=6000%2C4000%2C0%2C0&resize=500","pub_date":1739446511.0,"attribution":"thetimes.co.uk"},{"title":"Musk to Withdraw Bid if OpenAI Remains a Nonprofit.
