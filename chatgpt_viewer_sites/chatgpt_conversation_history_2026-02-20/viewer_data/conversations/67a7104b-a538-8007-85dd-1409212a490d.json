Its diagonals have the following key properties:\n1. They **bisect each other** at right angles (90\u00b0).\n2. They **bisect the interior angles** of the rhombus.\n\n#### Proof:\nConsider a rhombus **ABCD** with diagonals **AC** and **BD** intersecting at **O**.\n- Since a rhombus is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal: \\( \\angle A = \\angle C \\) and \\( \\angle B = \\angle D \\).\n- The diagonals **AC** and **BD** divide the rhombus into four right-angled triangles: **\u25b3AOB, \u25b3BOC, \u25b3COD, and \u25b3DOA**.\n- In each of these triangles, the diagonal acts as an **angle bisector** because it splits the angle into two equal parts.\n\nThus, each diagonal **bisects the angles at the vertices**, meaning:\n\\[\n\\angle AOB = \\angle AOD, \\quad \\angle BOC = \\angle BOD, \\quad \\angle COA = \\angle COD, \\quad \\angle DOB = \\angle DOA\n\\]"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002,200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"031f5323-03e7-44c1-ad2f-93193f06758f","request_id":"90ea1d782da60f9e-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"031f5323-03e7-44c1-ad2f-93193f06758f","children":[]}}}
