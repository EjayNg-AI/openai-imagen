Out-of-the-box WordPress doesn\u2019t run a daemon. Anything \u201cautomatic\u201d happens via schedulers:\n\n1) **WP-Cron (the built-in scheduler).**  \nBy default, WordPress checks due tasks *on a request* (front-end or admin). If there are scheduled events, it calls `wp-cron.php` to run them. This is **not independent of traffic**\u2014it fires because a page/admin request happened. Typical jobs: publishing scheduled posts, checking for updates, sending queued emails, plugin cleanups, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n2) **Real (server) cron calling `wp-cron.php`.**  \nMany hosts (or you) configure an OS-level cron to hit `wp-cron.php` every X minutes. When this is in place, jobs **do run periodically even with zero visits**. Example: Kinsta triggers `wp-cron.php` server-side every ~15 minutes by default; SiteGround shows how to set a 30-minute cron in Site Tools. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n3) **Plugin job queues (e.g., Action Scheduler).**  \nHeavy plugins (WooCommerce and many others) use **Action Scheduler**, a background job queue. It\u2019s still kicked by WP-Cron or a real cron, but once that\u2019s in place, queued tasks (webhooks, emails, renewals, data migrations) run on schedule independent of traffic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search17\ue201\n\n4) **External/SaaS schedulers.**  \nSome plugins can delegate scheduling to external services or a server-side cron option (e.g., MailPoet), which again means tasks fire even with no visits. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue201\n\n5) **Heartbeat is not a timer.**  \nThe WordPress Heartbeat API triggers periodic AJAX while an admin page is open; it\u2019s not a headless background timer and stops when the browser tab is closed. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search16\ue202turn1search18\ue201\n\n---\n\n### How to tell what *your* site is doing\n- **Check for a server cron:** On hosts like SiteGround, look in **Site Tools \u2192 Devs \u2192 Cron Jobs** for entries that curl/wget `wp-cron.php`. If present, your scheduled tasks run independently of visits. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  \n- **List scheduled events:** Use WP-CLI `wp cron event list` or a plugin like **WP Crontrol** to see what\u2019s queued, next run times, and overdue jobs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn1search19\ue201  \n- **Know the switch:** If `define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);` is set in `wp-config.php`, WP-Cron won\u2019t run on page loads\u2014so it *requires* a real cron or manual runs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search13\ue201\n\n**Bottom line:** By default, no periodic code runs without a request. The moment a **server cron** (or an external service) is configured to call `wp-cron.php`, WordPress and many plugins **will** execute scheduled code at intervals, independent of visits."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":534,"end_idx":581,"safe_urls":["https://wpengine.com/support/wp-cron-wordpress-scheduling/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.malcare.com/blog/wp-cron-php/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/wordpress-cron-job/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([WPZOOM](https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/wordpress-cron-job/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"WordPress Cron Job Guide: Setup, Management & ...","url":"https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/wordpress-cron-job/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1752753951.0,"snippet":"Jul 22, 2025 \u2014 Page Load Trigger: When someone visits your WordPress site, the system checks for scheduled events during the init hook \u00b7 Database Check: ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Event Scheduling and wp-cron - Support Center","url":"https://wpengine.com/support/wp-cron-wordpress-scheduling/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jul 28, 2025 \u2014 WordPress triggers wp-cron.php when any page of the website is visited.

Pure SFTP/File-Manager edits don\u2019t have a first-class, user-visible server audit log in Site Tools, so you must enforce per-person credentials and your own change discipline (Git, checksums).\n\n# What you can use today (SiteGround shared hosting)\n\n1) **HTTP access & error logs (server-side).**  \nIn **Site Tools \u2192 Statistics \u2192 Access Log** you can download raw Apache logs with timestamps, IPs, methods and URLs; **Error Log** shows the last errors. Correlate these with your file\u2019s mtime to see which admin action (e.g., POST to `/wp-admin/update.php`) preceded the change. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201\n\n2) **WordPress activity logs (app-layer \u201cwho\u201d).**  \nIf you use SiteGround\u2019s **Security Optimizer** plugin, its **Activity Log** records WordPress-side events (logins, plugin/theme changes, settings toggles) for the past **12 days**, including the user and IP where available. Use this first when changes touch WP-managed files (e.g., `.htaccess` rules written by a plugin). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n3) **Backups (for diff/restore).**  \nSiteGround keeps daily backups; you can restore **specific files** or roll back a full snapshot. Handy for \u201cwhen did this file change between backups?\u201d comparisons.

SiteGround\u2019s KB points you to your **FTP/SFTP client\u2019s log** for proof of who uploaded what. If you need attribution, give **each person a unique SFTP account or SSH key** (Site Tools \u2192 Site \u2192 FTP Accounts / Devs \u2192 SSH Keys) and keep their client logs.

Detect unauthorized file changes (FIM)**\n- Use **WP-CLI checksums** via cron to detect tampering in **core** and **WordPress.org plugins** (fast, low-overhead).  \n  ```\n  wp core verify-checksums\n  wp plugin verify-checksums --all\n  ```\n  Non-matching files are flagged immediately; schedule these hourly/daily and email results. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search1\ue201\n- For non-WP files (your HTML/CSS/JS in `public_html`), add a simple checksum job (e.g., `sha256sum` tree to a manifest and diff on each run) or move them under Git (next item).\n\n**C.
