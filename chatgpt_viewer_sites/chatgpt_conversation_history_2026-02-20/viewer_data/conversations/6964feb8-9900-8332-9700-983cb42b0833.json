Gradually they learn how much power their thoughts beliefs and expectations have in shaping their lived experiences. The driver of such changes is their openness to ideas and willingness to apply their own creative energies. This is one example of what I am thinking of.\r\n\r\nI am also of Oversoul 7 kind of tales.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Personal Reality Formation:**: You have the power to form your own reality.\r\n2. **Reality Formation En Masse**: Collectively, we form our joint reality.\r\n3. **Belief De-limitation:**: You need not be constrained by limiting beliefs.\r\n4. **Inner Knowledge Access:**: You can draw on the knowledge of the inner self.\r\n5. **Expansion of Consciousness**: You are here to expand your consciousness.\r\n6. **Multi-dimensional nature of the Soul**: You are a being who has chosen to focus a portion of your energy and consciousness into physical reality. You are part of realities beyond the physical.\r\n7. **Probable realities**: \r\n  - The multi-dimensional soul experiences probable realities, which are variations of events, circumstances, manifestations, and directions of growth and evolution it encounters during its travels. \r\n  - In physical form, we are often aware of only one timeline or string of events. There are other timelines, other manifestations, that the soul explores. \r\n  - Rather than the concept of \"one self, one world\", the soul encompasses many selves and embraces many worlds. You are many, and yet also uniquely you. Your soul's offshots explore realms beyond your current reality and are free to evolve in their own ways. The unity in this framework is possible because of the divine diversity that this framework implies.\r\n  - Probable realities allow the soul to explore its true multi-dimensional nature and actualize itself using its deep creative reservoirs. Indeed, it is only through the vast framework of probable realities that  reality creation and co-creation with other units of consciousness is possible. \r\n  - Probable realities are part and parcel of the soul's multi-dimensional nature, and are part of the nature of consciousness and reality itself. \r\n8. **Reincarnational existence**: \r\n  - Your consciousness is expressed through both probable realities and reincarnational existences.\r\n  - Reincarnational existences represent the soul experiencing different probable births and deaths.\r\n  - Since time has no meaning beyond the physical realm, cause and effect do not extend to reincarnational circumstances. The rules of reward and punishment, justice and retribution, do not apply.\r\n  - The lessons that the soul must learn are far more profound than the usual ideas of right and wrong, karma and consequence. Instead, we follow the divine impetus to expand one's consciousness and learn the lessons of the creative use of one's energies.  \r\n9. **The Spacious Present**: \r\n  - Cause and effect, the concept of linear, segmented growth from one stage to another, only makes sense in a time-dependent physical universe.\r\n  - In the spacious present, all reincarnational existences, and indeed, all probable realities, emerge simultaneously like petals on a flower, and they grow outward in multitudinous directions.\r\n  - You form your reality, both individually and en masse, from the present point of power. \r\n  - From the vantage point of the spacious present, you create both future and past, in the framework of time as you understand it.\r\n10. **Eternal Validity of the Soul**: You will survive the body's death, and even after your reincarnational existences are over, you will still live. You existed before the annals of time. When you are done with your reincarnational existences, still you will continue to exist, explore and evolve.\r\n11. **Connection with All-That-Is**: \r\n  - You are a cherished part of All That Is.\r\n  - The knowledge, the divine subjectivity of All That Is, is expressed Within every single unit of consciousness.\r\n  - The whole is more than the sum of its parts. You, too, are more than the sum of your parts.\r\n  - Every thought, every creative act, every breath you take, is an inalienable and precious part of All That Is.\r\n12. **Divine Subjectivity**: Divine subjectivity is truly infinite. This is the heritage of All That Is and all its manifestations, including you, your world, the smallest particles, and the largest galaxies. Divine subjectivity is the universe in eternal evolution, expansion, and creative exploration. In divine subjectivity, All That Is explores all facets of existence, and so do you.\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"7928b4ff-a841-40f3-abad-7f191abf13b3","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"5c845b9e-793c-45db-9ed8-b5141c663321","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7a45b834-e578-432b-9ba7-ee2c03cb9a6c","children":["97e8e80f-c6b1-49c1-997e-24f92dea88e7"]},"97e8e80f-c6b1-49c1-997e-24f92dea88e7":{"id":"97e8e80f-c6b1-49c1-997e-24f92dea88e7","message":{"id":"97e8e80f-c6b1-49c1-997e-24f92dea88e7","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768226489.9452434,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"7928b4ff-a841-40f3-abad-7f191abf13b3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e3b39acd-dbf8-409c-aa77-3c3b91e8715f","turn_exchange_id":"5c845b9e-793c-45db-9ed8-b5141c663321","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e3b39acd-dbf8-409c-aa77-3c3b91e8715f","children":["92584b84-d30e-46fe-a95b-97a47cc6008f"]},"92584b84-d30e-46fe-a95b-97a47cc6008f":{"id":"92584b84-d30e-46fe-a95b-97a47cc6008f","message":{"id":"92584b84-d30e-46fe-a95b-97a47cc6008f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768226490.2523384,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"7928b4ff-a841-40f3-abad-7f191abf13b3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"97e8e80f-c6b1-49c1-997e-24f92dea88e7","turn_exchange_id":"5c845b9e-793c-45db-9ed8-b5141c663321","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"97e8e80f-c6b1-49c1-997e-24f92dea88e7","children":["3873efc3-efea-4788-ba64-8d9e28874fa3"]},"3873efc3-efea-4788-ba64-8d9e28874fa3":{"id":"3873efc3-efea-4788-ba64-8d9e28874fa3","message":{"id":"3873efc3-efea-4788-ba64-8d9e28874fa3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1768226491.32316,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Providing guidance for generating short stories","content":"I need to focus on offering creative writing guidance for writing short stories or novels based on metaphysical ideas from Seth's works, particularly the Oversoul Seven tales.

Your job is to **turn the ideas into narrative constraints**: rules, costs, conflicts, and irreversible choices. Otherwise you\u2019ll get airy monologues and plot that dissolves the moment \u201cbelief changes reality.\u201d\n\nBelow is a practical way to guide an LLM to produce **short stories** and **short novels** that *feel like* \u201cSeth / Oversoul 7\u201d without becoming a lecture.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Convert the metaphysics into a \u201cstory physics\u201d (rules + costs)\n\nIf beliefs shape reality, stories get boring unless there are **limits**. Ask the LLM to adopt a clear mechanics model like a magic system:\n\n**Reality-creation constraints (pick 3\u20135):**\n- **Emotional buy-in rule:** A belief only \u201ccasts\u201d when the character *emotionally* inhabits it, not when they repeat it.\n- **Inertia rule:** Physical reality lags; small shifts come fast, big shifts have delay and collateral effects.\n- **Interference rule:** Competing beliefs (within the character, or across a group) cause distortions, glitches, or \u201csplit outcomes.\u201d\n- **Coherence rule:** The world prefers consistent narratives; reality bends toward the most coherent story a mind (or group) can sustain.\n- **Cost rule:** Every major shift costs something: memory, relationships, identity stability, or moral injury (\u201cdid I steal someone else\u2019s timeline?\u201d).\n\n**Why this matters:** Seth ideas remove the usual external constraints. Fiction needs constraints to create tension.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Choose *few* ideas per story, and force them into conflict\n\nYour list has 12 items. If you try to include all 12, the LLM will summarize them instead of dramatizing them.\n\nA reliable recipe:\n- **Short story (2\u20133 ideas)**  \n- **Novella (3\u20135 ideas)**  \n- **Novel (5\u20138 ideas)** with the remainder as background texture\n\nThen make the ideas **fight** each other. Examples:\n- Personal reality formation (1) vs. collective formation (2): \u201cI can change my life, but not without changing yours.\u201d\n- Belief de-limitation (3) vs. coherence rule: \u201cIf anything is possible, who am I?\u201d\n- Probable realities (7) vs. relationships: \u201cWhich version of me promised you what?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3) Anchor everything in a concrete human problem (not a cosmic lesson)\n\nPick a **core wound / desire** that the metaphysics pressures:\n- Fear of abandonment \u2192 probable realities where they stay / leave.\n- Shame \u2192 self-sabotaging reality scripts.\n- Need for control \u2192 collective reality backlash.\n- Grief \u2192 spacious present contact with \u201cdead\u201d variants.\n\nTell the LLM explicitly: **\u201cThis is a character story wearing a metaphysical coat.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## 4) Use \u201cOversoul 7\u201d structure as a narrative engine, not lore\n\nThe most effective \u201cOversoul\u201d storytelling pattern is *not* exposition about oversouls. It\u2019s **multiple selves colliding**:\n\n**Three proven formats:**\n1. **Braided timelines:** 3\u20135 chapters each in a different probable self, converging at one choice-point.\n2. **Council structure:** The \u201cinner self\u201d appears as a chorus of variants arguing about which reality to select.\n3. **Leakage mystery:** The protagonist experiences bleed-through (skills, memories, relationships) and must discover why.\n\nGive the LLM one chosen format and forbid the others for focus.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Prompt the LLM in stages (don\u2019t ask for a full draft immediately)\n\nA strong workflow is:\n\n1) **Premise + constraints** (what\u2019s the engine?)\n2) **Outline with turning points** (what changes, when, and why?)\n3) **Scene list with \u201creality shift events\u201d** (exact scenes where beliefs alter outcomes)\n4) **Draft**\n5) **Revision pass** (cut lectures, increase stakes, tighten causality)\n\nThis prevents the model from \u201cwandering into philosophy.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 6) Copy-paste prompt templates you can actually use\n\n### A) Story \u201coperating system\u201d prompt (paste as your main instruction)\nUse this to force dramatization:\n\n> You are writing a character-driven speculative story that embodies Seth-style reality-creation metaphysics **through events**, not lectures.  \n> **Do not explain the metaphysics directly** except in brief, in-character fragments.  \n> **Show reality formation via consequences**: decisions \u2192 belief shift \u2192 observable change \u2192 cost.  \n>  \n> **Chosen metaphysical pillars (use only these):** {PILLAR_A}, {PILLAR_B}, {PILLAR_C}.  \n> **Reality-physics constraints:** {3\u20135 constraints}.  \n>  \n> **Core human problem:** {wound/desire}.  \n> **External pressure:** {antagonist / deadline / threat}.  \n> **Tone:** {e.g., intimate, eerie, hopeful}.  \n> **POV + tense:** {e.g., close third, past}.  \n> **Length:** {e.g., 3,500\u20135,000 words}.  \n>  \n> **Hard requirements:**  \n> 1) Start with a concrete sensory scene and immediate stakes.  \n> 2) Include a skeptic character who makes strong counterarguments.  \n> 3) At least two reality-shift events must backfire before one works.  \n> 4) End with a choice that costs something irreversible.\n\n### B) Outline prompt (forces structure)\n> Produce a beat outline with 8\u201312 beats. For each beat include:  \n> - Scene goal  \n> - The belief in play (explicit or implicit)  \n> - What reality does in response (observable detail)  \n> - Cost or complication  \n> - How this beat escalates the core human problem  \n> Keep metaphysical language minimal; keep it dramatic.\n\n### C) Revision prompt (the \u201canti-lecture\u201d filter)\n> Revise the draft under these rules:  \n> - Cut any paragraph that explains metaphysics abstractly; replace with action, dialogue, or sensory evidence.  \n> - Increase causal clarity: every major change must be traceable to a belief shift + constraint.  \n> - Make the skeptic\u2019s arguments sharper, not weaker.  \n> - Preserve ambiguity where appropriate, but don\u2019t allow \u201canything can happen\u201d to solve plot problems.\n\n---\n\n## 7) What you should *expect to go wrong* (and how to prevent it)\n\n**Failure mode 1: \u201cVibes\u201d without plot.**  \nFix: require *deadlines, antagonists, and backfires.*\n\n**Failure mode 2: Deus ex belief (\u201cI believe harder and win\u201d).**  \nFix: enforce constraints + costs + interference from other minds.\n\n**Failure mode 3: Lecture masquerading as dialogue.**  \nFix: limit metaphysical talk to **short fragments** and force a skeptical rebuttal that has teeth.\n\n**Failure mode 4: Emotional flatness (cosmic = impersonal).**  \nFix: tie every metaphysical insight to a relationship consequence.\n\n---\n\n## 8) A concrete example setup (you can feed this as a test)\n\n**Pick three pillars:** (1) Personal formation, (2) collective formation, (7) probable realities.  \n**Constraints:** emotional buy-in, interference, cost (memory loss).  \n**Core human problem:** grief + guilt.  \n**External pressure:** a community \u201cmiracle\u201d movement weaponizes group belief, rewriting people\u2019s histories.\n\nThe protagonist tries to resurrect a lost loved one by belief-shifting\u2014only to discover they are pulling in a version of that person who *doesn\u2019t love them* (probable reality mismatch), and the town\u2019s collective belief begins overwriting everyone\u2019s memories to maintain coherence.\n\nThat\u2019s Seth-style, and it still has teeth.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me **(i)** the genre you want (literary, thriller, cozy, romance, sci-fi), **(ii)** your preferred length (e.g., 4k short story vs 30k novella), and **(iii)** which 3\u20135 pillars you want in the *first* tale, I can produce a ready-to-run prompt pack (outline prompt + drafting prompt + revision prompt) tailored to your voice."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"7928b4ff-a841-40f3-abad-7f191abf13b3","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"12825a8d-59d1-497f-8e16-acdd525f539b","turn_exchange_id":"5c845b9e-793c-45db-9ed8-b5141c663321","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"12825a8d-59d1-497f-8e16-acdd525f539b","children":[]}}}
