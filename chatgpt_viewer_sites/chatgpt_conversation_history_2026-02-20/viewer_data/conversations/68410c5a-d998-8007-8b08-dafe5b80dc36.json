He called for increased defense spending among Asian partners, similar to European nations, and reiterated the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. However, his message received mixed reactions, especially amid tensions over President Trump's protectionist trade policies, which heavily affect Southeast Asian exporters like Vietnam and Cambodia. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim criticized these trade restrictions, emphasizing that open trade is vital for stability and growth in Asia. Other leaders, including Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Malaysian advisor Mohd Faiz Abdullah, resisted tying defense purchases to U.S. tariff relief, instead calling for stronger U.S. economic engagement. European leaders, including Kaja Kallas and Emmanuel Macron, highlighted Europe's reliability as a global partner and promoted strategic autonomy and new alliances with Asia. Across the forum, there was a consensus rejecting the binary choice between the U.S. and China, advocating instead for a principled global order rooted in cooperation and stability.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748805271.639,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.usip.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/04/small-state-heavyweight-how-singapore-handles-us-china-rivalry","title":"A Small State Heavyweight?

China's recent export restrictions on these magnets, citing national security, have sharply limited global supply, threatening to halt automotive production lines. To circumvent these controls, companies are considering relocating parts of their manufacturing to China since the restrictions apply to the export of magnets but not finished components. Despite the added costs and potential for tariffs, this may be preferable to full production shutdowns.\n\nAlternative sources in Europe and Asia are being evaluated, but none can meet current demand. China commands about 90% of the global supply of rare-earth elements, such as dysprosium and terbium, and possesses unmatched refining capabilities. As export license approvals lag, automakers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and India are experiencing disruptions, with some plants already ceasing operations.\n\nCarmakers are also reevaluating designs to reduce dependence on rare-earth magnets, including reverting to older motor technologies and eliminating premium features. However, shifting back to more gasoline-powered vehicles could breach fuel-economy regulations, as credits from EV makers are fully allocated until 2027. The situation underscores the urgent need to diversify supply chains away from China.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":66}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"wsj.com"},{"title":"In Asia, Hegseth warns of China 'threat,' but few want to pick sides","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/01/asia-hegseth-china-shangrila-dialogue-security-summit-sides-trade/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1748805271.639,"snippet":"At the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized military cooperation over economic policy, warning of China's ambitions to alter the Asia-Pacific military balance. He called for increased defense spending among Asian partners, similar to European nations, and reiterated the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. However, his message received mixed reactions, especially amid tensions over President Trump's protectionist trade policies, which heavily affect Southeast Asian exporters like Vietnam and Cambodia. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim criticized these trade restrictions, emphasizing that open trade is vital for stability and growth in Asia. Other leaders, including Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Malaysian advisor Mohd Faiz Abdullah, resisted tying defense purchases to U.S. tariff relief, instead calling for stronger U.S. economic engagement. European leaders, including Kaja Kallas and Emmanuel Macron, highlighted Europe's reliability as a global partner and promoted strategic autonomy and new alliances with Asia.

China's recent export restrictions on these magnets, citing national security, have sharply limited global supply, threatening to halt automotive production lines. To circumvent these controls, companies are considering relocating parts of their manufacturing to China since the restrictions apply to the export of magnets but not finished components. Despite the added costs and potential for tariffs, this may be preferable to full production shutdowns.\n\nAlternative sources in Europe and Asia are being evaluated, but none can meet current demand. China commands about 90% of the global supply of rare-earth elements, such as dysprosium and terbium, and possesses unmatched refining capabilities. As export license approvals lag, automakers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and India are experiencing disruptions, with some plants already ceasing operations.\n\nCarmakers are also reevaluating designs to reduce dependence on rare-earth magnets, including reverting to older motor technologies and eliminating premium features. However, shifting back to more gasoline-powered vehicles could breach fuel-economy regulations, as credits from EV makers are fully allocated until 2027. The situation underscores the urgent need to diversify supply chains away from China.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":66}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"wsj.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5377,"end_idx":5377,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Automakers Race to Find Workaround to China's Stranglehold on Rare-Earth Magnets","url":"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/car-companies-production-rare-earth-shortage-aaf87ad2?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"wsj.com"},{"title":"In Asia, Hegseth warns of China 'threat,' but few want to pick sides","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/01/asia-hegseth-china-shangrila-dialogue-security-summit-sides-trade/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"washingtonpost.com"},{"title":"Singapore's Efforts to Navigate US\u2013China Strategic Rivalry","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15389-1_12?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"link.springer.com"},{"title":"Foreign Investment Increasing in Singapore's Logistics Sector","url":"https://blog.maxthon.com/2025/05/09/foreign-investment-increasing-in-singapores-logistics-sector/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"blog.maxthon.com"},{"title":"What are 5 business trends emerging from Southeast Asia's foreign ...","url":"https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/what-are-5-business-trends-emerging-from-southeast-asias-foreign-investment-boom.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"edb.gov.sg"},{"title":"Singapore says investment commitments up in 2024, sees challenges in 2025","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/singapore-says-investment-commitments-s219-billion-2024-sees-challenging-2025-2025-02-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"reuters.com"},{"title":"US-Singapore cooperation on tech and security: defense, cyber, and biotech","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07946?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"arxiv.org"},{"title":"China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) Further Upgrade ...","url":"https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2024/12/China-Singapore-Free-Trade-Agreement-CSFTA-Further-Upgrade-Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"mti.gov.sg"},{"title":"Singapore's Diplomatic Dance with the United States and China","url":"https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3768470/navigating-the-power-tides-singapores-diplomatic-dance-with-the-united-states-a/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"airuniversity.af.edu"},{"title":"China\u2013Singapore relations","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Singapore_relations?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"title":"The Role of ASEAN in the U.S.-China Competition -
