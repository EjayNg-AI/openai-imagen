Graph / relational layer (precise structure)\nFor: dependencies, \u201cuses\u201d, \u201cgeneralizes\u201d, \u201cequivalent to\u201d, assumptions, etc.\n- Minimal version: SQLite/Postgres tables + adjacency lists.\n- Rich version: a graph database (Neo4j) or a \u201cproperty graph\u201d inside Postgres.\n\n### B. Semantic retrieval layer (fast fuzzy recall)\nThis is **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): embed chunks, retrieve by meaning.\n- Vector search is great for \u201cI vaguely remember a lemma about \u2026\u201d.\n- It is *not* great for exact hypothesis matching (hence the graph layer).\n\n**Rule of thumb:**  \n- Use **vector retrieval** to *find* candidates.  \n- Use **structured filtering** to *validate* candidates (assumptions, domain, dependencies).\n\n## 3) Your solver/evaluator becomes a small lab of agents\nCompetition solving is mostly \u201cone theorem, one shot.\u201d Research is \u201cmany interlocking facts with provenance.\u201d\n\nA robust research team of agents:\n- **Librarian**: retrieves relevant claims/papers/definitions; insists on provenance.\n- **Curator**: converts raw sources into structured claims + links; updates taxonomy.\n- **Problem Solver**: proposes approaches and proof plans using retrieved claims.\n- **Skeptic/Evaluator**: adversarially checks logic, missing hypotheses, counterexamples.\n- **Formalizer** (optional but powerful): translates key lemmas into a proof assistant (Lean/Coq/Isabelle) or at least a strict \u201chypothesis \u2192 conclusion\u201d checklist.\n- **Writer**: turns the validated plan into exposition with correct citations.\n\nThis is your old solver/evaluator loop, but **front-loaded with retrieval** and **back-stopped by verification**.\n\n## 4) Orchestration flow: a 6-phase \u201cresearch episode\u201d\nThink of each research task as an *episode* with state.\n\n1. **Problem intake**\n   - Define goal, scope, known constraints, and what counts as \u201cdone\u201d.\n2. **Context build**\n   - Librarian pulls 20\u201380 candidate claims; Curator prunes to an \u201cactive set\u201d (say 10\u201325).\n3. **Plan synthesis**\n   - Solver drafts 1\u20133 proof strategies + required lemmas.\n4. **Critique / stress-test**\n   - Skeptic tries to break each strategy (edge cases, missing assumptions).\n5. **Verification**\n   - Either: formalizer checks key steps, or you run \u201cmicro-proof obligations\u201d (the system creates small subclaims and verifies them one by one).\n6. **Write + archive**\n   - Produce final writeup + an \u201cepisode log\u201d (what was used, what failed, what was added to KB).\n\nCrucially: every episode should *write back* new claims, counterexamples, and dependency links.\n\n## 5) Context window management: treat it like RAM vs disk\nA workable scheme is **three-tier memory**:\n\n- **Working memory (RAM)**: current episode\u2019s active claims + scratch proof plan (small, constantly rewritten).\n- **Active notes (cache)**: stable summaries of the most relevant lemmas/techniques for this project (updated occasionally).\n- **Long-term KB (disk)**: everything else, with provenance and version history.\n\nA \u201cContext Manager\u201d component does:\n- **Retrieve**: by query + tags + dependency neighborhood.\n- **Compress**: convert 20 retrieved items into a 1\u20132 page \u201cbrief\u201d with IDs.\n- **Pin**: keep the 5\u201315 most central items fixed across turns.\n- **Evict**: drop anything not referenced by the current proof plan.\n\nThis prevents the model from drowning in irrelevant text while still being grounded.\n\n## 6) Quality control: the non-negotiables for research\nIf you want this to scale, enforce these policies mechanically:\n\n- **Provenance required** for any \u201cknown result\u201d claim.\n- **No orphan claims**: every claim must link to (i) a source or (ii) a parent claim you already trust.\n- **Assumption ledger**: every lemma/theorem object has an explicit \u201chypotheses\u201d list.\n- **Counterexample slot**: if a claim fails under weakened hypotheses, store that as a first-class counterexample object.\n- **Versioning**: KB entries are Git-versioned; episodes are reproducible.\n\n## 7) A pragmatic MVP that won\u2019t explode\nIf you start too big (full graph DB + pipelines + proof assistant), you\u2019ll stall. A good MVP:\n\n1) Store items as **Markdown + YAML frontmatter** (easy to edit), versioned by Git.  \n2) Build a **small schema** for Definition/Lemma/Theorem/PaperSummary/Technique.  \n3) Add embeddings + vector search over the Markdown bodies.  \n4) Implement the 6-phase research episode loop with an episode log.  \n5) Only later: introduce a dependency graph and/or formalization.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, in the next step I can propose an exact minimal **data schema** (fields for each object type) and a corresponding **agent protocol** (what each agent is allowed to do, what it must output, and how the orchestrator decides which agent runs next)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"f9e56234-9197-4af4-8a02-bc76deefa40d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"4527b70e-3595-4553-9bcd-ff8eae606f2c","turn_exchange_id":"4df8d386-d025-4938-a8b0-c678be49a414","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"4527b70e-3595-4553-9bcd-ff8eae606f2c","children":["03edde5b-a906-44d1-a5f9-d5840972f446"]},"03edde5b-a906-44d1-a5f9-d5840972f446":{"id":"03edde5b-a906-44d1-a5f9-d5840972f446","message":{"id":"03edde5b-a906-44d1-a5f9-d5840972f446","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766731938.637,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Can we have Python Flask + Langchain as the orchestration layer, and provide the model all necessary info via function calling (tool calling)?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"fd63d2d4-9e57-458f-bf34-f5ea66f0991d","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"f8c7a19e-d57d-45be-b2c2-c89ac77ffff1","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7636202d-909a-4694-8c83-4c2f1780ebe2","children":["e316540a-b234-439b-a962-1d7a4878480e"]},"e316540a-b234-439b-a962-1d7a4878480e":{"id":"e316540a-b234-439b-a962-1d7a4878480e","message":{"id":"e316540a-b234-439b-a962-1d7a4878480e","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766731939.3892665,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"fd63d2d4-9e57-458f-bf34-f5ea66f0991d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"03edde5b-a906-44d1-a5f9-d5840972f446","turn_exchange_id":"f8c7a19e-d57d-45be-b2c2-c89ac77ffff1","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"03edde5b-a906-44d1-a5f9-d5840972f446","children":["495f2c12-8934-4868-9b75-25f518d42949"]},"495f2c12-8934-4868-9b75-25f518d42949":{"id":"495f2c12-8934-4868-9b75-25f518d42949","message":{"id":"495f2c12-8934-4868-9b75-25f518d42949","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766731939.4384975,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"fd63d2d4-9e57-458f-bf34-f5ea66f0991d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"e316540a-b234-439b-a962-1d7a4878480e","turn_exchange_id":"f8c7a19e-d57d-45be-b2c2-c89ac77ffff1","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e316540a-b234-439b-a962-1d7a4878480e","children":["51c9fa2c-a774-4a4b-a67b-2b204d9a4623"]},"51c9fa2c-a774-4a4b-a67b-2b204d9a4623":{"id":"51c9fa2c-a774-4a4b-a67b-2b204d9a4623","message":{"id":"51c9fa2c-a774-4a4b-a67b-2b204d9a4623","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1766731940.573021,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating Flask and LangChain integration","content":"The user wants to know if Flask and LangChain can work together for orchestrating function (tool) calls with models.

\u2014 Flask + LangChain can sit cleanly as the orchestration layer, and \u201cthe model gets what it needs\u201d via tool calling, *provided you design the tools + state manager carefully*.\n\n### The architecture that works in practice\n**Flask (API + UI)**\n- Handles auth, request routing, job management, and streaming/polling back to the frontend.\n\n**LangChain / LangGraph (orchestrator)**\n- Runs the agent loop(s): plan \u2192 retrieve \u2192 solve \u2192 critique \u2192 verify \u2192 write \u2192 archive.\n- LangGraph is often the better fit once you want durable state + loops + multi-agent routing (it\u2019s built for that). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n\n**Tool layer (function calling)**\n- Tools are your \u201cI/O\u201d: retrieve facts, fetch sources, store new claims, run checks.\n- Models call these tools using JSON-schema tool definitions (\u201cfunction calling\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n### A critical nuance: tool calling doesn\u2019t remove context-window limits\nTool outputs still enter the model\u2019s context (as tool messages), so you want **progressive disclosure**:\n1) `kb_search(...)` returns *IDs + 1\u20132 line summaries*  \n2) `kb_get_claim(id)` returns the full paraphrase + hypotheses list  \n3) `kb_get_source_snippet(ref)` returns *only the needed excerpt* (short)  \n4) Optional: `kb_get_dependency_neighborhood(id, depth=1)` to pull prerequisites\n\nThis keeps token use sane and makes the model \u201cask\u201d for more only when needed.\n\n### How to make \u201ctool-only info\u201d reliable (instead of wishful)\nYou need a **tool-use policy** in the developer prompt, like:\n- \u201cBefore asserting any named result, call `kb_search` and cite a claim ID.\u201d\n- \u201cIf a proof step depends on a lemma not in the active set, call `kb_search`.\u201d\n- \u201cIf confidence < verified, the Skeptic agent must request a source snippet.\u201d\n\nThen enforce it with an evaluator loop.\n\n### Tool set I\u2019d actually build for math research\n**Retrieval**\n- `kb_search(query, tags, msc, top_k)`\n- `kb_get_claim(claim_id)`\n- `kb_get_definition(def_id)`\n- `kb_get_paper_summary(paper_id)`\n- `kb_get_source_snippet(source_id, location_hint)`\n\n**Curation / write-back**\n- `kb_create_claim(statement, hypotheses, paraphrase, source_ref, tags)`\n- `kb_link_claims(parent_id, child_id, relation=\"uses|generalizes|equivalent\")`\n- `kb_set_status(claim_id, status=\"verified|plausible|needs_check\")`\n\n**Episode/state**\n- `episode_start(goal, scope, project_id)`\n- `episode_pin(claim_ids)`\n- `episode_summarize()` (creates a compact \u201cworking memory\u201d brief)\n- `episode_archive()` (stores final writeup + dependency trace)\n\n**Sanity checking (high leverage)**\n- `counterexample_search(formalized_statement, domain_constraints)` (even crude numeric / symbolic probing catches lots of mistakes)\n- `sympy_simplify_or_check(expr1, expr2, assumptions)`\n- optional later: `lean_check(snippet)` / `proof_assistant_check(...)`\n\n### LangChain specifics: structured output + tool calling is your friend\nIf you want agents to return predictable objects (plans, claim objects, checklists), use structured outputs (Pydantic/dataclasses/JSON) rather than \u201cfree text + parsing.\u201d LangChain explicitly supports structured output flows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  \nAlso note: in many setups, LangChain\u2019s \u201cstructured output\u201d is implemented via the model\u2019s function/tool-calling interface, and your Pydantic schema names/descriptions effectively become part of the prompt\u2014so write them like you mean them. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201  \nOn the model side, OpenAI recommends Structured Outputs when you want schema adherence. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n### Where Flask fits: long jobs + streaming\nResearch episodes can take time (multi-step retrieval + critique loops). Two patterns:\n- **Simple polling**: `/run_episode` returns `job_id`, frontend polls `/job_status/<id>`.\n- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) from Flask is a straightforward option if you want live token/tool updates. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n### The main tradeoff (I\u2019d push back on one assumption)\n\u201cProvide the model *all necessary info* via tool calling\u201d is great as a principle, but in practice:\n- You still need a **small but strong** developer prompt that teaches the agent *how to research* (provenance rules, hypothesis ledger, when to retrieve, when to refuse).\n- You often get better reliability if the **orchestrator preloads** a compact \u201cepisode brief\u201d (pinned definitions + active lemmas) *and* still allows tool calls for everything else.\n\nIn other words: **tool-first retrieval + pinned brief** tends to beat **tool-only**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want the next concrete step: I can propose an MVP \u201cepisode state schema\u201d (what you store per run) + the exact tool JSON schemas (Pydantic models) for the 8\u201312 core tools above, so you can wire them into LangChain/LangGraph and your Flask endpoints cleanly."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":587,"end_idx":619,"safe_urls":["https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview","https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.langchain.com/langgraph","https://www.langchain.com/langgraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([LangChain Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"LangGraph overview - Docs by LangChain","url":"https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more. \u200b.

So use:\n- **BM25 (Okapi BM25)** keyword retrieval for exact terms/symbols, plus\n- vector retrieval for paraphrases,\n- optionally a reranker on top. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search16\ue201\n\n(LangChain formalizes \u201cretriever\u201d as an interface that returns documents for a query \u2014 broader than \u201cvector store\u201d \u2014 so hybrid setups fit naturally. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201)\n\n### 3) Agentic retrieval loop (retrieve \u2192 grade \u2192 refine \u2192 retrieve)\nYou want the system to *decide when to retrieve*, and to retry retrieval with improved queries when results are weak. LangGraph has an \u201cagentic RAG\u201d pattern where a retrieval agent chooses whether to retrieve and can iterate on queries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n## The minimal RAG tool set I\u2019d add (as function calls)\nThink \u201cIDs first, payload later\u201d (to control tokens).\n\n**Candidate search**\n- `claim_search(query, tags, msc, top_k) -> [{claim_id, title, 1-2 line gist, score}]`\n- `source_search(query, filters, top_k) -> [{chunk_id, citation_stub, gist, score}]`\n\n**Fetch details (only on demand)**\n- `claim_get(claim_id) -> {statement, hypotheses, paraphrase, dependencies, source_refs, status}`\n- `source_get(chunk_id) -> {text, citation, location}`\n\n**Relevance & compression**\n- `rerank(query, candidate_ids) -> ordered_ids` (optional but high leverage)\n- `brief_build(pinned_claim_ids, supporting_chunks) -> \u201cepisode brief\u201d` (your context distiller)\n\n**Provenance enforcement**\n- `citation_format(source_ref) -> short cite token`\n- `claim_set_status(claim_id, verified|needs_check, reason)`\n\nThis is exactly the mechanism that makes \u201ctool-calling provides all necessary info\u201d actually workable without drowning the model.\n\n## How it plugs into LangGraph\nA good default graph for research episodes:\n\n1. **Intake / Goal node**\n2. **Query planner node** (turn goal into 3\u201310 retrieval queries)\n3. **Retrieve node** (hybrid search: BM25 + vectors)\n4. **Grade node** (LLM or heuristic checks: \u201cdoes this match hypotheses we need?\u201d)\n5. **Refine query loop** (if grade low \u2192 rewrite query \u2192 retrieve again)\n6. **Pin + Brief node** (construct compact working set)\n7. **Solve node**\n8. **Skeptic node** (forces missing-hypotheses checks; demands citations)\n9. **Writeback node** (new claims, links, counterexamples)\n10. **Archive node**\n\nThis matches LangGraph\u2019s \u201cworkflow vs agent\u201d distinction: retrieval and brief-building can be workflow-like (deterministic), while solve/critic are agentic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n## Practical \u201cmath-specific\u201d adjustments (where most RAG systems fail)\n- **Chunk at theorem/definition granularity** whenever possible (not arbitrary 1k-token slabs).\n- Store **hypotheses as structured fields** (list of conditions), so you can filter: \u201cneeds properness\u201d, \u201crequires characteristic 0\u201d, \u201cneeds nef divisors\u201d, etc.\n- Add a **symbol/LaTeX token index** (even a simple inverted index) because embeddings often underweight symbols.\n- Make the Skeptic refuse to accept any named result unless it has a **claim_id + source_ref** (or it\u2019s explicitly labeled \u201cunverified sketch\u201d).\n\n## When *not* to retrieve\nRetrieval can pollute the context. Have a decision rule (or node) like:\n- If the task is purely local (rewrite proof, check a step already fully specified), skip retrieval.\n- If the plan introduces any external lemma/standard fact, retrieve or mark as \u201cneeds check.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s basically what retrieval agents are for. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n---\n\nBottom line: **Yes, add RAG tools \u2014 but treat RAG as a controlled, multi-step subsystem (hybrid retrieval + grading + progressive disclosure + provenance), not a single vector search.** If you want, I can sketch a concrete LangGraph `State` schema for an \u201cepisode\u201d (pinned claims, open questions, proof obligations, citation ledger) and show how each tool updates it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201","start_idx":481,"end_idx":526,"safe_urls":["https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api","https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview","https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/workflows-agents","https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/workflows-agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([LangChain Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"LangGraph overview - Docs by LangChain","url":"https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more. \u200b.
