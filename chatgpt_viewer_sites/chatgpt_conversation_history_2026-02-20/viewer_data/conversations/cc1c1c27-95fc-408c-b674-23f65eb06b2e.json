This is because the system would attempt to counteract the increased pressure by shifting towards the side with fewer gas molecules.\n\nHowever, considering the molecular level dynamics, increasing the pressure increases the number of particles per unit volume, which leads to more effective collisions per unit time. This generally increases the rate of reaction for both the forward and reverse reactions.\n\nThe net effect on the equilibrium position would still primarily be determined by Le Chatelier's principle. The increased pressure favors the reaction that produces fewer gas molecules. Therefore, in the case where \\((a + b) < (c + d)\\):\n\n1. **Equilibrium Shift**: The equilibrium will shift towards the reverse reaction (left side) to decrease the number of gas molecules, thereby reducing the pressure.\n\n2. **Collision Theory**: While the number of effective collisions increases due to higher pressure, this increase in collision frequency affects both forward and reverse reactions. However, because the equilibrium position is more influenced by the change in the number of moles, the shift will still favor the direction that reduces the total number of gas molecules.\n\nThus, despite the increase in collision frequency, the final outcome in terms of equilibrium will align with Le Chatelier's principle.
