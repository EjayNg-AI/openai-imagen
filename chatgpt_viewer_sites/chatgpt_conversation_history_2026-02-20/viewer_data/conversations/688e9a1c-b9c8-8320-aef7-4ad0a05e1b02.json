This perspective, supported by Copenhagen interpretation, is challenged by recent fluid dynamics experiments revealing phenomena similar to quantum behavior. Through these experiments, bouncing oil droplets on liquid surfaces exhibit particle-like and wave-like behaviors due to pilot waves, reminiscent of elementary particles. This observed pilot-wave behavior revives the deterministic theory proposed by Louis de Broglie, suggesting particles follow defined trajectories influenced by waves rather than existing in probabilistic states. Significant skeptics remain within the physics community, mainly due to the lack of direct evidence at the quantum scale and the practical success of contemporary quantum mechanics. However, these findings stimulate discussions about potentially reinterpreting quantum mechanics through deterministic principles and exploring unified physical theories.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1404124205.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_688e9a5fc6d08007b9348aaf81e305b7","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"96913c3cb8b090f2-LAX","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"748c8084-1bae-45f4-af07-9adee5e2a146","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"748c8084-1bae-45f4-af07-9adee5e2a146","children":["c716f20e-2c46-4711-84dc-50f54ad1b6da"]},"c716f20e-2c46-4711-84dc-50f54ad1b6da":{"id":"c716f20e-2c46-4711-84dc-50f54ad1b6da","message":{"id":"c716f20e-2c46-4711-84dc-50f54ad1b6da","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1754176135.97863,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Searching for QFT books","content":"For advanced Quantum Field Theory, I\u2019m considering several recommendations. \u201cRelativistic Quantum Physics\u201d by Bjorken & Drell might be a little advanced, but it\u2019s essential.

I focus on books that are still in print, widely used in courses, and (where possible) available in current-edition hardbacks or PDFs.  Within each stage I list two to four titles that complement one another rather than duplicate coverage, so you can choose one core text and keep the others as references/problem\u2010books.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Advanced-undergraduate quantum mechanics  \n\n| Core goals | Suggested texts | Why this book / how it differs |\n|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Consolidate Dirac-notation, angular-momentum algebra, perturbation theory, identical particles | **Griffiths & Schroeter \u2013 *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*, 3 ed. (2018)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue201 | The cleanest bridge from lower-division courses to research literature; deliberately \u201chand-holding\u201d prose, many worked examples. |\n| Develop calculational stamina & exam-level problem-solving | **Zettili \u2013 *Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications*, 2 ed. (2009)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn5search2\ue201 | 950+ worked problems; every chapter has a summary of solution techniques.  Strong on approximation methods and scattering. |\n| Connect formalism to modern topics (spin-qubits, Berry phase, entanglement) | **Zwiebach \u2013 *Mastering Quantum Mechanics* (MIT Press, 2022)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn4search1\ue201 | Written from scratch for today\u2019s undergraduates; integrates numerical notebooks, symmetry language and information-theoretic viewpoints. |\n| Introduce the path-integral mindset early | **Feynman, Hibbs & Styer \u2013 *Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals*, emended ed. (2010)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn13search1\ue201 | The canonical source for learning how amplitudes emerge from sums over histories\u2014indispensable before QFT. |\n\n---\n\n## 2  Core graduate quantum mechanics  \n\n| Core goals | Suggested texts | Distinctive features |\n|------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Abstract state-space, symmetry generators, advanced scattering, density-matrix formalism | **Sakurai & Napolitano \u2013 *Modern Quantum Mechanics*, 3 ed. (2020)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn8search6\ue201 | Sets the standard graduate syllabus; adds modern material on open-system dynamics and entanglement entropy. |\n| Mathematically rigorous derivations & path-integral supplement | **Shankar \u2013 *Principles of Quantum Mechanics*, 2 ed. (1994)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn7search0\ue201 | Starts from Hilbert-space axioms, ends with relativistic wave equations; ideal reference while doing coursework or quals. |\n| Optional drill book | **Problems & Solutions in Quantum Mechanics** (various) or Zettili (above). |\n\n---\n\n## 3  Relativistic quantum mechanics (stepping-stone to QFT)  \n\n* **Bjorken & Drell \u2013 *Relativistic Quantum Mechanics* (1964)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn14search4\ue201  \n  Classic but concise treatment of the Dirac equation, Lorentz covariance, and tree-level scattering amplitudes.  Still unbeatable as a four-week \u201cbridge\u201d module.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Introductory quantum field theory (first course)  \n\n| Path | Suggested texts | Notes |\n|------|-----------------|-------|\n| **Gentle, symmetry-first intro** | **Semenoff \u2013 *Quantum Field Theory: An Introduction* (Springer GTiP, 2024)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn3search4\ue201 | Brand-new; starts with classical fields, Noether currents, then quantises.  Streamlined for one-semester courses. |\n| **Self-study friendly** | **Lancaster & Blundell \u2013 *QFT for the Gifted Amateur* (2014)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn11search1\ue201 | Narrative style, hundreds of diagrams, minimal prerequisites beyond Sakurai\u2010level QM. |\n| **Group-theory-driven** | **Schwichtenberg \u2013 *Physics from Symmetry*, 2 ed. (2018)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn15search0\ue201 | Derives QM and QFT Lagrangians almost entirely from symmetry arguments; fills a gap between math-methods and field theory. |\n| **Traditional graduate staple** | **Peskin & Schroeder \u2013 *An Introduction to QFT* (1995)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn9search2\ue201 | Thorough first-principles path-integral approach; heavy on perturbative QED/QCD, renormalisation-group flow, and gauge theory. |\n\n---\n\n## 5  Consolidation & modern applications  \n\n| Focus area | Main reference | What you gain |\n|------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Precision Standard-Model calculations, EFT heuristics | **Schwartz \u2013 *QFT and the Standard Model* (2014)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn10search0\ue201 | Pedagogical yet up-to-date treatment of dimensional regularisation, anomalies, collider kinematics, and modern EFT techniques. |\n| Physical insight & analogies | **Zee \u2013 *QFT in a Nutshell*, 2 ed. (2010)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue201 | Conversational, idea-oriented; useful parallel reading while working problems from Peskin/Schwartz. |\n\n---\n\n## 6  Advanced & reference-grade field theory  \n\n* **Weinberg \u2013 *The Quantum Theory of Fields*, Vols. I\u2013III (1995 \u2013 2000)**  \ue200cite\ue202turn12search0\ue201  \n  The definitive, axiomatic account: Lorentz-invariant S-matrix construction, renormalisation proofs, gauge theory, supersymmetry.  Treat as a *reference* while researching rather than a first textbook.\n\n---\n\n### How to use the list  \n1. **Pick one \u201cspine\u201d text per stage** and work all problems.  \n2. **Supplement with complementary perspectives** (e.g., symmetry-first vs. perturbative) rather than trying to read everything sequentially.  \n3. Keep **Sakurai \u2192 Peskin \u2192 Schwartz** as the minimal continuous path if time is limited.  \n4. Once comfortable with Peskin-level material, dip into Weinberg or current review articles to specialise (condensed-matter QFT, lattice methods, supersymmetry, etc.).  \n\nThis progression has proven effective for graduate qualifiers and for launching into research literature."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn6search0\ue201","start_idx":791,"end_idx":810,"safe_urls":["https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-quantum-mechanics/990799CA07A83FC5312402AF6860311E?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-quantum-mechanics/990799CA07A83FC5312402AF6860311E?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - Cambridge University Press","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-quantum-mechanics/990799CA07A83FC5312402AF6860311E?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Discover Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 3rd Edition, David J.
