In the SM this means temperatures **\\(T \\gtrsim 150\\text{\u2013}170\\ \\mathrm{GeV}\\)** (order-of-magnitude: a few \\(10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{K}\\)). Around \\(T\\sim160\\ \\mathrm{GeV}\\), cosmic time \\(t\\sim10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\n# What \u201cno mass\u201d really means\n- **Rest masses:** \\(m_\\text{rest}=0\\) for all SM fields because \\(\\langle H\\rangle=0\\) (no EWSB, no Yukawa masses, no \\(W/Z\\) masses).\n- **But not free particles:** In a hot gauge plasma, excitations acquire **thermal (screening) masses** \\(\\sim g\\,T\\) from medium effects. These are not rest masses; they encode collective behavior (Debye screening, Landau damping, etc.).\n\n# Symmetries and forces\n- **Gauge group:** Unbroken \\(SU(3)_c\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y\\).\n  - The usual **photon and \\(Z\\)** do not exist as separate eigenstates; instead you have massless gauge fields of **\\(SU(2)_L\\)** and **\\(U(1)_Y\\)**.\n  - In vacuum the weak force would be long-range here (gauge bosons massless), but in the plasma its range is set by **thermal screening**.\n- **Electric charge:** \\(Q=T_3+Y/2\\) is still the generator, but the medium eigenstates are not the broken-phase photon/\\(Z\\) mixture you\u2019re used to.\n\n# Particle content and degrees of freedom\n- All SM fields behave as **ultra-relativistic**. The effective relativistic d.o.f. are\n  \\[\n  g_* = 106.75\n  \\]\n  (SM value when all species are effectively massless and in equilibrium).\n- QCD is **deconfined**: a quark\u2013gluon plasma with all six quark flavors active (including top; its large Yukawa is just a coupling, not a mass, in this phase).\n\n# Thermodynamics and expansion\n- **Equation of state (radiation dominated):** \\(p=\\rho/3\\), sound speed \\(c_s=1/\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- **Energy density:** \\(\\rho=\\frac{\\pi^2}{30}g_* T^4\\), **entropy density:** \\(s=\\frac{2\\pi^2}{45}g_* T^3\\).\n- **Hubble rate:** \\(H\\simeq 1.66\\,\\sqrt{g_*}\\,T^2/M_{\\rm Pl}\\).\n  - Example at \\(T=160\\ \\mathrm{GeV}\\): \\(t\\sim 9\\times10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}\\); horizon size \\(c\\,t\\sim\\) a few mm.\n- **Scale factor:** \\(a(t)\\propto t^{1/2}\\).\n\n# Interactions and kinetics\n- **Frequent collisions:** Mean free paths are tiny; all reactions with gauge/Yukawa couplings \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) stay in chemical and kinetic equilibrium.\n- **Neutrinos** are tightly coupled (no decoupling yet).\n- **Sphalerons** are unsuppressed: rapid non-perturbative \\(SU(2)_L\\) transitions violate \\(B+L\\) (conserve \\(B\\!-\\!L\\)). This equilibrates baryon and lepton numbers subject to \\(B\\!-\\!L\\).\n- **No bound states:** Confinement absent; electromagnetic-like atoms don\u2019t exist because there isn\u2019t a photon eigenstate and plasma screening is strong.\n\n# The Higgs sector at high \\(T\\)\n- The finite-temperature effective potential **restores symmetry**: \\(\\langle H\\rangle=0\\).\n- The Higgs exhibits a **thermal mass** \\(\\sim \\kappa\\,T\\) (with \\(\\kappa\\) a coupling-dependent coefficient), so Higgs quanta are well-defined plasma modes despite vanishing vacuum mass.\n\n# Phase structure & transition\n- As the universe cools through **\\(T\\sim 150\\text{\u2013}170\\ \\mathrm{GeV}\\)**, the SM undergoes an **electroweak crossover** (not a strong first-order phase transition for physical Higgs mass \\(125\\ \\mathrm{GeV}\\)).  \n  - Consequence: the SM alone **doesn\u2019t** provide a strong-transition electroweak baryogenesis mechanism; extensions (extra scalars, etc.) are needed to make the transition first-order and generate gravitational-wave\u2013sized plasma dynamics.\n- Below the crossover, \\(\\langle H\\rangle\\neq0\\), fermions and \\(W/Z\\) acquire their familiar masses, and EM emerges as the massless \\(U(1)_{\\rm EM}\\).\n\n# Transport & plasma properties (order-of-magnitude)\n- **Viscosities/conductivities:** scale like powers of \\(T\\) divided by coupling factors, e.g. \\(\\eta\\sim T^3/[g^4\\ln(1/g)]\\) for non-Abelian plasmas (parametric form).\n- **Debye screening lengths:** \\(\\lambda_D\\sim 1/(g\\,T)\\) for the electric sector; magnetic screening in non-Abelian theories is non-perturbative \\(\\sim 1/(g^2 T)\\).\n\n# Cosmological implications\n- **Baryogenesis windows:** With active sphalerons, any pre-existing \\(B+L\\) is erased; viable models generate a nonzero **\\(B\\!-\\!L\\)** earlier (e.g., leptogenesis) or engineer CPV/out-of-equilibrium dynamics during a beyond-SM first-order EW transition.\n- **Primordial fields and chiral effects:** Chiral asymmetries and hypermagnetic fields can exist and undergo **chiral MHD** evolution in this phase (model-dependent).\n- **Perturbations:** Still standard radiation-era evolution for curvature modes; subhorizon plasma effects can damp vector/tensor modes (model-dependent, typically small).\n\n---\n\n## Quick numeric snapshot (at \\(T=160\\ \\mathrm{GeV}\\))\n- \\(g_*=106.75\\), \\(H\\approx 1.66\\sqrt{g_*}T^2/M_{\\rm Pl} \\Rightarrow t\\sim9\\times10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}\\).\n- Horizon size \\(c\\,t\\sim3\\times10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\).\n- \\(\\rho \\approx  \\frac{\\pi^2}{30}g_* T^4 \\sim 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{GeV}^4\\) (enormous energy density;

only \\(W^a\\) and \\(B\\) fields.\n- **\u201cWeak force short-range\u201d**: range is short in today\u2019s vacuum because \\(m_W,m_Z\\neq0\\); in the symmetric phase the range is set by plasma screening, not by a mass term.\n\nIf you want, I can add a one-page derivation sheet (with \\(H(T)\\), \\(a(t)\\), \\(\\rho(T)\\), \\(s(T)\\), Debye masses, and a degree-of-freedom count) you can keep as a reference."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"98a785b61825ff83-SIN","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"525df8d6-bf1d-407e-8b1e-9c4ded8327a0","turn_exchange_id":"d022aa76-0b98-4a63-8095-64d4fc4ea1c7","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"525df8d6-bf1d-407e-8b1e-9c4ded8327a0","children":["ebb6f0fb-f3dc-4906-bd52-1b72d1930a6d"]},"ebb6f0fb-f3dc-4906-bd52-1b72d1930a6d":{"id":"ebb6f0fb-f3dc-4906-bd52-1b72d1930a6d","message":{"id":"ebb6f0fb-f3dc-4906-bd52-1b72d1930a6d","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759807977.014,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Produce a web page that explains the above discussion in detail, carefully defining terms and adopting a \"teaching\" style."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98aa5594088a5f77-SIN","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"7796cdac-af4f-4caa-97e0-b71d719eb1a6","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"51f67eee-d7e5-44c3-9e35-9f094d72e20b","children":["bcb7d34b-3fdb-40fa-a73c-9dc64040aba6"]},"bcb7d34b-3fdb-40fa-a73c-9dc64040aba6":{"id":"bcb7d34b-3fdb-40fa-a73c-9dc64040aba6","message":{"id":"bcb7d34b-3fdb-40fa-a73c-9dc64040aba6","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759807978.3174143,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"98aa5594088a5f77-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"ebb6f0fb-f3dc-4906-bd52-1b72d1930a6d","turn_exchange_id":"7796cdac-af4f-4caa-97e0-b71d719eb1a6","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ebb6f0fb-f3dc-4906-bd52-1b72d1930a6d","children":["9b835ea0-1bf8-4b65-adf9-04d77d27b8c2"]},"9b835ea0-1bf8-4b65-adf9-04d77d27b8c2":{"id":"9b835ea0-1bf8-4b65-adf9-04d77d27b8c2","message":{"id":"9b835ea0-1bf8-4b65-adf9-04d77d27b8c2","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759807978.3404107,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"98aa5594088a5f77-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"bcb7d34b-3fdb-40fa-a73c-9dc64040aba6","turn_exchange_id":"7796cdac-af4f-4caa-97e0-b71d719eb1a6","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bcb7d34b-3fdb-40fa-a73c-9dc64040aba6","children":["7525138a-4cca-4fc1-b29d-755fa55f22ed"]},"7525138a-4cca-4fc1-b29d-755fa55f22ed":{"id":"7525138a-4cca-4fc1-b29d-755fa55f22ed","message":{"id":"7525138a-4cca-4fc1-b29d-755fa55f22ed","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1759807978.950109,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering page structure and technical choices","content":"I need to build a webpage explaining the electroweak-symmetric epoch with precision, in a teaching style, for E-Jay.
