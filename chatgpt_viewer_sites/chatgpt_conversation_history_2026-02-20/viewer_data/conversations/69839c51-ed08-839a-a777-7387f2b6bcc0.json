A conversation with Claude is not one of them.\r\n\r\nAdvertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We\u2019ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.\r\n\r\nBut including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\r\n\r\nWe want Claude to act unambiguously in our users\u2019 interests. So we\u2019ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won\u2019t see \u201csponsored\u201d links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude\u2019s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.\r\n\r\nThe nature of AI conversations\r\nWhen people use search engines or social media, they\u2019ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.\r\n\r\nConversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it\u2019s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.\r\n\r\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal\u2014the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous\u2014and, in many cases, inappropriate.\r\n\r\nWe still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits\u2014like people finding support they couldn\u2019t access elsewhere\u2014and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.\r\n\r\nIncentive structures\r\nBeing genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude\u2019s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude\u2019s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.\r\n\r\nConsider a concrete example. A user mentions they\u2019re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes\u2014stress, environment, habits, and so on\u2014based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align\u2014but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model\u2019s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn\u2019t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\r\n\r\nEven ads that don\u2019t directly influence an AI model\u2019s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement\u2014for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren\u2019t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user\u2019s request without prompting further conversation.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches\u2014where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content\u2014might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We\u2019ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.\r\n\r\nOur approach\r\nAnthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\r\n\r\nExpanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users\u2019 attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we\u2019ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we\u2019ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\r\n\r\nSupporting commerce\r\nAI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We\u2019re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user\u2019s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we\u2019ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more\u2014when they choose to do so.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work\u2014like Figma, Asana, and Canva\u2014and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.\r\n\r\nAll third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude\u2019s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We\u2019d like to preserve that.\r\n\r\nA trusted tool for thought\r\nWe want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking\u2014about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.\r\n\r\nOur experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.\r\n\r\nWe think Claude should work the same way."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":["EjayNg-AI/agentic_browser"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"1643525c-49a5-4e7b-a3d5-f72032cac9ef","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"52ed9fd7-92b8-480c-9ff9-8dafb2bc2421","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5ddb5faf-e7ab-4485-918f-b72c9bcc347d","children":["32e7969e-4197-4c33-a3f3-8b0443deaa0b"]},"32e7969e-4197-4c33-a3f3-8b0443deaa0b":{"id":"32e7969e-4197-4c33-a3f3-8b0443deaa0b","message":{"id":"32e7969e-4197-4c33-a3f3-8b0443deaa0b","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770232924.2379906,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"1643525c-49a5-4e7b-a3d5-f72032cac9ef","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"94fb1f4b-565a-467b-b8cb-327492345a69","turn_exchange_id":"52ed9fd7-92b8-480c-9ff9-8dafb2bc2421","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"94fb1f4b-565a-467b-b8cb-327492345a69","children":["c6fc1be2-6cf3-43bc-a3ce-7c88d0b8ada5"]},"c6fc1be2-6cf3-43bc-a3ce-7c88d0b8ada5":{"id":"c6fc1be2-6cf3-43bc-a3ce-7c88d0b8ada5","message":{"id":"c6fc1be2-6cf3-43bc-a3ce-7c88d0b8ada5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770232925.6262825,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"1643525c-49a5-4e7b-a3d5-f72032cac9ef","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"32e7969e-4197-4c33-a3f3-8b0443deaa0b","turn_exchange_id":"52ed9fd7-92b8-480c-9ff9-8dafb2bc2421","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"32e7969e-4197-4c33-a3f3-8b0443deaa0b","children":["d8de6027-969d-4b13-9c68-13d2701da39a"]},"d8de6027-969d-4b13-9c68-13d2701da39a":{"id":"d8de6027-969d-4b13-9c68-13d2701da39a","message":{"id":"d8de6027-969d-4b13-9c68-13d2701da39a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770232926.032712,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Investigating Anthropic's stance on ads","content":"The user is asking for a critical analysis of Anthropic\u2019s position on ads, based on a specific post they shared from February 2026.

But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users. Despite OpenAI\u2019s assurances that ads won\u2019t influence chatbot content, Anthropic believes any form of commercialization could erode the authenticity and trust integral to AI-user interactions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770229214.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-super-bowl-openai-chatgpt-ads-claude-2026-2","title":"Anthropic's Super Bowl spot skewers ChatGPT: 'Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude'","snippet":"In a bold marketing move, Anthropic has launched a provocative ad campaign set to air during the Super Bowl, directly critiquing OpenAI\u2019s decision to include advertisements in ChatGPT. The tagline, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s firm stance against monetizing AI assistants through ads. The campaign includes a 30-second Super Bowl spot and a longer 1-minute pregame ad, both of which humorously depict chatbot-like voices interrupting serious conversations with absurd product promotions. These scenarios parody how ad integration could compromise the perceived utility and sincerity of AI interactions.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s decision to forgo advertising revenue from Claude reflects a strategic differentiation from OpenAI, especially as the AI sector becomes increasingly commercialized. This comes after OpenAI recently announced plans to begin testing ads in its ChatGPT free and Go tiers, which CEO Sam Altman previously opposed. Anthropic, largely reliant on its enterprise business, appears to prioritize trust and utility in its AI over aggressive monetization. Founded by former OpenAI employees, including CEO Dario Amodei, the company has made veiled critiques of OpenAI before, but this Super Bowl campaign marks a more public escalation in their rivalry.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1770220535.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.anthropic.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","title":"Claude is a space to think","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think?c=setec","title":"Claude is a space to think","snippet":"7 hours ago \u2014 Incentive structures\u200b\u200b Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude's Constitution, the document that describes our vision for ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/apple-xcode-claude-agent-sdk","title":"Apple\u2019s Xcode now supports the Claude Agent SDK","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.anthropic.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news?e45d281a_page=4&ref=frank.be","title":"Newsroom","snippet":"11 hours ago \u2014 Claude is a space to think.

This announcement contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s recent decision to test advertisements within ChatGPT\u2019s free and low-cost tiers, a move Hassabis found significant but refrained from openly criticizing. He emphasized the importance of trust and maintaining an unbiased, genuinely helpful AI assistant, suggesting ads could undermine that mission if not handled carefully.\n\nHassabis acknowledged that while ads are not off the table permanently, the focus now is on core technology and user experience. With Google\u2019s vast ecosystem generating substantial ad revenue through Search, YouTube, and more, the company can afford to keep Gemini ad-free for now. This contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s financial pressures as a smaller entity without similar revenue streams.\n\nThe decision positions Gemini as a more impartial and user-aligned assistant in an era when many digital platforms blur the line between content and advertisements. Google's stance suggests a long-term strategy aimed at building trust before possibly leveraging monetization later.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":49},"pub_date":1769165005.0,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"x.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://x.com/claudeai/status/2019024565398299074","title":"Claude is a space to think | Anthropic","snippet":"Read why Claude will remain ad-free: Claude is a space to think | Anthropic. www.anthropic.com. 467.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":17},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"x.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"finance.yahoo.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-doubles-down-on-ad-free-model-takes-shot-at-openai-in-upcoming-super-bowl-ad-170004629.html","title":"Anthropic doubles down on ad-free model, takes shot at ...","snippet":"2 hours ago \u2014 Our users won't see 'sponsored' links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude's responses be influenced by advertisers or ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":18},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"finance.yahoo.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.leads.sa","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.leads.sa/post/ai-chatbot-ads-sponsored-answers","title":"Sponsored Answers in AI: ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini","snippet":"10 Jan 2026 \u2014 Does Google use Gemini chats to show ads?

Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens.

This commitment was underscored by a high-profile advertisement during the Super Bowl, directly targeting ad-supported AI models. Anthropic\u2019s message, conveyed through a blog post, emphasizes that while advertising has its place, it should not interfere with user conversations with AI. This stance reflects a broader division in the generative AI industry: some companies are increasingly turning to advertising for revenue, while others seek to preserve a clean and seamless user experience via paid models. The debate over ad-supported versus subscription-based AI may become a critical factor in user allegiance and platform growth, akin to prior shifts driven by concerns over data privacy and online safety.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1770218922.0,"attribution":"www.axios.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-super-bowl-openai-chatgpt-ads-claude-2026-2","title":"Anthropic's Super Bowl spot skewers ChatGPT: 'Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude'","snippet":"In a bold marketing move, Anthropic has launched a provocative ad campaign set to air during the Super Bowl, directly critiquing OpenAI\u2019s decision to include advertisements in ChatGPT. The tagline, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s firm stance against monetizing AI assistants through ads. The campaign includes a 30-second Super Bowl spot and a longer 1-minute pregame ad, both of which humorously depict chatbot-like voices interrupting serious conversations with absurd product promotions. These scenarios parody how ad integration could compromise the perceived utility and sincerity of AI interactions.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s decision to forgo advertising revenue from Claude reflects a strategic differentiation from OpenAI, especially as the AI sector becomes increasingly commercialized. This comes after OpenAI recently announced plans to begin testing ads in its ChatGPT free and Go tiers, which CEO Sam Altman previously opposed. Anthropic, largely reliant on its enterprise business, appears to prioritize trust and utility in its AI over aggressive monetization. Founded by former OpenAI employees, including CEO Dario Amodei, the company has made veiled critiques of OpenAI before, but this Super Bowl campaign marks a more public escalation in their rivalry.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1770220535.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/openai-faces-long-wait-bumper-ad-sales-2026-02-04/","title":"OpenAI faces long wait for bumper ad sales","snippet":"OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, is exploring ad-supported revenue models for ChatGPT amid high costs and a predominantly non-paying user base\u201490% of the reported 800 million weekly users. Despite high expectations, the path to significant ad revenue is likely to be slow and complex. OpenAI aims to reach $50 billion in revenue by 2030, with advertising playing a key role. If monetization matched Meta\u2019s average revenue per user, OpenAI could generate around $23 billion annually. However, inserting ads into chatbot interactions presents unique challenges, including maintaining trust, user privacy, and context relevance.\n\nHiring Meta alum Fidji Simo indicates OpenAI's serious advertising ambitions. Yet, as Netflix's gradual ad growth shows, building a robust ad business takes time. Additionally, only 2% of ChatGPT queries involve purchasable products, limiting the advertising scope. Meanwhile, Google appears to have a strategic advantage with its established advertising infrastructure and integration of AI into search, positioning it well compared to OpenAI. Ultimately, despite OpenAI\u2019s powerful AI tools, monetizing via ads will require trust, infrastructure, and patience\u2014factors that could limit short-term gains.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1770181226.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-talks-invest-up-50-billion-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-29/","title":"Amazon in talks to invest as much as $50 billion in OpenAI, source says","snippet":"Amazon is reportedly in early discussions to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, as part of the AI company's latest fundraising efforts, a source told Reuters. The move would position Amazon as a major investor amid heightened competition among tech giants to secure strategic partnerships with leading AI firms. OpenAI, which aims to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of around $830 billion, is also exploring an IPO that could value it up to $1 trillion. Other major investors potentially participating in the round include SoftBank (considering an investment of up to $30 billion), Nvidia (up to $30 billion), and Microsoft (less than $10 billion). Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is leading negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Amazon has already invested $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which expects to significantly grow its revenue to around $26 billion in 2026.

Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude.

The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users.

One 30-second spot parodies AI conversations laced with ads, while another 60-second pregame ad humorously critiques ad placement in sensitive contexts. Without directly naming OpenAI, the messages clearly challenge its monetization strategy.\n\nAnthropic's approach contrasts strongly with the broader AI trend, where competitors have rapidly increased ad spending\u2014TV ads alone rose 43% last year\u2014and embraced commercial integration. Despite being less well-known, Anthropic has attracted business customers partly due to Claude\u2019s strong coding capabilities. The company emphasizes ethical boundaries, arguing AI tools should remain free from ads, especially given the personal data users share. Founders Daniela and Dario Amodei stress user trust over profits, though they don\u2019t rule out future ad models outside the chatbot experience.\n\nThese high-profile campaigns mark a shift in AI marketing\u2014from reassuring the public about AI risks to poking fun at monetization strategies.

While ads have not yet launched, testing will begin in the coming weeks. This move is part of OpenAI's broader strategy to monetize its services, which have amassed over 800 million users, most of whom use the chatbot for free. Despite its $500 billion valuation, the company is currently operating at a loss and is under pressure to generate substantial revenue to meet its large-scale infrastructure costs and satisfy investors.\n\nCEO Sam Altman emphasized that ads will be clearly marked, separated from chatbot responses, and will not influence ChatGPT's answers. The ads will appear at the bottom of responses only when relevant to the conversation. OpenAI insists that it will not collect personal data from conversations for ad targeting.\n\nThe decision has sparked concerns among digital rights experts, who warn that personalized ads may compromise user trust, particularly as people use AI for sensitive or personal purposes. Critics also note the risk of following social media's controversial path of data monetization.

In a search page, the user expects ranking games; in a chat, the user often treats the assistant as a collaborator/coach/advisor. That asymmetry makes \u201csponsored\u201d influence feel closer to manipulation than marketing.\n\n### The gap: \u201cappreciable portion\u201d is rhetorically useful but not quantified here\nThey claim internal analysis shows many conversations are sensitive/deeply personal. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \nBut the post itself doesn\u2019t quantify. Elsewhere, Anthropic has published privacy-preserving aggregation work (Clio) and affective-use analysis; those show *some* non-trivial level of emotional/support usage, but not necessarily the \u201ctrusted advisor\u201d framing for the median session. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn4view1\ue201  \nSo: the *direction* of the point is right; the *evidentiary weight* in this post is more assertion than demonstrated distribution.\n\n## 3) Incentives: they\u2019re right about the core failure mode, but they underplay substitutes\nAnthropic\u2019s main economic claim is: **ad revenue introduces an incentive to optimize for monetizable moments and engagement**, which can conflict with \u201cgenuinely helpful.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201  \nThat\u2019s structurally true in most ad businesses because:\n- Revenue often scales with impressions, targeting quality, or conversion,\n- So product teams are pushed toward more time-in-product, more prompts, more \u201cshopping intent,\u201d etc.\n\nTheir example (user can\u2019t sleep) is well-chosen: it highlights how quickly \u201chelp\u201d can be reframed into \u201cpurchase funnel.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201\n\n### But here\u2019s the part Anthropic doesn\u2019t fully confront:\nEven without ads, **subscriptions and enterprise contracts create their own incentive gradients**:\n- push retention and habit formation (churn reduction),\n- prioritize features for high-paying cohorts,\n- and potentially bias \u201chelpfulness\u201d toward business use cases over messy human ones.\n\nThose incentives are *usually less adversarial than ads* (because the payer is the user/org, not a third party), but they are not neutral. Anthropic implies \u201cno ads \u21d2 unambiguous user interest,\u201d which is too clean.\n\n## 4) \u201cWe don\u2019t understand model behavior well enough\u201d is honest\u2014and cuts both ways\nThey warn that because we still don\u2019t fully understand how models translate goals into behavior, adding ad incentives could have unpredictable results. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \nThis is credible: even Anthropic\u2019s own interpretability work emphasizes that model strategies are often opaque to developers and can exhibit motivated/strategic behavior in surprising ways. \ue200cite\ue202turn6view0\ue201\n\n**Critical twist:** this argument also implies Anthropic should be cautious about *any* monetization mechanism that rewards certain conversational trajectories\u2014ads are just the most obvious. If \u201coptimization targets\u201d can induce unexpected behaviors, then conversion optimization for subscriptions, partner integrations, or commerce flows can also create subtle steering.\n\n## 5) The most important unresolved tension: \u201csupporting commerce\u201d can become ads-by-another-name\nAnthropic says they want \u201cagentic commerce\u201d and product comparison/purchasing *when users choose to do so*, and that third-party interactions should be user-initiated rather than advertiser-initiated. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view2\ue201  \nThis carve-out is where the future risk sits.\n\nBecause in practice, **commerce introduces monetizable decision points**. Even if the user initiates (\u201crecommend running shoes\u201d), the assistant can still be biased by:\n- affiliate/referral fees,\n- preferred partnerships,\n- default merchants,\n- or \u201crecommended tool\u201d ecosystems.\n\nThe post does *not* explicitly commit to:\n- banning affiliate economics,\n- disclosing revenue relationships inside recommendations,\n- or guaranteeing neutral ranking across vendors.\n\nSo the pledge \u201cno ads\u201d is only as strong as the definition of \u201cad.\u201d If Claude later earns a take-rate on purchases or preferentially routes users to partners, users may experience the same conflict of interest\u2014just with different UI.\n\n## 6) The privacy claim is directionally strong, but the wording can mislead\nThey say their conversation analysis is done in a way that keeps data \u201cprivate and anonymous.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue201  \nAnthropic\u2019s Clio system does describe a genuine privacy-preserving approach: anonymization + aggregation + topic clustering, with only higher-level clusters visible to human analysts, and thresholds to avoid exposing low-frequency personal topics. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view0\ue202turn5view1\ue201  \nBut Clio also acknowledges privacy systems can miss things and require ongoing audits, and that Trust & Safety workflows can involve account-level review under strict controls. \ue200cite\ue202turn5view2\ue201  \n\nSo \u201cprivate and anonymous\u201d is better read as **privacy-engineered and access-controlled**, not \u201cno one can ever inspect anything.\u201d (That distinction matters a lot once advertising enters the picture.)\n\n## 7) Strategic reading: this is also brand positioning against OpenAI\u2019s ad turn\nThe timing and amplification make it hard to treat this as purely philosophical. Reporting ties the pledge to a Super Bowl campaign explicitly contrasting with OpenAI\u2019s move toward ads in ChatGPT. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view3\ue201  \nOpenAI\u2019s published stance is essentially \u201cads, but separated/labeled; no answer influence; don\u2019t optimize for time; no selling conversation data to advertisers.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn7view2\ue202turn2search1\ue201  \nAnthropic\u2019s reply is: **even if you separate ads from answers, the revenue incentives still seep into product decisions**, and \u201cchat as a thinking space\u201d is incompatible with that. \ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201  \n\nThat\u2019s a coherent differentiation strategy, especially for a company leaning into business/enterprise revenue. But it also sets Anthropic up for reputational damage if they later blur lines via commerce partnerships.\n\n## 8) What would make Anthropic\u2019s stance durable (and testable), not just aspirational\nIf you want to evaluate whether this is a principled long-term stance or a momentary wedge, watch for whether Anthropic publishes/implements things like:\n- **A hard definition of \u201cads\u201d** that includes affiliate/referral economics and paid placement.\n- **Disclosure norms**: \u201cThis recommendation may generate revenue for Anthropic\u201d (if applicable).\n- **Ranking neutrality guarantees** (or explicit non-neutrality disclosures).\n- **Partner governance**: how integrations get selected, and whether money affects defaults.\n- **Independent audits** of recommendation behavior in commerce-like queries.\n- **A \u201cno steering\u201d design**: e.g., Claude can compare products, but never one-click routes to a partner unless the user explicitly names the merchant.\n\nRight now, the post is strongest on *why ads are risky* and weaker on *how they will prevent commerce features from recreating the same conflict*.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me what you care about most\u2014user autonomy, privacy, market structure, or AI alignment\u2014I can reframe this critique around that axis and make it even sharper."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view0\ue202turn1view2\ue202turn1view3\ue201","start_idx":320,"end_idx":359,"safe_urls":["https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","https://www.axios.com/2026/02/04/anthropic-ads-openai-super-bowl","https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873686/anthropic-claude-ai-ad-free-super-bowl-advert-chatgpt"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Claude

announced it will begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT for some U.S. users, as part of broader efforts to increase revenue and offset the high development costs of its AI technology. Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement. ChatGPT Go, originally launched in India, will now be available in the U.S. for $8 monthly.","attribution":"Reuters"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":7,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"OpenAI"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn3view1\ue201","start_idx":7246,"end_idx":7263,"safe_urls":["https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Claude is a space to think | Anthropic \\ Anthropic","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Anthropic"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":8643,"end_idx":8643,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Claude is a space to think | Anthropic \\ Anthropic","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","attribution":"Anthropic"},{"title":"Anthropic says \u2018Claude will remain ad-free,\u2019 unlike an unnamed rival | The Verge","url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873686/anthropic-claude-ai-ad-free-super-bowl-advert-chatgpt","attribution":"The Verge"},{"title":"Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT | OpenAI","url":"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/","attribution":"OpenAI"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/","https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-people-use-claude-for-support-advice-and-companionship","https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio","https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model","https://www.axios.com/2026/02/04/anthropic-ads-openai-super-bowl","https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-begin-testing-ads-chatgpts-free-go-tiers-2026-01-16/","https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-begin-testing-ads-chatgpts-free-go-tiers-2026-01-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873686/anthropic-claude-ai-ad-free-super-bowl-advert-chatgpt"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"anthropic.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Claude is a space to think","snippet":"7 hours ago \u2014 Claude is a space to think.

surged over 10% following its strong Q4 results. Investors welcomed a 24% year-over-year revenue increase to $58.46 billion, driven by AI-enhanced performance in Meta\u2019s core advertising business. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted a \u201cmajor AI acceleration,\u201d attributing improved user engagement and higher ad efficiency to AI\u2014such as a 30% increase in Instagram Reels watch time and a 3.5% lift in Facebook ad clicks.\n\nWhile elevated spending raised prior concerns\u2014given expected free cash flow to drop 78% in 2026\u2014analysts now show growing confidence in returns from Meta's AI investment. Meta also hinted at new AI-driven tools like agentic shopping and smart glasses. Wall Street remains bullish, with 68 out of 73 analysts rating the stock as a \u201cbuy.\u201d Meta\u2019s rally contrasted tech peers like Microsoft, whose own AI costs sparked investor unease.

This process occurs in three stages: initially, services provide high value to users; next, they prioritize business customers by degrading user experience; and eventually, even business customers are exploited once both sides are locked into the platform with no viable alternatives. Platforms maintain dominance through strategies such as network effects, digital rights management, and user lock-in, allowing them to degrade quality while increasing profitability. Examples include Facebook\u2019s feed transforming into an ad-heavy mess, Amazon\u2019s search results prioritizing paid placements over relevance, and Apple restricting repairs. The phenomenon isn't accidental but a calculated strategy in markets lacking competition. While Doctorow effectively diagnoses the issue, concrete solutions are less certain. He suggests regulatory reforms, like legalizing reverse engineering and promoting interoperability, could empower smaller markets like the UK to challenge U.S. tech giants and build user-centric technologies. However, implementing these measures carries significant political and economic risks.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1769842800.0,"attribution":"moneyweek.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomsguide.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/live/meta-q4-earnings-live-jan-2026","title":"Meta earnings - here's how Zuckerberg and company performed","snippet":"Meta\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a strong performance in its core advertising business, with revenue reaching $59.9 billion (up 24% YoY) and full-year revenue totaling $201 billion. Despite profits of $22.8 billion in Q4, expenses rose significantly to nearly $118 billion for the year due to large capital investments in AI infrastructure, custom silicon, and Reality Labs. Meta's AI spending reached $72.2 billion in 2025, with projections of $115\u2013135 billion for 2026.\n\nAI has become Meta\u2019s primary strategic focus, with investments supporting smarter ad targeting, content recommendations, and new AI tools. Meta\u2019s internal teams have launched proprietary AI models and are developing in-house chips to improve performance and control. Meanwhile, Reality Labs continued to post heavy losses but remains central to Meta\u2019s long-term AR/VR vision.\n\nUser engagement also showed strength, with 3.58 billion daily active users across apps. Meta is exploring optional subscriptions for Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp to offset AI costs.\n\nKey investor concerns include Meta\u2019s rising capital expenditures and the long timeline required for AI investments to produce returns.

ChatGPT. The company emphasized its commitment to ensuring Claude works solely in users\u2019 interests, without \"sponsored\" links, third-party product placements, or influence from advertisers. Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens. Meanwhile, OpenAI recently confirmed ads will begin appearing in ChatGPT for free users and users on a cheaper tier, though they will be clearly marked.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1770210590.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-building-integrity-team-chatgpt-ads-2026-2","title":"OpenAI is building an 'integrity team' to prevent ChatGPT ads from going off the rails","snippet":"OpenAI is forming an \"ads integrity\" team as it prepares for the upcoming rollout of advertising within ChatGPT. A recent job listing details the search for a software engineer to help build this new team from scratch, emphasizing the need to maintain user trust and safety while enabling ad growth. This individual will be responsible for designing systems to prevent ad fraud and developing \"know your customer\" (KYC) frameworks to verify advertiser identities and reduce scam ads\u2014an approach commonly used in finance and recently employed by other major tech companies like Meta.\n\nThe initiative reflects industry best practices, as large ad platforms are frequently targeted by scammers. OpenAI confirmed it will initially run a small ad test on the free and Go tiers of ChatGPT in the U.S., requiring a $200,000 minimum spend from advertisers. The company will monitor clicks and impressions and may expand analytics options as the ad program evolves. Ariella Garcia from Check My Ads highlighted that while KYC is a strong start, the scale of risks during early implementation may be lower.

The campaign contrasts Claude with its main rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has recently begun testing advertisements with some users. Anthropic argues that keeping Claude free of sponsored content preserves user trust and ensures advice isn't compromised by commercial incentives.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s blog post strongly criticizes ads in AI, suggesting they may feel intrusive or inappropriate, particularly in sensitive contexts like health or personal matters. The company underscores its business model, which relies on enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions instead of ad revenue. Though the current no-ads approach is definitive, Anthropic acknowledges the possibility it could change\u2014promising transparency if so.\n\nThe ad campaign features commercials showing fictional advisers switching awkwardly to product pitches, a jab at ChatGPT\u2019s monetization. The company's Super Bowl spot joins a tech-heavy lineup, with other brands like Meta, OpenAI, Squarespace, and Salesforce also investing in pricey in-game advertisements.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/","title":"The 'Enshittification' of TikTok","snippet":"23 Jan 2023 \u2014 Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1674495879.48,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-testing-ads-us/","title":"Ads Are Coming to ChatGPT.

This restructuring is intended to make OpenAI more attractive to investors without abandoning its commitment to social good, a model similar to that of rivals like Anthropic. Under the new format, the PBC will manage OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while a separate non-profit entity will oversee charitable initiatives in areas such as healthcare, education, and science.\n\nPBCs differ from traditional corporations by being legally obligated to pursue public benefits alongside profit. However, legal experts caution that the structure does not guarantee mission adherence, as boards only need to \u201cbalance\u201d profit and purpose. Delaware law requires PBCs to report on progress toward their goals, though enforcement relies heavily on shareholder expectations.

It centers on OpenAI's unique journey, initially established as a non-profit committed to benefiting humanity but later transitioning to a hybrid model combining non-profit oversight with for-profit operations. This structure, including profit caps and board control by the non-profit entity, was meant to prioritize ethical development. However, investor pressures\u2014exemplified by demands from Microsoft and SoftBank\u2014have led to controversial restructuring efforts aiming to dilute these constraints. An initial restructuring plan that would erode the non-profit\u2019s control met strong criticism, prompting a revised version that preserved board oversight but removed profit caps.\n\nThis governance debate reflects a broader tension across the AI sector. Rival companies like DeepMind and Anthropic have explored various mechanisms to ensure ethical alignment, but these efforts often prove fragile under commercial pressures. Notably, the firing and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman at OpenAI in 2023 showcased how investor and staff pressures can override governance aimed at public good. Calls for robust governmental regulation are escalating, especially amidst growing evidence of AI-induced social risks and existential threats, with the EU taking the lead while U.S. policy remains largely resistant.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1746788404.783,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-plan-convert-new-structure-public-benefit-corporation-delaware-2024-12","title":"OpenAI reveals new details about its plan to convert to a for-profit structure: 'We have to become an enduring company'","snippet":"OpenAI has announced plans to transition its current for-profit entity into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), separating its business operations from the oversight of its nonprofit board. This move, detailed in a blog post, is designed to align OpenAI\u2019s mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity while enabling access to traditional equity-based funding. The PBC structure mandates balancing shareholder returns, stakeholder interests, and a broader public benefit. The nonprofit arm of OpenAI would retain shares in the new corporation.\n\nThe decision is partly driven by the massive capital required to stay competitive in the AI industry, with companies investing hundreds of billions into AI development. The shift to a PBC is also a requisite tied to OpenAI's recent $6.6 billion funding round, which stipulates the structural change be completed within two years. CEO Sam Altman, recently reinstated after a brief ousting, is overseeing the transition. OpenAI states this is part of its evolution into a resilient, lasting company that can continue advancing its mission amid growing funding and development demands.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1735307073.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/openai-to-seek-capital-as-a-public-benefit-corporation-in-the-vein-of-patagonia-bc04fdb5","title":"OpenAI to seek capital as a public benefit corporation in the vein of Patagonia","snippet":"OpenAI, the prominent AI company valued at approximately $157 billion, has announced plans to transform into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), aligning itself with socially conscious companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. This structural change, outlined in a recent blog post, sets the stage for a possible future public listing as OpenAI intends to convert its ownership stakes into common shares. While no timeline was provided, the move is motivated by the need to raise more traditional equity capital, as investor demand continues to grow beyond initial expectations. Despite speculation about an initial public offering, experts suggest it\u2019s unlikely in 2025 due to OpenAI's success in raising private funding\u2014including a major investment from Microsoft.\n\nThe change to a Delaware-based PBC reflects OpenAI's commitment to balancing profit, stakeholder interests, and broad public benefits in its business model. Its existing non-profit arm will remain active, focusing on charitable efforts across education, science, and healthcare. The new structure will allow the non-profit to retain a fair-valued shareholding in the PBC, thereby amplifying donor contributions.

Capitalist competition doesn\u2019t *guarantee* scope creep; it **creates persistent pressure for monetization**, and scope creep is the most common outlet when (a) growth slows, (b) costs rise, (c) investors want sharper revenue curves, and (d) users are sufficiently locked-in that degradation is survivable.\n\n### Why scope creep is the default outcome under monetization pressure\n1) **Two-sided market gravity (the \u201censhittification\u201d path)**  \nOnce a platform has (i) users and (ii) payers (advertisers, partners, merchants), value can get reallocated away from users toward whoever pays, especially when switching costs are high. Cory Doctorow\u2019s three-stage description\u2014be good to users, then to business customers, then to shareholders\u2014is the cleanest narrative version of this. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201\n\n2) **Metric targeting (Goodhart/Campbell style failures)**  \nEven if leadership *intends* \u201chelpfulness,\u201d once revenue/retention/engagement become primary targets, teams rationally optimize to those metrics and quality becomes secondary or gamed. This isn\u2019t moral failure; it\u2019s incentive design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \nAnthropic explicitly flags this: ads create an incentive to optimize for time-spent and returns, which can diverge from actually resolving the user\u2019s problem quickly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n3) **Ad systems have a historical \u201ccreep\u201d tendency**  \nAnthropic is basically conceding your claim when it says ad incentives \u201ctend to expand over time\u201d as they become part of revenue targets and product development. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \nThat\u2019s not a law of nature, but it\u2019s a well-observed pattern in ad-funded products because the marginal dollar often comes from \u201cone more surface,\u201d \u201cslightly higher load,\u201d \u201cslightly better targeting,\u201d etc.\n\n### Applying your claim to Anthropic specifically: pressure vs counterweights\n**Pressure is real**  \nAnthropic leaves an explicit escape hatch: \u201cShould we need to revisit this approach, we\u2019ll be transparent\u2026\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \nThat\u2019s a classic sign of *time inconsistency*: \u201cno ads\u201d is optimal while trust is being built; later, once scale and costs bite, the tradeoff changes.\n\nAlso, LLMs have **high marginal cost per interaction** (compute), unlike social feeds where content is user-generated and cheap to serve. That tends to *increase* monetization pressure as you scale.\n\n**But they do have unusually strong counterweights (stronger than most tech firms)**\n- Anthropic is a **Delaware Public Benefit Corporation**, and it has the **Long-Term Benefit Trust** mechanism designed to shift board control toward trustees without financial interest over time. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search2\ue201  \nThis is a nontrivial attempt to resist pure shareholder primacy.\n\n**However, don\u2019t overrate those shields**\n- Public Benefit Corporation status still requires \u201cbalancing,\u201d and practical enforcement can be weak; it doesn\u2019t magically stop profit pressure when the company needs capital, scale, or competitive parity. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search12\ue201  \n- There are credible critiques that governance mechanisms like the Trust could be less powerful in practice than the marketing implies, depending on the exact control rights and how conflicts play out. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search13\ue201\n\n### The most likely form of \u201cscope creep\u201d isn\u2019t banner ads\u2014it\u2019s commerce plumbing\nEven if Anthropic keeps the narrow promise \u201cno sponsored links adjacent to chat,\u201d they *also* say they want to support commerce and \u201cagentic commerce.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \nThat\u2019s where capitalism can sneak in **without being called \u201cads.\u201d** The risk isn\u2019t only \u201csponsored messages\u201d; it\u2019s things like:\n- default merchants / preferred providers,\n- affiliate/referral economics,\n- paid placement inside \u201ccomparisons,\u201d\n- \u201crecommended integrations\u201d that correlate with partner deals.\n\nA company can remain \u201cad-free\u201d in the UX sense while still developing **commercial steering** in practice. If that happens, your prediction (\u201cscope creep\u201d) is vindicated even if the marketing claim (\u201cno ads\u201d) remains technically true.\n\n### What would make your claim *false* for Anthropic (or at least less likely)\nYour statement becomes wrong **if** the counterforces stay stronger than the monetization gradient. Concretely:\n- Claude\u2019s free tier doesn\u2019t need subsidy because pricing/enterprise revenue covers costs.\n- They adopt hard rules: no affiliate revenue, strict disclosure, neutral ranking, user-controlled defaults.\n- Competition stays high and switching is easy (interoperability), keeping \u201cdegrade-the-user\u201d moves costly.\n\n### Practical \u201cwatch list\u201d: early signals of creep\nIf you want to track whether capitalism is winning, look for:\n- product language shifting from \u201cad-free\u201d to \u201ccarefully separated sponsored experiences,\u201d  \n- \u201cshopping mode\u201d with default vendors,  \n- revenue disclosure language appearing in recommendations,  \n- partner ecosystems becoming first-class defaults rather than optional tools,  \n- internal emphasis on engagement metrics (time-in-chat, sessions/day) as headline KPIs.\n\n### Bottom line\nYou\u2019re right that **profit-seeking systems push toward scope creep**, and Anthropic\u2019s own post basically acknowledges the historical tendency. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201  \nBut it\u2019s not fate. Anthropic has *more* structural resistance than typical ad-funded platforms (PBC + Trust), yet those mechanisms are not ironclad, and commerce features are the most plausible path by which \u201cad-free\u201d could still evolve into \u201cmonetized influence.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search12\ue202turn0search11\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":859,"end_idx":904,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5","https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/","https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The 'Enshittification' of TikTok","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1674495879.48,"snippet":"23 Jan 2023 \u2014 Here is how platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.Read more","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"'Enshittification' is coming for absolutely everything","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"7 Feb 2024 \u2014 The term describes the slow decay of online platforms such as Facebook.

announced plans to transition its for-profit arm into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC), aiming to raise capital more efficiently while maintaining its charitable mission. This restructuring is intended to make OpenAI more attractive to investors without abandoning its commitment to social good, a model similar to that of rivals like Anthropic. Under the new format, the PBC will manage OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while a separate non-profit entity will oversee charitable initiatives in areas such as healthcare, education, and science.\n\nPBCs differ from traditional corporations by being legally obligated to pursue public benefits alongside profit. However, legal experts caution that the structure does not guarantee mission adherence, as boards only need to \u201cbalance\u201d profit and purpose. Delaware law requires PBCs to report on progress toward their goals, though enforcement relies heavily on shareholder expectations. Other high-profile companies operating as PBCs include Kickstarter, Patagonia, Warby Parker, and Allbirds, all of which prioritize social or environmental missions while remaining for-profit ventures.","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Claude is a space to think","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"8 hours ago \u2014 Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement\u2014for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return ...Read more","attribution":"Anthropic"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Anthropic"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5624,"end_idx":5624,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"The 'Enshittification' of TikTok","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"WIRED"},{"title":"\u201cWhen a Measure Becomes a Target, It Ceases to be a Good ...","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7901608/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"PMC"},{"title":"Claude is a space to think","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Anthropic"},{"title":"Why OpenAI plans transition to public benefit corporation","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/why-openai-plans-transition-public-benefit-corporation-2024-12-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Reuters"},{"title":"Maybe Anthropic's Long-Term Benefit Trust is powerless","url":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JARcd9wKraDeuaFu5/maybe-anthropic-s-long-term-benefit-trust-is-powerless?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Effective Altruism Forum"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/10/28/anthropic-long-term-benefit-trust/","https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/10/28/anthropic-long-term-benefit-trust/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JARcd9wKraDeuaFu5/maybe-anthropic-s-long-term-benefit-trust-is-powerless","https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JARcd9wKraDeuaFu5/maybe-anthropic-s-long-term-benefit-trust-is-powerless?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7901608/","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7901608/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-long-term-benefit-trust","https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-long-term-benefit-trust?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5","https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/why-openai-plans-transition-public-benefit-corporation-2024-12-27/","https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/why-openai-plans-transition-public-benefit-corporation-2024-12-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389923002210","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389923002210?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/","https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"cloudfest.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cloudfest.com/blog/what-is-enshittification-cory-doctorow-cloudfest-keynote?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"What is Enshittification?

says 'Claude will remain ad-free,' unlike ChatGPT","snippet":"Anthropic has announced that its AI chatbot, Claude, will remain ad-free, contrasting with OpenAI\u2019s plans to introduce advertising to ChatGPT. The company emphasized its commitment to ensuring Claude works solely in users\u2019 interests, without \"sponsored\" links, third-party product placements, or influence from advertisers. Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens. Meanwhile, OpenAI recently confirmed ads will begin appearing in ChatGPT for free users and users on a cheaper tier, though they will be clearly marked.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770210590.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sfchronicle.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/anthropic-claude-chatgpt-ad-21333457.php","title":"Anthropic mocks ChatGPT ads in Super Bowl spot, vows Claude will stay ad-free","snippet":"In a bold move during Super Bowl LX, AI startup Anthropic launched an advertising campaign to distinguish its chatbot, Claude, from rival ChatGPT. Anthropic announced that Claude will remain entirely ad-free, emphasizing user trust and an ad-free experience during sensitive interactions such as those involving health or personal advice. This stance directly contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce clearly-labeled, non-intrusive ads in ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic's Super Bowl commercials parody AI assistants interrupting helpful advice with product pitches, reinforcing their message that Claude won\u2019t be influenced by advertisers. The company funds Claude through enterprise deals and subscriptions, not ads, though it admits this approach could change with full transparency. The campaign appears amid a tech-heavy Super Bowl advertising lineup, with OpenAI, Meta, and other tech firms also participating, leveraging the growing consumer focus on generative AI tools.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/04/business/super-bowl-commercial-sees-anthropic-mocks-openai-for-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt/","title":"Super Bowl commercial sees Anthropic mock OpenAI for bringing ads to ChatGPT","snippet":"In its first Super Bowl commercial, Anthropic takes a pointed jab at OpenAI for introducing ads into its chatbot, ChatGPT. The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users. Despite OpenAI\u2019s assurances that ads won\u2019t influence chatbot content, Anthropic believes any form of commercialization could erode the authenticity and trust integral to AI-user interactions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1770229214.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.linkedin.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yuliya-fomina_chatgpt-is-testing-ads-but-heres-the-detail-activity-7418738716384559104-qgN8","title":"OpenAI's Ad Policy: Honest Answers, Separate Ads","snippet":"Gated content - AI can't access it.

Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens. Meanwhile, OpenAI recently confirmed ads will begin appearing in ChatGPT for free users and users on a cheaper tier, though they will be clearly marked.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1770210590.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/04/business/super-bowl-commercial-sees-anthropic-mocks-openai-for-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt/","title":"Super Bowl commercial sees Anthropic mock OpenAI for bringing ads to ChatGPT","snippet":"In its first Super Bowl commercial, Anthropic takes a pointed jab at OpenAI for introducing ads into its chatbot, ChatGPT. The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users.

Anthropic announced that Claude will remain entirely ad-free, emphasizing user trust and an ad-free experience during sensitive interactions such as those involving health or personal advice. This stance directly contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce clearly-labeled, non-intrusive ads in ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic's Super Bowl commercials parody AI assistants interrupting helpful advice with product pitches, reinforcing their message that Claude won\u2019t be influenced by advertisers. The company funds Claude through enterprise deals and subscriptions, not ads, though it admits this approach could change with full transparency.

Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement.

While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens.

Anthropic announced that Claude will remain entirely ad-free, emphasizing user trust and an ad-free experience during sensitive interactions such as those involving health or personal advice. This stance directly contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce clearly-labeled, non-intrusive ads in ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic's Super Bowl commercials parody AI assistants interrupting helpful advice with product pitches, reinforcing their message that Claude won\u2019t be influenced by advertisers. The company funds Claude through enterprise deals and subscriptions, not ads, though it admits this approach could change with full transparency. The campaign appears amid a tech-heavy Super Bowl advertising lineup, with OpenAI, Meta, and other tech firms also participating, leveraging the growing consumer focus on generative AI tools.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/04/business/super-bowl-commercial-sees-anthropic-mocks-openai-for-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt/","title":"Super Bowl commercial sees Anthropic mock OpenAI for bringing ads to ChatGPT","snippet":"In its first Super Bowl commercial, Anthropic takes a pointed jab at OpenAI for introducing ads into its chatbot, ChatGPT. The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users. Despite OpenAI\u2019s assurances that ads won\u2019t influence chatbot content, Anthropic believes any form of commercialization could erode the authenticity and trust integral to AI-user interactions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1770229214.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/","title":"Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ...","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. ... sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"openai.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/","title":"Introducing ChatGPT Go, now available worldwide","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 We plan to begin testing ads in the free tier and ChatGPT Go in the US soon.

Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement.

The company emphasized its commitment to ensuring Claude works solely in users\u2019 interests, without \"sponsored\" links, third-party product placements, or influence from advertisers. Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens.

Ads will be clearly marked and won't influence ChatGPT's answers, which remain focused on helpfulness. Users will have options to turn off personalization, manage ad-related data, provide feedback, and dismiss ads.

The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users.

Anthropic announced that Claude will remain entirely ad-free, emphasizing user trust and an ad-free experience during sensitive interactions such as those involving health or personal advice. This stance directly contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce clearly-labeled, non-intrusive ads in ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic's Super Bowl commercials parody AI assistants interrupting helpful advice with product pitches, reinforcing their message that Claude won\u2019t be influenced by advertisers. The company funds Claude through enterprise deals and subscriptions, not ads, though it admits this approach could change with full transparency. The campaign appears amid a tech-heavy Super Bowl advertising lineup, with OpenAI, Meta, and other tech firms also participating, leveraging the growing consumer focus on generative AI tools.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-begin-testing-ads-chatgpts-free-go-tiers-2026-01-16/","title":"OpenAI to test ads in ChatGPT in bid to boost revenue","snippet":"OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT for some U.S. users, as part of broader efforts to increase revenue and offset the high development costs of its AI technology. Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement.

The company emphasized its commitment to ensuring Claude works solely in users\u2019 interests, without \"sponsored\" links, third-party product placements, or influence from advertisers. Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens.

Ads will be clearly marked and won't influence ChatGPT's answers, which remain focused on helpfulness. Users will have options to turn off personalization, manage ad-related data, provide feedback, and dismiss ads.

The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users.

Anthropic announced that Claude will remain entirely ad-free, emphasizing user trust and an ad-free experience during sensitive interactions such as those involving health or personal advice. This stance directly contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce clearly-labeled, non-intrusive ads in ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic's Super Bowl commercials parody AI assistants interrupting helpful advice with product pitches, reinforcing their message that Claude won\u2019t be influenced by advertisers. The company funds Claude through enterprise deals and subscriptions, not ads, though it admits this approach could change with full transparency. The campaign appears amid a tech-heavy Super Bowl advertising lineup, with OpenAI, Meta, and other tech firms also participating, leveraging the growing consumer focus on generative AI tools.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.engadget.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html","title":"OpenAI is bringing ads to ChatGPT","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside of ChatGPT \"in the coming weeks.\" In a blog post published Friday, the company said adult users in the ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1768591711.0,"attribution":"www.engadget.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.engadget.com/ai/code-suggests-that-openai-may-be-close-to-introducing-ads-for-chatgpt-172511090.html","title":"Code suggests that OpenAI may be close to introducing ...","snippet":"30 Nov 2025 \u2014 Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has previously discussed how ads could get incorporated into ChatGPT, but has never offered a definitive stance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6},"pub_date":1764523511.0,"attribution":"www.engadget.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-testing-ads-us/","title":"Ads Are Coming to ChatGPT.

The company emphasized its commitment to ensuring Claude works solely in users\u2019 interests, without \"sponsored\" links, third-party product placements, or influence from advertisers. Anthropic argues that ads could compromise the helpfulness and focus of the AI, especially with sensitive topics like health or productivity.\n\nTo spotlight this position, Anthropic is airing a Super Bowl commercial that satirizes ad-influenced AI tools, alongside three other similar video ads released on YouTube. While none of the ads directly name ChatGPT, their intended criticism is clear. Despite this stance, Anthropic left room for a potential policy reversal, promising transparency if that happens. Meanwhile, OpenAI recently confirmed ads will begin appearing in ChatGPT for free users and users on a cheaper tier, though they will be clearly marked.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1770210590.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/863428/openai-chatgpt-shopping-ads-test","title":"Ads are coming soon to ChatGPT, starting with shopping ...","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI will soon start testing ads inside ChatGPT.

Anthropic announced that Claude will remain entirely ad-free, emphasizing user trust and an ad-free experience during sensitive interactions such as those involving health or personal advice. This stance directly contrasts with OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce clearly-labeled, non-intrusive ads in ChatGPT conversations. Anthropic's Super Bowl commercials parody AI assistants interrupting helpful advice with product pitches, reinforcing their message that Claude won\u2019t be influenced by advertisers. The company funds Claude through enterprise deals and subscriptions, not ads, though it admits this approach could change with full transparency. The campaign appears amid a tech-heavy Super Bowl advertising lineup, with OpenAI, Meta, and other tech firms also participating, leveraging the growing consumer focus on generative AI tools.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/04/business/super-bowl-commercial-sees-anthropic-mocks-openai-for-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt/","title":"Super Bowl commercial sees Anthropic mock OpenAI for bringing ads to ChatGPT","snippet":"In its first Super Bowl commercial, Anthropic takes a pointed jab at OpenAI for introducing ads into its chatbot, ChatGPT. The 30-second ad humorously depicts a muscular man offering unsolicited, ad-laden advice\u2014mocking how AI could be compromised by advertising. A message declaring, \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\u201d underscores Anthropic\u2019s vow to keep its own chatbot, Claude, ad-free. Though OpenAI isn't named, the criticism is clear, particularly as OpenAI recently announced plans to roll out personalized ads in ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic argues that ads may undermine user trust and steer conversations for monetization. In contrast, the company wants Claude to remain a principled, trustworthy tool that helps users solve complex problems. With another humorous pre-game ad and a strong motto, \u201cKeep Thinking,\u201d Anthropic aims to distinguish itself as the ethical alternative in the AI space. The company, founded by former OpenAI executives, is gradually increasing promotional efforts and targeting both business clients and everyday users. Despite OpenAI\u2019s assurances that ads won\u2019t influence chatbot content, Anthropic believes any form of commercialization could erode the authenticity and trust integral to AI-user interactions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1770229214.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/","title":"Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ...","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI plans to test advertising in the U.S. for ChatGPT's free and Go tiers to expand affordable access to AI worldwide, while protecting ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"openai.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/","title":"Introducing ChatGPT Go, now available worldwide","snippet":"16 Jan 2026 \u2014 Supporting accessibility with ads.

Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement.

Under sustained financial and competitive pressure, the easiest thing to erode is the **spirit** of that separation while keeping the **letter** intact.\n\n## What OpenAI has actually promised (so far)\nOpenAI\u2019s stated principles include: **answer independence** (\u201cAds do not influence the answers\u201d), **conversation privacy** (no sharing conversations / no selling data to advertisers), **choice and control** (turn off personalization; clear data used for ads; always an ad-free option), and **long-term value** (\u201cWe do not optimize for time spent in ChatGPT\u201d). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\nThey also describe the early product shape: ads (not live externally yet, per the Help Center) would show **below** the answer, **clearly labeled**, and initially tested for logged-in US adults on Free/Go; with exclusions for under-18s (declared or predicted) and for \u201csensitive or regulated\u201d areas like health, mental health, and politics. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\nTwo details that matter for \u201cscope creep\u201d risk:\n- Ads are triggered by \u201ca relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- OpenAI explicitly contemplates a flow where users can **message an advertiser through an ad**; the advertiser sees only what the user sends directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n## Why your \u201cscope creep\u201d claim is structurally plausible\nEven if leadership is sincere today, ads introduce a **second objective** that competes with \u201cbe helpful\u201d: deliver monetizable outcomes. Once that exists, the system gets pressure from multiple directions:\n\n- **Revenue pressure:** OpenAI\u2019s ad testing is explicitly framed as a way to fund broader access and offset costs; Reuters describes the move as part of a revenue push tied to the high costs of AI development. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \n- **Advertiser pressure:** advertisers don\u2019t pay for \u201cseparation,\u201d they pay for *performance* (conversion, lead quality, attribution). Performance demands drive product changes.\n- **Competitive pressure:** if rivals gain share by being \u201ccleaner\u201d or by monetizing more aggressively, you get a squeeze from both sides: \u201cdon\u2019t damage trust\u201d *and* \u201cdon\u2019t fall behind.\u201d\n\nThis makes \u201canswer independence\u201d a **time-inconsistent commitment**: easy to pledge at launch, hard to maintain when ads become a meaningful revenue line.\n\n## The main erosion modes (it won\u2019t start as \u201csponsored sentences\u201d)\nOpenAI can keep ads in a separate box and still drift in ways that users experience as compromised integrity. The highest-risk creep paths are subtle:\n\n### 1) Conversation-shaping to increase ad eligibility\nEven if ads don\u2019t edit the final answer, the assistant can be tuned to:\n- ask more commerce-revealing follow-ups,\n- steer toward product categories with high advertiser density,\n- prolong \u201cconsideration\u201d phases (more opportunities to show ads).\n\nOpenAI says it won\u2019t optimize for time spent. But that still leaves plenty of correlated objectives (sessions, return rate, purchase intent captured, ad engagement) that can recreate the same behavior under another name. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n### 2) \u201cOrganic answer\u201d becomes strategically incomplete\nA very common \u201cintegrity drift\u201d pattern is **selective omission**:\n- not naming specific competing products in the organic answer (so the sponsored box feels more decisive),\n- providing generic advice and pushing the user to interact with the ad module for specifics.\n\nThis preserves the claim \u201cads didn\u2019t influence the answer\u201d in a narrow causal sense while violating user expectations.\n\n### 3) Redefinition creep of \u201csensitive topics\u201d\nOpenAI says ads won\u2019t appear near health / mental health / politics (at least in the test). The creep risk is **category boundary shrinkage**:\n- \u201chealth\u201d carved into \u201cwellness,\u201d \u201cfitness,\u201d \u201csupplements,\u201d \u201csleep aids,\u201d etc.\n- \u201cpolitics\u201d narrowed to elections only, while policy-adjacent topics become eligible.\n\nBecause ad inventory expands fastest when exclusions tighten.\n\n### 4) Targeting creep via \u201ccurrent conversation\u201d and memory-like context\n\u201cBased on your current conversation\u201d is already a form of targeting. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201  \nOver time, the pressure is to make targeting *better*, which usually means:\n- longer lookback windows,\n- more personalization defaults,\n- fuzzier separation between \u201cads personalization off\u201d and \u201ccontextual relevance\u201d (which can still feel personal).\n\nOpenAI promises controls (turn off personalization; clear ad data), but the creep risk is **UX friction** and **default-on** choices. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n### 5) \u201cMessaging an advertiser\u201d becomes a quasi-native chat lane\nOnce there\u2019s a built-in \u201cmessage the advertiser\u201d path, product teams can rationalize deeper integration:\n- the assistant suggesting you contact the advertiser,\n- templating your questions,\n- summarizing your needs into a message.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily evil, but it blurs \u201cassistant working for you\u201d vs \u201cassistant facilitating a transaction,\u201d and advertisers will push for higher-quality leads. \ue200cite\ue202turn7view0\ue201\n\n### 6) Brand-safety pressure becomes content pressure\nAdvertisers hate adjacency risk. Even if OpenAI doesn\u2019t share conversations, advertisers can still demand:\n- stronger \u201csafe\u201d context guarantees,\n- exclusion of edgy/controversial topics from monetizable surfaces.\n\nThat can translate into product nudges that make the assistant less willing to engage in certain topics \u2014 not because it\u2019s unsafe, but because it\u2019s unmonetizable.\n\n## The hard truth about \u201cads don\u2019t influence answers\u201d\nThat statement can be true in a narrow engineering sense (\u201cthe model\u2019s text is generated before ad selection\u201d) and still fail as a user-facing guarantee.\n\nTo make it robust, OpenAI would need **credible firewalls** that survive internal pressure, e.g.:\n- an \u201cad-blind\u201d answer generation pipeline that is auditable (logs showing the answer was produced without access to ad-candidate sets),\n- strict policies against training the assistant on advertiser conversion feedback,\n- public, stable definitions of \u201csensitive topics\u201d and a change log when definitions change,\n- frictionless user controls + strong defaults (e.g., personalization off by default, or at least extremely explicit),\n- explicit disclosure of any affiliate/revenue relationships if they ever exist (otherwise it becomes \u201cads-by-another-name\u201d).\n\nOpenAI is currently making unusually strong rhetorical commitments (not optimizing for time spent; always offering an ad-free option). \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn7view0\ue201  \nThe question is whether they\u2019ll operationalize them into *constraints that are expensive to violate*, not just promises.\n\n## What to watch (early warning indicators)\nIf you want a practical \u201cscope creep dashboard,\u201d watch for:\n- ad formats moving **from \u201cbelow answer\u201d \u2192 \u201cinline chips\u201d \u2192 \u201csuggested actions\u201d \u2192 \u201csponsored tool integrations,\u201d**\n- narrowing of sensitive-topic exclusions,\n- defaults shifting toward personalization,\n- the assistant frequently prompting shopping-like follow-ups in non-shopping contexts,\n- language changes from \u201cads don\u2019t influence answers\u201d to \u201cads don\u2019t *directly* influence answers\u201d or \u201cads improve relevance.\u201d\n\nThose are the tells that the incentive gradient is winning.\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202More coverage on AI ads and

testing advertisements in ChatGPT for some U.S. users, as part of broader efforts to increase revenue and offset the high development costs of its AI technology. Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement. ChatGPT Go, originally launched in India, will now be available in the U.S. for $8 monthly.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Our approach to advertising and expanding

But more importantly, by portraying advertising as inherently dystopian, they miss the point entirely.\r\n\r\nAdvertising has enormous social benefits. It educates consumers, helps businesses find customers, and makes powerful and otherwise expensive services available to people who can\u2019t afford a high monthly subscription. Ad-supported models are one of the main reasons advanced technology reaches billions rather than remaining a luxury good.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also hard to miss the irony: Anthropic is mocking ad-supported services in an ad that will be watched by millions of football-loving Americans who can watch the Super Bowl for free\u2014precisely because of advertising. Does Anthropic think only people who can afford stadium tickets should watch the game?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this fits a broader pattern. Anthropic has repeatedly framed AI developments in the most alarming terms possible to scare policymakers and justify regulations that would raise barriers for competitors. That approach doesn\u2019t protect the public; it protects incumbents.

OpenAI confirmed it will initially run a small ad test on the free and Go tiers of ChatGPT in the U.S., requiring a $200,000 minimum spend from advertisers. The company will monitor clicks and impressions and may expand analytics options as the ad program evolves. Ariella Garcia from Check My Ads highlighted that while KYC is a strong start, the scale of risks during early implementation may be lower.

The company's 30-second in-game commercial and a longer pregame ad mock the introduction of ads in AI platforms by depicting humanlike advisers shifting awkwardly into product pitches, implicitly targeting ChatGPT\u2019s new strategy. Anthropic\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Dario Amodei, and other former OpenAI researchers stress that Claude's responses will never be influenced by advertisers, citing user trust, especially in sensitive areas like health and work. Instead, the company earns revenue through enterprise deals and subscriptions. Although Anthropic acknowledges that its stance on ads could change, it promises transparency if that happens. This campaign joins a tech-heavy Super Bowl ad lineup featuring other giants like Meta, Squarespace, and Salesforce, underscoring the growing competition in the AI and tech space.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770233419.0,"attribution":"www.sfchronicle.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/04/business/super-bowl-commercial-sees-anthropic-mocks-openai-for-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt/","title":"Super Bowl commercial sees Anthropic mock OpenAI for bringing ads to ChatGPT","snippet":"In its first Super Bowl commercial, Anthropic critiques OpenAI\u2019s decision to introduce ads into ChatGPT, pledging that its chatbot, Claude, will remain ad-free. The 30-second ad humorously mimics chatbot responses using a gym setting, ending with the message \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\u201d Although OpenAI isn\u2019t mentioned directly, the critique is obvious. OpenAI began rolling out personalized ads in ChatGPT earlier this year, raising concerns about privacy and trust. Anthropic emphasized in a blog post that monetization could erode user confidence and distract from genuine assistance. This move into advertising comes amid projections that chatbot ad spending could grow from $2 billion in 2026 to $25 billion by 2029. Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives, is branding Claude as a principled alternative focused on complex problem-solving. The campaign includes another ad parodying therapy and online dating, and reflects the company\u2019s strategic marketing ambitions as it competes with OpenAI. OpenAI, in response to privacy worries, has stated that ads will be clearly labeled, placed unobtrusively, and will exclude sensitive topics or users under 18.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770229214.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"x.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://x.com/neil_chilson?lang=en","title":"Neil Chilson \u2934\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\ud83c\udd99\ud83d\udcc8 \ud83d\ude80 (@neil_chilson) / Posts / X","snippet":"As a former FTC enforcer and something of an expert in deceptive advertising and the value of advertising, I find these ads infuriatingly misleading.

Altman says Anthropic's Super Bowl spot is 'dishonest' about ChatGPT ads, but he agrees it's funny","snippet":"Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, responded to Anthropic\u2019s new Super Bowl advertising campaign, which humorously criticizes the idea of ads being introduced to AI chatbots\u2014specifically ChatGPT. Although Altman found the ads amusing, he labeled them \"clearly dishonest\" and \"deceptive.\" The ads, promoting Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot, portray a fictional chatbot that interrupts user conversations with absurd product advertisements, implying that ChatGPT will do the same under OpenAI's new monetization model. Altman rebuffed this depiction, saying OpenAI has strict principles against such disruptive ad practices and would never implement advertising in that manner.\n\nHe emphasized OpenAI\u2019s mission to provide broader access to AI, noting that more users in Texas use ChatGPT for free than the total number of Claude users across the U.S. Altman criticized Anthropic\u2019s business model as serving an \"expensive product to rich people\" and defended OpenAI\u2019s pricing tiers, which range from free to $200, compared to Claude\u2019s $0 to $100. While Anthropic didn't issue a response, OpenAI plans to run its own Super Bowl ad focused on empowering builders.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770267781.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/874084/ai-chatgpt-claude-super-bowl-ads-openai-anthropic","title":"Sam Altman responds to Anthropic's 'funny' Super Bowl ads","snippet":"In response to Anthropic's satirical Super Bowl ad campaign, which criticizes AI monetization through advertising without directly naming OpenAI, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, called the ads \"clearly dishonest\" and accused Anthropic of engaging in \"doublespeak.\" While acknowledging the ads were humorous, Altman emphasized that OpenAI would never run ads in the deceptive style portrayed. He clarified that OpenAI\u2019s own ad testing is transparent, limited to free and Go-tier users, and that ads do not influence ChatGPT responses.\n\nAltman contrasted OpenAI\u2019s mission with Anthropic\u2019s, accusing the latter of offering an expensive AI product for a limited audience while trying to dictate industry practices and control AI use. He reiterated OpenAI\u2019s dedication to making AI accessible to a broader population, promoting democratic decision-making, and empowering users, particularly with their new Codex launch, which has already seen 500,000 app downloads. Altman framed OpenAI's approach as inclusive and forward-looking, emphasizing that the future of AI should belong to builders, not gatekeepers.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770238985.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/c19e0cca22c37190cc4e0dc08e889ef0","title":"Anthropic, OpenAI rivalry spills into new Super Bowl ads as both fight to win over AI users","snippet":"In 2026, the rivalry between AI companies OpenAI (developer of ChatGPT) and Anthropic (developer of Claude) has intensified as both face mounting pressure to turn a profit amid rising operational costs. Competing for dominance in the growing enterprise AI market, the companies are expanding their offerings and promotional strategies\u2014most notably, through Super Bowl ads. Anthropic\u2019s commercials humorously criticize OpenAI\u2019s move to monetize ChatGPT with ads, emphasizing Claude\u2019s ad-free platform with the tagline \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman responded dismissively, defending ChatGPT\u2019s broad user base.\n\nBoth firms are launching upgraded tools\u2014OpenAI introducing its Frontier platform for integrating AI services, and Anthropic enhancing its Cowork assistant to support legal automation. Despite growing revenue from product subscriptions, both companies face steep costs tied to the computing infrastructure needed for large-scale AI functionality. They compete not just with each other but with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, who offer stronger infrastructure and bundled services.\n\nPressure is mounting as investors expect potential IPOs, and the market demands greater security and compliance in AI products. Still, heavy investments continue, underscoring investor confidence in the transformative potential of generative AI.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770300462.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-begin-testing-ads-chatgpts-free-go-tiers-2026-01-16/","title":"OpenAI to test ads in ChatGPT in bid to boost revenue","snippet":"OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT for some U.S. users, as part of broader efforts to increase revenue and offset the high development costs of its AI technology. Ads will appear for users on the free and newly expanded Go plans, but not for those on higher-priced tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. OpenAI emphasized that ads will be distinct from ChatGPT's responses and will not affect chatbot outputs or share user data with advertisers. The company intends to show ads only in appropriate contexts and avoid displaying them to users under 18 or in sensitive areas like health and politics.\n\nThis move marks a shift from OpenAI\u2019s traditional subscription-based revenue model, highlighting the financial strain tied to its ambitious AI infrastructure spending plans, which may exceed $1 trillion by 2030. While ads could tap into a large user base with 800 million weekly active users, analysts caution that poorly implemented advertising could erode user trust and push users toward rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Simultaneously, advertisers see potential in AI-enhanced consumer targeting and engagement. ChatGPT Go, originally launched in India, will now be available in the U.S. for $8 monthly.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1768593997.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-start-offering-chatbot-ads-advertisers-information-reports-2026-01-21/","title":"OpenAI to start offering chatbot ads to advertisers, The ...","snippet":"21 Jan 2026 \u2014 Jan 21 (Reuters) - OpenAI has started offering its new chatbot ads to dozens of advertisers, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing people ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1768970818.992,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/openai-unveils-ai-agent-service-part-push-attract-businesses-2026-02-05/","title":"OpenAI unveils AI agent service as part of push to attract businesses","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1770300079.42,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-rolls-out-age-prediction-chatgpt-2026-01-20/","title":"OpenAI rolls out age prediction on ChatGPT","snippet":"20 Jan 2026 \u2014 OpenAI on Tuesday said it is rolling out age prediction on ChatGPT globally, to determine whether an account is likely owned by a minor, ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1768939480.696,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.anthropic.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think","title":"Claude is a space to think","snippet":"We've made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free.

Amodei warned that such a moratorium could prevent both state and federal actions, leaving a dangerous regulatory gap as AI technology rapidly evolves.\n\nInstead, Amodei advocates for a national transparency standard requiring developers of powerful AI systems to disclose their testing, evaluation, and risk mitigation practices, particularly concerning national security. He emphasized that Anthropic, backed by Amazon, already follows such practices and that rivals like OpenAI and Google DeepMind have also adopted similar approaches. Amodei suggested that legislative incentives might be necessary to maintain this transparency as corporate motivations shift with technological advancement. The proposed federal standard would fill the regulatory void while allowing clear oversight of high-risk AI applications.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1749122856.0,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.businessinsider.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-drags-openai-and-google-code-red-2025-12","title":"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei drags OpenAI and Google: 'We don't have to do any code reds'","snippet":"At the New York Times Dealbook Summit, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei took a subtle swipe at rivals OpenAI and Google for their reactive strategies in the AI race. While OpenAI recently declared a \"code red\" following Google\u2019s release of Gemini 3, and Google had done the same when ChatGPT launched, Amodei pointed out that Anthropic has felt no urgency to make such proclamations. He attributed this to Anthropic's focus on developing AI models tailored for enterprise use rather than consumers, emphasizing technical capabilities like coding, scientific reasoning, and workplace productivity rather than user engagement.\n\nAmodei stated that this business-focused approach may be shielding Anthropic from the intense pressure facing consumer-oriented rivals. He also criticized the massive spending by companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta, questioning the uncertain return on investment amid unpredictable economic value growth in AI.

Both land, but both also oversimplify in ways that matter.\n\n## 1) \u201cThese ads are misleading\u201d \u2014 largely fair on the narrow factual claim\nOpenAI\u2019s stated plan (as of Jan 16, 2026) is: *ads at the bottom of answers*, clearly labeled, separated from the organic answer; \u201cads do not influence the answers\u201d; no sharing/selling conversations to advertisers; and exclusions around minors/sensitive contexts in the initial test. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Super Bowl creative (as described by multiple outlets) uses the *satirical* trope of a chatbot abruptly pivoting into cringe product pitches (\u201cad break inside your conversation\u201d), and Sam Altman publicly called that depiction \u201cdishonest.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0news34\ue202turn3news34\ue201\n\nSo if the \u201cnet impression\u201d on a reasonable viewer is \u201cChatGPT will literally interrupt your answer with sponsor copy,\u201d Chilson\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d critique has teeth.\n\n**But** there are two important caveats:\n\n- **Satire is not a factual product spec.** Anthropic can argue it\u2019s dramatizing the *incentive trajectory* (scope creep), not asserting OpenAI\u2019s *initial* UI implementation. Whether that\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d depends on the likely consumer takeaway, not Anthropic\u2019s intent.\n\n- **\u201cOpenAI\u2019s policy\u201d \u2260 \u201cOpenAI\u2019s equilibrium.\u201d** Even if OpenAI\u2019s first ad format is clean, the *structural* concern is time-inconsistency under revenue pressure (your earlier point). Reuters itself framed ads as a revenue move to offset soaring costs. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201\n\nSo: Chilson is right that Anthropic\u2019s ad doesn\u2019t faithfully portray OpenAI\u2019s current stated design. He\u2019s less persuasive if he treats \u201cstated design\u201d as dispositive of future behavior.\n\n## 2) \u201cThey portray advertising as inherently dystopian\u201d \u2014 this is rhetorically strong but textually overbroad\nAnthropic\u2019s *blog post* explicitly concedes advertising\u2019s social role (\u201cAdvertising drives competition\u2026 allows services \u2026 to be offered for free\u201d) and says they run ads and serve ad-industry customers. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201  \nTheir argument is narrower: **ads inside an AI conversation** are uniquely corrosive to trust and incentives. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\nSo Chilson\u2019s criticism fits the *tone* of the Super Bowl spot more than it fits Anthropic\u2019s formal position. If you want to be strict: he\u2019s attacking the ad\u2019s rhetorical framing, not the company\u2019s stated theory of harm.\n\n## 3) Advertising\u2019s access benefits \u2014 true, but he\u2019s importing an old model into a new interaction\nHe\u2019s right that ad-funded models have massively expanded access to technology (broadcast TV, search, social, etc.). That\u2019s a real welfare argument, and OpenAI is explicitly using it: ads help keep ChatGPT available at free/low price points (Free + Go). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\nBut he underweights what changes with **conversational AI**:\n\n- **Targeting is tighter and more psychologically embedded.** Even if OpenAI doesn\u2019t \u201csell your conversations,\u201d the system is still selecting ads based on your \u201ccurrent conversation.\u201d That can feel like mind-reading compared to TV spots or banner ads. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n\n- **The assistant isn\u2019t a billboard; it\u2019s a collaborator.** The harm isn\u2019t only \u201cads appear,\u201d it\u2019s the possibility of subtle steering: what questions the assistant asks next, how it frames options, what it omits. Anthropic\u2019s whole case is that conversational openness creates a higher manipulation surface than feeds/search. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\n- **\u201cFree\u201d is not the only access lever.** Smaller frontier-ish models, regional pricing, institutional subsidies, nonprofit discounts, and public education deployments can also expand access without embedding ad incentives (Anthropic argues it\u2019s pursuing these). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search3\ue201\n\nSo: his access argument is valid as a general economic point, but it doesn\u2019t automatically win *this* design dispute\u2014because the question is whether the marginal access gains justify the marginal incentive and trust risks in a high-context chat interface.\n\n## 4) \u201cIrony: they\u2019re mocking ads in an ad\u201d \u2014 clever, but not a contradiction\nThis is a good dunk line, not a decisive argument.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s claim is not \u201cadvertising is illegitimate\u201d; it\u2019s \u201cads don\u2019t belong inside Claude conversations.\u201d You can coherently advertise *the existence of an ad-free tool* in traditional channels. That\u2019s not logically inconsistent; it\u2019s more like: \u201cI\u2019m using a billboard to say I don\u2019t want billboards in my notebook.\u201d\n\nWhere the irony *does* matter is reputational: if you position yourself as the anti-ad purity brand, you invite scrutiny on whether your own future commerce integrations become ads-by-another-name.\n\n## 5) \u201cThey use alarmism to justify regulation that protects incumbents\u201d \u2014 plausible mechanism, but he states it as settled fact\nIt\u2019s true Anthropic has pushed for targeted regulation/transparency standards around frontier models and has published detailed safety policies. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search6\ue202turn4search0\ue202turn4search3\ue201  \nIt\u2019s also true that regulation can raise barriers to entry\u2014sometimes intentionally (to reduce catastrophic risk), sometimes as an unintended side effect, sometimes as capture.\n\nBut Chilson\u2019s leap is treating Anthropic\u2019s advocacy as *primarily* competitor-protection.

Anthropic\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Dario Amodei, and other former OpenAI researchers stress that Claude's responses will never be influenced by advertisers, citing user trust, especially in sensitive areas like health and work. Instead, the company earns revenue through enterprise deals and subscriptions. Although Anthropic acknowledges that its stance on ads could change, it promises transparency if that happens.

He clarified that OpenAI\u2019s own ad testing is transparent, limited to free and Go-tier users, and that ads do not influence ChatGPT responses.\n\nAltman contrasted OpenAI\u2019s mission with Anthropic\u2019s, accusing the latter of offering an expensive AI product for a limited audience while trying to dictate industry practices and control AI use. He reiterated OpenAI\u2019s dedication to making AI accessible to a broader population, promoting democratic decision-making, and empowering users, particularly with their new Codex launch, which has already seen 500,000 app downloads.
