Singapore, once a tenancy agreement (TA) is signed\u2014even if the lease term hasn't commenced\u2014it is legally binding.\ue204 \ue203Backing out before the lease starts constitutes a breach of contract, and the consequences largely depend on the specific terms outlined in the TA.\ue204\ue206\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n1. **Security Deposit Forfeiture**: \ue203Typically, landlords require a security deposit (usually one month's rent for a one-year lease or two months' rent for a two-year lease) upon signing the TA.\ue204 \ue203If a tenant terminates the lease early without a valid clause permitting such action, the landlord is generally entitled to forfeit this deposit to cover potential losses \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n2. **Liability for Remaining Rent**: \ue203Beyond forfeiting the security deposit, tenants may be held liable for the rent covering the entire lease term, especially if the TA lacks an early termination clause.\ue204 \ue203Landlords can pursue legal action to recover this amount, although enforcement can be challenging if the tenant has not taken possession of the property \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n3. **Early Termination Clauses**: \ue203Some TAs include clauses like the Diplomatic Clause, allowing tenants to terminate the lease early under specific conditions (e.g., job relocation), usually after a minimum occupancy period and with advance notice.\ue204 \ue203If such clauses are present and applicable, they can provide a lawful exit route.\ue204\ue206\n\n4. **Negotiation and Lease Takeover**: \ue203If the TA lacks provisions for early termination, tenants can negotiate with landlords to find a replacement tenant.\ue204 \ue203While landlords are not obligated to accept this arrangement, it can mitigate their losses and may lead to a more amicable resolution \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n5. **Stamp Duty Remission**: \ue203If the lease is terminated before commencement and hasn't been utilized (e.g., no rent paid, no possession taken), tenants may apply for a stamp duty remission from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).\ue204 \ue203Applications must be made within six months of termination and are subject to specific conditions \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201.\ue204\ue206\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Review the TA**: \ue203Examine the agreement for any clauses related to early termination, penalties, or obligations.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Communicate with the Landlord**: \ue203Engage in open discussions to explore possible solutions, such as finding a replacement tenant or negotiating a settlement.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Seek Legal Advice**: \ue203If disputes arise or if the landlord demands excessive compensation, consult a legal professional to understand your rights and obligations.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **Document All Communications**: \ue203Maintain written records of all interactions with the landlord to protect your interests in case of legal proceedings.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203In summary, while forfeiting the security deposit is a common consequence of early lease termination in Singapore, tenants may also face additional liabilities depending on the TA's terms.\ue204 \ue203Proactive communication and negotiation with the landlord are crucial in mitigating potential losses.\ue204\ue206
