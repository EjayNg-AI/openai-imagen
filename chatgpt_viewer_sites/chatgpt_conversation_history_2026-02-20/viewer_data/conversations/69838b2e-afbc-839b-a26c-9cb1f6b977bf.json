It\u2019s worth adding one sentence: since the points \\((0,25)\\) and \\((80,25)\\) have equal height, the axis of symmetry is midway, \\(x=40\\).\n- Minor: they assume \u201cwire length = \\(y\\)\u201d. That\u2019s true only because the roadbed is the \\(x\\)-axis (\\(y=0\\)), but it\u2019s worth stating explicitly.\n\n### Ambiguities / style (question)\n- The phrase \u201c**15 m horizontally from the origin**\u201d is potentially confusing because the text defines \\(x\\) as distance from **Tower A**, not from \u201cthe origin.\u201d It *looks* like the origin is at Tower A in the diagram, but the text should just say **\u201cfind the wire length at \\(x=15\\)\u201d** or **\u201c15 m from Tower A\u201d**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L8\ue201\n- \u201cVertical supporting wires are spread out in equal intervals\u2026\u201d is **irrelevant** to the math asked (you never use the spacing). It reads like missing information.\n\n---\n\n## Q2 (Bomb height model)\n\n### Mathematical correctness (student)\n- **(i) Correct:** \\(h(0)=\\frac{9}{5}=1.8\\) m. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L12-L23\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L42-L50\ue201\n- **(ii) Correct:** vertex at \\(x=20\\), maximum height \\(h=41.8\\) m. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L24-L26\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L51-L74\ue201\n- **(iii) Essentially correct**, but the rounding is a bit loose:\n  - Exact roots are \\(x=20\\pm\\sqrt{418}\\approx 40.445,\\,-0.445\\).\n  - Student reports \\(40.4\\) and \\(-0.445\\). This is fine if answers are to **3 s.f. / 1 d.p.**, but the question doesn\u2019t specify rounding. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L75-L101\ue201\n\n### Presentation / clarity (student)\n- In the \u201ccomplete the square\u201d step, the line\n  \\[\n  h=-\\frac{1}{10}\\big((x-20)^2-20^2-18\\big)\n  \\]\n  is *correct*, but it\u2019s the sort of line where missing brackets would break the logic\u2014so it\u2019s worth being **extra explicit with brackets** (the PDF version is okay, but students often lose parentheses when writing quickly). \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L59-L72\ue201\n- In (iii), they should state explicitly why the negative root is rejected (e.g. \u201c\\(x\\ge 0\\) because distance travelled can\u2019t be negative\u201d).\n\n### Ambiguities / style (question)\n- You use **\\(h\\)** as:\n  - the *vertex parameter* in Q1\u2019s form \\(y=a(x-h)^2+k\\), \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L6-L7\ue201\n  - and then as the *height variable* in Q2. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L12-L21\ue201  \n  This symbol collision is avoidable and can confuse weaker students. Suggestion: in Q1 write \\(y=a(x-p)^2+q\\) (or similar), or in Q2 use \\(y\\) for height.\n- \u201c\\(x\\) is the horizontal distance travelled\u201d implicitly assumes \\(x=0\\) at the launch point. That\u2019s standard, but you could make it explicit: \u201c\\(x\\) is the horizontal distance from the cannon.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Quick recommended edits (high impact)\n1. Q1(ii): replace \u201c15 m horizontally from the origin\u201d with **\u201cat \\(x=15\\) m (measured from Tower A)\u201d**. \ue200filecite\ue202turn2file0\ue202L5-L8\ue201  \n2.
