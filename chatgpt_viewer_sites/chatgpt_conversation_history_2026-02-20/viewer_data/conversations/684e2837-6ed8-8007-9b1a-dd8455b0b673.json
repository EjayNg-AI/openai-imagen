The framework is structured in **5 progressive stages**:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 STAGE 1: Foundational Self-Awareness and Preparation\n\n### 1.1. **Daily Self-Check-In**\n- Track your own emotional states and their social impact.\n- Use a journal or an app (e.g., Moodnotes or Daylio).\n- Goal: Recognize patterns in your tone, expressions, triggers.\n\n### 1.2. **Voice and Body Calibration**\n- **Mirror work (5 mins/day):** Practice different facial expressions\u2014curiosity, warmth, concern.\n- **Record and review (2x/week):** Record yourself speaking naturally on a topic. Look for monotone, filler words, weak eye contact.\n\n### 1.3. **Intentional Exposure**\n- Identify 2\u20133 recurring social situations (e.g., group chats, meetings, 1-on-1s).\n- Set weekly interaction goals: \"Start 3 conversations\", \"Ask 2 people about themselves\".\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f STAGE 2: Conversational Mastery and Social Adaptability\n\n### 2.1. **Engaging Opener Toolkit**\nPrepare reusable, flexible openers that work across demographics:\n- Children: \u201cWhat\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve done today?\u201d\n- Teens: \u201cWhat\u2019s something you\u2019re into that most people don\u2019t know about?\u201d\n- Adults: \u201cWhat keeps you busy these days?\u201d\n- Elders: \u201cWhat\u2019s something people don\u2019t appreciate enough anymore?\u201d\n\n### 2.2. **Active Listening Routine**\nUse the **3-step loop**:\n- **Mirror** (\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you felt frustrated about that?\u201d)\n- **Probe** (\u201cWhy do you think that happened?\u201d)\n- **Validate** (\u201cThat makes sense, I\u2019d probably feel the same way.\u201d)\n\n### 2.3. **Name, Hook, Follow-up**\nWhen you meet someone:\n- **Name:** Say their name 2\u20133 times naturally.\n- **Hook:** Find a point of interest\u2014hobby, opinion, experience.\n- **Follow-up:** Revisit that hook next time you see them. Builds memory and trust.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f STAGE 3: Rapport and Trust Building Across Age Groups\n\n### 3.1. **Rapport-Building in First 30 Seconds**\nApply the **FORM model**:\n- **F**amily (\u201cYou grew up here?\u201d)\n- **O**ccupation (\u201cWhat kind of work do you do?\u201d)\n- **R**ecreation (\u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d)\n- **M**eaning (\u201cWhat\u2019s something you\u2019re passionate about?\u201d)\n\n### 3.2. **Adaptive Language Use**\n- **Teens/Gen Z**: Short, casual, authentic. Avoid over-formality or jargon.\n- **Adults**: Balanced tone, showing curiosity without intrusion.\n- **Elderly**: Respectful tone, slower pace, deeper questions about the past or values.\n\n### 3.3. **Microtrust Gestures**\n- Mirror posture subtly\n- Nod and keep eye contact (70\u201380% of the time)\n- Remember small details and bring them up later (birthdays, recent events)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 STAGE 4: Social Calibration and Conflict Management\n\n### 4.1. **Read Group Dynamics**\nAsk yourself silently:\n- Who is talking the most? Who is being ignored?\n- Who is comfortable? Who looks uneasy?\n- Who respects whom?\n\nAdjust accordingly: either facilitate or step back.\n\n### 4.2. **Disarm Hostility**\nUse the **PACE method**:\n- **P**ause (give space)\n- **A**cknowledge (name the tension)\n- **C**larify (seek understanding)\n- **E**mpathize (show you care)\n\n> Example: \u201cI sense something didn\u2019t land right. Can I check in?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 STAGE 5: Continuous Practice and Real-Life Application\n\n### 5.1. **The Weekly \u201cSocial Reps\u201d Routine**\nEach week:\n- Initiate 5 new conversations\n- Reconnect with 3 people you already know\n- Attend 1 event or social environment outside your comfort zone\n\n### 5.2. **Social Reflection Log**\nAfter each social interaction, ask:\n- What went well?\n- What made them open up?\n- What would I do differently next time?\n\nTrack patterns and adapt.\n\n### 5.3. **Get Feedback**\nOnce a month, ask someone you trust:\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s one thing I could improve in how I come across?\u201d\n- \u201cDo I ever come off as disinterested or hard to read?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 BONUS TACTICS: \u201cUniversal Engaging Habits\u201d\n| Habit | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Smile with your eyes | Practice a natural Duchenne smile\u2014engages emotional connection |\n| Ask \u201csecond layer\u201d questions | Go deeper: \u201cWhat made you choose that?\u201d instead of \u201cWhere do you work?\u201d |\n| Tell personal but concise stories | Be relatable without oversharing |\n| Use \u201cwe\u201d language | \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there\u201d instead of \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d |\n| Offer small favors | \u201cLet me connect you to someone I know.\u201d Creates reciprocity |\n\n---\n\nWould you like a printable version or a daily/weekly checklist derived from this framework?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"59c2b0f8-2084-4de3-9d8c-ddc2827f166d","request_id":"94fe85b3ad15fd64-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"59c2b0f8-2084-4de3-9d8c-ddc2827f166d","children":[]}}}
