David Mermin\r\nA slightly revised version of what appeared as a \u201cQuick Study\u201d in Physics\r\nToday, June 2022, 63-64.\r\n******\r\nThere Is No Quantum Measurement Problem\r\nThe idea that wave-function collapse is a physical process stems\r\nfrom a misunderstanding of probability and the role it plays in\r\nquantum mechanics.\r\nThere are three types of quantum physicists: (1) those who think quantum mechanics\r\nis defaced by a so-called measurement problem; (2) those who think, as I do, that there is\r\nno measurement problem; and (3) those who think the issue is not worth serious thought.\r\nYou can find the diverse views of 17 physicists and philosophers from the first two groups\r\nin Chapter 7 of Maximilian Schlosshauer\u2019s Elegance and Enigma.\r\nMost people in all three groups would agree on the following: Quantum mechanics\r\ndescribes a physical system entirely in terms of states. A state is a compendium of proba\ufffebilities of all possible answers to all possible questions one can ask of the system. Quantum\r\nmechanics is inherently statistical. There is no deeper underlying theory that gives a fuller\r\ndescription.\r\nThe state assigned to a system can change in time in two ways. If no question is asked\r\nof a system, then its state evolves in time deterministically: continuously and according to\r\nfixed rules. If a question is asked of a system \u2014 called making a measurement \u2014 then when\r\nthe question is answered the state changes discontinuously into a state that depends both\r\non the state just before the question was asked and on the particular answer the system\r\ngives to that question. This second process is called the collapse of the state. Collapse is\r\ngenerally abrupt, discontinuous, and stochastic.\r\nA physical system together with another physical system that carries out a particular\r\nmeasurement \u2014 an apparatus \u2014 can be treated by quantum mechanics as a single com\ufffeposite system. If the composite system is not questioned then quantum mechanics gives a\r\ndeterministic time evolution to the state assigned to it. If the entire composite system is\r\nquestioned, however, the state assigned to the composite system gives probabilities that\r\ncorrelate the possible answers given by the state assigned to the original system with states\r\n1","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 4>","assigned to the apparatus that indicate those possible answers. The associated probabil\ufffeities are just those that quantum mechanics would give for the original system alone. So\r\nas far as probabilities are concerned, it makes no difference whether one applies quantum\r\nmechanics to the original system alone, or to the composite original-system + apparatus.\r\nMany physicists in group 2 would add the following: There are no consequences of\r\na quantum state assignment other than all the probabilities it gives rise to. While many\r\n(perhaps most) physicists view probabilities as objective features of the world, most prob\ufffeabilists or statisticians do not. As the celebrated probabilist Bruno de Finetti put it in\r\n1931, \u201cThe abandonment of superstitious beliefs about the existence of Phlogiston, the\r\ncosmic ether, absolute space and time. . . , or Fairies and Witches, was an essential step\r\nalong the road to scientific thinking. Probability too, if regarded as something endowed\r\nwith some kind of objective existence, is no less a misleading misconception, an illusory\r\nattempt to exteriorize or materialize our actual probabilistic beliefs.\u201d\r\nPhysicists who do materialize their own probabilistic beliefs must also materialize\r\nquantum states, which are nothing more than catalogs of such beliefs. But a physicist who\r\nregards probabilities as personal judgments must necessarily view the quantum states he or\r\nshe assigns as catalogs of his or her own personal judgments. This view that the quantum\r\nstate of a system expresses only the belief of the particular physicist who assigns that\r\nstate to that system, was emphasized as the crucial key to the interpretation of quantum\r\nmechanics by Carlton Caves, Christopher Fuchs, and R\u00a8udiger Schack at the turn of the\r\n21st century\r\nThe quantum measurement problem\r\nThe measurement problem stems from the two different ways of viewing a measure\ufffement: the system alone, or the system + apparatus. If the system alone is measured its\r\nstate collapses. But the state of the composite system + apparatus does not collapse until\r\nthe apparatus is examined. Which description is correct? Which is the real state?\r\nThe answer from group (2) is that there is no real state of a physical system. What\r\none chooses to regard as the physical system, and what state one chooses to assign to it,\r\ndepend on the judgment of the particular physicist who questions the system and who uses\r\nquantum mechanics to calculate the probabilities of the answers.\r\nThis interplay between continuous and stochastic time evolution is also a feature of\r\nordinary classical probability. When a statistician assigns a probability to the answers to\r\nquestions about a system, those probabilities vary in time by rules giving the smooth time\r\nevolution of the the isolated unquestioned system. But those probabilities also depend on\r\n2","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 4>","any further information the statistician acquires about the system from any other source.\r\nThat updating of probabilities is the abrupt and discontinuous part of the classical process.\r\nNobody has ever worried about a classical measurement problem.\r\nIf the entire content of a quantum state is the catalog of probabilities it gives rise to,\r\nthen each physicist using quantum mechanics is acting as a statistician. The acquisition\r\nof further information by that physicist \u2014 whether it be through reading the display of\r\nan apparatus, or through communication with other physicists, or just through rethinking\r\nwhat that physicist already knows \u2014 can lead to an abrupt change in those probabilities,\r\nand thus to an updating of the quantum state which the physicist uses to represent them.\r\nThere is no quantum measurement problem.\r\nPhysicists in group 1 deal with their measurement problem in a variety of ways:\r\nIn their otherwise superb quantum mechanics text Landau and Lifshitz insist that\r\nquantum mechanics is not to be viewed as a conceptual tool used by observers. This leads\r\nthem to declare that a measurement is an interaction between objects of quantum and\r\nclassical types. How to distinguish between these two types (which they never explain) is\r\ntheir (unstated) measurement problem.\r\nOthers eliminate the physicist from the story by introducing a particular kind of phys\ufffeical noise that interacts significantly only with subsystems that contain macroscopically\r\nmany degrees of freedom. The special noise is designed to provide a physical mechanism\r\nfor an objective collapse of an objective state. They solve their measurement problem by\r\nintroducing a new physical processes.\r\nStill others remove the personal judgment of each physicist by eliminating collapse\r\nentirely. They take quantum states to describe an inconceivably vast multitude of contin\ufffeuously bifurcating universes (the many-worlds interpretation) that contain every possible\r\noutcome of every possible measurement.\r\nSuch solutions all take quantum states to be objective properties of the physical system\r\nthey describe and not as catalogs of personal judgments about those physical systems made\r\nby each individual user of quantum mechanics.\r\nKeep the scientist in the science\r\nWhy does our understanding of scientific laws have to be impersonal? Science is a\r\nhuman activity. Its laws are formulated in human language. As empiricists most scientists\r\nbelieve that their understanding of the world is based on their own personal experience.\r\nWhy should I insist that my interpretation of science, which I use to make sense of\r\nthe world that I experience, should never make any mention of me? The existence of a\r\n3","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 4>","\u201cquantum measurement problem\u201d, either unsolved or with many incompatible solutions,\r\nis powerful evidence that the experience of the scientist does indeed play as important\r\na role in understanding quantum theory, as the experience of the statistician plays in\r\nunderstanding ordinary probability theory.\r\nMany physicists dismiss this view with the remark that quantum states were collaps\ufffeing in the early universe, long before there were any physicists. I wonder if they also\r\nbelieve that probabilities were updating in the early universe, long before there were any\r\nstatisticians.\r\nNiels Bohr never mentions a quantum measurement problem. I conclude with a state\ufffement of his that concisely expresses the above view that there is no such problem, provided\r\nboth occurrences of \u201cour\u201d are read not as all of us collectively but as each of us individ\ufffeually. \u201cIn our description of nature the purpose is not to disclose the real essence of the\r\nphenomena but only to track down, so far as it is possible, relations between the manifold\r\naspects of our experience.\u201d I believe that this unacknowledged ambiguity of the first per\ufffeson plural lies behind much of the misunderstanding that still afflicts the interpretation of\r\nquantum mechanics.\r\nAdditional resources\r\nM.

The resulting model is local, parameter-free and makes testable\npredictions.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe measurement problem in quantum physics concerns\nthe question of why we generically do not observe the out-\ncome of the Schro\u0308dinger evolution, but merely one eigenstate\nof the measurement observable with a probability that can be\ncomputed from the wavefunction. While we can mathemati-\ncally describe this process with the reduction (or \u2018update\u2019 or\n\u2018collapse\u2019) of the wavefunction, the collapse is then not lo-\ncal, which is difficult to reconcile with general relativity. The\nquestion of why we never observe macroscopic superpositions\n(of measurement eigenstates) therefore turns into the question\nof how the process to arrive in a measurement eigenstate can\nhappen locally.\n\nSeveral models have been proposed to convert the sud-\nden collapse of the wave function into a gradual, physical\nprocess. The most prominent among them are the Ghiradi-\nRimini-Weber (GRW) model [1] and related approaches [2],\nDio\u0301si\u2019s model of stochastic gravitational collapse [3, 4], as\nwell as Penrose\u2019s [5, 6] model of gravitationally induced col-\nlapse. These models, however, are all non-local in the sense\nof violating Bell\u2019s condition of local causality. The purpose\nof this paper is to develop a local collapse model.\n\nWe know from Bell\u2019s theorem [7, 8] that any locally causal\nmodel that correctly describes observations needs to violate\nmeasurement independence. Such theories are sometimes\ncalled \u2018superdeterministic\u2019 [9, 10]. It is therefore clear that\nto arrive at a local collapse model, we must use a superdeter-\nministic approach. The aim of this paper is to show that a local\ncollapse arises in a superdeterministic setting from what I be-\nlieve to be fairly general assumptions about quantum gravity.\n\nIn the following \u210f = c = 1.\n\nII. MODEL DEFINITION\n\nA. Geometry and Matter\n\nAs starting point, I want to use an old idea for the unifi-\ncation of the fundamental interactions: that matter, radiation,\nand geometry are ultimately the same.\n\nOne way to interpret this statement is that the particles in\nthe standard model are really geometrical in nature: stable,\nnoise-free, subsystems. This idea was pursued for example by\nJohn Wheeler with the geon approach [11], but it survives in\nmore modern formulations such as Spinor Gravity [12], geo-\nmetric engineering in string theory [13], or braided spin net-\nworks [14].\n\nAnother way to interpret the statement is that geometry is\na purely relational property that arises entirely from matter.\nThis, too, is not a new idea; it has been pursued for example in\nthe context of Causal Fermion Systems [15], Shape Dynamics\n[16], or Geometric Unity [17].\n\nClassical gravity already has these features to some extent.\nOn the most trivial level, we can infer the mass and charge of\na particle from its gravitational field. Furthermore, there are\nknown links between the solutions of Yang-Mills theory and\nthose of gravity [18]. A difficulty here is to account for quan-\ntum properties like fractional spin. Nevertheless, it is clear\nthat gravity carries a lot of the information from the particle\nsector already.\n\nWhat I am assuming here is then that in the to-be-found un-\nderlying theory, geometry carries the same information as the\nparticles because they are the same. Gravity is in this sense\nfundamentally different from the other interactions: The elec-\ntromagnetic interaction, for example, does not carry any in-\nformation about the mass of the particles. Yet gravity car-\nries information about the particles\u2019 charges. We may note in\npassing that this would solve the black hole information loss\nproblem.\n\nConcretely, I will take this idea to imply that we have a fun-\ndamental quantum theory in which particles and their geome-\ntry are one and the same quantum state. That is, the geometry\nis fully determined by the particles\u2019 properties, and vice versa.\nThere are no extra degrees of freedom. I am here including\ngravitons as a type of particle, one for which the relation is\nparticularly obvious.\n\nTo be even more concrete, let us call this fundamental quan-\ntum state |\u03a8\u27e9. We then want to recover the familiar Hilbert\nspace of quantum gravity H , that is a product of matter and\ngeometric degrees of freedom\n\nH = Hm \u2297 Hg . (1)\n\nThe geometric degrees of freedom do not necessarily have to\nbe the metric. They could be other geometric properties, like\nthe connection, loops, networks, or anything else that, in the\nfundamental theory, might replace space-time.\n\nThe assumption that I have made, that matter and geom-\netry are ultimately the same, means we will not get the full\nHilbert space H , but rather a subset of product states M :=\n{|\u03a8\u27e9 \u2297 U |\u03a8\u27e9}. I have here introduced a unitary operation\nU that accounts for the possibly different identification of de-\ngrees of freedom. We correspondingly assume that the under-\nlying theory has a total Hamiltonian H\u0302tot that acts on each\n\nar\nX\n\niv\n:2\n\n51\n0.\n\n11\n03\n\n7v\n1 \n\n [\nqu\n\nan\nt-\n\nph\n] \n\n 1\n3 \n\nO\nct\n\n 2\n02\n\n5\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11037v1\n\n\nB Off the Hamiltonian 2\n\nfactor separately and is of the form\n\nH\u0302tot =\n1\n\n2\n\n(\nH\u0302u \u2297 11 + 11 \u2297 UH\u0302uU\n\n\u2020\n)\n, (2)\n\nwhere H\u0302u is the unknown underlying Hamiltonian and 11 is\nthe identity operator.\n\nThe reason for this reduced Hilbert-space, M , is that an en-\ntangled state between matter and geometry would have extra\ninformation in the phases that are neither in the matter nor in\nthe geometry sector. But by assumption each of those sectors\nalready carries the full information.\n\nThis seemingly innocent assumption causes an immediate\nproblem, which is that in the best understood approaches to\nquantum gravity\u2014perturbatively quantised and canonically\nquantised gravity\u2014the Hamiltonian evolution generates en-\ntanglement between matter and geometry. We therefore need\nto reconcile these two approaches.\n\nOne might at this point say, well, this discrepancy just\nserves to show that we cannot assume a product state! But\nas I will argue below, this might be the reason why we do\nnot have a physical description of the measurement process in\nquantum mechanics.\n\nB. Off the Hamiltonian\n\nWe will reconcile the product assumption with the canon-\nical quantum gravity evolution by conceding that the time-\nevolution of the product state cannot be a solution to the\nSchro\u0308dinger equation. We will further assume that this de-\nviation from the Schro\u0308dinger evolution leads to a suppression\nof the transition amplitude. That is, we allow the evolution of\nthe state in Hilbert space to proceed unitarily1 on any path that\nevolves locally and by the known interaction terms, and that\nrespects all conservation laws, but it needs to fulfil the product\nstate constraint.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to add some words on how to in-\nterpret this approach. I have started from the assumption that\nwe have an underlying fundamental theory that unifies matter\nand geometry. This underlying theory has its own dynami-\ncal law that, alas, I don\u2019t know. The product state constraint\nwill not give us the underlying dynamical law. It is rather\na phenomenological model to explain our observation of the\ncollapse process that will, hopefully, allow us to identify ways\nto test the underlying theory.\n\nThis is similar to how, in the early days of quantum mechan-\nics, physicists postulated discrete atomic energy levels and a\nfractional electron spin just because that agreed with observa-\ntions, despite not knowing the underlying law. The underlying\nlaws were then discovered, and the theory developed, from\nfurther studies of the observed phenomena.\n\nIt is straightforward to estimate how large the deviation of a\nproduct path |\u03a8\u27e9 from the usual Schro\u0308dinger evolution |\u03a8\u2032\u27e9 is.\n\n1 This means in particular that states are normalised to 1 as usual.\n\nFirst we may note that since the product state concerns gravi-\ntational degrees of freedom, we expect the product constraint\nto only make a difference when quantum gravitational effects\nare taken into account. That is, even without doing any cal-\nculation, we expect the effect to be small for states with small\nmasses/energies.\n\nTo calculate the deviation, we then define the residual R :=\n(i\u2202t\u2212H\u0302)|\u03a8\u27e9 with respect to the standard Hamiltonian H\u0302 (i.e.\nthe known one of, say, canonical quantum gravity, and not the\nunknown H\u0302u) and use the functional\n\nS :=\n\n\u222b\ndt ||R|| (3)\n\nto integrate the deviation from the Schro\u0308dinger evolution,\nwhere, as usual, || \u00b7 || =\n\n\u221a\n\u27e8\u00b7|\u00b7\u27e9.\n\nIt will be helpful in the following to decompose the inte-\ngrand into two components, one that is perpendicular to |\u03a8\u27e9,\nthat we will call |R\u22a5\u27e9, and one that is parallel to it, that we\nwill call |R\u2225\u27e9. We obtain them as usual as projections\n\n|R\u22a5\u27e9 = (11 \u2212 |\u03a8\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8|)|R\u27e9 , (4)\n|R\u2225\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03a8|R\u27e9|\u03a8\u27e9 . (5)\n\nThen we have\n\n||R||2 = ||R\u22a5||2 + ||R\u2225||2 , (6)\n\n||R\u2225||2 = |\u27e8\u03a8|R\u27e9|2 . (7)\n\nSince both terms are strictly positive, they must separately\nbe minimal. The parallel component, however, can always be\nset to zero by multiplying |\u03a8\u27e9 by a suitable time-dependent\nphase. Suppose we have \u27e8\u03a8\u0303|R\u0303\u27e9 \u0338= 0. Then instead choose\n|\u03a8\u27e9 = e\u2212i\u03c6(t)|\u03a8\u0303\u27e9, where \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212\u27e8\u03a8\u0303|R\u0303\u27e9, and then you have\n\u27e8\u03a8|R\u27e9 = 0. This is sometimes called the \u201cenergy gauge.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cgauge\u201d is somewhat misleading in our case,\nsince the residual actually does depend on this phase, so it\nis not a gauge. Still, I will use this term in the following. The\nenergy gauge is a shortcut to finding the minimum of the func-\ntional. One could alternatively just use ||R\u22a5|| for the func-\ntional and assume the energy gauge.\n\nC. Teleology\n\nIn my mind the biggest shortcoming of Penrose\u2019s argument\nfor gravitationally induced collapse is that once the gravita-\ntional self-energy is large enough to make a non-negligible\ncontribution to the time-evolution, it is too late to collapse the\nstate locally. This problem is common to all decoherence-\nbased approaches, and it is here where superdeterminism\ncomes in.\n\nSuperdeterminism is mathematically defined as a correla-\ntion between the measurement settings X and the presumed\nto exist hidden variables \u03bb, i.e. \u03c1(X|\u03bb) \u0338= \u03c1(X), where \u03c1 is\nthe probability distribution of the hidden variables. However,\nas we have argued in [19], what this really means is that the\ntime-evolution of the underlying state depends on the mea-\n\n\n\nD Multipartite and Interacting Systems 3\n\nsurement setting: They must fit together. Superdeterminism\nis therefore best understood as a constraint on possible evo-\nlutions (an all-at-once constraint in the terminology of [20])\nor as a superselection rule on possible outcomes of the time-\nevolution.\n\nOne can assume that the outcome of the time evolution is\nalways a detector eigenstate (as we did in [21]) to get a model\nthat reproduces quantum physics. But what one really wants\nis to explain what outcomes we get and why, and hence how\nthe classical world emerges. The model presented here will\ngo a long way towards this.\n\nAs argued in [22], the action principle is ideally suited to in-\ncorporate a superselection rule because technically it already\ndepends on both initial and end states. In classical physics,\nthe action principle is only seemingly teleological, by which\nI mean it only seemingly depends on a boundary condition in\nthe future. This is because we can use the principle of least\naction to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations which merely\nrequire initial values, and no future input.\n\nHowever, the action principle opens a door to formalising\na theory that violates measurement independence by not only\nusing a variation over all possible paths, but also a variation\nover all possible end-states of the paths. Our first step at an\naction principle will thus simply be that the time-evolution\nwhich is realised is the one that is (a) a stationary state of\nthe residual action Eq. (3), \u03b4S = 0, and (b) has the minimal\nresidual among all stationary states given our product ansatz.\nThis will turn out to be not quite correct, but we will refine it\nlater on.\n\nD. Multipartite and Interacting Systems\n\nIt is clear that if this model is to describe the measurement\nprocess, then it must deal with macroscopically large systems\nthat are composed of many particles. We therefore have to\nthink about how to deal with systems that have multiple com-\nponents.\n\nLet first consider the case of two non-interacting systems in\na product state |\u03a8\u27e9 = |A\u27e9 \u2297 |B\u27e9 with Hamiltonian\n\nH\u0302 = H\u0302A \u2297 11 + 11 \u2297 H\u0302B . (8)\n\nThe residual is\n\n|R\u27e9 = |RA\u27e9 \u2297 |B\u27e9+ |A\u27e9 \u2297 |RB\u27e9 , (9)\n\nwhere |RA\u27e9 = (i\u2202t \u2212 H\u0302A)|A\u27e9 and |RB\u27e9 = (i\u2202t \u2212 H\u0302B)|B\u27e9.\nTo fix the phases for the energy gauge, we set \u27e8A|RA\u27e9 =\n\n\u27e8B|RB\u27e9 = 0. Then\n\n||R||2 = ||RA||2 + ||RB ||2 . (10)\n\nThis expression generalises in the obvious way to any number\nof systems: ||R||2 will be a linear sum of the individual con-\ntributions. Consequently, the contribution of each can be min-\nimised separately, and for n identical separable subsystems,\n||R|| will scale with\n\n\u221a\nn\n\nIf the systems are interacting, we add a term that couples\nthem\n\nH\u0302int :=\n\u2211\nk\n\nI\u0302kA \u2297 I\u0302kB . (11)\n\nThen we define\n\n\u27e8V \u27e9 := \u27e8A|\u27e8B|H\u0302int|B\u27e9|A\u27e9 , (12)\n\nV\u0302A := \u27e8B|H\u0302int|B\u27e9 , (13)\n\nV\u0302B := \u27e8A|H\u0302int|A\u27e9 , (14)\n\n|R\u2032\nA\u27e9 :=\n\n(\ni\u2202t \u2212 H\u0302A \u2212 V\u0302A + \u27e8V \u27e9\n\n)\n|A\u27e9, (15)\n\n|R\u2032\nB\u27e9 :=\n\n(\ni\u2202t \u2212 H\u0302B \u2212 V\u0302B + \u27e8V \u27e9\n\n)\n|B\u27e9, (16)\n\nV\u0303 := H\u0302int \u2212 V\u0302A \u2297 11 \u2212 11 \u2297 V\u0302B + \u27e8V \u27e911 . (17)\n\nIn the energy gauge, we then have\n\n||R||2 = ||R\u2032\nA||2 + ||R\u2032\n\nB ||2 + \u27e8\u03a8|V\u0303 2|\u03a8\u27e9 . (18)\n\nThat is, the functional for two interacting subsystems is the\ndeviation of each subsystem from the mean field path, plus a\ncontribution from the interaction.\n\nE. Generalisations\n\nWhile I have here for simplicity used the Newtonian limit\nand first quantisation, the derivation could be extended to a\ngenerally covariant quantum field theory. This can be done as\nusual by replacing the Lagrangian by an integral over density\noperators\n\nL = i\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\u03a3\n\u2212 H\u0302\u03bdN\n\n\u03bd , (19)\n\nwhere N\u03bd = (N,N i) is the lapse/shift vector, \u03a3 is a family\nof Cauchy hypersurfaces, and H\u0302\u03bd is the constraint operator\ndensity [23\u201325]. With that, the functional S becomes a space-\ntime integral that is by construction a scalar.\n\nThat said, general covariance is naturally broken in a typical\nquantum experiment by the rest frame of the detector.\n\nIII. MODEL PROPERTIES\n\nHaving formulated the mathematical framework of the new\nmodel, I now want to explain what it is good for.\n\nA. The Penrose Case\n\nThe case I want to look at first is one in which we generate\na particle of mass m and with wavefunction |\u03c7\u27e9 in a superpo-\nsition of two places (in the following called branches), x\u20d71 and\nx\u20d72 that we will call |\u03c71\u27e9 and |\u03c72\u27e9. That is, the wavefunction\nof the particle is |\u03c7\u27e9 = \u03b11|\u03c71\u27e9+ \u03b12|\u03c72\u27e9.\n\n\n\nA The Penrose Case 4\n\nStrictly speaking, the particle\u2019s wavefunction in each loca-\ntion has its own gravitational field. For simplicity, we will\nuse the Newtonian limit, in which the branches each have\ntheir own Newtonian potential \u03a61 and \u03a62, or corresponding\nquantum states |\u03a61\u27e9 and |\u03a62\u27e9, respectively. We will also as-\nsume that the wave-packets do not overlap, so they are or-\nthogonal, that each branch separately is to good approxima-\ntion classical. This is the common setup used for example in\n[5]. I will also assume that the branches are so far apart that\n\u03a61(x\u20d72) \u2248 \u03a62(x\u20d71) \u2248 0.\n\nPlease do not think of the particles as point-like as that will\ncause singular gravitational potentials. Better think of them as\nsuitably smeared-out coherent states.\n\nThe usual quantum gravitational evolution will generate an\nentangled state of the form\n\n|\u03a8\u2032\u27e9 = a\u20321(t)|\u03c71\u27e9|\u03a61\u27e9+ a\u20322(t)|\u03c72\u27e9|\u03a62\u27e9 , (20)\n\nwhich we assume to satisfy the Schro\u0308dinger equation\nof canonical quantum gravity, whereas our product state\nschematically has the form\n\n|\u03a8\u27e9 = (a1(t)|\u03c71\u27e9+ a2(t)|\u03c72\u27e9) (a1(t)|\u03a61\u27e9+ a2(t)|\u03a62\u27e9) ,(21)\n\nand fulfils the Schro\u0308dinger evolution in whatever is the under-\nlying theory.\n\nWe can then estimate S as follows. First we assume, as Pen-\nrose in his argument [5], that we have gauge-fixed the metrics\nof the different branches. This means in practice that we can\nexpress them both as functions of the same coordinate sys-\ntem, and we can compare them pointwise. In general, this is a\ncomplicated procedure, but for two wave-packets that are each\napproximately classical, we will just be left with one Newto-\nnian potential focused on the position of the first particle, and\none focused on the other particle.\n\nSince |\u03a8\u2032\u27e9 evolves under the usual Hamiltonian, each\nbranch has a slightly different time evolution stemming from\nthe slightly different lapse functions which stem from the dif-\nferent Newtonian potentials. This means that each branch\npicks up a different phase that we can write as\n\n|\u03a8\u2032\u27e9 = \u03b1\u2032\n1e\n\n\u2212itm\u03a61 |\u03c71\u27e9|\u03a61\u27e9+ \u03b1\u2032\n2e\n\n\u2212itm\u03a62 |\u03c72\u27e9|\u03a62\u27e9 , (22)\n\nwhere we have discarded an overall phase from the mass as\nit\u2019s the same on both branches. In this expression, \u03b1\u2032\n\n1 and \u03b1\u2032\n2\n\nare constant, and the time-dependence has entirely moved into\nthe phases.\n\nFor our product state, we will use the same coefficients\n\u03b11 = \u03b1\u2032\n\n1 and \u03b12 = \u03b1\u2032\n2 to preserve the weights, but we\n\nnote that the phases pick up a factor 1/2 from the doubling\nprocedure, see Eq. (2). If we expand |\u03a8\u27e9, then the two un-\nmixed factors |\u03c71\u27e9|\u03a61\u27e9 and |\u03c72\u27e9|\u03a62\u27e9 will solve the canonical\nSchro\u0308dinger equation. The residual is therefore schematically\nof the form\n\n|R\u27e9 = m \u03b11\u03b12 exp (\u2212i t m \u03a612/2)\u03a612\n\n\u00d7 (|\u03c71\u27e9|\u03a62\u27e9+ |\u03c72\u27e9|\u03a61\u27e9) /2 , (23)\n\nwhere \u03a612 = \u03a61(x\u20d71) + \u03a62(x\u20d72). From this we get\u221a\n|\u27e8R|R\u27e9| = 1\n\n2\nm|\u03b11\u03b12||\u03a612|\n\n\u221a\n2 . (24)\n\nHowever, this is not the minimal value of the functional\nS because |\u03a8\u27e9 is not in the energy gauge. Integrating \u03c6\u0307 =\n\u27e8\u03a8|R\u27e9, we get\u03c6 = tm|\u03b11\u03b12|2|\u03a612|, and so the minimal norm\nbecomes\u221a\n\n|\u27e8R|R\u27e9| = 1\n\n2\nm|\u03b11\u03b12||\u03a612|\n\n\u221a\n2\u2212 4|\u03b11\u03b12|2 . (25)\n\nThe value of the square root in Eq. (25) is \u2208 [1,\n\u221a\n2] and just\n\nmakes an order-one correction. Since |\u03b11| =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 |\u03b12|2 we\n\nsee that, as expected, the residual vanishes if one has only one\nbranch, because no entanglement is created. The only other\ncase when the expression vanishes is when the gravitational\npotentials are both identical to zero.\n\nMost importantly, we see that parametrically this expres-\nsion is similar to the estimate for (the inverse of) Penrose\u2019s\ndecoherence time. However, the residual does not scale with\nthe variance of the potentials \u2206\u03a6, as one might expect from\na mean-field approach. Rather it scales with the sum of po-\ntentials in each locations. For the interested reader, in the Ap-\npendix, I summarise Penrose\u2019s calculation and the mean field\napproach for comparison.\n\nOne can rightfully question the details of this argument.\nThe product state might not actually have this form or its time\nevolution not actually proceed this way. However, this little\ncalculation serves as an estimate for what one generally ex-\npects. To maintain a product state, the time evolution in the\nunderlying theory will constantly oscillate into mixed terms\n(|\u03c71\u27e9|\u03a62\u27e9 , |\u03c72\u27e9|\u03a61\u27e9) with an oscillation frequency deter-\nmined by m|\u03a612|. Since we are integrating over the absolute\nvalue of the residual, these oscillations will not average out\nbut rather add up over a time \u03c4 , and increase as S \u223c \u03c4m|\u03a612|.\nI will in the following refer to this estimate as the \u201cPenrose-\nphase\u201d.\n\nWe will now turn to the question of what to do with this\nestimate.\n\nB. The Collapse\n\nSince the integrand of Eq. (3) is strictly positive, it is clear\nthat the absolute minimum of the action is equal to zero. This\nis the case iff the time evolution follows the Schro\u0308dinger equa-\ntion. The estimate in the previous section then tells us that the\nSchro\u0308dinger evolution is a good approximation, so long as the\ntime-integral over the gravitational self energy is small. In this\ncase, the product requirement will not make much of a differ-\nence. This is what one expects given that it affects only the\ngravitational sector.\n\nHowever, if we consider a situation in which the state is\nmeasured (otherwise, what are we to predict?), then the dif-\nferent branches of the wavefunction will become amplified by\nthe detector. This is what makes a detector a detector: It cor-\nrelates a quantum state with increasingly more other particles,\n\n\n\nB The Collapse 5\n\nso that we can eventually read out the result. This means that\nthe total mass that is in a superposition of two places will in-\ncrease due to the measurement.\n\nConsider for example that we create a superposition of a\nphoton with a beam splitter and then measure the photon with\na photomultiplier. In branch 1, the photon will create a cas-\ncade of electrons in photomultiplier 1, whereas photomulti-\nplier 2 remains untouched. For the photon on branch 2, it\nis instead electrons in photomultiplier 2 that move. Eventu-\nally these electrons will create a current and text on a screen\nthat will be read by a human. As that happens, the total mass\nand energy in a superposition of two locations increases. This\nis sometimes called a \u201cSchro\u0308dinger\u2019s cat state\u201d or just a \u201ccat\nstate\u201d.\n\nI want to stress here that the relevant distinction is not that\nbetween detector 1 and detector 2. It is rather that between\ndetector 1 that has detected a particle and detector 1 that has\nnot detected a particle, and similar for detector 2. Let me\ndenote the states of the detector on branch 1/2 with |Don\n\n1/2\u27e9\nand |Doff\n\n1/2\u27e9. Then we start with the (matter) state\n\n|Doff\n1 \u27e9|Doff\n\n2 \u27e9(\u03b11|\u03c71\u27e9+ \u03b12|\u03c72\u27e9) , (26)\n\nand end with the entangled state\n\n\u03b11|Don\n1 \u27e9|Doff\n\n2 \u27e9|\u03c71\u27e9+ \u03b12|Doff\n1 \u27e9|Don\n\n2 \u27e9|\u03c72\u27e9 . (27)\n\nThe total final state will then be a product state with the cor-\nresponding state of the geometry that is now also entangled,\nalbeit only internally and not with the matter. The differences\nin potential then come from the different locations of particles\nin the on/off states of the detector.\n\nImportantly, since this is an entangled state, for identical\nparticles, the total size of the effect does not scale with the\nsquare root of the number of particles, it scales linearly. This\nmakes sense intuitively because this is how the gravitational\npotential scales. Note that the particles in each detector do\nnot need to be a coherent state for this scaling. However, for\nthe estimate in the previous subsection to hold, the particles\nin either branch need to be dislocated enough so that their\nwavefunctions no longer overlap.\n\nOur action principle now must take into account the de-\ntector. We then see immediately that any state that will be\nmeasured which is not to good approximation in one location\n(and hence has approximately a classical gravitational field),\nwill generate a very large residual once it hits the detector.\nThis means that if we take into account the amplification by\nthe detector, then the only local time evolutions for which the\nSchro\u0308dinger equation is a good approximation is one in which\nthe measurement outcome does not create macroscopic super-\npositions, in the quantifiable sense that the time-integral over\nthe residual (3) remains negligible.\n\nWhat will happen instead? For this we have to answer the\nquestion of what is the end state of the time evolution of the\nproduct state that results in the smallest residual. We have\npartly answered this question already: The residual will ac-\ncumulate on any time evolution that is in a superposition of\ntwo locations. The more mass (or energy) is in this superposi-\n\ntion, the faster it will accumulate. To keep the residual small,\na more optimal time evolution is hence one that only briefly\n(and locally!) violates the Schro\u0308dinger evolution. This will\nalso make a contribution to the residual, but it will no longer\naccumulate over time.\n\nThis is particularly obvious in our example with the beam\nsplitter. If we measure the photon\u2019s path after the beam split-\nter this would create a macroscopic superposition with a large\nresidual. We would expect that the case in which the photon\nbriefly violates the Schro\u0308dinger evolution at the beam split-\nter and locally \u201ccollapses\u201d into just one arm gives a smaller\nresidual.\n\nWhat will this residual be? To estimate this we can forget\nabout the specifics of the gravitational sector and its Hamil-\ntonian as it is a general question of going off the Schro\u0308dinger\nevolution. Let us just generally consider the case with two\nbranches and a superposition\n\n|\u03a8\u2032\u27e9 = \u03b11|1\u27e9+ \u03b12|2\u27e9 . (28)\n\nWe will assume that both |1\u27e9 and |2\u27e9 fulfil the Schro\u0308dinger\nequation and wlog Im(\u03b11) = 0 , \u03b11 \u2265 0.\n\nWe then want to know what is the residual for the time-\ndependent (unitary) rotation into branch 2\n\n|\u03a8\u2032(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03b8(t))|1\u27e9+ ei\u03c6 sin(\u03b8(t))|2\u27e9 , (29)\n\nwhere \u03b8(t) is a monotonically increasing function of t,\ncos(\u03b8(ts)) := \u03b11, ei\u03c6 sin(\u03b8(ts)) := \u03b12, \u03c6 \u2208 R, \u03b8s := \u03b8(ts) \u2264\n\u03c0/2, and cos(\u03b8(te)) = 0 for some start time ts and final time\nte. This ansatz is already in the energy gauge, so we get\u221a\n\n|\u27e8R|R\u27e9| = \u03b8\u0307 , (30)\n\nand thus S = \u03c0/2\u2212 \u03b8s.\nThere are two things worth pointing out about this expres-\n\nsion. First, it does not depend on how fast \u03b8(t) evolves, it\nonly depends on the beginning and end value. However, in\ngeneral such a transition can only proceed locally if it hap-\npens within an interaction region. Second, this is the smallest\npossible value that the action can take on for any such transi-\ntion because we can always choose the basis vectors so that\nwe have a two-state system, and this rotation is the shortest\npath between the start and end point.\n\nWhy does the state not collapse once the superposition\nreaches the detector? Because there is no local interaction\nwhich can make this happen. If the particle really were to go\nseveral paths but upon measurement was found on only one\npath, then its mass (and/or energy) would be spread over sev-\neral places upon arrival at the detector, and it would have to\nsuddenly jump to only one place, violating local energy con-\nservation.2\n\n2 This problem persists if one slowly collapses the superposition on the way\nto the detector, as we did in [21]. Such a model can be locally causal in\nBell\u2019s sense if one is only concerned with the measurement outcome, but\ngenerically it still has to propagate energy densities outside the lightcone.\n\n\n\nC Born\u2019s Rule 6\n\nWhat this means is that if the system minimises the action,\nit will locally collapse into a branch that results in a mea-\nsurement outcome which is to good accuracy a product state\nbetween matter and metric, and pick the branch that had the\nlargest amplitude under the Schro\u0308dinger evolution. We can\ntherefore identify these product states as the pointer states of\nthe measurement device. When I say they are product states,\nI do not mean they need to be exact product states. They just\nneed to be close enough to product states so that the Penrose-\nphase remains \u226a 1.\n\nThe example that we used in subsection III A was that of\na position-state measurement. However, the model presented\nhere works for any measurement variable. It only matters that\nthe detector amplifies the state to macroscopic size. Suppose,\nfor example, that we measure an energy eigenstate rather than\na position eigenstate. Different energy eigenstates might go\nthe exact same path and hit the detector at the same location.\nThe difference in the gravitational potentials will then come\nfrom the necessarily distinct detector response that must even-\ntually reach a macroscopic level, not from having detectors in\ndifferent locations.\n\nThe only problem is that this, of course, is not what we ac-\ntually observe. In reality, the outcome of a quantum measure-\nment is not always the pointer state with the largest amplitude.\nWhat is missing here is a probabilistic element. We will turn\nto this next.\n\nC. Born\u2019s Rule\n\nSuperdeterministic theories are hidden variables theories.\nThis means they explain the seeming randomness of quantum\nmechanics as due to our lack of information about variables \u03bb\nwhich do not appear in standard quantum physics. To recover\na probabilistic theory, therefore, we must now incorporate the\nhidden variables.\n\nFor this, we will assume that the probability of a prepared\nstate to go from an initial state |\u03a8s\u27e9 := |\u03a8(ts)\u27e9 into an end\nstate |\u03a8e\u27e9 := |\u03a8(te)\u27e9 is determined by random variables\nX(|\u03a8s\u27e9, |\u03a8e\u27e9, \u03bb), which are, to a good approximation, inde-\npendent for each possible end-state. The end state into which\nthe initial state evolves is that with the smallest X .\n\nWe define the random variables so that they have rate (in-\nverse mean value)\n\nr(|\u03a8s\u27e9, |\u03a8e\u27e9) := e\u22122A(|\u03a8s\u27e9,|\u03a8e\u27e9) , (31)\n\nwhere\n\nA(|\u03a8s\u27e9, |\u03a8e\u27e9) :=\n\n\u222b te\n\nts\n\ndt\n\u221a\n\u27e8R|R\u27e9\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 |C(t)|2/|C(t)| ,\n\nC(t) := |\u27e8\u03a8\u2032|\u03a8\u27e9| , (32)\n\nand so that the probability distribution has maximum entropy,\nwhich means it is given by\n\n\u03c1(\u03bb|r) =\n\n{\nre\u2212r\u03bb for \u03bb \u2265 0\n0 for \u03bb < 0\n\n. (33)\n\nThis distribution depends on the end state |\u03a8e\u27e9 via r and hence\non the measurement settings and thereby violates measure-\nment independence.\n\nTo understand this expression, we note that for the rotation\nin section II C, we have C(t) = cos(\u03b8(t)\u2212 \u03b8s) , so that\n\nA =\n\n\u222b \u03c0/2\n\n\u03b8s\n\nd\u03b8\nsin(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s)\n\ncos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s)\n\n= \u2212 ln(sin(\u03b8s)) = \u2212 ln |\u03b12| , (34)\n\nand hence r = |\u03b12|2.\nIn the case of the enforced product state of section II B we\n\nhave instead\n\nC(t) = |\u03b12\n1\u03b1\n\n\u2032\n1\n\u2217\n+ \u03b12\n\n2\u03b1\n\u2032\n2\n\u2217| . (35)\n\nIts absolute value generically gives a correction of order one.\nThat is, by order of magnitude we get\n\nA \u223c \u03c4m|\u03a612| , (36)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the time that the superposition remains in existence.\nTo move on, we define \u2206t = te \u2212 ts and |\u03a8\u2032\n\ne\u27e9 :=\ne\u2212iH\u2206t|\u03a8s\u27e9 as the final state under the Schro\u0308dinger evolu-\ntion. We have previously seen that if the final state is to good\naccuracy a product state of metric and matter it can serve as a\nmeasurement eigenstate. We will denote these states as |\u03a8I\u27e9,\nI \u2208 {1, 2 . . . D}, and \u03b1I := \u27e8\u03a8I |\u03a8\u2032\n\ne\u27e9.\nLet us then look at the case with two final states |\u03a8e1\u27e9 and\n\n|\u03a8e2\u27e9. We want to know what is the probability that we get the\nfinal state |\u03a8e1\u27e9. By assumption this will be the case whenever\n\nX(|\u03a8s\u27e9, |\u03a8e1\u27e9, \u03bb1) < X(|\u03a8i\u27e9, |\u03a8e2\u27e9, \u03bb2) , (37)\n\nthat is, the values have to fulfill the condition \u03bb1 < \u03bb2.\nWe can then calculate the probability of this happening by\n\nintegrating over the probability distributions\n\nP (X(|\u03a8s\u27e9, |\u03a8e1\u27e9, \u03bb1) < X(|\u03a8s\u27e9, |\u03a8e2\u27e9, \u03bb2)) =\n\nr1r2\n\n\u222b \u221e\n\n0\n\nd\u03bb1\n\n\u222b \u221e\n\n\u03bb1\n\nd\u03bb2 e\n\u2212r1\u03bb1\u2212r2\u03bb2 , (38)\n\nwhere r1 and r2 are the rates associated with end state 1 and\n2, respectively. The result of this integral is\n\nr1\nr1 + r2\n\n=\ne\u22122A(|\u03a8s\u27e9,|\u03a8e1\u27e9)\n\ne\u22122A(|\u03a8s\u27e9,|\u03a8e1\u27e9) + e\u22122A(|\u03a8s\u27e9,|\u03a8e2\u27e9)\n. (39)\n\nWe see that if the end state |\u03a8e1\u27e9 is that of the usual\nSchro\u0308dinger evolution but not a product state, then the prob-\nability is exponentially suppressed. We hence never observe\nthese outcomes. The best possible path is one with a sudden\nbranch rotation. In this case P = |\u03b11|2 for the state to go to\nend state |\u03a81\u27e9, which is what Born\u2019s rule requires.\n\nDo the probabilities come out correctly for arbitrary num-\nbers of |\u03a8I\u27e9, I \u2208 {1, 2, . . . D}? Yes, they do. One can con-\nfirm this the hard way by actually calculating the integral for\nD probability distributions. But we can make it simpler by\ndenoting PI := P (|\u03a8e\u27e9 = |\u03a8I\u27e9). It follows from the above\n\n\n\nC Born\u2019s Rule 7\n\nthat\n\n|\u03b1I |2\n\n|\u03b1I |2 + |\u03b1J |2\n=\n\nPI\n\nPI + PJ\n\u2200 I \u0338= J . (40)\n\nSince this equation is trivially also true for I = J , we get\n\n|\u03b1I |2\n\n|\u03b1J |2\n=\nPI\n\nPJ\n\u2200 I, J . (41)\n\nAnd because both the PI and the |\u03b1I |2 sum up to 1, we have\n\n1 =\n\nD\u2211\nI=1\n\nPI =\nPJ\n\n|\u03b1J |2\nD\u2211\n\nI=1\n\n|\u03b1I |2 =\nPJ\n\n|\u03b1J |2\n. (42)\n\nSo, PJ = |\u03b1J |2 \u2200 J .\nWe also see that since the integral in A is additive and in\n\nthe exponent, the probabilities of consecutive local rotations\nwill factorise, as they should.\n\nA few comments. One might raise the point here that the\nprobability distribution of the hidden variables (33) appears\nlike a bunny out of a magic hat rather than following from any-\nthing in particular. This is entirely true, but absent an underly-\ning theory really the best I can do is to provide an example for\nthe probability distribution that reproduces quantum mechan-\nics3. For what I am concerned, it doesn\u2019t pop any more out\nof the hat than Born\u2019s rule pops in the standard formulation of\nquantum mechanics. Of course one hopes that eventually one\nwould be able to derive this (or some other) expression from\nsome deeper theory, but we will leave this to future work. . .\n\nA second question one might have is why I introduced both\nS and A and not just used A for both purposes. The reason is\nnot only that this doesn\u2019t make physical sense, it doesn\u2019t work.\nS is the functional whose variation determines the possible\npaths that the system can take. A is a statistical measure that\ncounts paths in the presumed to be underlying theory. They\nshould not be the same. Worse, if we set them to be the same,\nwe would run into the problem that \u03b4A = A = 0 on any path\nof the form ei\u03c6(t)|\u03a8\u2032\u27e9, \u03c6(t) \u2208 R. That is, we would lose the\nusual Schro\u0308dinger evolution as a unique solution in the case\nwhen gravity can be neglected.\n\nAnother question one might have here is how this can pos-\nsibly reproduce Born\u2019s rule if there are other time evolutions\nfrom the initial to the final state that we could realise with\nlocal interactions even disregarding gravity. To be concrete,\nconsider a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Under the usual\nSchro\u0308dinger evolution, the state goes in a superposition over\nboth paths, and then recombines. But we could alternatively\nuse a local rotation at the first beam splitter to either one of\nthe paths, and then another local rotation on the second beam\nsplitter into the wrong port. Why does this not happen?\n\nThe reason this cannot happen is that such a path would\nnot be a stationary solution of S. As long as the outcome of\n\n3 And that, as we may note, does not require finetuning, thus providing an-\nother counterexample to the claim that superdeterministic theories are fine-\ntuned.\n\nthe usual Schro\u0308dinger evolution is a detector eigenstate, the\nproduct state constraint does nothing and the usual solution\nof the Schro\u0308dinger equation is the optimal path. It is only\nwhen the forward evolution of the Schro\u0308dinger solution is not\na product state between matter and geometry that the product\nstates become the stationary solutions.\n\nIn case you noticed that (35) could be equal to zero for\n\u03b11/2 = \u03b1\u2032\n\n1/2, |\u03b11| = |\u03b12| =\n\u221a\n1/2, and a suitably chosen\n\nphase, do not worry. This path is not stationary since any\nnudge towards smaller |\u03b11| or |\u03b12| will decrease the residual,\nand there always must be a local path for this, since other-\nwise the state that we actually measure could not come about\nlocally. That is, it was somewhat unnecessary to include this\ncase here. However, it will make it easier to interpret the math-\nematics, which we turn to next.\n\nD. Interpretation\n\nBefore we get to the experimental tests I would like to offer\na hopefully helpful interpretation for what is going on. In the\nframework developed here, a massive object that is in a super-\nposition of two different locations is somewhat like a virtual\nparticle-antiparticle pair in a Feynman diagram. It can exist\ntemporarily but will not appear in outgoing states, just that\nhere the \u201coutgoing\u201d states are detector eigenstates that must\nbe, to good precision, product states of matter and metric. The\nrequired precision is given by the accumulated Penrose phase.\n\nHowever, the temporal and spatial extension of these inter-\nmediate superpositions much exceeds those of virtual particles\nbecause quantum gravitational effects are so small. They can\nexist over a duration given by approximately \u03c4 \u223c 1/(m|\u03a612)|\nwhich, for elementary particles, is enormously large (we will\nget to estimates in the next section).\n\nThe teleological element of this construction is that the\nquestion of whether the state stays in a superposition or col-\nlapses depends on whether it will be measured in the future,\ni.e. whether it will go on to interact with a detector or not.\n\nPersonally I do not read much into this mathematical prop-\nerty because I do not think of this model as fundamental.\nThere is also no good reason for why virtual particles can\u2019t\nbecome real other than that we know they are just a way to\nkeep track of integrals, and real particles must be on-shell\nby construction. Asking how virtual particles \u201cknow\u201d that\nthey need to disappear again is just a meaningless question.\nI think that the question of how a particle in a superposition of\ntwo locations \u201cknows\u201d it must recombine is equally meaning-\nless. But the reader who feels uncomfortable with the future-\ndependence might want to imagine that indeed all possible\ntime evolutions happen, each in its own universe, it\u2019s just that\nthe probability that we find ourselves in a universe with a cat-\nstate is vanishingly small, as we saw in the previous subsec-\ntion.\n\nThe comparison to virtual particles also helps to understand\nwhy, in this approach, we do not need to integrate the residual\nall the way to infinity. This is because for practical purposes\nwe can chop the time evolution apart into disconnected dia-\ngrams at any sufficiently localised and near classical (think\n\n\n\nE Weak Measurements 8\n\n\u201creal\u201d) final state, that is the end of a measurement process.\n\nE. Weak Measurements\n\nOnce we have the probabilistic formulation, we can deal\nwith weak measurements. One of the standard definitions for\nweak measurements is loosely speaking a detector that only\nsometimes makes a detection. Concretely, let us consider a\nweak measurement that answers the question \u201cIs the system\nin state |q\u27e9?\u201d The detector can then be described by two oper-\nators M\u0302+ and M\u0302\u2212, the former describing a positive, the latter\na negative (no) detection. These operators can be defined as\n\nM\u0302+ :=\n\u221a\np |q\u27e9\u27e8q| , (43)\n\nM\u0302\u2212 := 11 \u2212\n(\n1\u2212\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 p\n\n)\n|q\u27e9\u27e8q| , (44)\n\nwith some detection probability p \u226a 1. That is, we refor-\nmulate the weak measurement as a collapse that happens only\nwith a small probability [26].\n\nThere is a simple way to interpret such a device in the model\npresented here. A weak measurement detector is one that only\nsometimes maintains the residual ||R|| and sometimes washes\nit out. This can happen if the imprint of the state |q\u27e9 was not\nlarge enough for the detector to reliably amplify it to a macro-\nscopic level. An example could be that frequent interactions\nwith atoms in a gas can make states less, rather than more, dis-\ntinguishable, essentially by adding noise. Whether a system\nactually acts as a detector, therefore, depends not only on its\nnumber of constituents, but on how they interact and just how\nquickly that increases ||R||. A weak measurement device sits\nat the threshold between detection and no detection.\n\nA second definition of weak measurement which is fre-\nquently used [27] is that the detector itself is described by a\nstate |M\u27e9 that changes only mildly to a state |M \u2032\u27e9 with large\noverlap, i.e. |\u27e8M |M \u2032\u27e9| \u223c 1. In this case, the \u2018weakness\u2019 of the\nmeasurement lies in the difficulty of reading out the difference\nbetween the two states, which only sometimes works.\n\nThe distinction between the two definitions of a weak mea-\nsurement is therefore about what one calls the \u201cmeasurement\u201d\nand not the actual mechanism. I think that the imprint in |M \u2032\u27e9\nwould better be referred to as a pre-measurement and the term\nmeasurement be reserved for a successful amplification. In\nany case, both definitions mean that the record of the ob-\nservable is only sometimes amplified to macroscopic scales,\nwhich can be described in the context of this model as a sys-\ntem that only sometimes accumulates a large Penrose phase.\n\nOne must keep in mind though that the question of whether\na device acts as a detector does not depend on whether ||R||\ngrows, but whether\n\n\u222b\ndt||R|| reaches \u223c 1. That is, the de-\n\ntection threshold is a residual that grows faster than 1/t for a\nsufficient duration.\n\nF. Free Particles\n\nIn the previous subsections we assumed that the wavefunc-\ntions on each branch are gravitationally coherent states. By\nthis I mean that the matter \u2297 gravity sector is coherent. The\nmatter and gravity sectors do not have to be each coherent in-\nternally. Gravitationally coherent states will, by construction,\nnot build up a residual.\n\nCanonically coherent states in quantum mechanics are de-\nfined as eigenstates of the annihilation operators. They are\noften interpreted as the closest approximation to a classical\nstate. Their main feature is, as the name suggests, that they\nhave only one overall phase. However, to avoid an accumula-\ntion of the Penrose-phase it is sufficient that a state remains\ncoherent, it need not necessarily be a canonically coherent\nstate: any state that maintains only one overall phase under\nthe canonical evolution will do.\n\nIf one strictly defines a freely propagating particles as one\nthat asymptotically goes to infinity, then any arbitrarily small\nresidual would build up and eventually exceed the residual\ncost of going off the Schro\u0308dinger evolution at the previous in-\nteraction. Therefore, in the model presented here, asymptotic\nparticle states in Feynman diagrams must be gravitationally\ncoherent. Then again, we never observe asymptotic states, be-\ncause to observe them they must go into a detector and not to\ninfinity.\n\nIV. TESTS\n\nBefore we turn to estimates for the prospects of testing the\nmodel proposed here, I want to point out some relevant differ-\nences to the Penrose-Dio\u0301si (hereafter PD) model.\n\nIn the PD model, the deviation from the standard\nSchro\u0308dinger equation comes from a noise-kernel that scales\nwith the gravitational self-energy of the mass-density. The\nstrength of this effect first grows for small separation, as long\nas the wave-packets overlap. But once the wave-packets are to\ngood approximation orthogonal, the strength of the deviation\ndrops with the inverse of the distance between them. (If the\nbranches are not each internally coherent, a residue remains\nfor each branch.)\n\nIn the model proposed here, in contrast, the contribution\nto the Penrose phase grows with the dislocation of the wave-\npackets, but once the wave-packets are orthogonal it becomes\nconstant and to good approximation independent of the dis-\ntance4. This is basically because the residual that I am using\nmeasures distance in Hilbert-space and not in spacetime.\n\nThe other difference between the models is what I already\nmentioned in III A: The effect in this new model scales with\nthe sum of the gravitational potentials, whereas in the PD-\nmodel it scales with the variance of the gravitational self-\nenergy. In both cases though one has to avoid integrating over\n\n4 Strictly speaking, there is a contribution to the phase from the Newtonian\npotential at one branch evaluated at the other. However, I set that to ap-\nproximately zero exactly because it will drop with separation.\n\n\n\nA Estimates 9\n\npoint-like sources because that would bring in a divergence\nfrom the Newtonian potential. I will therefore here, as usual,\nassume that the mass-density is smeared out over a radius that\nroughly scales like the width of the wave-packet.\n\nA. Estimates\n\nThe great benefit of this model is that since the collapse is\ncaused by a known entity\u2014gravity\u2014the process has no free\nparameters. Let us therefore make some order-of-magnitude\nestimates for when the effects of the model proposed here\nshould become relevant.\n\nIn the best case (near a maximally localised particle), we\ncan estimate \u03a612 \u223c (m/mp)\n\n2, where mp is the Planck mass.\nThis gives us a Penrose phase \u223c \u03c4m3/m2\n\np. Our task is now\nto find cases where the collapse induced by this phase is not\nmasked by decoherence.\n\nFor elementary particles, the Penrose phase is ridiculously\nsmall. For an electron, for example, its effect will become\nnoticeable at a time of approximately\n\n\u03c4e \u223c\nm2\n\np\n\nm3\n\u223c 7\u00d7 1023 sec . (45)\n\nEven for a heavy nucleus with, say, 100 nucleons, we have\nm \u223c 100 GeV and \u03c4 \u223c 108 seconds. These effects will be\nmasked by environmental decoherence easily.\n\nWhat about quantum computers? At first, this sounds like\na promising idea because quantum computers are designed to\nproduce massive amounts of entanglement while keeping de-\ncoherence at bay. However, in a quantum computer the masses\nthat move are tiny.\n\nConsider for example a superconducting circuit that will\nmove something like Ne = 106 electrons. To get a collapse\ntime of \u223c 1 second, we would thus optimistically need \u223c 1017\n\nqubits, if we were to create a fully entangled state. To take the\nother extreme, if we just have a product of qubits, each of\nwhich is in a superposition (of electron locations), then we\nhave to use the\n\n\u221a\nn scaling from subsection II D and we need\n\n\u223c 1035 qubits. In a realistic setting the number would be\nsomewhere in between but probably closer to the latter esti-\nmate. In any case, clearly, this is not going to happen any time\nsoon. The situation is even worse for other types of qubits,\nsuch as ion traps, neutral atoms, or photon states, because they\ndislocate even smaller masses. This makes my estimate con-\nsiderably less optimistic than those put forward in [28, 29].\n\nWhat we need is instead a lot of mass that moves coher-\nently, so that we can witness its collapse. This is the bad\nnews. The good news is that this mass does not need to move\nby a lot, it just needs to move enough so that we can consider\nthe wavefunctions as sufficiently displaced for our estimate to\nhold. This is not much. We just need to displace e.g. atomic\nnuclei by more than the typical diameter of the nucleus, that\nis, some femtometres.\n\nB. Existing Proposals\n\nExperimental setups which are in the parameter range of\ntesting the model proposed here (maybe not so surprisingly)\nare attempts to probe quantum gravity by bringing small ob-\njects (typically made of silicon) into a superposition of two\ncoherent oscillation states [30\u201332]. To get a collapse time of\n\u223c 1 second, we would need to displace a total mass of about\n0.2 nanogram (or, equivalently, a mass of about 1 ng with a\ncoherent fraction of 0.2). The model proposed here predicts\nthat superpositions which exceed this bound from the Penrose\nphase do not exist, or they cannot stay coherent, respectively.\nThe decoherence time of these objects is currently in the ms\nrange [33], so either the masses of the oscillators need to fur-\nther increase or the coherence be improved, but we are not so\nfar away from being able to test this model. I consider this to\nbe the currently most promising experimental avenue.\n\nA completely different way to test this model would be\nto see whether matter and gravity actually can be entangled.\nThere are some experiments gearing up to look for this, see\ne.g. [34]. However, most of the experiments currently under-\nway that use \u201centanglement witnesses\u201d [35, 36] to probe the\nquantisation of gravity actually measure the entanglement in-\ndirectly through the matter sector, so they are not sensitive to\nthe product state constraint.\n\nThe product state requirement will not affect real graviton\nemission provided one treats the graviton also as a particle5.\nIt will set constraints on the possible matter states created in\nscattering processes. However, since we have zero evidence\nthat gravitons exist, and measuring them is far outside exper-\nimental reach for the foreseeable future, it is rather moot to\ndiscuss this point.\n\nAnother possibility to test this model would be to investi-\ngate closer just which type of in-medium interactions result\nin a sufficient accumulation of ||R|| to induce a collapse, and\nwhether there are cases when that would happen before de-\ncoherence makes the effect undetectable. However, for all\nin-medium interactions that I have looked at so far, the accu-\nmulated residual and the inverse decoherence time are pretty\nmuch the same, so this does not seem to be promising.\n\nIt is worth noting that the model proposed here cannot be\ntested by looking for dispersive effects like those induced by\nthe noise-kernel of the Penrose-Dio\u0301si model [37].\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nI now want to spend a few words on why I think it makes\nsense to treat gravity differently from the other interactions.\n\nIn canonically or perturbatively quantised gravity, the en-\ntanglement between matter and its gravitational field can be\n\n5 The assumption that particles and geometry are ultimately the same does\nnot per se require the existence of gravitons. However, I find it hard to\nsee how one could have geometry with quantum features and not also have\npropagating modes, i.e. gravitons.\n\n\n\n10\n\nbest understood by what is called a \u2018dressing\u2019 in the context\nof quantum field theory. This is the formal acknowledgement\nthat a particle which carries a charge\u2014say, an electron that\ncarries electric charge\u2014never occurs in nature without the\nfield created by that charge. A bare electron appears only in\nthe mathematics. Real electrons always come with soft (low\nenergy) photon clouds: This is the dressing.\n\nIf one has an electron that is in a superposition of two\nbranches, then each branch has its own dressing. They are\nindependent from each other and can have a relative phase.\nConsequently, the electron is entangled with the soft photon\ndressing. The entanglement in quantum gravity comes about\nin the same way: it describes a dressing by soft gravitons that\ncan then be interpreted as the field caused by the particle, or\nthe geometric deformation respectively.\n\nIn the approach that I started from, however, soft photons\nare very different from soft gravitons. The photons are par-\nticles and independent of the electrons. The soft gravitons,\nhowever, are not because, by assumption, the particle and its\ngeometry are ultimately the same. They are the same, that is,\nup to freely propagating modes that are hard gravitons.\n\nThe reason this makes sense at least to me is that if we\ntreat the graviton dressing like the photon dressing, then the\nmathematical description of a particle in a superposition of\nmultiple locations carries no information about it in fact being\none particle. There is formally no way we could know that,\nsay, half an electron with its own dressing is actually not itself\na fundamental particle other than by normalisation. But the\nnormalisation just tells us that we cannot measure only one\nbranch in isolation, which is exactly the fact that needs ex-\nplanation. But half an electron does not exist any more than\nan electron without an electric field. To put this differently:\nTwo branches of one particle are not physically independent\nbecause they cannot exist separately.\n\nThe product state requirement can thus be seen as a way\nto make sure that it is always entire particles that create a ge-\nometry, and this in turn explains why we can only measure\nentire particles. In other words, the Hamiltonian constraint\nshould act per particle sector (of Fock space), and not point-\nwise. This is why, intuitively, the state of a particle in two\nbranches has mixed terms that essentially describe part of a\nparticle in one place with a gravitational field sourced from\nanother place. This happens exactly because the rest of the\nparticle must be somewhere.\n\nI know that I did not, in fact, put forward the mathemat-\nics for these statements. That is because it would just add as-\nsumptions that are unnecessary to arrive at the phenomenolog-\nical consequences which were the focus of this paper. How-\never, I wanted to provide this explanation as motivation.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the estimate presented here\ndoes not rest on the product state assumption. By order of\nmagnitude one would expect most deviations from canoni-\ncally quantised gravity to give a similar result.\n\nI interpret this model as a way to reconcile the present for-\nmalism of quantum mechanics with a possibly underlying the-\nory. The teleology of this model is likely a mathematical arti-\nfact that originates in the way that we have developed quantum\nmechanics. This is because the teleology of the model pre-\n\nsented here ultimately comes from the way that we describe\nthe initial (prepared) state of the system. But how do we even\nknow what this state is? We have simply inferred these states\n(and their Hamiltonian operators) from the results of count-\nless experiments. We have no evidence that the initial state in\nstandard quantum mechanics is an ontological state, rather, it\nis a reconstruction for the purpose of fitting our measurement\nresults.\n\nIs it any surprise, then, that if we ask for the local time evo-\nlution of such a reconstructed state, we get a model in which\nthe choice of measurement variable must fit with what hap-\npened before the measurement? I think that this odd feature\nwill make sense once we understand the underlying physics,\njust like the electron\u2019s magnetic moment made sense once we\nunderstood what a spin 1/2 particle is.\n\nFinally, I want to stress that nowhere have I assumed that\nthe geometry is classical. Indeed, in general it is not classical:\nThe geometry can have superpositions and it can also be in-\nternally entangled. It is just that states of the geometry with\nsignificant quantum features will not survive for long because\nof the residual build-up.\n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nI have shown here how the assumption that matter and ge-\nometry have the same fundamental origin requires the time\nevolution of a quantum state to differ from the Schro\u0308dinger\nequation. This has the consequence that the ideal time evo-\nlutions which minimise the action are those with end states\nthat are to good approximation classical. We can then identify\nthese end states with the eigenstates of the measurement de-\nvice. This new model therefore explains why quantum states\nseem to \u2018collapse\u2019 into eigenstates of the measurement ob-\nservable, and how this can happen while preserving locality.\n\nSince the collapse process is governed by quantum grav-\nitational contributions whose strength is known, the result-\ning model is parameter free. Collapse happens in this\nmodel whenever the accumulated phase difference between\ndislocated branches, \u03c4m|\u03a612|, exceeds \u223c 1. The model\u2019s\nphenomenology\u2014notably the collapse itself\u2014can be tested in\nroughly the same parameter range as other tests of the weak\nfield limit of quantum gravity.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI acknowledge help from ChatGPT 5 for literature research\nas well as checking this manuscript. I swear I actually wrote\nit myself.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nI here want to briefly summarise Penrose\u2019s argument [5]\nand the mean field approach to semi-classical gravity. As in\nthe body of this paper, we consider a particle in a superposi-\ntion of two locations x\u20d71 and x\u20d72. Each has an energy density,\n\u03c11 and \u03c12, centred around its position, but the particles are so\n\n\n\n11\n\nfar apart that their overlap is negligible. We will assume that\neach lump of the superposition on its own is to good accuracy\nclassical and denote their Newtonian potentials as \u03a61 and \u03a62,\nrespectively, where \u22072\u03a61/2 = 4\u03c0G\u03c11/2.\n\nIn approaches like perturbatively or canonically quantized\ngravity, the full state will be entangled with the metric,\nschematically \u03b11|\u03c71\u27e9|g1\u27e9+ \u03b12|\u03c72\u27e9|g2\u27e9, where |\u03c71/2\u27e9 are the\nparts of the matter wave-function in either location, and |g1/2\u27e9\nthe metrics.\n\nNow remember that in General Relativity the Newtonian\npotential appears as a correction to the time-time component\nof the metric tensor gtt \u2248 \u2212(1+2\u03a6). Also remember that the\nlapse N , which can be said to quantify the passage of time, is\nbasically N =\n\n\u221a\n\u2212g00 \u2248 1 + \u03a6. We can then estimate the\n\nmismatch between the two time coordinates as \u03b4N \u223c (\u03a61 \u2212\n\u03a62) := \u03b4\u03a6. This causes a discrepancy in the local acceleration\nof order \u03b4a \u223c \u2212\u2207\u03b4\u03a6.\n\nThe important step is now that Penrose interprets this\ndiscrepancy as a measure for the uncertainty in the time-\nevolution, and not just a difference. He argues that a natural\nmeasure of this uncertainty is the contribution to the gravita-\ntional self-energy which is\n\nE\n(Pen)\nG :=\n\n1\n\n4\u03c0G\n\n\u222b\nd3x (\u2207\u03b4\u03a6)2 . (46)\n\nIntegrating by parts and discarding the boundary term gives\n\nE\n(Pen)\nG = \u2212 1\n\n4\u03c0G\n\n\u222b\nd3x \u03b4\u03a6(\u22072\u03b4\u03a6) . (47)\n\nWe can then insert the non-relativistic propagator\n\n\u03a6(x\u20d7) = \u2212G\n\u222b\nd3y\n\n\u03c1(y\u20d7)\n\n|x\u20d7\u2212 y\u20d7|\n(48)\n\nand get\n\nE\n(Pen)\nG =\n\nG\n\n2\n\n\u222b\nd3x\n\n\u222b\nd3y\n\n\u03b4\u03c1(x\u20d7)\u03b4\u03c1(y\u20d7)\n\n|x\u20d7\u2212 y\u20d7|\n, (49)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c1 := \u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12.\nSince Penrose interprets the spread in lapses as an uncer-\n\ntainty, he says that this self-energy mismatch will cause dif-\nferent branches to lose phase-correlations at a timescale of\n\u03c4 \u223c 1/E\n\n(Pen)\nG . He then conjectures that \u201cThe basic stationary\n\nstates into which a general superposition would decay by state\nreduction are to be stationary solutions of the Schro\u0308dinger-\nNewton equation (SN-equation),\u201d ([6], emph orig.) which is\nsimilar to the behaviour we found in the previous subsections.\n\nHowever, such a decoherence just does not happen in either\ncanonically or perturbatively quantised gravity. Part of my\nreason for writing this paper was to close this gap.\n\nOne finds a similar result if one considers the Schro\u0308dinger-\nNewton equation [38, 39]\n\ni\u2202t\u03c8(x\u20d7, t) =\n\n(\n\u2212 1\n\n2m\n\u22072 + V +m \u03a6N\n\n)\n\u03c8(x\u20d7, t) (50)\n\nwith\n\n\u22072\u03a6N = 4\u03c0Gm |\u03c8(x\u20d7, t)|2 , (51)\n\nas a mean-field approximation. How good this approximation\nis can be quantified by calculating the variance of the density,\nthat is, the strength of the quantum fluctuations around the\nmean value, where the mean value gives rise to the classical\nmetric. For this, one replaces \u03c1 with an operator \u03c1\u0302 that is\nacting on the matter state, and defines \u03b4\u03c1\u0302 := \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 \u27e8\u03c1\u0302\u27e9 (note:\nthis operator is not the same as the function \u03b4\u03c1 above), then\n\u27e8\u03b4\u03c1\u0302 \u03b4\u03c1\u0302\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c1\u03022\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8\u03c1\u0302\u27e92 is the variance and\n\nE\n(var)\nG =\n\nG\n\n2\n\n\u222b\nd3x\n\n\u222b\nd3y\n\n\u27e8\u03b4\u03c1\u0302(x\u20d7) \u03b4\u03c1\u0302(y\u20d7)\u27e9\n|x\u20d7\u2212 y\u20d7|\n\n(52)\n\nmeasures the deviations from the mean field approximation.\n\n[1] Ghirardi, G.

An \u201caction over Hilbert space\u201d selects local branch rotations and reproduces **Born\u2019s rule**; the collapse threshold is set by a gravity-controlled \u201cPenrose phase\u201d \u223c \u03c4 m |\u03a6\u2081\u2082|, giving concrete, **parameter-free** predictions (e.g., cat states of \u2273 ~0.2 ng should not remain coherent). \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n# Where they directly clash\n1) **Ontology of the quantum state**  \n- Mermin: state = personal belief; there is *no* \u201creal state\u201d to collapse.  \n- Hossenfelder: state encodes real matter\u2013geometry degrees of freedom subject to a product constraint; collapse is a real physical (local) process.  \nThese are flatly incompatible starting points. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n2) **Status of collapse**  \n- Mermin: \u201ccollapse\u201d = Bayesian update; nothing dynamical to explain.  \n- Hossenfelder: explicit dynamics selects a detector \u201cpointer\u201d branch; non-Schr\u00f6dinger evolution is essential near measurements. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n3) **Bell/locality & superdeterminism**  \n- Mermin\u2019s stance needs no hidden-variable machinery; no violation of measurement independence is invoked.  \n- Hossenfelder: any *local* model that matches experiments must violate measurement independence; thus adopts superdeterminism to keep locality. That\u2019s a commitment Mermin would regard as unnecessary because (in his view) there was never a dynamical problem to solve. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n# Where they talk past each other (so no immediate experimental contradiction)\n- **Empirical content today:** Mermin offers an interpretive dissolution, not new testable deviations. Hossenfelder predicts gravity-triggered loss of coherence above a calculable mass\u2013time threshold (e.g., massive mechanical cat states), but those regimes are only now becoming accessible. Until such tests are run, the disagreement is philosophical/structural, not about already-observed data. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\n# Bottom line\n- **Conceptually:** Mermin\u2019s \u201cno problem, no collapse\u201d view *contradicts* the core premise of Hossenfelder\u2019s paper that collapse is a real, local, gravity-linked phenomenon.  \n- **Experimentally:** Only Sabine\u2019s side sticks its neck out; if future macroscopic-superposition experiments *do* see the predicted gravity-scale collapse, that would undercut Mermin\u2019s \u201cnothing physical happens at measurement\u201d stance. If they *don\u2019t*, her particular mechanism (and perhaps the broader \u201ccollapse is physical\u201d program) would be in trouble, leaving Mermin\u2019s viewpoint unscathed. \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file0\ue201 \ue200filecite\ue202turn0file1\ue201\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can extract and line up the key claims/equations that drive Sabine\u2019s testable predictions (the product-state constraint, the residual functional S, the \u03c4 m |\u03a6\u2081\u2082| criterion) against Mermin\u2019s specific objections to objective collapse, in a one-page crib."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[{"start_ix":991,"end_ix":1012,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"2206.10741v1.pdf","id":"file_000000006b3862069d32029b3f8edb36","source":"my_files","text":"","extra":{"retrieval_turn":0,"retrieval_file_index":0,"cited_message_idx":7,"cited_message_id":"d4fb5882-4cdb-4309-92c4-9be2d84e1399","search_result_idx":null,"line_range":null,"cloud_doc_url":null,"authors_display":null,"doi":null,"publication_year":"None","journal_name":null}}},{"start_ix":1718,"end_ix":1739,"citation_format_type":"berry_file_search","metadata":{"type":"file","name":"How Gracity can Explain the Collapse of the Wave Function -

Here\u2019s how someone in the \u201cmirage\u201d camp (Mermin/QBism-ish) would answer both points without hand-waving.\n\n# First: what \u201cmirage\u201d means\nThe \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d arises if you treat the quantum state \u03c8 as an **objective physical state** that must evolve sometimes unitarily and sometimes by \u201ccollapse.\u201d The mirage thesis instead says: \u03c8 is an **agent\u2019s probability catalog** for the outcomes of the experiments they *might* perform; \u201ccollapse\u201d is just **Bayesian updating** on the outcome they *did* obtain. The only extra, empirical ingredient beyond ordinary coherence is the **Born rule**, which constrains how an agent\u2019s probabilities for different, incompatible experiments fit together. No split dynamics, no special physical event called \u201ccollapse.\u201d\n\n## (i) \u201cDoesn\u2019t entanglement make the state objective?\u201d\n- **What entanglement objectively gives you:** patterns of **nonclassical correlations** between outcomes that any well-informed agent can test (violations of Bell inequalities, GHZ contradictions, Tsirelson bounds). Those correlations are objective features of the world.\n- **What it doesn\u2019t force:** that the **wavefunction itself** be a beable (a thing the world possesses independent of any agent). In the mirage view, an \u201centangled state\u201d is a compact way for an agent to encode *joint* betting odds that cannot be written as a mixture of product odds. Two agents with different information can assign different states (even entangled vs separable); once they share data, their assignments tend to converge (state tomography), but the state remains an **inference tool**, not a microscopic stuff.\n- **About no-go theorems (e.g., PBR):** they show that certain **\u03c8-epistemic hidden-variable** models (where \u03c8 reflects incomplete knowledge of deeper variables under assumptions like preparation independence) don\u2019t reproduce quantum statistics. The mirage/QBist move is different: it **doesn\u2019t posit hidden variables at all**. So those theorems don\u2019t force \u03c8 to be ontic; they narrow the options if you insist on hidden variables.\n\n## (ii) \u201cDouble slit is more than updating odds\u2014collapsed vs not is starkly different!\u201d\nYou\u2019re right that the patterns differ dramatically. But that contrast is fully explained **without** positing a physical collapse:\n\n- **With no which-path record:** amplitude at screen point x is \u03c8(x)=\u03c8\u2081(x)+\u03c8\u2082(x). Probability  \n  P(x)=|\u03c8|\u00b2=|\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2+|\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2+2Re(\u03c8\u2081\u03c8\u2082*): interference fringes.\n- **With a which-path interaction (detector or environment):** the particle becomes entangled with a path marker |E\u2081\u27e9,|E\u2082\u27e9:  \n  |\u03a8\u27e9 \u221d |1\u27e9|E\u2081\u27e9 + |2\u27e9|E\u2082\u27e9.  \n  The screen probability is  \n  P(x)=|\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2+|\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2+2Re(\u27e8E\u2082|E\u2081\u27e9 \u03c8\u2081\u03c8\u2082*).  \n  If the path records are (nearly) orthogonal, \u27e8E\u2082|E\u2081\u27e9\u22480 and **interference vanishes**.\n- Nothing \u201ccollapsed.\u201d The **unitary** interaction that *in principle* makes path information available kills the cross term (decoherence). After you *see* a specific dot on the screen, switching from a prior distribution P(x) to a posterior (\u201cthe dot is at x\u2080\u201d) is indeed **updating odds**\u2014but the **presence or absence of interference** was already fixed by the **setup** (whether you created which-path entanglement), not by a post-hoc mental act. \u201cQuantum eraser\u201d experiments make this crystal clear: interference can be recovered only in **conditionally selected** subensembles that undo/access the path record; the unconditional pattern still has no fringes.\n\n---\n\n### The crux\n- **Your intuition**: \u201cWe see sharp, setup-dependent differences; so something physical must \u2018collapse\u2019.\u201d  \n- **Mirage reply**: \u201cYes to sharp, physical differences\u2014but they come from **different interventions** (different instruments/Hamiltonians) and the ensuing **entanglement/decoherence**, all unitary. \u2018Collapse\u2019 is just the agent\u2019s **conditionalization** after an outcome. The only normative rule tying all those probability books together is the **Born rule**.\u201d\n\nIf you *want* a literal mechanism that picks one outcome (a physical collapse), you must add structure beyond this\u2014hidden variables, objective collapse, or (as in Sabine\u2019s proposal) a gravity-linked, local superdeterministic dynamics. That\u2019s precisely where her paper **disagrees** with Mermin: she says there *is* a real collapse process to explain, and it should have **testable** mass\u2013time thresholds; Mermin says there was never a physical collapse to explain in the first place."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68ee0363bae08191a46d574ec91f5007","request_id":"98e69a224b799c50-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"2422dee3-15dc-43b6-8d96-e3d27b3167dd","turn_exchange_id":"e1ae73ef-626d-4f1d-9e86-59a520d38cc1","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"2422dee3-15dc-43b6-8d96-e3d27b3167dd","children":[]}}}
