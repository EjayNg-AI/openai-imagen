Many have moderated their earlier dire predictions as the economy showed resilience through 2023\u20132024. For instance, Moody\u2019s Analytics recently estimated the probability of a downturn around 35%, while Goldman Sachs put the odds near 20%; J.P. Morgan\u2019s economists pegged recession chances closer to 40% under more extreme policy assumptions\u30105\u2020L254-L262\u3011. Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief U.S. economist likewise noted that the recession likelihood has \u201crisen\u201d to perhaps **20\u201325%**, roughly double the risk in a normal year\u30108\u2020L508-L516\u3011. At the same time, some forecasters argue the **\u201csoft landing\u201d** scenario is plausible \u2013 citing cooling inflation and a strong job market \u2013 meaning the economy could slow without contracting\u301034\u2020L197-L204\u3011. Overall, expert sentiment characterizes the recession risk for 2025 as **moderate**: not negligible, but far from a consensus expectation of an inevitable downturn.\n\n## Bond Yield Trends  \nOne of the clearest warning signals of recession in recent years has come from the bond market. The U.S. **yield curve** (the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields) inverted in 2022 and remained inverted through much of 2023 \u2013 meaning short-term yields rose *above* long-term yields\u301019\u2020L349-L358\u3011. Historically, every U.S. recession in the last 50 years was preceded by an inverted yield curve, with very few false alarms\u301019\u2020L349-L358\u3011. In fact, the Federal Reserve\u2019s own yield-curve model at one point assigned well over a **30%** probability of recession within 12 months (a high figure by historical standards) based on the deep yield curve inversion\u301020\u2020L11-L16\u3011. As of early 2025, the curve has begun to normalize \u2014 for example, the 10-year Treasury yield recently climbed slightly *above* the 2-year yield (around 4.3% vs. 4.0% in March)\u301012\u2020L11-L18\u3011 \u2014 reflecting expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates. This steepening could imply investors see slower inflation or growth ahead. **Bottom line:** The bond market has been flashing caution. The prolonged yield curve inversion over the past couple years is a classic harbinger of recession, though the timing is uncertain and unique factors (like strong post-pandemic demand) may have delayed its signal.\n\n## Stock Market Action  \nThe stock market\u2019s behavior over the past few years has been turbulent, mirroring shifting economic expectations. In 2022, equities fell sharply into a bear market as the Federal Reserve\u2019s rapid rate hikes and surging inflation weighed on valuations. The S&P 500 index ended 2022 down about 18%, its worst yearly loss since 2008, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged over 30% during that inflation scare. However, 2023 brought a strong rebound: major indices rallied as inflation gradually eased and corporate earnings proved better than feared. By late 2024, the S&P 500 had even approached new highs, reflecting optimism about a soft landing. \n\nVolatility has resurfaced heading into 2025. A notable **market sell-off** in early 2025 erased gains that followed the November elections, with the S&P 500 dropping roughly 9% below its recent peak amid renewed economic jitters\u30108\u2020L489-L497\u3011. In one early-March week, the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all **fell heavily** as recession fears mounted\u301018\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Investors have become skittish, quickly rotating out of risk assets on any hint of trouble. The VIX \u201cfear index\u201d spiked during these pullbacks, indicating heightened uncertainty. On the other hand, there are still pockets of optimism \u2013 periods of rally persist when data comes in strong or when policymakers signal support. Overall, **investor sentiment** in equity markets is cautious: the bull market of 2021 gave way to a volatile, range-bound market reflecting both hopes (strong fundamentals, earnings growth) and fears (policy missteps, slowing demand). This push-and-pull in stocks suggests that while markets are not pricing in a certain recession, they are **on edge** and quick to react to recession-related news.\n\n## Market Valuation Trends  \nBy many metrics, U.S. equity valuations remain elevated, which could amplify the impact of any economic slowdown. **Price-to-earnings ratios** have expanded in the past year thanks to rising stock prices. The forward **P/E** for the S&P 500 recently hovered around 21\u201322, which is well *above* historical norms \u2013 for context, the 5-year average forward P/E is about 19.6 and the 20-year average ~15.8\u301032\u2020L75-L82\u3011. On a cyclically adjusted basis, the **Shiller CAPE** (which smooths earnings over 10 years) is near 35, roughly double its long-term median of ~16\u301030\u2020L29-L37\u3011. Such levels were only surpassed during the 1990s tech bubble and briefly in 2021, underscoring that stocks are priced for optimistic outcomes. \n\nOther valuation measures tell a similar story: \n\n- **Market Cap-to-GDP (\u201cBuffett Indicator\u201d)** \u2013 Total U.S. stock market value is around *200% of GDP*, which is **signaling an overvalued market** by historical standards\u301029\u2020L277-L284\u3011. (This ratio hit ~205% at the end of 2024, near record highs\u301029\u2020L277-L284\u3011.)  \n- **P/E vs. History** \u2013 The S&P\u2019s forward earnings multiple of ~22 is higher than its 5-, 10-, and even 25-year averages, reflecting a market that is priced richly relative to recent earnings capacity\u301032\u2020L75-L82\u3011.  \n- **Other Ratios** \u2013 Price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios for the market are likewise above long-term norms, although not uniformly across sectors (tech and growth stocks are pricier, while some value sectors trade closer to average multiples).\n\nHigh valuations do not cause recessions, but they **can exacerbate market downturns** if growth falters. An overvalued market is more vulnerable to a correction if investors suddenly anticipate declining earnings or a tighter credit environment. The current lofty valuations imply a lot of good news is priced in \u2013 leaving little margin of safety should the economic outlook deteriorate. This could lead to a sharper stock market reaction in the event of any recession signs, creating a negative wealth effect that feeds back into the economy.\n\n## Government Policies  \n**Monetary policy** has been a key swing factor for recession risk. The Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle starting in 2022, raising interest rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s to combat high inflation. The Fed\u2019s policy rate climbed from near zero to over **5%** by mid-2023, a level not seen in 22 years. These rate hikes were designed to slow the economy and tame price pressures, and indeed they contributed to cooler inflation by late 2023. However, higher rates also increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, acting as a brake on growth. By early 2024, with inflation coming down and growth surprising on the upside, the Fed began shifting to a more neutral stance. Officials signaled \u201cflexibility\u201d and even enacted the first modest rate **cuts** in late 2024\u301014\u2020L174-L182\u3011\u301014\u2020L176-L184\u3011. As of early 2025, the Fed has adopted a patient approach \u2013 policy rates remain moderately high, but further tightening is on hold given the progress on inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the economy was on \u201ca good path\u201d of low unemployment and easing inflation\u301034\u2020L197-L204\u3011, implying the Fed aims to avoid overtightening into a recession. That said, the Fed stands ready to raise rates again if inflation reaccelerates, which injects some uncertainty into the outlook.\n\n**Fiscal policy** is another important influence. During 2020\u20132021, massive federal stimulus helped spur a rapid recovery, but it also left a legacy of large budget deficits. Even in 2023\u201324, fiscal deficits remained unusually high (around **6.3% of GDP** in FY2024)\u301036\u2020L91-L99\u3011 despite the strong economy. This ongoing fiscal support has arguably propped up consumer spending and growth \u2013 for example, government infrastructure projects and investments from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act boosted sectors like construction and manufacturing. However, high deficits also mean less room for new stimulus if the economy turns down. Federal debt is near 100% of GDP and interest costs on that debt have surged (the government\u2019s net interest payments jumped ~34% in 2024)\u301036\u2020L109-L117\u3011\u301036\u2020L110-L118\u3011. Looking ahead, there is policy uncertainty associated with the post-2024 election period. A new administration or Congress could change the fiscal stance: for instance, proposals for large tax cuts or spending increases might provide short-term growth lift but risk higher inflation, whereas aggressive deficit reduction (spending cuts) could **weaken demand** and tip the economy toward recession. Additionally, trade and regulatory policies are a wild card \u2013 any escalation in trade tariffs or disruptive regulatory changes could dampen business confidence (as seen in early 2025 with new tariff announcements stirring market fears\u301040\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u301040\u2020L167-L175\u3011). \n\nIn summary, government policies are a double-edged sword for recession risk. On one hand, the Fed\u2019s potential to **ease** (cut rates or even pause quantitative tightening) in response to any weakness could cushion the economy. On the other hand, policy missteps \u2013 such as not easing fast enough, or fiscal moves that shock confidence \u2013 could be the trigger that turns a slow-growth scenario into a recession. Close attention will be paid to Fed decisions in 2025 (as the central bank balances inflation vs. growth) and to fiscal policy coming out of Washington, as these will strongly influence the recession odds.\n\n## Other Economic Indicators to Watch  \nBeyond markets and policy, a range of real-economy indicators provide insight into the health of the expansion. Here are several key metrics and their recent trends:\n\n- **Consumer Confidence:** U.S. consumers have sent somewhat mixed signals. In late 2024, consumer confidence reached its highest level in over a year \u2013 the Conference Board index hit **111.7 in November**, reflecting optimism about the labor market and slowing inflation\u301039\u2020L167-L175\u3011. However, by February 2025 that optimism had faded: the index plunged to **98.3**, an eight-month low, in what one survey noted was the sharpest one-month drop in over three years\u301040\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u301040\u2020L184-L193\u3011. Households grew anxious about economic uncertainty and certain government policy moves (mentions of tariffs and political concerns spiked in the survey responses)\u301040\u2020L167-L175\u3011\u301040\u2020L174-L183\u3011. If consumer sentiment remains depressed, it could lead to more cautious spending. Conversely, any signs of stability (or relief from price pressures) might bolster confidence again. This back-and-forth in sentiment is important because consumer spending makes up ~70% of GDP \u2013 pessimistic consumers could **pull back** and increase recession risk, whereas confident consumers spending freely can keep the expansion going.\n\n- **Housing Market:** The housing sector has been under pressure from high interest rates. Mortgage rates more than doubled from their 2021 lows, reaching around 7% in 2023\u20132024, which dramatically cooled housing activity. Residential investment has been a drag on GDP as home sales declined. For example, **new home sales** in October 2024 were down 17% from the prior month\u2019s pace\u301039\u2020L162-L170\u3011, and home construction slowed. However, home prices nationally have not collapsed \u2013 in fact, prices were still up about 3\u20135% year-over-year in late 2024\u301039\u2020L162-L170\u3011. Limited housing supply and still-solid household incomes have buoyed prices even as sales volumes fell. Looking ahead to 2025, housing is a sector to watch: if interest rates stay high or rise again, housing could continue to **struggle**, weighing on growth (and potentially hurting consumer wealth perception). On the other hand, any decline in mortgage rates (or government housing incentives) could revive homebuyer demand and construction, providing a boost. At present, housing trends point to a lukewarm outlook \u2013 not a crash, but not the engine of growth it was in 2020\u201321, and historically housing downturns often precede broader recessions.\n\n- **Corporate Earnings:** Corporate profitability has so far been resilient, but there are signs of strain. After a banner 2021, earnings growth slowed in 2022 and was essentially flat through parts of 2023, as higher costs (wages, materials, borrowing costs) pinched profit margins. By early 2024, the earnings picture improved slightly \u2013 the S&P 500 is expected to post **~7% year-over-year earnings growth** in Q1 2025\u301031\u2020L395-L403\u3011, returning to growth after a period of very weak earnings in 2023. Sectors like technology and energy have seen particularly volatile earnings swings. Importantly, many companies remain cautious in their outlooks. **Corporate guidance** skews negative: about 59% of S&P 500 firms issuing guidance for 2025 have guided earnings *below* consensus, a higher-than-usual share of pessimistic outlooks\u301031\u2020L379-L387\u3011. This suggests that executives are bracing for slower sales or tighter profit margins ahead. If earnings disappoint or turn negative, businesses may respond by cutting costs (jobs, investment), which can contribute to a downturn. For now, positive earnings growth provides a cushion, but any deterioration in corporate results in upcoming quarters would be a strong warning sign of recession.\n\n- **Labor Market:** The job market has been a pillar of strength that so far has staved off recession. Unemployment has been hovering around **3.5%\u20134.0%**, near historic lows. As of late 2024, job gains were still solid \u2013 the U.S. added a higher-than-expected number of jobs in September and the jobless rate ticked *down* to 4.1%\u30107\u2020L167-L174\u3011. This robust employment has supported consumer spending and kept the economy growing despite other headwinds. Additionally, wage growth, while off its peak, remains decent, helping consumers cope with past inflation. However, there are some early signs the labor market may be cooling: job openings have come down from record highs, and layoffs in interest-sensitive industries (tech, finance, real estate) picked up from the ultra-low levels seen in 2021. Typically, recessions are marked by a sharp rise in unemployment \u2013 something not yet evident. A key indicator to watch is weekly **jobless claims** and monthly payroll gains. If claims begin trending materially higher and hiring slows markedly, it could signal that the Fed\u2019s tightening is finally spilling into the job market. For now, the labor market\u2019s strength is a **positive signal** arguing against an imminent recession; as long as Americans are working and earning, a severe contraction is less likely. But if the labor market unexpectedly cracks (for example, if businesses react to falling profits by slashing jobs), the odds of a 2025 recession would increase significantly.\n\n- **Business Investment & Manufacturing:** Business spending has been mixed. On one hand, manufacturing has been in a slump for much of 2023 \u2013 surveys of manufacturers (like the PMI indices) showed contraction as companies worked down excess inventories and exports faced global weakness. On the other hand, certain investment areas are booming, partly due to federal incentives (e.g. a surge in construction of semiconductor plants and renewable energy projects). **Corporate investment** in equipment and structures rose in late 2024, and orders for capital goods were fairly steady, indicating companies are still investing for growth in some sectors. If businesses grow wary of the outlook, they may freeze hiring or capital expenditures, which would slow the economy. Notably, small business optimism (per NFIB surveys) has been on the low side \u2013 small firms cite inflation and labor quality as top problems, and their outlook for future sales has been subdued. A deterioration in business confidence or a credit crunch would likely curtail investment. For now, this indicator is giving a cautiously neutral message: no collapse in capex yet, but sentiment is nowhere near exuberant.\n\nIn aggregate, these indicators present a **balanced picture**: there are clear weaknesses (housing, manufacturing, forward-looking sentiment) but also enduring strengths (jobs, consumer spending, corporate earnings growth). The interplay of these factors will determine whether the economy can keep expanding or finally tip into a mild recession.\n\n## Sentiment in Media and Surveys  \nThe tone in financial media and corporate surveys provides context for how people are perceiving the economy\u2019s direction. Over the past year, the phrase \u201crecession risk\u201d has been a constant drumbeat in business news \u2013 to the point that the anticipated recession of 2023 became dubbed \u201cthe most predicted recession that never happened.\u201d Entering 2025, sentiment is split between those sounding warnings and those pointing to encouraging signs. For example, news headlines in early 2025 highlighted the \u201cflashing warning signs\u201d \u2013 such as the inverted yield curve and volatility \u2013 and emphasized policy uncertainties. Reuters reported a **steep decline in both consumer and business confidence** by February 2025 as tariff concerns and political uncertainty mounted\u301040\u2020L161-L169\u3011. In that report, economists noted that Americans were \u201cgrowing anxious\u201d about potential negative impacts of new policies, and survey respondents overwhelmingly brought up concerns about tariffs and government actions\u301040\u2020L167-L175\u3011. Such anxiety can become self-fulfilling: one economist warned that unprecedented threats (like mass layoffs of federal workers in this scenario) were \u201cscaring the daylights out of consumers\u201d and could cause the economy to \u201cground to a halt\u201d if people and businesses pull back\u301040\u2020L174-L183\u3011. \n\nOn the corporate side, CEO and business surveys reflect guarded expectations. A late-2024 **CEO survey** found nearly half of chief executives expected a recession in the next 6\u201312 months\u301043\u2020L29-L35\u3011, even though many were still hiring and investing. The Conference Board\u2019s measure of CEO confidence in Q4 2024 was around 51 (on a scale where 50 is neutral)\u301043\u2020L3-L7\u3011 \u2013 indicating more optimism than mid-2023, but still far from exuberant. Notably, after the 2024 election, some sentiment measures briefly improved (especially among business leaders anticipating policy changes); for instance, small and mid-sized business CEO confidence saw a post-election bump according to one index. But as the new year dawned, **uncertainty** returned to the forefront. The general narrative in the business community is one of **preparing for a downturn just in case**: companies have been tightening their belts, building cash reserves, and focusing on efficiency in case the economic tide turns. \n\nIn the financial media, commentary is divided. Some analysts argue that as long as the job market holds and the Fed is cautious, the expansion can continue \u2013 a viewpoint that yields hopeful headlines about \u201csoft landing achieved.\u201d Others point to the historical patterns and urge caution, with op-eds declaring that a recession \u201cmay just be a matter of when, not if,\u201d given the lagged effects of monetary tightening. The result is that **market and economic sentiment is jittery**. Positive data sparks relief rallies and upbeat editorials, while any negative surprise (a weak jobs report, a bad inflation print, a geopolitical flare-up) quickly swings the narrative back to recession fears. This heightened sensitivity means expectations themselves could influence reality \u2013 if enough businesses and consumers act defensively due to fear of a recession, their collective pullback could actually trigger one. Policymakers are aware of this dynamic, which is why Fed officials have been careful in communications and the administration (whichever is in office) emphasizes economic \u201cresilience\u201d in public remarks to maintain confidence.\n\n## Outlook: How High is the Recession Probability for 2025?  \nBringing together all of the above evidence, what is the **overall probability** of a U.S. recession in 2025? Based on current data and expert analysis, the risk appears **elevated but not guaranteed**. Many forecasters indeed put the odds of a 2025 recession at roughly **1 in 3**, or about 30%. For example, a range of economist estimates cluster between 20% and 40% odds\u30105\u2020L254-L262\u3011\u30108\u2020L508-L516\u3011, reflecting the various positive and negative forces at play. On the pessimistic side, the historically reliable yield curve signal and the lag effect of past rate hikes suggest a significant chance that growth could roll over by mid-to-late 2025. Stubbornly high valuations and any policy shocks could also accelerate a downturn. On the optimistic side, the U.S. economy still has momentum \u2013 a strong labor market, solid consumer spending, and improving supply conditions \u2013 which could enable it to **skirt an outright recession** and instead settle into slower growth. Policymakers also have tools to respond if weakness emerges (the Fed could cut rates further, and fiscal policy could turn stimulative if needed, though with some constraints). \n\nA reasonable base-case assessment is that **2025 will see slower growth** and perhaps one or two weak quarters, but only a *mild recession* at most \u2013 and it\u2019s quite possible the economy avoids a technical recession altogether. In probability terms, one might assign roughly a **25\u201335% chance** of a recession occurring in 2025, which implies it\u2019s a material risk but more likely than not the U.S. manages to continue growing (even if modestly). Even those odds could shift depending on developments: for instance, if inflation flares up and the Fed tightens more, recession odds would rise; if inflation subsides gracefully and the Fed eases, odds would fall. \n\n**In summary**, the probability of a U.S. recession in 2025 is meaningful enough that businesses and investors are prudent to prepare for one, yet it is not so high that a recession is seen as inevitable. Most experts anticipate either a near-miss (a soft landing with growth just above zero) or a mild recession (a short, shallow contraction) rather than a severe downturn, barring an unforeseen shock. Therefore, our structured analysis concludes with an estimated recession probability on the order of **30%** for 2025, acknowledging significant uncertainty. Policymakers and economic actors can still influence this outcome \u2013 by sustaining confidence and navigating carefully \u2013 to tilt the odds further in favor of continued expansion. \n\n**Sources:** The analysis above is based on current views of economists and strategists\u30105\u2020L254-L262\u3011\u301018\u2020L55-L63\u3011, bond market recession indicators\u301019\u2020L349-L358\u3011\u301020\u2020L11-L16\u3011, stock market performance and valuation metrics\u301032\u2020L75-L82\u3011\u301030\u2020L29-L37\u3011, recent policy actions by the Federal Reserve\u301014\u2020L174-L182\u3011\u301034\u2020L197-L204\u3011, fiscal conditions and other economic data releases (consumer confidence, housing, earnings, labor market)\u301040\u2020L161-L169\u3011\u30107\u2020L167-L174\u3011.

Here's the detailed reasoning:\n\n### **Factors Indicating Increased Recession Risk**\n- **Bond Yield Curve:** A prolonged inversion (2022\u20132023) historically signals recession risk. Although it has started normalizing, its lagged recession signal typically unfolds 12\u201318 months later, placing 2025 within that critical window.\n- **Market Valuations:** Elevated P/E ratios (around 22) and market cap-to-GDP ratio (~160\u2013170%) indicate markets are priced for continued strong economic outcomes, increasing vulnerability if growth falters.\n- **Stock Market Volatility:** Increased volatility in early 2025 suggests investors fear possible recessionary pressures, showing heightened sensitivity to negative data.\n- **Corporate Earnings Sentiment:** A notable number of corporations are cautious about future earnings, suggesting business leaders foresee slowing economic growth or margin pressure.\n- **Consumer Confidence:** The sharp decline in early 2025 points to weakening consumer spending potential, significant given its dominance in U.S. GDP (~70%).\n\n## Factors Supporting Economic Stability\n- **Labor Market Strength:** Persistent low unemployment (~4%) and solid job creation remain critical stabilizers, implying recession, if it occurs, might be mild.\n- **Inflation Moderation & Fed Policy Flexibility:** Inflation significantly cooled, allowing the Federal Reserve room to cautiously adjust interest rates downward to stabilize growth if needed, enhancing prospects of a soft landing.\n- **Government Policy Flexibility:** Despite constraints from high debt, policymakers retain tools (targeted stimulus, regulatory easing, etc.) to avert a severe recession scenario.\n\n## Additional Key Observations\n- **Housing Market:** Continued weakness remains a drag on growth but unlikely to spiral without additional adverse shocks (sharp interest rate spikes or unemployment).\n- **Labor Market Resilience:** Strong employment numbers suggest economic momentum is still robust enough to delay or mitigate recessionary impacts significantly, making severe recession scenarios unlikely absent dramatic shifts.\n- **Geopolitical Risks:** Risks from geopolitical instability or sudden trade-policy shifts could accelerate a downturn, though these remain uncertain.\n\n## Probability Estimate of Recession in 2025\nConsidering all these indicators:\n\n- **Moderate scenario (most likely)**: Mild recession or no recession, GDP slows but remains slightly positive. Probability: **~50%**.\n- **Pessimistic scenario**: Clear recession, GDP contraction lasting 2\u20133 quarters due to lagged effects of prior tightening and valuation corrections. Probability: **~25%**.\n- **Optimistic scenario**: Robust growth continues without significant downturn, successfully achieving a soft landing. Probability: **~25%**.\n\nOverall estimated probability of recession in 2025: **approximately 40\u201350%** (mild downturn most likely if recession occurs).\n\n## Probability of a Severe Recession\n- Probability of severe recession or deep contraction in 2025: **relatively low (around 10\u201315%)**, given existing monetary and fiscal buffers.\n\n---\n\n## Is the U.S. likely to experience a recession (mild or otherwise) in 2025?\n- Yes, it\u2019s a significant risk, though likely mild or moderate.\n\n## Is the U.S. Likely Headed for Stagflation in 2025?\n- **Inflation Outlook:** Inflation has notably moderated from the 2022\u20132023 highs. The Federal Reserve\u2019s high interest rate environment through early 2024 effectively cooled price pressures significantly, returning inflation closer to historical averages by late 2024/early 2025.\n- **Growth Outlook:** While growth is slowing, the economy remains supported by a robust labor market and continued fiscal stimuli, even though constrained by debt levels.\n\nThus, the conditions for **stagflation** (high inflation and negative GDP growth simultaneously) in 2025 seem less probable. Given current conditions:\n\n- **Probability of stagflation (slow/no growth and persistently high inflation)**: **low (~15\u201320%)**.\n- More plausible is either a mild recession with moderate inflation or a soft-landing scenario.\n\n## Final Comprehensive Probability Assessment:\n- **No recession (soft landing): ~45%**\n- **Mild recession: ~40%**\n- **Severe recession: ~10\u201315%**\n- **Stagflation scenario: ~15\u201320%**\n\n### Bottom Line:\nThe probability of a U.S. recession in 2025 is elevated but still not definitive. While certain indicators (yield curves, market valuation, weakening consumer confidence) strongly suggest caution, monetary and fiscal policy interventions, coupled with resilient labor markets and improving inflation, mitigate the risks of a severe downturn. The most likely scenarios range from modest slowdown (soft landing) to mild recession."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"b19b0107-a89a-470a-853e-d18bcc1f790f","request_id":"91f0e6c9dd9a4c7d-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b19b0107-a89a-470a-853e-d18bcc1f790f","children":[]}}}
