HIghlight noteworthy developments and initiatives, and other information that readers will find interesting and relevant.\n\n---\n\n\r\n\r\nSINGAPORE \u2013 All students at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) will learn how to use generative artificial intelligence, or Gen AI, from January, to prepare them for workplaces where the technology is increasingly part of everyday work.\r\n\r\nInstead of being taught as a standalone subject, Gen AI will be embedded across the curriculum, with all students \u2013 regardless of their course of study \u2013 using it every year in at least one module through a structured approach.\r\n\r\nModelled on the PAIR framework \u2013 short for problem, AI, interaction and reflection \u2013 developed by Professor Oguz Acar, an expert in Gen AI at King\u2019s College London, the approach will guide students through four steps: defining a problem clearly, selecting appropriate AI tools, testing them through hands-on use, and reflecting on how the technology influences their thinking and decisions.\r\n\r\nThe aim, NP said, is to ensure that AI supports human judgment, creativity and problem-solving rather than replacing them.\r\n\r\nStudents will be taught to consider the ethical use of AI, including verifying accuracy and understanding its limitations. NP hopes to develop graduates who are confident in using new technologies yet able to make independent decisions in fast-changing workplaces.\r\n\r\nOther local polytechnics have introduced AI into their curricula.\r\n\r\nAt Republic Polytechnic, Gen AI is embedded across all diploma courses, with students introduced to AI fundamentals and critical thinking, and AI tools used in discipline-specific ways.\r\n\r\nTemasek Polytechnic launched an experimental design studio in January 2024, giving design students a space to learn and experiment with Gen AI.\r\n\r\nNP principal and chief executive Lim Kok Kiang said the polytechnic has been building its AI capabilities since 2022, starting with a Gen AI hub and AI-focused tracks in its information technology courses.\r\n\r\n\u201cAI is evolving very quickly, and our curriculum has to evolve with it,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nWhile mastering AI tools is important, it is equally crucial for students to learn how to frame problems well, think critically and use AI responsibly, he said.\r\n\r\nMr Lim added that NP\u2019s approach is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing it to be applied across different subjects and encouraging lecturers and students to learn alongside one another.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt times, the young learner may be more digitally savvy than the domain expert, but the two can come together\u2026 It\u2019s no longer just about teaching but about facilitating learning,\u201d he said, noting that this approach allows fundamentals to be taught while encouraging experimentation.\r\n\r\nThird-year NP student Sofea Carmila Rohaizat, 19, was initially hesitant to try Gen AI tools, fearing they might affect her grades or lead to accusations of academic misconduct.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was allowed and what wasn\u2019t\u2026 I heard stories of students whose reports were flagged and ended up getting zero, and that really scared me. So I stayed away from it in Year 1,\u201d said Ms Sofea, who is pursuing a diploma in tourism and resort management.\r\n\r\nHer perspective changed in her second year, when she was encouraged to use AI as part of an individual assignment.\r\n\r\nDuring her time at Sentosa Development Corp in 2025, as an events and programming intern, she used AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to refine event ideas and social media mock-ups, which she felt enhanced her communication and critical thinking skills.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough using AI will help us tremendously, we need to know where our limits are. At the end of the day, we must feel rewarded for earning this diploma.\r\n\r\n\u201cGen AI can only do so much, but as humans, we can do so much more,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nMs Sofea plans to pursue data analytics at the National University of Singapore and believes the PAIR framework will benefit her in both her future studies and professional life.\r\n\r\nThe programme is designed to meet a growing demand for professionals who can bridge technology with legal work, as law firms, companies and public agencies increasingly adopt digital tools.\r\n\r\nNP plans to admit 40 students for its first cohort in 2026. They will learn software development, cybersecurity, AI and database management, alongside contract law, corporate governance, intellectual property and data protection.\r\n\r\nThe diploma was developed in response to rapid changes in the legal sector, said Mr Lim, as law firms and technology start-ups invest more heavily in AI and digital tools.\r\n\r\nIt is supported by industry partners including Rajah & Tann Singapore and the Singapore Academy of Law, which will provide mentorship, insights and internship opportunities.\r\n\r\nMr Lim added that the skills gained will also benefit graduates beyond the legal tech sector.\r\n\r\n\u201cA grounding in law is increasingly important today, as governance and accountability matter across industries. Even for those entering the ICT sector, this knowledge can help them stand out and make more informed, responsible decisions,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nFinal-year ICT student, Mr Elvis Chan, 21, is now on a six-month internship in Vietnam as an AI engineer.\r\n\r\nWorking with a start-up focused on legal work, his role as an AI agent intern involves supporting tasks such as drafting contracts and agreements.\r\n\r\nDespite having little prior legal knowledge, he has been able to automate legal document generation and streamline workflows, highlighting the demand for talent who can bridge tech and law.\r\n\r\nThrough this internship, he has observed the growing importance of AI in legal work, along with the ethical and regulatory responsibilities.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr Chan: \u201cToday, many industries no longer operate purely within one discipline, and legal technology is increasingly intertwined. Instead of forcing students to choose between law or technology, the new diploma allows them to develop a strong foundation in both areas from the start.\u201d\r\n\r\nNP\u2019s School of Engineering has also updated its curriculum to keep pace with the growing complexity of modern infrastructure and industrial systems.\r\n\r\nAll engineering students will receive a stronger foundation in AI starting from April and will have an option to take cross-disciplinary specialisations that expose them to emerging fields while retaining core engineering skills.\r\n\r\nNew offerings include a space technology programme, which equips students with skills in systems design, electronics and data-driven applications.\r\n\r\nCollectively, these new initiatives reflect NP\u2019s focus on evolving education alongside technological and industrial shifts, said Mr Lim.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy embedding AI literacy across disciplines, linking learning to emerging sectors, and encouraging ethical and adaptive thinking, we are committed to equipping our learners with the skills and perspectives to navigate complex environments and contribute impactfully to society.\u201d\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSINGAPORE \u2013 All students at Republic Polytechnic (RP) will be using artificial intelligence (AI) more deeply in their coursework, thanks to a campus-wide push to ensure they are proficient with the technology when they join the workforce.\r\n\r\nRather than learning about AI as a standalone subject, students will encounter and use AI directly in existing study modules alongside their problem-based learning approach.\r\n\r\nThe use of AI will vary across the various disciplines in RP.\r\n\r\nFor example, in supply chain courses, students will use AI tools to analyse demand patterns, optimise inventory and plan efficient delivery routes. The polytechnic said these are skills that are increasingly in demand in global logistics.\r\n\r\nCreative arts and media students, meanwhile, will learn to integrate generative AI tools into content creation processes, from ideation and storyboarding to post-production, while learning to maintain creative control and ethical standards.\r\n\r\nAn AI-driven chatbot, designed specifically to train students studying hotel and leisure management, can simulate guest interactions to help trainees develop soft skills through immersive, scenario-based practice. It gives students the flexibility to practise and strengthen their skills anytime, anywhere, enhancing real-world readiness.\r\n\r\nRP said such tools allow students to gain realistic practice while freeing up classroom time for deeper discussion and reflection.\r\n\r\nBy the 2027 academic year, at least half of the discipline-specific modules in every diploma will incorporate AI tools and applications that mirror those used in the workplace.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping changes are part of the polytechnic\u2019s AI Transformation strategy aimed at giving students hands-on experience with real-world technologies.\r\n\r\nThis is critical as industries increasingly demand workers who can work confidently and responsibly alongside AI.\r\n\r\nTo be implemented progressively at four levels, the changes will first help students develop a foundational understanding of AI before teaching them how to apply AI tools ethically and responsibly.\r\n\r\nMore advanced modules will then involve developing industry-relevant AI tools, before culminating in AI design at the last level.\r\n\r\nAssessment practices will also be updated in tandem with these changes.\r\n\r\nSaid RP: \u201cLearners are now evaluated not only on final outputs, but also on their thinking processes, use of AI tools and ability to work effectively alongside them.\u201d\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the launch event for RP\u2019s AI Transformation strategy at its open house on Jan 8, Mr David Neo, Senior Minister of State for Education, echoed the need to nurture an AI-ready workforce.\r\n\r\nTo do so, institutes of higher learning (IHLs) like RP have to play a key role in upskilling the workforce through Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to maintain Singapore\u2019s human capital as our greatest competitive advantage, and enable every Singaporean to access good jobs,\u201d said Mr Neo, who is also the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth.\r\n\r\nHe added that there are now over 1,600 SkillsFuture Singapore-supported AI-related courses that support AI competency-building for various skill levels and needs.\r\n\r\nEmphasising the need to start young, Mr Neo said the Education Ministry is also preparing students to be AI-ready with the right mindsets and skills to thrive in future workplaces.\r\n\r\nTo this end, students will not only learn about AI and how to use it, but will also learn with and beyond AI, by leveraging it to enhance learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nNgee Ann Polytechnic began integrating Gen AI into its curricula from 2023, with students across all diploma courses set to experience it by 2026.\r\n\r\nSingapore Polytechnic equips all students with basic AI literacy through a common core curriculum, while Nanyang Polytechnic has embedded baseline Gen AI training in all diploma programmes since October 2025.\r\n\r\nTemasek Polytechnic launched an experimental design studio in January 2024, giving design students a space to learn and experiment with Gen AI.\r\n\r\nAt the tertiary level, the Singapore University of Technology and Design is providing all first-year students with comprehensive training in Design AI skills, through a specially designed course.\r\n\r\nMiss Kymberly Uthaya Kumar, 20, a third-year student pursuing a diploma in engineering design and business at RP, said she had many opportunities to dabble with AI during her time at the poly.\r\n\r\nThese included learning how to connect AI with applications when she was learning about the Internet of Things in her first year, and using AI to provide unique design features for a Year 2 project.\r\n\r\nBy her third year, she grew confident enough to use AI independently as part of her learning, even though it was not part of her coursework.\r\n\r\n\u201cAI helps make work more efficient and productive, but I have learnt that we always need to check AI\u2019s output, as it can make mistakes,\u201d said Miss Kymberly.\r\n\r\nShe added that RP\u2019s AI overhaul is a great opportunity for students to prepare to enter the workforce with relevant skills.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure AI will feature in my future studies and work even, so it is good to be exposed to it and guided on how to use it in school,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nThe AI push also extends to RP\u2019s CET programmes, with AI competencies being infused into specialist and part-time diplomas to help adult learners keep up with rapidly changing workplace technologies.\r\n\r\nDepending on the programme, CET learners may use AI tools for productivity, data analysis or decision-making, with some courses offering opportunities to develop or use AI tools relevant to their industries.\r\n\r\nIn support of these changes, RP has expanded partnerships with major AI and technology companies. These include AI Singapore, Autodesk, Microsoft, Nvidia and ST Engineering.\r\n\r\nThey can also take part in applied research projects, innovation challenges and industry-led training provided by these companies, which RP said stand to benefit from the strengthened talent pipeline and joint development of AI solutions.\r\n\r\nTo further aid in these efforts, all 1,200 RP staff members will undergo AI capability development, ranging from basic proficiency in role-relevant tools to advanced certification.\r\n\r\nRP said more than half of its staff have already attained baseline AI capability, with all expected to reach this level by the end of 2026.\r\n\r\nMs Jeanne Liew, RP\u2019s principal and chief executive, said the goal of this transformation is to create an environment where every learner is empowered to succeed in the AI era.\r\n\r\nBy bringing the use of AI into the classroom, strengthening workforce capabilities and working closely with industry partners, she said learners will have the confidence, judgment and skills to use and navigate new technologies.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur purpose is ultimately about giving our learners the opportunity to adapt, grow and excel in a fast-changing world,\u201d said Ms Liew.\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"655a9417-54a7-4b83-9c0d-62e5857e1013","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"f4f7cc6f-4bf7-4f92-a30e-c13918ce1039","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fcc10db4-8af5-40b9-a437-8fd479905ea9","children":["f355ac9d-c8f8-4471-a9cf-560bb43e496e"]},"f355ac9d-c8f8-4471-a9cf-560bb43e496e":{"id":"f355ac9d-c8f8-4471-a9cf-560bb43e496e","message":{"id":"f355ac9d-c8f8-4471-a9cf-560bb43e496e","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767876669.8401682,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"655a9417-54a7-4b83-9c0d-62e5857e1013","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"27284aed-dd2b-4cb3-a68e-59f35a6ad9c1","turn_exchange_id":"f4f7cc6f-4bf7-4f92-a30e-c13918ce1039","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"27284aed-dd2b-4cb3-a68e-59f35a6ad9c1","children":["2a3a9138-1c85-41b8-8982-e3590a846081"]},"2a3a9138-1c85-41b8-8982-e3590a846081":{"id":"2a3a9138-1c85-41b8-8982-e3590a846081","message":{"id":"2a3a9138-1c85-41b8-8982-e3590a846081","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767876670.045384,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"655a9417-54a7-4b83-9c0d-62e5857e1013","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"f355ac9d-c8f8-4471-a9cf-560bb43e496e","turn_exchange_id":"f4f7cc6f-4bf7-4f92-a30e-c13918ce1039","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f355ac9d-c8f8-4471-a9cf-560bb43e496e","children":["5aaf21df-2b77-4310-b261-740cda664860"]},"5aaf21df-2b77-4310-b261-740cda664860":{"id":"5aaf21df-2b77-4310-b261-740cda664860","message":{"id":"5aaf21df-2b77-4310-b261-740cda664860","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767876670.817987,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Summarizing developments at NP and RP","content":"The user wants me to summarize key developments from two articles into a continuous prose.

At Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), all students will learn to use Gen AI from January through an \u201cembedded\u201d approach rather than a standalone subject, ensuring that every student, regardless of course, uses it each year in at least one module. The backbone is the PAIR framework (problem, AI, interaction, reflection), which pushes students to start by framing the problem clearly, then choose and test suitable AI tools, and finally reflect on how AI shaped their thinking and decisions. The emphasis is explicit: AI should augment human judgment, creativity and problem-solving\u2014not replace them\u2014and students are trained to verify outputs, understand limitations, and apply the technology ethically. NP\u2019s leadership frames this as both a curriculum design choice and a cultural shift: lecturers and students \u201clearn alongside one another\u201d, with fundamentals preserved while experimentation is encouraged, in recognition that younger learners may sometimes be more digitally fluent than domain experts.\n\nRepublic Polytechnic (RP) is pursuing a similarly integrated model, pairing AI use with its problem-based learning culture so that students encounter AI directly inside existing modules in discipline-specific ways. RP\u2019s examples make the shift feel concrete: supply chain students apply AI tools to demand analysis, inventory optimisation and route planning; creative arts and media students integrate Gen AI into workflows from ideation to post-production while maintaining creative control and ethical standards; and an AI-driven chatbot for hotel and leisure management simulates guest interactions so students can practise soft skills through realistic scenarios anytime, anywhere\u2014freeing up classroom time for deeper discussion and reflection. RP\u2019s campus-wide \u201cAI Transformation\u201d strategy is also more explicitly staged, rolling out progressively across four levels: building foundational understanding, moving to ethical and responsible tool use, then developing industry-relevant AI tools, and culminating in AI design. By academic year 2027, at least half of the discipline-specific modules in every diploma are meant to incorporate workplace-mirroring AI applications, and assessment practices are being updated so students are evaluated not only on final products but also on thinking processes, how they used AI, and how effectively they worked alongside it.\n\nWhat makes NP\u2019s story especially noteworthy is how AI literacy is being paired with targeted, cross-disciplinary pathways tied to changing industry demands. Alongside the broad Gen AI rollout, NP is launching a new diploma aimed at producing graduates who can bridge technology and legal work, with an initial cohort of 40 students in 2026. The curriculum blends software development, cybersecurity, AI and database management with contract law, corporate governance, intellectual property and data protection, supported by partners such as Rajah & Tann Singapore and the Singapore Academy of Law through mentorship and internships. This \u201chybrid\u201d framing is reinforced by student experience: an NP ICT student interning in Vietnam as an AI engineer on legal workflows described automating contract and agreement drafting despite limited legal background\u2014an illustration of both the demand for tech\u2013law translators and the accompanying ethical and regulatory stakes. NP\u2019s engineering school is also updating its curriculum to reflect more complex infrastructure and industrial systems, strengthening AI foundations for all engineering students from April and offering cross-disciplinary specialisations such as a space technology programme that combines systems design, electronics and data-driven applications.\n\nAcross both articles, student perspectives underscore why formal guidance matters. One NP student initially avoided Gen AI out of fear of misconduct accusations and grade penalties, then shifted after being encouraged to use it appropriately for an assignment and later found tools like ChatGPT and Gemini useful during an internship for refining event ideas and social media mock-ups\u2014while stressing the importance of knowing the limits and still earning the diploma through genuine learning. An RP student described progressively gaining confidence through early exposure (for example, linking AI with Internet of Things applications) and later using AI independently, coupled with the habit of checking outputs because AI can be wrong. The broader ecosystem context is also being actively built: at RP, the push extends beyond full-time students to Continuing Education and Training programmes for adult learners, with AI competencies infused into part-time and specialist diplomas for productivity, analysis and decision support. RP is expanding partnerships with AI Singapore, Autodesk, Microsoft, Nvidia and ST Engineering, and is scaling staff upskilling as a prerequisite for sustainable change\u2014training all 1,200 staff, with more than half already at baseline capability and the remainder expected to reach that level by end-2026.\n\nFinally, the initiatives are framed as national workforce strategy as much as educational reform. At RP\u2019s launch event on Jan 8, Senior Minister of State for Education David Neo pointed to the need for institutes of higher learning to help upskill Singapore through continuing education, and noted the breadth of SkillsFuture Singapore-supported AI-related courses (over 1,600) spanning different proficiency levels. Taken together, NP\u2019s PAIR-driven, curriculum-wide Gen AI literacy\u2014paired with new cross-sector programmes like legal tech and space technology\u2014and RP\u2019s staged transformation that reshapes modules, assessment, industry partnerships and staff capability, signal a move toward \u201cAI-normalised\u201d education: students are expected not just to learn about AI, but to learn with it, critique it, and use it responsibly in ways that map directly onto real workplace practices."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"655a9417-54a7-4b83-9c0d-62e5857e1013","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"f4caaa74-2cf2-4ca5-aeae-c4c8525e8afc","turn_exchange_id":"f4f7cc6f-4bf7-4f92-a30e-c13918ce1039","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"f4caaa74-2cf2-4ca5-aeae-c4c8525e8afc","children":["6e77cdbd-1cb3-4d14-8d72-ff70fcaa5d67"]},"6e77cdbd-1cb3-4d14-8d72-ff70fcaa5d67":{"id":"6e77cdbd-1cb3-4d14-8d72-ff70fcaa5d67","message":{"id":"6e77cdbd-1cb3-4d14-8d72-ff70fcaa5d67","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767876923.021,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["what would be a suitable title?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"2e63388c-901f-4aea-96cd-80d43f4a7f63","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"8bffe512-ea44-426a-820c-7928a900d647","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3b6a1d4c-e863-4d1b-bf31-76979a163507","children":["dbb22fac-a7d1-4972-abd1-b776a99d9fa9"]},"dbb22fac-a7d1-4972-abd1-b776a99d9fa9":{"id":"dbb22fac-a7d1-4972-abd1-b776a99d9fa9","message":{"id":"dbb22fac-a7d1-4972-abd1-b776a99d9fa9","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767876923.5192587,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"2e63388c-901f-4aea-96cd-80d43f4a7f63","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"6e77cdbd-1cb3-4d14-8d72-ff70fcaa5d67","turn_exchange_id":"8bffe512-ea44-426a-820c-7928a900d647","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6e77cdbd-1cb3-4d14-8d72-ff70fcaa5d67","children":["a28dded7-6947-4ccc-ac5f-4084e323d180"]},"a28dded7-6947-4ccc-ac5f-4084e323d180":{"id":"a28dded7-6947-4ccc-ac5f-4084e323d180","message":{"id":"a28dded7-6947-4ccc-ac5f-4084e323d180","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1767876923.578697,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here are a few strong options, depending on the tone you want:\n\n- **Singapore Polytechnics Go All-In on AI: From Literacy to Industry-Ready Practice**\n- **From Classroom to Workplace: How NP and RP Are Embedding Generative AI Across Every Diploma**\n- **Beyond \u201cLearning AI\u201d: Singapore\u2019s Polytechnics Teach Students to Work With AI**\n- **AI as a Core Skill: NP\u2019s PAIR Framework and RP\u2019s Campus-Wide AI Transformation**\n- **Training an AI-Ready Workforce: Polytechnics Integrate Gen AI, Ethics, and Real-World Tools**\n- **AI-Normalised Education: NP and RP Rewire Curriculum, Assessment, and Industry Partnerships**\n\nIf you want one that fits most general audiences and still sounds newsy, I\u2019d pick:\n\n**Singapore Polytechnics Go All-In on AI: From Literacy to Industry-Ready Practice**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"2e63388c-901f-4aea-96cd-80d43f4a7f63","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"dbb22fac-a7d1-4972-abd1-b776a99d9fa9","turn_exchange_id":"8bffe512-ea44-426a-820c-7928a900d647","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"dbb22fac-a7d1-4972-abd1-b776a99d9fa9","children":[]}}}
