Among educated people in classical antiquity (especially in the Greek-speaking world, later the Roman and Islamic worlds, and in classical Indian astronomy) the Earth\u2019s sphericity was standard knowledge. What varied wasn\u2019t *whether* Earth is round, but *how big* it is and how best to prove and measure it.\n\n# How they figured it out (pre-telescope, using naked-eye evidence)\n\n1) Lunar eclipses  \n- In every lunar eclipse, Earth\u2019s shadow on the Moon is circular. A sphere is the only shape that always casts a circular shadow regardless of orientation. This is one of Aristotle\u2019s stock arguments.\n\n2) Changing stars and Sun with latitude  \n- As you travel south, southern constellations rise higher and some northern stars disappear; northward, the reverse happens. The elevation of the pole star changes roughly one degree per degree of latitude\u2014exactly what a spherical Earth predicts.  \n- The Sun\u2019s noon height and the length of shadows vary with latitude in a way that fits a sphere.\n\n3) Ships and horizons  \n- From shore, the hull of a departing ship disappears before the mast; from the mast, you can see farther than from the deck. That\u2019s natural on a curved surface.\n\n4) \u201cNatural place\u201d symmetry (Greek physics)  \n- Philosophers argued that matter settling uniformly around a center produces a symmetric shape\u2014most \u201cperfectly\u201d a sphere. (Wrong physics, right conclusion.)\n\n# First quantitative measurement (Eratosthenes, c. 240 BCE)\n\n- Observation: At local noon on the summer solstice, the Sun was nearly overhead at Syene (modern Aswan) but ~7.2\u00b0 south of the zenith at Alexandria (measured via a gnomon\u2019s shadow).  \n- Geometry: 7.2\u00b0 is 1/50 of a full circle, so the N\u2013S distance between the two cities must be 1/50 of Earth\u2019s circumference.  \n- Input distance: ~5,000 stadia between Alexandria and Syene.  \n- Result: Circumference \u2248 50 \u00d7 5,000 = 250,000\u2013252,000 stadia.  \n- In modern units (depending on which \u201cstadion\u201d you think he used), that\u2019s around **39,000\u201340,000 km**, remarkably close to the true ~40,075 km.\n\n# Other ancient and medieval measurements/confirmations\n\n- **Posidonius (1st c. BCE)** proposed a different method using the change in altitude of a bright southern star between two locales, giving another (disputed) circumference; a smaller value later propagated via Ptolemy and made some later Europeans underestimate the size of the oceans.  \n- **Indian astronomers (e.g., \u0100ryabha\u1e6da, 5th\u20136th c.)** explicitly treated Earth as spherical (and even proposed daily rotation) and produced numerical estimates of its size.  \n- **Islamic scholars (9th\u201311th c.)** ran geodetic expeditions (e.g., under al-Ma\u2019mun) to measure a degree of latitude on the ground, and **al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b** derived Earth\u2019s radius from the dip angle to the horizon measured from a known-height mountain\u2014an elegant single-site method that lands strikingly close to the modern value.  \n- **Global voyages (16th c.)**\u2014not a *proof* per se, but successful circumnavigation (Magellan/Elcano) is trivially consistent with a sphere.\n\n# Common misconceptions to park\n\n- Medieval educated Europeans did **not** generally believe in a flat Earth; the spherical Earth remained the scholarly default via late antiquity and the Middle Ages.  \n- **Columbus** didn\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d Earth is round; the disagreement was about the *distance* to Asia. He was (fortunately) wrong in ways that made the trip seem shorter.\n\n# Bottom line\nBy the 4th\u20133rd centuries BCE, the sphericity of Earth was argued from multiple independent lines of evidence and even measured with surprising accuracy. Later Greco-Roman, Indian, and Islamic astronomers refined those arguments and measurements. The \u201cflat-earth\u201d story is mostly a modern myth about the past, not the past itself."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[],"citations":[],"request_id":"25809680-4dee-4a44-870c-e5f6eabc7f4e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"c5c29484-fae9-48ee-ab33-2c7c43f89381","turn_exchange_id":"c0b2b4af-d659-452f-9b17-4fe282023f7e","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c5c29484-fae9-48ee-ab33-2c7c43f89381","children":[]}}}
