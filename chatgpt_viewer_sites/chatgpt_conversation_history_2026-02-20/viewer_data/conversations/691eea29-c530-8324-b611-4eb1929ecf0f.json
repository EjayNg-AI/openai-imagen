To make a *rigorous and in-depth* undergraduate curriculum feel broad and powerful, I\u2019d round it out with pillars from:\n\n- Logic and set theory  \n- Algebra and number theory (beyond what you already have)  \n- Real and functional analysis  \n- Complex analysis  \n- Topology and geometry  \n- Probability and combinatorics  \n- A little theoretical computer science / information theory  \n\nBelow is a curated expansion. I\u2019ll avoid proofs and focus on **which** results and **why** they are good undergrad targets.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Logic, Set Theory, Foundations\n\nYou already have G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness on the list. I\u2019d add:\n\n1. **Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument and uncountability of the real numbers**  \n   The canonical \u201cfirst deep theorem\u201d in foundations: there is no bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.\n\n2. **Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem**  \n   If there are injections both ways between sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then there is a bijection. Conceptually cleans up \u201csame cardinality\u201d and is a good vehicle for set-theoretic reasoning.\n\n3. **Cantor\u2019s theorem on the power set**  \n   The cardinality of \\( \\mathcal{P}(X) \\) strictly exceeds that of \\(X\\), even for infinite \\(X\\). Perfect to pair with G\u00f6del to talk about the hierarchy of infinities vs. hierarchy of theories.\n\n4. **Equivalence of the Axiom of Choice (AC), Zorn\u2019s Lemma, and the Well-Ordering Theorem**  \n   This is one of the most elegant equivalence triads in mathematics. It gives students a concrete feel for how \u201cchoice\u201d pervades algebra and analysis.\n\n5. **Compactness Theorem for first-order logic**  \n   If every finite subset of a first-order theory is satisfiable, the whole theory is satisfiable. It\u2019s a beautiful, conceptually clean result that interfaces well with model theory and G\u00f6del.\n\n6. **L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem (downward version)**  \n   Any countable first-order theory with an infinite model has a countable model. Great for \u201cSkolem paradox\u201d discussions and the limits of formalization.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Algebra and Number Theory\n\nYou already listed:  \n- Insolvability of the quintic by radicals  \n- Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  \n- Law of Quadratic Reciprocity  \nAdd the following:\n\n7. **Structure Theorem for finitely generated abelian groups**  \n   Every finitely generated abelian group is a direct sum of copies of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) and finite cyclic groups. This is a cornerstone result with many applications, and the proof is very teachable at undergrad level.\n\n8. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**  \n   (\u201cChinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)\u201d: the theorem stating that congruences modulo pairwise coprime integers can be solved simultaneously and are unique modulo their product.)  \n   Gives concrete algebra\u2013number theory interaction and leads naturally into ring decompositions and local thinking.\n\n9. **Euclidean domains, Principal Ideal Domains (PIDs), and Unique Factorization Domains (UFDs)**  \n   Not a single theorem but a package:  \n   - Every Euclidean domain is a PID.  \n   - Every PID is a UFD.  \n   The structure of ideals and factorization is a central undergrad narrative.\n\n10. **Sylow theorems**  \n    The core structural theorems of finite group theory. Concrete classification exercises (e.g. groups of order \\(p^2\\), \\(pq\\), etc.) are excellent training.\n\n11. **Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem**  \n    Any finite group has composition series whose composition factors are unique up to order and isomorphism. Underlines the notion of \u201csimple building blocks\u201d of algebraic structures.\n\n12. **Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory**  \n    Since you already want to prove insolvability of the quintic, having at least one run through the fundamental theorem \u2013 for a carefully chosen tower \u2013 is natural and very rewarding.\n\n13. **Dirichlet\u2019s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions (at least statement, maybe some partial proof)**  \n    A \u201cwow\u201d theorem in analytic number theory; even if you do not give a full proof, showing the architecture (characters, \\(L\\)-functions) is eye-opening.\n\n14. **Prime Number Theorem (PNT) (again, at least statement, partial proof if ambitious)**  \n    Critical for undergrads to *know* it exists and see at least the outline of complex-analytic or Tauberian arguments.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Real Analysis and Functional Analysis\n\nYou already have: irrationality of \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\), Stirling\u2019s approximation. I\u2019d add the canonical structural theorems:\n\n15. **Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem**  \n    Every bounded sequence in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) has a convergent subsequence. The core compactness phenomenon in elementary analysis.\n\n16. **Heine\u2013Borel theorem for \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\)**  \n    A subset of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Gives a geometric grasp on compactness.\n\n17. **Intermediate Value Theorem and Extreme Value Theorem**  \n    Simple statements, but foundational for the philosophy of continuity and existence proofs.\n\n18. **Uniform convergence theorems: Weierstrass M-test and interchange of limit/integral or derivative**  \n    This is where students first really see \u201cfunctional\u201d behavior of sequences of functions.\n\n19. **Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem**  \n    A deep, beautiful generalization of polynomial approximation. Good capstone of real analysis / beginning functional analysis.\n\n20. **Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem**  \n    A characterization of relatively compact families of functions. Connects equicontinuity, bounds, and compactness.\n\n21. **Baire Category Theorem**  \n    Complete metric spaces are \u201clarge\u201d in a precise sense; nowhere dense sets cannot cover them. Conceptually powerful and feeds into functional analysis.\n\n22. **Hahn\u2013Banach theorem**  \n    The key theorem of linear functionals extension in normed spaces. Even a normed-space version (without measure theory) is a big conceptual leap.\n\n23. **Open Mapping Theorem, Closed Graph Theorem, and Uniform Boundedness Principle (Banach\u2013Steinhaus)**  \n    The basic triad of the theory of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces.\n\n24. **Riesz Representation Theorem for \\(C([a,b])\\)**  \n    Every continuous linear functional is integration against a measure. This gives a beautiful bridge between analysis, measure theory, and functional analysis.\n\n25. **Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem (existence and uniqueness for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs))**  \n    Shows how analysis gives rigorous foundation to ODEs; the contraction mapping principle appears naturally here.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Complex Analysis\n\nUndergrads usually love complex analysis because it is short, powerful, and full of miracles.\n\n26. **Cauchy\u2019s Integral Theorem and Cauchy\u2019s Integral Formula**  \n    This pair is the backbone of complex analysis; from them you derive half the subject.\n\n27. **Liouville\u2019s theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra via Liouville**  \n    You already have the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra on your list; the Liouville proof is one of the most elegant inter-field arguments in undergraduate mathematics.\n\n28. **Maximum Modulus Principle and the Open Mapping Theorem (for holomorphic maps)**  \n    Together they show holomorphic functions behave in a rigid, geometric way very unlike real functions.\n\n29. **Rouch\u00e9\u2019s theorem**  \n    A surprisingly elementary but strong result on zeros that makes powerful root-counting arguments accessible.\n\n30. **Riemann Mapping Theorem (statement and a conceptual proof outline)**  \n    Possibly too heavy for a full proof at undergrad level, but presenting the statement and how its proof uses normal families and compactness is very inspiring.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Topology and Geometry\n\nYou probably want at least a minimal topology sequence if the curriculum is \u201crigorous and in-depth\u201d.\n\n31. **Urysohn\u2019s Lemma and Tietze Extension Theorem**  \n    They crystallize normality and the interplay between topology and continuous functions.\n\n32. **Tychonoff\u2019s theorem for products of compact spaces**  \n    Even just for the product of infinitely many copies of \\([0,1]\\), this is a high-impact result (and a dramatic use of the Axiom of Choice).\n\n33. **Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem**  \n    Every continuous map from a closed disk to itself has a fixed point. Iconic, geometrically intuitive, widely applicable.\n\n34. **Borsuk\u2013Ulam Theorem**  \n    Every continuous map from \\(S^n\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) identifies an antipodal pair. It has very clean, combinatorial corollaries.\n\n35. **Fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)**  \n    A first substantial computation in algebraic topology; great for getting students to appreciate covering space theory.\n\n36. **No-retraction theorem: there is no retraction from the closed disk onto its boundary**  \n    A natural corollary of the above and/or Brouwer; visually appealing and conceptually important.\n\n37. **Classification of compact surfaces (at least statement and how to get there)**  \n    \u201cEvery compact surface is a sphere with handles and crosscaps.\u201d Even if the full proof is long, the surgery ideas are very instructive.\n\n38. **Jordan Curve Theorem (statement and discussion)**  \n    Another classic: every simple closed curve divides the plane into two components. You probably will not fully prove it, but its role in topology is central.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Probability and Statistics\n\nThis is where the real world meets measure-theoretic rigor.\n\n39. **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**  \n   (\u201cLaw of Large Numbers (LLN)\u201d: the theorem that sample averages converge to expected value under suitable conditions.)  \n   Good gateway theorem: students see how randomness stabilizes.\n\n40. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**  \n   (\u201cCentral Limit Theorem (CLT)\u201d: the theorem that normalized sums of independent identically distributed random variables converge in distribution to a normal law under suitable conditions.)  \n   Both a central applied result and a theoretical highlight; in a rigorous curriculum, a proof via characteristic functions or Lindeberg\u2019s method is feasible.\n\n41. **Strong Law of Large Numbers**  \n   Convergence almost surely, demonstrating the strength of measure-theoretic tools compared with \u201cin probability\u201d.\n\n42. **Kolmogorov\u2019s Zero\u2013One Law**  \n   Tail events for independent sequences have probability zero or one. Conceptually striking and leads into ergodic-type thinking.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Theoretical Computer Science\n\nYou already have the Principle of Inclusion\u2013Exclusion. Add some deeper combinatorial structure:\n\n43. **Ramsey\u2019s Theorem (finite version)**  \n   Every large enough structure contains a large well-ordered substructure. \u201cComplete disorder is impossible\u201d is a beautiful slogan.\n\n44. **Sperner\u2019s Lemma**  \n   A combinatorial lemma that is a discrete version of Brouwer\u2019s fixed point theorem. Excellent cross-link between topology and combinatorics.\n\n45. **Dilworth\u2019s Theorem**  \n   In a finite partially ordered set, size of largest antichain equals minimum size of chain decomposition. Very neat structural result.\n\n46. **Tur\u00e1n\u2019s Theorem**  \n   Extremal graph theory in one bite: maximizes edges without containing a given complete subgraph.\n\n47. **Kuratowski\u2019s Theorem on planar graphs**  \n   A graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of \\(K_5\\) or \\(K_{3,3}\\). Beautiful structural classification.\n\n48. **Four Color Theorem (statement and context)**  \n   Historically important; even if you do not go into proof details, it\u2019s a good opportunity to discuss computer-aided proofs.\n\n49. **Cook\u2013Levin Theorem (NP-completeness of Boolean satisfiability)**  \n   (\u201cNP\u201d = Nondeterministic Polynomial time.)  \n   Brings in theoretical computer science: shows that Boolean satisfiability is NP-complete and opens the door to complexity theory. Even a proof sketch is deeply motivating.\n\n50. **Shannon\u2019s Source Coding Theorem**  \n   An information-theoretic crown jewel: you can compress data down to its entropy and not further (on average). Clean probabilistic reasoning, strong conceptual bite.\n\n---\n\n## 8. \u201cWow-factor\u201d and Conceptual Shock Results\n\nThese are good as capstones or special topics.\n\n51. **Banach\u2013Tarski Paradox (statement and rationale)**  \n   Using the Axiom of Choice, you can decompose a ball into finitely many pieces and reassemble them into two balls of the same size. Excellent for discussing measure, choice, and the limits of naive geometric intuition.\n\n52. **Noether\u2019s Theorem (symmetries and conservation laws)**  \n   In Lagrangian mechanics, continuous symmetries give conserved quantities. This is cross-disciplinary: calculus of variations, differential equations, and physics.\n\n53. **Spectral Theorem for normal operators on finite-dimensional inner product spaces**  \n   Every normal linear operator is unitarily diagonalizable. Encodes much of linear algebra in one powerful statement.\n\n54. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  \n   Any matrix factors as \\(U \\Sigma V^*\\). Enormously important in numerical analysis, statistics, and data science; the proof is accessible via spectral theorem.\n\n55. **Jordan Canonical Form**  \n   Over an algebraically closed field, every linear map has a canonical matrix form up to similarity. A natural culmination of linear algebra and minimal polynomials.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, the next step could be to **prune** this list into:\n\n- \u201cMust-prove in full detail\u201d results,  \n- \u201cProve in a simplified or special case\u201d results, and  \n- \u201cState and sketch\u201d results for inspiration.\n\nThat pruning will force you to articulate what you want the *undergraduate mathematical personality* of the program to be: more structural, more analytic, more applied, or evenly balanced."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"cce0d124-ffae-4bb5-9171-cf72e1089de7","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"c6ddf06d-b30c-4b23-a329-0182695dce98","turn_exchange_id":"6af57288-6c95-448d-8e9f-70a61c248fa5","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"c6ddf06d-b30c-4b23-a329-0182695dce98","children":["dace8e19-84fc-447c-acb7-7756b98c11d2"]},"dace8e19-84fc-447c-acb7-7756b98c11d2":{"id":"dace8e19-84fc-447c-acb7-7756b98c11d2","message":{"id":"dace8e19-84fc-447c-acb7-7756b98c11d2","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1763694137.077,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Hmm, a comprehensive list indeed.

Infinity and Foundations\n\n**1. Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument and uncountability of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)**  \n> There is no bijection between \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).  \nCanonical, conceptually clean, and pairs beautifully with G\u00f6del: \u201cnot only are there limits to provability, there are also hierarchies of infinity.\u201d\n\n**2. Cantor\u2019s theorem on power sets**  \n> For any set \\(X\\), \\(|\\mathcal{P}(X)| > |X|\\).  \nMakes the \u201ctower of larger and larger infinities\u201d precise. Short statement, philosophical impact is huge.\n\n**3. Equivalence of Axiom of Choice (AC), Zorn\u2019s Lemma, and the Well-Ordering Theorem**  \n(\u201cAC\u201d = Axiom of Choice.)  \n> AC \\(\\iff\\) every poset with suitable chains has a maximal element (Zorn) \\(\\iff\\) every set can be well-ordered.  \nThis is an instant shibboleth: anyone who can even sketch how these are equivalent has done some real foundational work.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Algebra and Number Theory (beyond your list)\n\nYou already have: insolvability of the quintic, Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.\n\n**4. Structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups**  \n> Every finitely generated abelian group is a direct sum of copies of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and finite cyclic groups.  \nShows how algebra \u201cclassifies\u201d objects the way physics classifies particles: everything is built from simple pieces.\n\n**5. Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**  \n(\u201cCRT\u201d = Chinese Remainder Theorem.)  \n> Congruences modulo coprime moduli can be solved simultaneously and give a unique solution modulo the product.  \nRecognizable, very usable, and a natural precursor to local\u2013global thinking.\n\n**6. Sylow theorems**  \n> For a finite group, the number and structure of subgroups of maximal prime-power order obey precise constraints.  \nFinite group theory\u2019s first really nontrivial landmark. Even just being able to apply Sylow to classify groups of low order is impressive.\n\n**7. Dirichlet\u2019s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions**  \n> Every arithmetic progression \\(a, a + q, a + 2q, \\dots\\) with \\(\\gcd(a,q)=1\\) contains infinitely many primes.  \nThe statement alone screams \u201cserious analytic number theory\u201d; even a high-level sketch of the character/\\(L\\)-function machinery is enough to show depth.\n\n**8. Prime Number Theorem (PNT)**  \n(\u201cPNT\u201d = Prime Number Theorem.)  \n> The number of primes \\(\\le x\\) is asymptotic to \\(x/\\log x\\).  \nThe natural complement to Quadratic Reciprocity: you know *how primes are distributed* in bulk as well as how they behave modulo \\(n\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Analysis and Complex Analysis\n\nYou already have: irrationality of \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\), Stirling\u2019s formula.\n\n**9. Heine\u2013Borel theorem in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\)**  \n> A subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.  \nThe crystallization of compactness for a \u201cphysics audience\u201d: every bounded closed region is \u201cfinite in an analytic sense.\u201d\n\n**10. Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem**  \n> On a compact space, a sufficiently rich subalgebra of continuous functions is uniformly dense in all continuous functions.  \nThe statement \u201cyou can approximate any continuous thing by simple building blocks (polynomials, trigs, etc.)\u201d is directly resonant with numerical analysis, physics, and engineering.\n\n**11. Cauchy\u2019s integral theorem and Cauchy\u2019s integral formula**  \n> Holomorphic functions on simply connected domains have path-independent integrals and are determined by their boundary values.  \nThis is the true engine of complex analysis; from it you get Liouville, Maximum Modulus, an elegant proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, and all the \u201ccomplex magic.\u201d\n\n**12. Riemann Mapping Theorem (statement and idea)**  \n> Any simply connected, proper open subset of \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) is conformally equivalent to the unit disk.  \nIt\u2019s a \u201cwow\u201d geometric classification theorem: all simply connected planar domains (except the whole plane) are, conformally, the same.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Topology and Geometry\n\n**13. Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem**  \n> Any continuous map from a closed disk in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) to itself has a fixed point.  \nIt\u2019s visually intuitive (\u201cstir a cup of coffee, some point stays put\u201d) but the proof genuinely uses topology. Very high \u201cconceptual return per line of statement.\u201d\n\n**14. Borsuk\u2013Ulam Theorem**  \n> Any continuous map \\(f : S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n\\) takes some pair of antipodal points to the same value.  \nLeads to elegant corollaries (ham sandwich theorem, etc.). Great for showing how topology bites into combinatorics and geometry.\n\n**15. Classification of compact surfaces (at least the statement)**  \n> Every compact surface is a sphere with handles and/or crosscaps.  \nA strong, memorable structural result: it says \u201cwe actually know all 2-dimensional topological shapes up to homeomorphism.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. Probability and Information\n\n**16. (Weak or Strong) Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**  \n(\u201cLLN\u201d = Law of Large Numbers.)  \n> Averages of independent identically distributed random variables converge to the expected value (in probability, or almost surely).  \nThis is the rigorous backbone behind \u201cempirical frequencies stabilize.\u201d\n\n**17. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**  \n(\u201cCLT\u201d = Central Limit Theorem.)  \n> Properly normalized sums of independent identically distributed random variables converge in distribution to a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  \nScientifically literate people know the *fact*; being able to discuss the *theorem* and its conditions is serious probability.\n\n**18. Shannon\u2019s Source Coding Theorem**  \n> You cannot compress a source below its entropy (on average), and you can get arbitrarily close to that rate.  \nThis is the flagship result of information theory, highly legible to anyone with a physics/CS background.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Theoretical Computer Science and Algorithms\n\n**19. Cook\u2013Levin Theorem (satisfiability is NP-complete)**  \n> Boolean satisfiability is complete for Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP).  \n(\u201cNP\u201d = Nondeterministic Polynomial time.)  \nThis is the iconic bridge from logic to complexity theory, and it\u2019s the cornerstone of the whole NP-completeness story.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Linear Algebra, Physics, and \u201cParadoxes\u201d\n\n**20. Spectral Theorem for self-adjoint (Hermitian) operators**  \n> On a finite-dimensional inner product space, every self-adjoint operator is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and an orthonormal eigenbasis.  \nThis is *the* mathematical statement behind \u201cobservables have real eigenvalues and can be simultaneously measured if they commute\u201d in quantum mechanics.\n\n**21. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  \n> Any matrix \\(A\\) factors as \\(A = U \\Sigma V^*\\) with \\(U,V\\) unitary and \\(\\Sigma\\) diagonal with nonnegative entries.  \nCentral for numerical linear algebra, statistics, and data science; saying \u201cI\u2019ve worked through a proof of SVD\u201d signals serious linear algebra maturity.\n\n**22. Noether\u2019s Theorem (for Lagrangian mechanics)**  \n> Every continuous symmetry of a Lagrangian corresponds to a conserved quantity.  \nShows off the deepest connection between symmetry and physics in one line. Very high prestige-to-technicality ratio for a scientifically literate crowd.\n\n**23. Banach\u2013Tarski Paradox (statement)**  \n> In \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), assuming the Axiom of Choice, a solid ball can be partitioned into finitely many pieces and reassembled into two balls of the same size.  \nYou don\u2019t need the full proof; just being able to explain what kind of sets and what kind of \u201cnon-measurability\u201d are involved already shows serious measure-theoretic sophistication.\n\n---\n\n### How this complements your original list\n\nYour original list already hits:\n\n- Foundations / logic: G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness.  \n- Number theory and algebra: quadratic reciprocity, quintic unsolvability, Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.  \n- Analysis / asymptotics: Stirling, irrationality of \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\).  \n- Combinatorics: Principle of Inclusion\u2013Exclusion.\n\nThe additions above give you iconic \u201cflags\u201d in:\n\n- Infinity and choice (Cantor, AC \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Zorn \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) Well-ordering),  \n- Deeper structure in algebra and primes (structure theorem, Sylow, Dirichlet, PNT),  \n- Serious analysis and complex analysis (Heine\u2013Borel, Stone\u2013Weierstrass, Cauchy, Riemann Mapping),  \n- Modern topology (Brouwer, Borsuk\u2013Ulam, surface classification),  \n- Probability/Information (LLN, CLT, Shannon),  \n- Complexity theory (Cook\u2013Levin),  \n- Linear algebra / physics / set-theoretic pathologies (spectral theorem, SVD, Noether, Banach\u2013Tarski).\n\nPut together with your list, this forms a very credible \u201cthese are the theorems you aspire to really *know* if you are serious about mathematics\u201d set\u2014without drifting into the grand open problems or ultra-technical pinnacles."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"6142dd1a-305b-48e3-bc2c-c40dfcf27075","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"75932117-bc0f-4400-8e19-866344ce02c7","turn_exchange_id":"09870a87-c100-40aa-b016-78ee1b2d7f19","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"75932117-bc0f-4400-8e19-866344ce02c7","children":[]}}}
