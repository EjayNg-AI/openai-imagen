This move is significant in the context of increasing global competition, particularly after China's DeepSeek emerged as a major player and questions arose around Meta's focus on open models due to its pivot toward superintelligence. These models support chain-of-thought reasoning and web access and can also be used in tandem with more powerful cloud-based AI. However, they are text-only and not multimodal like many of OpenAI's recent offerings.

GPT-oss is a family of models with downloadable, open weights, empowering users to run, inspect, and fine-tune the models locally on high-end laptops or even smartphones. Two versions were introduced: gpt-oss-120b, aimed at high-end systems, and the more accessible gpt-oss-20b for typical desktops and laptops. Altman claimed these models offer performance comparable to OpenAI's o4-mini and described GPT-oss as \"the best and most usable open model in the world.\"\n\nThe launch is positioned as a catalyst for innovation, aiming to boost research and product development by making powerful tools more widely available. This move contrasts with the trend of increasingly closed models from some major AI labs, and puts OpenAI in step with companies like Meta, which has also released open-weight models like LLAMA. The announcement comes shortly after rival Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.1 and ahead of the anticipated ChatGPT-5 release.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754416897.0,"attribution":"www.businessinsider.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"cookbook.openai.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-vllm","title":"How to run gpt-oss with vLLM | OpenAI Cookbook","snippet":"This guide will walk you through how to use vLLM to set up gpt-oss-20b or gpt-oss-120b on a server to serve gpt-oss as an API for your ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754412400.962025,"attribution":"cookbook.openai.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"github.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss","title":"openai/gpt-oss: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b are two open-weight ...","snippet":"You can start this server with the following inference backends: triton \u2014 uses the triton implementation; metal \u2014 uses the metal implementation on Apple Silicon ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"github.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"docs.vllm.ai","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/recipes/en/latest/OpenAI/GPT-OSS.html","title":"GPT OSS - vLLM Recipes","snippet":"One premier feature of gpt-oss is the ability to call tools directly, called \"built-in tools\".

The two most widely adopted are:  \n\n* **vLLM** \u2013 fastest throughput, OpenAI-compatible REST API, supports batching & speculative decoding.  \n* **Ollama/llama.cpp** \u2013 CPU-friendly GGUF build; good when GPU memory is scarce.  \n\nDocker images exist for both paths, so you can stay reproducible:  \n\n```bash\n# GPU path with vLLM (all drivers already installed)\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --ipc=host \\\n  vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b\n```\n\nThe container auto-downloads weights the first time.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search4\ue201  \n\nIf you prefer native installs:\n\n```bash\npip install --pre \"vllm==0.10.1+gptoss\" \\\n  --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/gpt-oss/\nvllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b --port 8000\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3  Expose the service  \n\nThe vLLM server starts an OpenAI-style endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`).

Pick the closest region with capacity and file a **Service Quota** request for *p5* if your default quota is 0.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003Launch an EC2 Deep-Learning image  \nFrom the EC2 console (or the CLI) choose the latest *Deep Learning AMI GPU \u2013 Ubuntu 22.04*; it ships with CUDA 12.2 and an H100-capable NVIDIA 550-series driver pre-installed \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search3\ue201.  \nAttach at least a 200 GB gp3 EBS volume (weights + checkpoints + logs) and open TCP :8000 in the security group if you plan to expose an API.  \nIf you only want to dedicate one H100 to inference, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` in your session or Docker command; NVSwitch lets all eight GPUs see each other, but you pay only the memory footprint you use.\n\n```bash\naws ec2 run-instances \\\n  --instance-type p5.48xlarge \\\n  --image-id ami-0d#####  # Deep Learning AMI GPU Ubuntu 22.04\n  --block-device-mappings DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={VolumeSize=200} \\\n  --security-group-ids sg-xyz --subnet-id subnet-abc\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Prepare the runtime (inside the instance)  \nActivate the PyTorch virtual-env that the AMI provides:\n\n```bash\nsource activate pytorch\npython -c \"import torch, subprocess, os; print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))\"\n```\n\nInstall a recent `vLLM` build compiled for H100 and CUDA 12:\n\n```bash\npip install --pre \"vllm==0.10.1+gptoss\" \\\n  --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/gpt-oss/\n```\n\n(You can equally well use DeepSpeed, FasterTransformer or TensorRT-LLM; vLLM gives the simplest OpenAI-style server and good throughput.) vLLM supports tensor-parallel serving out-of-the-box \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Fetch the model weights  \nAuthenticate to Hugging Face (or the mirror bucket) and pull the 120 B checkpoint once:\n\n```bash\nhuggingface-cli login\nvllm pull openai/gpt-oss-120b  # or git lfs clone ...\n```\n\nThe files (\u2248 45 GB) will land on NVMe for maximum IO.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Start the OpenAI-compatible server  \nA single-GPU launch that fits comfortably in 80 GB:\n\n```bash\nvllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b \\\n  --tensor-parallel-size 1 \\\n  --port 8000 \\\n  --max-model-len 8192 \\\n  --dtype auto\n```\n\nMulti-GPU (if you want higher throughput):\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1\nvllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b --tensor-parallel-size 2 --port 8000\n```\n\nvLLM publishes `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions`, so any OpenAI client works by pointing  \n`OPENAI_API_BASE=http://<public-ip>:8000` \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201. Docker users can do the same in one line:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --ipc=host \\\n  -e HF_HOME=/data -v /data:/data \\\n  vllm/vllm-openai:gptoss \\\n  --model openai/gpt-oss-120b\n``` \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 6\u2003Lock down and monitor  \nPoint a Route 53 DNS record at the instance or place it behind an Application Load Balancer with TLS off-load.  \nUse an **Instance Role** with least-privilege (just S3/HF read) rather than hard-coding tokens.  \nMonitor GPU utilisation with `nvidia-smi dmon` or the CloudWatch agent and keep an eye on on-demand cost (\u2248 USD 55 h-1 in us-east-1, or ~USD 0.13 token-k-1 at 120 tokens s-1 throughput) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201. Spot P5 capacity exists but is volatile; set interruption handlers if you go that route.\n\n---\n\n### 7\u2003Optional: SageMaker instead of do-it-yourself  \nIf you prefer a managed endpoint, create a **SageMaker real-time endpoint** on `ml.p5.48xlarge` (same hardware) and supply a Dockerfile that installs vLLM and starts the OpenAI server. SageMaker handles autoscaling and gives you built-in TLS + IAM-based auth, at a ~15 % uplift on the raw EC2 price \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201.\n\n---\n\n#### In practice  \nRunning the 120 B open-weight model on AWS boils down to (a) reserving an H100 P5 instance, (b) using the Deep Learning AMI so you get the correct CUDA/driver stack instantly, and (c) launching vLLM with either one or several of the eight GPUs. Once the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is up, your applications talk to it exactly as they would to OpenAI\u2019s cloud\u2014except the bill is now an EC2 line item you control."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":486,"end_idx":518,"safe_urls":["https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-p5-instances-powered-by-nvidia-h100-tensor-core-gpus-for-accelerating-generative-ai-and-hpc-applications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/p5.48xlarge?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-p5-instances-powered-by-nvidia-h100-tensor-core-gpus-for-accelerating-generative-ai-and-hpc-applications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Vantage](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/p5.48xlarge?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"New \u2013 Amazon EC2 P5 Instances Powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor ...","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-p5-instances-powered-by-nvidia-h100-tensor-core-gpus-for-accelerating-generative-ai-and-hpc-applications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1690329600.0,"snippet":"P5 instances provide 8 x NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs with 640 GB of high bandwidth GPU memory, 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, 2 TB of system ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Amazon Web Services, Inc."},{"title":"p5.48xlarge pricing and specs - Amazon EC2 Instance Comparison","url":"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/p5.48xlarge?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The p5.48xlarge instance is in the GPU instance family with 192 vCPUs, 2048 GiB of memory and 3200 Gibps of bandwidth starting at $55.04 per hour.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Vantage"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn4search6\ue201","start_idx":686,"end_idx":705,"safe_urls":["https://cloudonaut.io/worldwide-availability-of-ec2-instance-types/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([cloudonaut](https://cloudonaut.io/worldwide-availability-of-ec2-instance-types/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Worldwide availability of EC2 instance types - cloudonaut","url":"https://cloudonaut.io/worldwide-availability-of-ec2-instance-types/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1700049600.0,"snippet":"The following instance families are supported in region us-east-1 . a1 , c1 ...
