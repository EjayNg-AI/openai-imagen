Skim it first, then start answering the questions that jump out at you; we can iterate from there and flesh out wireframes, tech stack, SEO schema, etc.  \n\n---\n\n## 1  Site Purpose & Business Goals  \n1. **Primary conversion events**  \n   - What single action matters most (e-mail enquiry, WhatsApp message, instant booking with payment, newsletter sign-up)?  \n2. **Secondary goals**  \n   - Brand authority? selling digital notes? funneling traffic to YouTube/TikTok? alumnus referral programme?  \n3. **KPIs & analytics**  \n   - How will you measure success (bounce rate, enquiry-to-enrolment ratio, organic keyword positions, etc.)?\n\n---\n\n## 2  Audience & User Journeys  \n| Persona | Main pain-point | Typical device | Info they look for first | Desired assurance | Conversion trigger |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Parent of Sec 4 student | \u201cI need my child to pass O-Levels\u201d | Mobile | Track record, fees, schedule | Credentials + testimonials | Clear next available slot |\n| JC student | \u201cNeed A for H2\u201d | Mobile/Desktop | Teaching style, resources | Past A-level results | Trial lesson |\n| Undergrad | \u201cNeed help in Linear Algebra\u201d | Desktop | Depth of expertise | Ph.D. credential | 1-on-1 booking |\n\n**Questions**  \n- Any additional personas (e.g., adult-learners, homeschool)?  \n- Do parents or students usually initiate contact?  \n\n---\n\n## 3  Content Architecture  \nSuggested top-level nav:\n\n```\nHome \u2502 About Dr Ng \u2502 Classes (Sec / JC / Uni) \u2502 Schedule & Fees \u2502 Results & Testimonials \u2502 Resources / Blog \u2502 FAQ \u2502 Contact / Book\n```\n\nQuestions to decide:\n\n1. **Separate landing pages** for each level (SEO benefit) or one combined \u201cClasses\u201d page?  \n2. **Grade-specific timetables**: will they change weekly? automate feed from calendar?  \n3. **Proof of credentials**: happy to show high-resolution degree certificates in person only; online just low-res watermarked snapshots or a credential-verification badge?  \n4. **Testimonials**: text only, video clips, or embedded Google reviews?  \n5. **Blog/Knowledge base**: do you want a steady pipeline of articles/short-form explanations for SEO (\u201cHow to tackle AMath Trigonometry Qn 7\u201d style)?  \n6. **Downloadables**: sample notes / problem sets behind e-mail gate?\n\n---\n\n## 4  Functional Requirements  \n| Feature | Must-have / Nice-to-have | Your preference |\n|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| Mobile-first responsive layout | Required |   |\n| Online booking with real-time availability |   |   |\n| Automated reminders (SMS/WhatsApp) |   |   |\n| Online payment gateway (PayNow, Stripe, etc.) |   |   |\n| Student/parent portal (login) to retrieve notes & homework |   |   |\n| Live chat / chatbot (basic FAQ) |   |   |\n| Mailing-list integration (ConvertKit, MailChimp) |   |   |\n| Analytics (GA4, Matomo) w/ event tracking | Required |   |\n| Schema-org markup for local business & course | Required |   |\n\nSpecific questions:  \n\n1. Do you currently accept online payments, or is invoicing offline?  \n2. Are class sizes fixed such that a booking engine must enforce capacity?  \n3. Would a closed student portal add real value, or is e-mail/Telegram distribution adequate?  \n4. Need bilingual (EN/\u4e2d\u6587) content?  \n\n---\n\n## 5  Design & Brand Identity  \n- **Look & feel**: modern academic? traditional scholar? playful STEM vibe?  \n- Preferred **colour palette** (existing logo hues?)  \n- Any **design benchmarks** you admire (local or overseas tuition sites)?  \n- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA?  \n\n---\n\n## 6  Technical Stack & Hosting  \nGiven you already run CentOS 8 + nginx:  \n\n1. **Site generator & CMS options**  \n   - Static (Hugo/Gatsby/Next JS) + headless CMS (NetlifyCMS, Strapi)  \n   - WordPress + secure hardening (fail2ban, modsecurity, two-factor)  \n   - Flask/FastAPI \u201cmini-CMS\u201d leveraging your Python skillset  \n2. **Booking integration**  \n   - Self-hosted (Calendly alternative like Cal.com) vs SaaS  \n3. **Security**  \n   - SSL, CSP, WAF, regular dependency scanning  \n4. **Deployment workflow**  \n   - GitHub Actions \u2192 rsync to server? Docker?  \n\nQuestions:\n\n- Any hard constraint to avoid WordPress?  \n- Comfort level with React?  \n- How often will non-technical staff (if any) edit content?  \n\n---\n\n## 7  SEO & Performance  \n- Core Web Vitals targets (<1 s LCP)  \n- Local SEO (Google Business Profile, NAP consistency)  \n- Keyword clusters (e.g., \u201cJC H2 Math tuition Singapore\u201d, \u201cO-Level EMath tutor\u201d)  \n- Structured data (course, review, FAQ)  \n- Content-delivery strategy (image optimisation, Brotli, caching headers)  \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Do you intend to keep sgmathtuition.com domain or launch a fresh one?  \n2. Current backlink profile\u2014any strong links we must preserve?  \n3. Do you plan paid ads or purely organic?  \n\n---\n\n## 8  Compliance & Policies  \n- PDPA consent for storing student details  \n- Terms & Conditions, refund policy, class cancellation policy  \n- Cookie banner (if using any tracking beyond strictly necessary)  \n\n---\n\n### Next Steps  \n1. **Answer the key questions** above (even brief bullet points are fine).  \n2. We\u2019ll prioritise features, sketch wireframes, pick a tech stack, and draw a phased roadmap (MVP \u2192 V1.1 \u2192 V2).  \n3.
