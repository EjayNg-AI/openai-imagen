An example given is the unchanged time required for a string quartet to perform Haydn, compared to the dramatic advancements in other economic activities. The relevance today is not just in performing arts but in public sectors such as healthcare, education, and social care. These sectors struggle as their productivity can't increase similarly to other fields, thus becoming increasingly costly. This creates a dilemma where society must choose to either allow public sector wages to lag, rely on voluntary work, decrease dependence on certain services, or accept and fund higher wages. The UK\u2019s struggling NHS highlights the impact of the Baumol effect, compounded by pandemic strain and under-investment. While the Baumol effect questions the notion that every worker must become more productive to justify pay rises, it also challenges us to explore ways to elevate productivity in sectors traditionally resistant to such gains, ensuring balanced economic development and improved public services.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1727409606.135,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.newyorker.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/07/07/what-ails-us","title":"What Ails Us","snippet":"American consumers are confused by warnings of deflation amid rising prices for goods and services such as car insurance, health insurance, haircuts, and college tuition. The divergence in price trends stems from \"Baumol's cost disease,\" where industries with stagnant productivity, like education and healthcare, see rising costs to attract talent, while more productive sectors like manufacturing and retail reduce costs and maintain or increase wages. This phenomenon creates two economies, one characterized by decreasing costs and another by increasing costs. While cost disease affects labor-intensive sectors, the economy remains stable as long as growth in productive industries continues to offset the slower sectors. The political implication is that essential government services like education, law enforcement, and healthcare require more funding without visible quality improvements, making the public sector appear inefficient.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1056931200.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68611045bcd48007853b901627d5803a","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"efacabc6-bd68-48e9-88d7-6acd9afc0a76","request_id":"95749d131f6f9af4-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"efacabc6-bd68-48e9-88d7-6acd9afc0a76","children":["fbfad94b-9147-415b-88df-10bb524f71b9"]},"fbfad94b-9147-415b-88df-10bb524f71b9":{"id":"fbfad94b-9147-415b-88df-10bb524f71b9","message":{"id":"fbfad94b-9147-415b-88df-10bb524f71b9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1751191627.733155,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing AI\u2019s economic effect","content":"It seems like the user is curious about how AI might change the cost dynamics of essentials versus luxuries.

Speaking at the SXSW festival in London, Blair advocated for AI doctors, nurses, and tutors, emphasizing the potential for massive improvements in service efficiency, cost reduction, and personalized care. He criticized government's resistance to change and highlighted AI's ability to streamline bureaucratic processes. A government trial showed that integrating AI could free 30,000 civil servants from repetitive administrative duties. Blair stressed the need for responsible use of AI and called for better access to NHS data for innovation. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle echoed these views, citing the UK's rich data resources and arguing that using them with AI could lead to groundbreaking advances in science and services. He also noted that public trust must be earned for successful AI implementation.

A standout initiative is a $1 billion Pre-sale Finance Guarantee package that will see the government act as a guarantor for certain housing projects, aimed at adding 20,000 homes over five years. Additionally, $145 million will continue funding the NSW Building Commission's efforts to enforce quality controls and target unscrupulous developers.\n\nThe Budget highlights technology's role, particularly artificial intelligence, in reforming planning frameworks that have historically delayed housing approvals and driven up costs. The Wingecarribee Shire Council has adopted an AI-based system, DAISY, to streamline development approvals, with 20 more councils applying for similar support. The Housing Industry Association (HIA) has called for sweeping planning reforms and launched the \"One House One Approval\" campaign to simplify and accelerate building approvals. HIA warns that without immediate reforms, Australia's housing shortfall will persist, pointing to high regulatory costs and procedural delays as key contributors to the affordability crisis and reduced construction industry productivity.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750735800.0,"attribution":"www.dailytelegraph.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"workingforest.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://workingforest.com/ai-in-construction/","title":"Economic Impact of AI in Construction and Home Building","snippet":"While AI brings productivity gains, it also introduces the risk of job displacement.

Will the basics keep drifting out of reach?  \n\n1. **Short-run divergence likely**  \n   *AI disproportionately boosts tasks that are already digitised.* Expect a fresh flood of cheap or free digital experiences\u2014hyper-personalised entertainment, design, legal templates, coding helpers\u2014while college, rent and healthcare may at first feel only slightly cheaper.  \n   *Early adopters* (big tech platforms, high-skill professionals) will capture much of the value, widening income dispersion.\n\n2. **Medium-run convergence is plausible but not automatic**  \n   *AI tools now attack the very bottlenecks that drive cost disease*: clinical documentation, lesson-planning, planning-permission delays, project-management overruns. If governments allow experimentation, the service sectors could finally see genuine productivity growth.  \n   *Regulation is the swing factor.* Liability shields for AI-augmented clinicians, accreditation for AI-centric degrees, and streamlined digital building codes could tip the curve from perpetual above-CPI inflation toward near-CPI or even deflation in essential services.\n\n3. **Distribution still matters**  \n   Even when productivity rises, *who* enjoys the price drop depends on competitive structure. Without antitrust vigilance and open-standards pressures, a handful of model providers could internalise much of the surplus.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Strategic implications for policy & firms  \n\n1. **Open interfaces & portability** \u2013 Prevent lock-in so gains pass to consumers.  \n2. **Outcome-based regulation** \u2013 Approve AI medical or educational tools via real-world efficacy audits rather than prescriptive rules.  \n3. **Skills transition funds** \u2013 Redirect some of the AI surplus to reskill displaced service-sector labour into AI-augmented roles.  \n4. **Land-use reform paired with AI construction** \u2013 Otherwise productivity savings in building never reach renters or buyers.  \n5. **Public-option AI utilities** \u2013 Governments could deploy open-weight models for tutoring, legal aid, and triage to supply a competitive benchmark and curb mark-ups.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line  \n\nYes\u2014**if left on autopilot, AI could extend the 1960s-to-2020s pattern: dazzling new gadgets get cheaper while tuition, rent and healthcare keep racing ahead.**  \nBut AI also offers the *first credible toolkit* in decades to punch holes in Baumol\u2019s cost disease.

The divergence in price trends stems from \"Baumol's cost disease,\" where industries with stagnant productivity, like education and healthcare, see rising costs to attract talent, while more productive sectors like manufacturing and retail reduce costs and maintain or increase wages. This phenomenon creates two economies, one characterized by decreasing costs and another by increasing costs. While cost disease affects labor-intensive sectors, the economy remains stable as long as growth in productive industries continues to offset the slower sectors.

Speaking at the SXSW festival in London, Blair advocated for AI doctors, nurses, and tutors, emphasizing the potential for massive improvements in service efficiency, cost reduction, and personalized care. He criticized government's resistance to change and highlighted AI's ability to streamline bureaucratic processes. A government trial showed that integrating AI could free 30,000 civil servants from repetitive administrative duties. Blair stressed the need for responsible use of AI and called for better access to NHS data for innovation. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle echoed these views, citing the UK's rich data resources and arguing that using them with AI could lead to groundbreaking advances in science and services. He also noted that public trust must be earned for successful AI implementation.
