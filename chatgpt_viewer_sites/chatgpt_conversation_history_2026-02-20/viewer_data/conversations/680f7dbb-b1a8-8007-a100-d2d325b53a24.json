Given that she has WAs and a paper this week, it's completely understandable to skip this week's lesson.\n> \n> If you're open to it, may I suggest having Claire attend one or two trial sessions with another teacher? Different teachers use different approaches, and sometimes a slight shift in teaching style can significantly improve a student's learning experience.\n> \n> If after trying these sessions you still feel it's best to stop, we'll of course respect that decision.

It balances empathy with an implicit reminder of the notice policy without sounding demanding.\n\n- **Potential Risk:**  \n  There's a chance the parent insists on immediate withdrawal regardless. If that happens, you'll have to decide if enforcing the two-lesson policy is worthwhile or if maintaining goodwill with the parent outweighs enforcing the policy.\n\n- **Forward-thinking:**  \n  Suggesting an alternative teacher is proactive. Even if Claire ultimately stops, the gesture could leave a positive impression, maintaining your reputation and potentially encouraging the parent to reconsider in the future or provide referrals.\n\nWould you like to adjust any part of this message?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"dd084252-a54e-47b5-b599-4922160314a3","request_id":"9376c9743d89fd0b-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dd084252-a54e-47b5-b599-4922160314a3","children":["72a5e89f-83e6-4f2c-a44c-afaae3516416"]},"72a5e89f-83e6-4f2c-a44c-afaae3516416":{"id":"72a5e89f-83e6-4f2c-a44c-afaae3516416","message":{"id":"72a5e89f-83e6-4f2c-a44c-afaae3516416","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745845806.855,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I'd like to place the official policy in front (the phrasing has to be as diplomatic as possible) so as to give context as to my suggestions"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"9376cc43a885fd0b-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e41ea865-07d8-4c9b-9d46-6f598724393d","children":["5bcbc2b7-2e66-4e98-bd62-789c9ff445c1"]},"5bcbc2b7-2e66-4e98-bd62-789c9ff445c1":{"id":"5bcbc2b7-2e66-4e98-bd62-789c9ff445c1","message":{"id":"5bcbc2b7-2e66-4e98-bd62-789c9ff445c1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1745845807.239141,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's your revised message, clearly stating the official policy upfront in a diplomatic manner, while smoothly transitioning into your constructive suggestions:\n\n---\n\n> Hi, thanks for letting me know about Claire\u2019s situation.  \n>   \n> The official policy does typically ask for a two-lesson notice period, mainly to allow students a bit of buffer time to confirm their decision or explore alternatives without disruption.
