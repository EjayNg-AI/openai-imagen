And generally the last 80 years have been a period of\n0:37\nunprecedented peace and prosperity for most countries in the world. But the\n0:43\npoint is that it was unique. And the deeper point today is that that\n0:50\ninternational order has ended. Ended.\n0:57\nThis order used to be characterized by principles of multilateralism,\n1:04\ninternational law, sovereign equality, free markets, global supply chains\n1:10\norganized on the basis of efficiency and global institutions, the UN, the IMF,\n1:17\nthe World Bank, the WTO. In the last 60 plus years of Singapore's\n1:24\nindependence, actually we evolved exquisitly\n1:30\nto take full advantage of this global system\n1:35\nand we benefited from Pax Americana from China's reform and opening from the\n1:44\nrise of middle powers and the progressive integration of ASEAN.\n1:50\nIn fact, Singapore thrived as a global metropolis in an age of globalization.\n1:58\nNow, the first brutal hard truth is that if that period has ended, we cannot\n2:06\nsimply presume that if we just carry on as per normal, somehow magically things\n2:12\nwill fall into place. This is a moment of rupture.\n2:21\nIt's also worth asking ourselves why and how that benign era of globalization has\n2:30\nended. Actually, foreign policy begins at home\nWorkstreams of MFA to exercise agency\n2:36\nand this applies in understanding what is happening now on the global stage. In\n2:42\nmany countries, there has been a populist backlash.\n2:48\nGlobalization has created wealth. But it is also blamed for accentuating fault\n2:54\nlines, for increasing inequality, for middle class stagnation, for the\n3:01\nloss of jobs, for growing despair and depolarization in many societies.\n3:08\nThis domestic dysfunction has now projected itself onto the global\n3:15\nstage and you'll see that this has\n3:20\nundermine the support for the international order.\n3:25\nSo I completely agree with Mr. Yongwing, Mr. Vikram Na, Mr. Leanging Hua and Gerald Gang that this is not a passing\n3:33\nshower. This is not just a small tremor. This is geostrategic\n3:40\ntectonic plate rupture. The Greek historian to cidis wrote, \"The\n3:47\nstrong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.\"\n3:53\nHis words are now acutely apt today. The great powers flex their military and\n4:01\neconomic power more readily than ever before in pursuit of their interests\n4:06\nmore narrowly defined and to be frank with less pretense of\n4:14\nlegal or moral justification for their actions. Where there was once economic\n4:20\nintegration, there is now fragmentation and weaponization\n4:26\nof interdependence and dependence. We are now in a world where\n4:31\ninternational relations are no longer driven primarily by rules or by attempts\n4:38\nto achieve consensus. Actually, the great powers have always been selective when applying the rule of\n4:44\nlaw to themselves. But now they feel even less need to\n4:50\nengage in hypocrisy. It's all about raw power and how that\n4:56\nraw power asymmetry can be exploited. And so this is a far more dangerous\n5:03\nworld for small countries because small countries do not have the strategic heft\n5:10\nto buffer ourselves from turbulence. For Singapore, a tiny city state, the\n5:16\nScholes are even more treacherous. Let's pause for a moment to consider\n5:24\nwhat our options are. Option number one,\n5:29\ndespair, give up, surrender to our fates.\n5:34\nI think the answer must be no. Cuz that's not who we are. This is not who\n5:42\nwe were in 1965 when in fact a newly independent\n5:47\nSingapore faced even longer odds with less resources.\n5:54\nSecond option, choose one dominant power and seek\n6:00\nprotection under its wing. No,\n6:06\nthis would undermine our sovereignty, our independence and in effect make us a\n6:11\nvassal state. Singapore should not and does not need\n6:17\nto do this. And after all, Singapore has never expected anyone else to come to\n6:26\nour defense. We will defend ourselves.\n6:31\nThe third and in my view the only viable option for us is to continue to\n6:38\ndetermine our long-term national interests and then exercise our agency\n6:44\nto chart our own path, choose our own destiny. Yes, we may be small but we are\n6:52\na sovereign and independent country. We are a trusted global hub and an\n6:58\nassiduous bridge builder. We want to make common cause with all states that\n7:03\nare willing to engage us. We build regional and global networks that support dialogue, openness and\n7:11\ninclusion. We want to be useful but not made use\n7:16\nof. We are successful because of our domestic unity, our\n7:23\neconomic relevance and vitality and our defense capability.\n7:30\nSo therefore we may be small but we have agency, we have resilience and we have\n7:35\nthe resources and the will to back this up. As Hongwing asked how Singapore will\n7:42\ndefend our principles not just in words but also in deed. Singapore's foreign\n7:48\npolicy has always rested on two pillars. Mr. Rajaratnam described the first\n7:55\npillar as the theology of foreign policy. theology. That means\n8:01\nthe world that we hope to have, a world that hopefully was based on principles\n8:06\nof fairness, sovereign equality and international rules.\n8:12\nBut we have never been naive. There is a deep vein of realism in the\n8:19\nway we view the world and the way we operate. And this is what Mr. Raja Radnam term quote the practice of\n8:27\nforeign policy. Now we have always understood that size and power matter in\n8:34\nforeign relations. Disagreement, coercion, even conflict\n8:40\nare part and parcel of the cut and thrust of international relations.\n8:46\nAnd this is precisely why we have spent between 3 to 6% of our GDP for six\n8:52\ndecades for defense. An effective foreign policy needs both\n8:58\npillars, idealism and realism. We never want to\n9:04\nbecome so cynical that no one will trust us. But we also do not want to be so\n9:12\nnaive that we will get taken advantage of by everyone.\n9:18\nSo we need to assess objectively our national interests based on our unique\n9:23\ncircumstances as a tiny multi-racial city state in the heart of Southeast\n9:28\nAsia. So the next set of questions, what are\n9:34\nour national interests? First, to safeguard our sovereignty, our\n9:39\nindependence and our national unity. Second, to secure access to essential\n9:46\nsupplies and the freedom of navigation necessary for us to continue to have\n9:52\naccess to these essential supplies. What are these essential supplies? Energy, food, water, and you can add to that\n9:59\nlist. The third national interest is to continue to strengthen our role as a\n10:07\ntrusted global hub for trade, for finance, for wealth management, advanced\n10:12\nmanufacturing and other global services. And fourth aspect of our national\n10:18\ninterest is to support a rules-based multilateral approach wherever possible\n10:24\nrecognizing that the challenges to the global commons like climate change like pandemics in fact have to be tackled\n10:32\ncollectively because they go beyond the ability of any single country even a superpower to resolve. So in such a\n10:40\ntumultuous world, the point I'm making today is that we are going to face more\n10:46\nstrategic dilemmas and difficult choices because for instance, our interests are\n10:54\nnot always going to be aligned with the great powers or the middle powers or our\n11:00\nimmediate neighbors. On some issues, and this is the key point I'm making today, on some issues, we will have to say no.\n11:09\nTo say no courteously, respectfully, and constructively, but nevertheless to\n11:16\nstand firm and say no. And this is not about choosing sites, but about\n11:21\nupholding principles and a careful assessment of Singapore's\n11:27\nlong-term national interests. Now, I've been in this post long enough\n11:33\nto tell you that pressure has been and will be brought to bear on us. And\n11:40\nthere will always be attempts to weaken our will and to divide us domestically.\n11:48\nAnd I would also state that sometimes we will pay a price for staking out our\n11:56\nposition. But I'm hoping that this house and the\n12:01\ncitizens beyond will agree that we must retain this\n12:08\nability to say no when we have to and that if we ever lose that ability to say\n12:14\nno then that is the day that Singapore loses its relevance indeed our\n12:20\nindependence. Let's provide some examples so it's not\n12:25\njust words. We have consistently called out violations of international law. We did\n12:31\nso when Russia invaded Ukraine. To us, that was a clear violation of international law and the principles of\n12:38\nthe UN charter. More recently, we also did so in relation to the US actions in\n12:45\nVenezuela. And we took these positions because a world based on might is right is a world\n12:54\nthat's more dangerous for Singapore. We spoke out about the need to preserve\n12:59\na rules-based trading system, including the principle\n13:05\nof most favored nation in the WTO. We expressed categorically our\n13:11\ndisappointment with the US tariffs that violate this principle because trade is\n13:18\nour lifeblood. Trade is more than three times Singapore's GDP. jobs, investments, and\n13:25\nliving standards depend on our predictable access to external markets.\n13:31\nWe also took clear positions on the Israel Gaza conflict. We condemned the\n13:38\nattacks that occurred on the 7th of October 2023 on Israel. These were acts\n13:44\nof terror. We affirmed that every state has a right of self-defense.\n13:50\nHowever, in exercising this right, countries must abide by international law, including international\n13:57\nhumanitarian law. And we have clearly stated that Israel's military response\n14:02\nhas breached international humanitarian law. I agree with Mr. Yangwing on the need\n14:10\nfor both moral clarity and diplomatic effectiveness.\n14:15\nAlthough I would add that we mustn't try to reduce\n14:22\nforeign relations into a morality play. I think you will be hardressed to find\n14:28\noccasions when the prime minister or me ever refer to anyone any other leader or\n14:35\nany other country as evil or saint. That's not the way things work in real\n14:43\nlife. Coming back to Gaza, we have and we will\n14:49\ndo more to alleviate the suffering in Gaza. And in fact, we have been able to\n14:54\ndo more precisely because we've got extensive diplomatic ties across the\n15:01\nentire Middle East. And we're one of the few countries, and those of you who traveled with me will know, with\n15:06\nremarkable access to all sides. We have sent 11 tranches of humanitarian\n15:13\naid amounting to more than 25 million Singapore dollars to help the civilians in Gaza so far. And you know that these\n15:20\nfundraising efforts are continuing and more than just money that there are Singaporeans lining up to volunteer\n15:27\ntheir services, their professional services to help on the ground.\n15:33\nTo answer Mr. Gerald Gam, we are still assessing the invitation from the US to\n15:39\nformally join the Board of Peace, but in the meantime, we will explore\n15:45\ninitiatives, including those that were recently announced at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace on the\n15:50\n19th of February, 2026. Singapore will continue to play a\n15:56\nconstructive role in the pursuit of peace and reconstruction in Gaza. And on Palestine, the larger question. Our\n16:03\nlong-standing position remains that the only path to a just and durable peace is\n16:08\na negotiated two-state solution consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. We oppose attempts\n16:17\nto create new facts on the ground that undermine the prospects for a two-state\n16:23\nsolution. And it is our consistent position that the Israeli settlements in\n16:28\nthe West Bank are illegal under international law.\n16:33\nThese positions that we have taken and explicitly stated over the last few\n16:40\nyears have not been universally welcomed and even domestically have elicited\n16:46\nactive debate. But the point I'm trying to make to you is that people may disagree with certain\n16:54\ndecisions and positions that we take, but I hope you understand why we take\n16:59\nthese positions. As Mr. Fu Chasang has emphasized,\n17:05\ntaking a position rather than lying low and seeking cover in fact align with\n17:15\nfurthering our national interest. Articulating these positions is part of\n17:20\nexercising agency because we must try to shape the environment and to carve out\n17:28\nconditions which are most conducive for the survival and success of small states.\n17:34\nI agree with Mr. Yam that in this fraught geopolitical environment the\n17:39\npersonal touch is still of par paramount.\n17:46\nBuilding relationships at a personal level between leaders, political leaders\n17:51\nis still the paramount currency of diplomacy. Last year, MFA facilitated\n17:58\nover 180 visits, incoming and outgoing, at the political level. If you include\n18:04\nofficials and civil servants, the number balloons exponentially. But the purpose of meeting of traveling\n18:11\nis not just to show up just to fly the flag but to deepen the personal rapport\n18:18\nand trust between leaders and officials and their foreign counterparts\n18:23\nparticularly when the views are divergent. It won't resolve the conflict, but building reservoirs of\n18:32\ntrust and understanding reduces the probability of miscommunications and\n18:37\nunnecessary conflicts. Having said all that, I go one more\nSingapore\u2019s strategic options as superpowers compete\n18:44\nlayer of resolution down. MFA has five priority work streams. First, we want to\n18:51\nengage all the great powers constructively and we want to give give them a stake in the stability and\n18:57\nprosperity of our region because that balance of power between great powers is\n19:03\nwhat gives small states like Singapore room for maneuver and options.\n19:09\nThe second work stream is to butress an even wider network of middle power\n19:16\npartnerships for greater stability. I think in the last couple of years, the need for middle powers, particularly\n19:23\nmiddle powers who share an affinity for international law, multilateralism,\n19:29\nfree trade, the imperative for middle powers to get together and for us to\n19:35\nengage the middle powers has become all the more obvious. Our third work stream\n19:41\nis to strengthen a stable and integrated ASEAN because not just because it's our\n19:46\nimmediate neighborhood but because this happens to be a part of the world with great potential over the next couple of\n19:54\ndecades in terms of economic growth in terms of a rising middle class in terms\n19:59\nof technological leaprogging in terms of infrastructure and integration.\n20:06\nFourth, obviously we do need to pay attention to our immediate neighbors.\n20:12\nAnd by our immediate neighbors, it's Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunai, the core of\n20:18\nour core. And fifth, take an overarching view. We need where\n20:24\nto do where we can to reinforce a rules-based international architecture\n20:30\ndespite the current headwinds. So again, it's an example of not surrendering to\n20:36\nour fates. Let me delve in a little bit more detail about big the major powers.\nRole of ASEAN and Singapore assuming chairmanship in 2027\n20:42\nStarting with the US and China. Mr. Edbert Chia, Henry Quong, Mr. Sean Hang\n20:48\nHuang, Miss Jessica Tan asked, \"How do we maintain trust with both the US and\n20:53\nChina whilst preserving Singapore's strategic options and even while the two\n20:59\npowers superpowers are competing against each other in the realms of\n21:06\nsecurity, supply chain, technology, and trade?\" It's a tough question. Well, let\n21:13\nme start with the US. We have a substantial, deep, and multifaceted relationship with\n21:20\nthe US. The US has long been and continues to be the largest foreign\n21:28\ninvestor in Singapore by a long way. If you check the figures, you will see that\n21:35\nit is multiple times more stock of FDI from the US than the second, third,\n21:41\nfourth, and fifth investor. Even if you add it up, we purchase US defense equipment and we\n21:50\ncooperate closely on countering terrorism and proliferation\n21:56\nand we are deepening our our cooperation in critical and emerging technologies.\n22:01\nThis year we celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties with the US.\n22:07\nHaving said that, China is also a vital partner with whom we enjoy a robust and\n22:13\nclose relationship. Over most of the last 10 years, China has been our\n22:18\nlargest trading partner in goods. At the last joint council for bilateral\n22:23\ncooperation, we concluded 27 agreements ranging from finance and innovation to food security and green energy. We\n22:31\nmarked 35 years of diplomatic relations last year. Actually, if you stop to\n22:37\nthink about it beyond the numbers, we have a unique relationship with\n22:46\nChina. China and Singapore are the only two\n22:52\nsovereign states in the world with a majority Chinese population\n23:00\nwith deep linguistic, cultural and historical links.\n23:05\nThis presents both opportunities and is also a burden for us because\n23:14\nSingapore is an independent multi-racial city state in the heart of Southeast\n23:21\nAsia. We have our own identity, our own political system and our own values.\n23:28\nActually our value proposition even to China is\n23:34\nto be same same but different to quote Mr. The limbs we say same same. Yes, of\n23:41\ncourse we enjoy the affinity, the linguistic, the shared cultural heritage,\n23:48\nbut different because Singapore's destiny and our value proposition is to\n23:55\nbe distinct and not yet another small Chinese city. Do you see my point?\n24:04\nSo therefore we have to work with both the US and China where our interests\n24:11\ncoincide and where our interests diverge we will have to courteously stand up and say no\n24:19\nand where we say no both sides must understand it's not personal but it's\n24:24\nbased on a principled assessment of Singapore's national interest and that\n24:30\nwe are not acting as a proxy for one or the other against them. So long as we\n24:37\ncan maintain this and I speak now from experience in fact so long as we\n24:42\nmaintain this principal approach actually they put I feel that we come under less pressure because they know\n24:50\nthis tiny little city state is one where the more you push them the more spine\n24:56\nand the more firmly they will hold their ground. and conducting foreign policy on\n25:02\nthis basis with superpowers. I'm telling you from experience, I think\n25:08\nthis is the only way to do it. The reality is that all countries\n25:15\nincluding Singapore will have to find creative ways to work with both the US and China because they are the major\n25:21\npowers and they are relevant to our future. Turning to the middle powers, we\n25:28\nare growing our part our network of partnerships with middle powers and with regional blocks. So for instance in 2025\n25:35\nwe upgraded our partnerships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand, Vietnam. We achieved a new partnership\n25:42\nwith South Korea. We signed the EU Singapore digital trade agreement and we\n25:47\nare deepening relations with more like-minded partners. We are expanding our global footprint in Africa and Latin\n25:54\nAmerica. And to support this, we are establishing new missions in Mexico and\n25:59\nEthiopia. And actually, there will be more to come. And I want to reassure Mr.\n26:04\nLee Hongan that all these moves will be the diplomatic field are also aimed to\n26:10\nincrease access for our local enterprises to overseas markets.\nThe need to protect the global commons and support the multilateral system\n26:15\nOn ASEAN, I agree with Mr. Leanging Hua and Miss Valerie Lee that Asean has to\n26:21\nremain the cornerstone of our foreign policy. It is a salient platform from\n26:26\nwhich we engage the wider world. For ASEAN to remain relevant, you have\n26:32\nreminded us that we must deepen our regional integration in order to become\n26:38\nmore cohesive, more united and credible. An integrated ASEAN builds a stable\n26:44\nregional platform for Singapore and gives us a voice more so than a\n26:50\nunilateral voice and also the convening power of ASEAN. And that's why we're\n26:56\nalso pushing very hard on key initiatives that bind our ASEAN economies closer together as emphasized\n27:02\nby Mr. Yip Hong and Miss Rachel. We are making progress on the ASEAN power grid.\n27:08\nThis is about creating a sustainable interconnected infrastructure that supports the entire region's growth. The\n27:15\nASEAN digital economy framework agreement was substantially concluded last year. We hope to finalize the\n27:21\nagreement this year. I believe it will unlock the immense potential of the digital economy in ASEAN in the years to\n27:28\ncome. But we must also continue to look outwards. We should give all major\n27:34\npowers a stake in the stability and prosperity of our region and to ensure\n27:39\nthat ASEAN remains a partner of choice. This is the logic behind our open\n27:45\ninclusive ASEAN centered regional architecture. The more countries invest in ASEAN's\n27:52\ncollective progress, the more stable we will be. This balance of power and\n27:58\ninterest provides small countries like Singapore with more room for maneuver\n28:03\nthan an alternative scenario where there was only a single power dominating our\n28:09\nregion. Mr. Gerald Gam, Mr. Patrick Tay, Miss Rachel asked how we plan to let to\n28:15\nleverage our upcoming ASEAN chairmanship to deepen integration and unity. We will\n28:21\nassume the chair of ASEAN in 2027 during ASEAN's 60th anniversary. This is a\n28:30\nheavy responsibility but also an opportunity. An opportunity at a time of\n28:35\nTamil. We will deepen integration. We will promote external partnerships. We will\n28:41\ncontinue to keep the Assean region open for business, open to the world, committed to peace, stability, and\n28:47\ncooperation. I would like to assure Mr. Gerald Kam that we do in fact secon offices to the Assean secretariat\n28:53\nparticularly at the leadership positions we've done so over the years including the current deputy secretary general for\n29:00\nthe Assean economic community Mr. Sabinda Singh MFA will continue to curate and\n29:06\nfacilitates for MFA and other public offices from other ministries to the\n29:11\nASEAN secretariat and to other international organizations. This extends our experience and knowledge\n29:18\nbase of international diplomacy and tradecraftraft more widely across our\n29:24\ncivil service. Let me turn now to our neighbors closer to home. Strong\n29:30\nrelations with Malaysia with Indonesia and Brunai as is critical. Mr. Patrick T asked how\n29:38\nwe will step up our engagement with them. Mr. Victor Lie asked how we will strengthen economic coordination with\n29:44\nour neighbors through city-based and regional partnerships given the increasing crossber activities of\n29:50\nSingaporean companies and Singaporeans. With Indonesia, we have resolved longstanding issues and are now in a\n29:58\nposition to explore mutually beneficial projects in energy, in food security, education and healthcare. We're\n30:05\ndiscussing crossber electricity trade, carbon capture and storage and establishing a sustainable industrial\n30:12\nzone across the Batam bintankaroon corridor. These strategic projects will\n30:18\naccelerate decarbonization. It will catalyze green investments in both countries and we look forward to\n30:24\ncommemorating 60 years of diplomatic ties in 2027. With Malaysia, our leaders meet\n30:32\nregularly, both formally and informally for candid discussions. This has allowed\n30:38\nus to pursue beneficial regional partnerships, including the Johor Singapore special economic zone, the\n30:45\nJoharu Singapore rapid transit system link. We are deepening economic and\n30:50\npeopleto-people ties with East Malaysia. In fact, we will be establishing new\n30:55\nconsulates, one in Sappa and one in Surawak shortly. But at the same time, I\n31:02\nwill also be candid and tell you that we are trying to manage outstanding bilateral issues that are complex that\n31:09\nby definition have been around for a long time and will take time to resolve.\n31:15\nBut the fact of the matter is Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunai will always be close neighbors, permanent neighbors.\n31:23\nAnd we cannot afford to allow spiky issues to undermine our overall positive\n31:30\ncooperation on international organizations norms and\n31:35\nstandards. I agree with Miss Ponging, Mr. Lee Lee Hongchan on the need to protect the global commons and to\nForeign policy begins at home\n31:42\nsupport multilateralism. Despite the challenges,\n31:47\nthe rules-based multilateral system ultimately provides the architecture of norms, standards, and institutions that\n31:56\nprotects the global commons and gives all small states a say. So this means\n32:04\nin spite of the headwinds today, we must continue to try do our best to build\n32:10\noverlapping flexible circles of plurilateral partnerships with like-minded countries. Wherever we can\n32:17\nmake common cause, we do so and we proceed. We remain fully committed to\n32:23\nthe World Trade Organization. But achieving consensus amongst 166 members\n32:29\nis very difficult. Our strategy is to push the envelope with like-minded\n32:35\npartners where we can who share our commitment to free trade and we aim for\n32:41\nhigh ambition agreements that are inclusive and WTO consistent so that others can join when ready. In other\n32:47\nwords, make common cause, move forward, invite other people to come on board,\n32:53\nalways stay open and inclusive. The joint statement initiative on e-commerce\n32:59\nagreement began with Singapore, Australia and Japan. It now has 72\n33:05\nco-sponsors. The future of investment and trade partnership brings together 16 small and\n33:12\nmedium-siz economies on supply chain resilience and trade facilitation.\n33:18\nDo you see my point that these are examples where you start small but you can build and expand these platforms\n33:26\nbeyond trade. We have also built constituencies of support amongst fellow small states in the UN. The forum of\n33:31\nsmall states which Singapore co-founded brings together 108 countries to address\n33:37\nissues like sustainable development, climate change, protecting the global commons and digitalization.\n33:43\nBuilding consensus in a fractured world is difficult but not impossible.\n33:50\nAmbassador Reena Lee preided over the conclusion of the BBJ agreement in 2023.\n33:57\nWe will continue to contribute where we can and our nomination of Ambassador Reena Lee as a candidate for judge in\n34:04\nthe International Court of Justice reflects our commitment to advancing the international rule of law. Mr. The\n34:12\nNeocbang has suggested leveraging technology as a soft power. Completely\n34:17\nagree with you. We have in fact been stepping up technology cooperation in partnership with other countries. We\n34:24\nwork together with others including at the G20 and APE to shape the norms and\n34:30\nstandards and more importantly open access to technology that can benefit\n34:36\nall countries. We will continue to strengthen such engagements and re ensure that Singapore remains an open\n34:42\nand trusted hub for techn technological innovation and scientific collaboration.\n34:47\nI tell my foreign counterparts, send your people to us. We will run an open book exercise with you. We will show you\n34:55\nhow we do it because anyway the challenge is not\n35:01\nin the idea. The challenge is in execution. And to the extent that we can\n35:06\nshow people what we've done, including our mistakes, and they can modify it and\n35:11\nmake it relevant to them, that's how we exercise thought leadership and\n35:16\ncooperation in this field. Let me come to the challenges ahead.\n35:25\nWe're in a very turbulent world. We will face more inflection points and we will have to take more difficult positions.\n35:32\nSingaporeans will have different views on these foreign policy issues. Being\n35:38\ninterested or as Eileen has said, literate in global issues and\n35:45\nunderstanding Singapore's national interest will help us engage the world with knowledge, understanding and\n35:52\nconfidence. We do not necessarily have to agree on\n35:57\nall our foreign policy stances, but we must agree that these are matters to be\n36:04\ndiscussed and decided by Singaporeans alone. And that means keeping a wary eye on\n36:11\nforeign interference and influence. With increased global contestation,\n36:17\nforeign actors will want us to align with their views. They will try to seed\n36:23\ntheir narratives and there will be attempts as have occurred more recent\n36:28\ntimes to create fake news and to play on potential internal divisions. We have\n36:34\nalready seen information campaigns targeting Singapore online including I must add during our own general\n36:41\nelections last year where Singaporeans were urged to vote along religious\n36:47\nlines. Government statements on regional developments have prompted criticisms\n36:53\nfrom foreign nizens who want us to adopt their interpretations of history and\n36:59\nsuch attempts will continue. Geopolitical contestation has become a tussle for the hearts and minds\n37:06\nin cyerspace as well. We must be aware and we must exercise\n37:12\ncaution because we have a diverse population and never never presume that\n37:20\nwe are immune to the polarization and fractures in societies elsewhere.\n37:27\nSo where does this leave us? The world today more dangerous, more unpredictable\n37:32\nthan I've ever seen in my decade plus as foreign minister.\n37:38\nThe global order that used to underpin our success has ended and we do not\n37:44\nexpect a stable new equilibrium to to take shape in 2026 or even frankly even\n37:51\nthe next couple of years and we must expect more issues on which we will have to make take a difficult stand and\n37:58\nexternal and domestic pressures on us will grow. But I also believe we should\n38:05\ntake heart. The challenges we face today are serious, but they are less severe\n38:11\nthan what Singapore faced in 1965. Singapore had unexpectedly become\n38:17\nindependent. We had no hintterland, no resources, no armed forces. Our security was precarious. Our economic viability\n38:25\nwas in doubt. Our social cohesion was yet to be forged. and we lived in a\n38:31\nvolatile and dangerous neighborhood that regarded us with suspicion. Despite all\n38:37\nthis, our pioneers pressed ahead and they built this country.\n38:44\nThis is a narrative that connects Singapore over the\n38:50\ndecades. We may be small and improbable, but we have never been afraid to stand\n38:56\nup to fight for what we believe in. Today we are in a far far better\n39:03\nposition in terms of tools and resources. We have three prerequisites\n39:08\nfor success. The first is our domestic unity. Although we have this is work\n39:14\nalways constantly in progress. As long as we understand that we are all in this\n39:19\ntogether, as long as we can inoculate ourselves from foreign influence, as long as we can disagree maturely and\n39:26\nultimately still forge a domestic consensus, we will continue to thrive and we cannot be bought or bullied by\n39:33\nanyone. The second ingredient is our economic vitality and relevance. Mr. Lee Kwanu\n39:40\nsaid, quote, Singapore cannot take its relevance for granted. small countries\n39:47\nperform no vital or irreplaceable function in the international system.\n39:54\nHence, we must preserve our relevance to the world. In 1965, our per capita GDP\n40:00\nwas US $500. Today, it is over US90,000.\n40:09\nParadoxically, today's more fractious world accentuates Singapore's value as a\n40:15\ntrusted, stable hub. Our friends and partners\n40:21\nknow that we speak honestly and independently. They know that we are open and welcoming to all. They know\n40:28\nthat we honor our word. Contracts are sacrosanked. Investments and\n40:34\nintellectual capital are protected. There is a premium in such a world for\n40:39\nstability, consistency and respect for the rule of law.\n40:44\nThe third ingredient is our ability to defend ourselves. We can do that today\n40:50\nbecause we have national service and because of the steady investment in\n40:55\ndefense for decades. We must preserve this capability because it keeps us safe\n41:01\nand we are a country that can hope for the best but also prepare for the worst.\n41:08\nSo on this note, I thank all members for your long-standing support for MFA's work as we continue to navigate the\n41:14\nchallenges. We continue to safeguard Singapore's national interest and we seize the opportunities in these\n41:21\ntroubled times. I began with Tucid Tucidus and the core logic of power.\n41:27\nI'll end on a different note. The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus offered a different kind of\n41:34\nwisdom. Quote, \"Character is destiny.\"\n41:40\nFor all the turbulence in the world, I believe Singapore's destiny is bright, not because of our size or our luck, but\n41:48\nbecause of who we are. that Singapore spirit, indomitable grit, courage,\n41:56\nhonesty, discipline, diligence, rectitude and compassion.\n42:02\nThese are not mere abstractions. This is the Singapore spirit that got us here\n42:10\nand it is what will carry us forward."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"client-created-root","children":["2a69d93c-2739-4aca-a336-bc6e85bd1164"]},"2a69d93c-2739-4aca-a336-bc6e85bd1164":{"id":"2a69d93c-2739-4aca-a336-bc6e85bd1164","message":{"id":"2a69d93c-2739-4aca-a336-bc6e85bd1164","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1772216242.4381566,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### Singapore navigating the turbulent world\n\n**Vivian Balakrishnan:** Mr Chairman, on behalf of my colleagues, I first thank all of you for your ideas, your suggestions, and I must say again this year, I think I can claim bipartisan support for MFA.\n\nThe post-World War II international order is historically an unprecedented phase in global history. And generally, the last 80 years have been a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity for most countries in the world. But the point is that it was unique. And the deeper point today is that that international order has ended. Ended.\n\nThis order used to be characterized by principles of multilateralism, international law, sovereign equality, free markets, global supply chains organized on the basis of efficiency, and global institutions: the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO. In the last 60-plus years of Singapore\u2019s independence, actually we evolved exquisitely to take full advantage of this global system, and we benefited from Pax Americana, from China\u2019s reform and opening, from the rise of middle powers, and the progressive integration of ASEAN.\n\nIn fact, Singapore thrived as a global metropolis in an age of globalization. Now, the first brutal hard truth is that if that period has ended, we cannot simply presume that if we just carry on as per normal, somehow magically things will fall into place. This is a moment of rupture. It\u2019s also worth asking ourselves why and how that benign era of globalization has ended.\n\n### Workstreams of MFA to exercise agency\n\n**Vivian Balakrishnan:** Actually, foreign policy begins at home, and this applies in understanding what is happening now on the global stage. In many countries, there has been a populist backlash. Globalization has created wealth, but it is also blamed for accentuating fault lines, for increasing inequality, for middle-class stagnation, for the loss of jobs, for growing despair and depolarization in many societies.\n\nThis domestic dysfunction has now projected itself onto the global stage, and you\u2019ll see that this has undermined the support for the international order. So I completely agree with Mr Yong Weng, Mr Vikram Nair, Ms Liang Eng Hwa, and Mr Gerald Giam that this is not a passing shower. This is not just a small tremor. This is geostrategic tectonic plate rupture.\n\nThe Greek historian Thucydides wrote, \u201cThe strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.\u201d His words are now acutely apt today. The great powers flex their military and economic power more readily than ever before, in pursuit of their interests more narrowly defined, and to be frank, with less pretense of legal or moral justification for their actions. Where there was once economic integration, there is now fragmentation and weaponization of interdependence and dependence.\n\nWe are now in a world where international relations are no longer driven primarily by rules or by attempts to achieve consensus. Actually, the great powers have always been selective when applying the rule of law to themselves, but now they feel even less need to engage in hypocrisy. It\u2019s all about raw power, and how that raw power asymmetry can be exploited. And so this is a far more dangerous world for small countries, because small countries do not have the strategic heft to buffer ourselves from turbulence. For Singapore, a tiny city-state, the shoals are even more treacherous.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a moment to consider what our options are. Option number one: despair, give up, surrender to our fates. I think the answer must be no, because that\u2019s not who we are. This is not who we were in 1965, when in fact a newly independent Singapore faced even longer odds with less resources.\n\nSecond option: choose one dominant power and seek protection under its wing. No. This would undermine our sovereignty, our independence, and in effect make us a vassal state. Singapore should not and does not need to do this. And after all, Singapore has never expected anyone else to come to our defense. We will defend ourselves.\n\nThe third, and in my view the only viable option for us, is to continue to determine our long-term national interests and then exercise our agency to chart our own path, choose our own destiny. Yes, we may be small, but we are a sovereign and independent country. We are a trusted global hub and an assiduous bridge builder. We want to make common cause with all states that are willing to engage us. We build regional and global networks that support dialogue, openness, and inclusion. We want to be useful but not made use of.\n\nWe are successful because of our domestic unity, our economic relevance and vitality, and our defense capability. So therefore, we may be small, but we have agency, we have resilience, and we have the resources and the will to back this up.\n\nAs Mr Yong Weng asked how Singapore will defend our principles not just in words but also in deed, Singapore\u2019s foreign policy has always rested on two pillars. Mr Rajaratnam described the first pillar as the theology of foreign policy\u2014\u201ctheology.\u201d That means the world that we hope to have, a world that hopefully was based on principles of fairness, sovereign equality, and international rules.\n\nBut we have never been naive. There is a deep vein of realism in the way we view the world and the way we operate, and this is what Mr Rajaratnam termed the practice of foreign policy. Now, we have always understood that size and power matter in foreign relations. Disagreement, coercion, even conflict are part and parcel of the cut and thrust of international relations. And this is precisely why we have spent between 3 to 6% of our GDP for six decades for defense.\n\nAn effective foreign policy needs both pillars: idealism and realism. We never want to become so cynical that no one will trust us. But we also do not want to be so naive that we will get taken advantage of by everyone. So we need to assess objectively our national interests based on our unique circumstances as a tiny multi-racial city-state in the heart of Southeast Asia.\n\nSo the next set of questions: what are our national interests? First, to safeguard our sovereignty, our independence, and our national unity. Second, to secure access to essential supplies and the freedom of navigation necessary for us to continue to have access to these essential supplies. What are these essential supplies? Energy, food, water\u2014and you can add to that list.\n\nThe third national interest is to continue to strengthen our role as a trusted global hub for trade, for finance, for wealth management, advanced manufacturing, and other global services. And the fourth aspect of our national interest is to support a rules-based multilateral approach wherever possible, recognizing that the challenges to the global commons\u2014like climate change, like pandemics\u2014in fact have to be tackled collectively, because they go beyond the ability of any single country, even a superpower, to resolve.\n\nSo in such a tumultuous world, the point I\u2019m making today is that we are going to face more strategic dilemmas and difficult choices, because, for instance, our interests are not always going to be aligned with the great powers, or the middle powers, or our immediate neighbors.\n\nOn some issues\u2014and this is the key point I\u2019m making today\u2014on some issues, we will have to say no. To say no courteously, respectfully, and constructively, but nevertheless to stand firm and say no. And this is not about choosing sides, but about upholding principles and a careful assessment of Singapore\u2019s long-term national interests.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been in this post long enough to tell you that pressure has been and will be brought to bear on us. And there will always be attempts to weaken our will and to divide us domestically. And I would also state that sometimes we will pay a price for staking out our position. But I\u2019m hoping that this House, and the citizens beyond, will agree that we must retain this ability to say no when we have to\u2014and that if we ever lose that ability to say no, then that is the day that Singapore loses its relevance, indeed our independence.\n\nLet\u2019s provide some examples, so it\u2019s not just words. We have consistently called out violations of international law. We did so when Russia invaded Ukraine. To us, that was a clear violation of international law and the principles of the UN Charter. More recently, we also did so in relation to the US actions in Venezuela. And we took these positions because a world based on \u201cmight is right\u201d is a world that\u2019s more dangerous for Singapore.\n\nWe spoke out about the need to preserve a rules-based trading system, including the principle of most-favored-nation in the WTO. We expressed categorically our disappointment with the US tariffs that violate this principle, because trade is our lifeblood. Trade is more than three times Singapore\u2019s GDP. Jobs, investments, and living standards depend on our predictable access to external markets.\n\nWe also took clear positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict. We condemned the attacks that occurred on 7 October 2023 on Israel. These were acts of terror. We affirmed that every state has a right of self-defense. However, in exercising this right, countries must abide by international law, including international humanitarian law. And we have clearly stated that Israel\u2019s military response has breached international humanitarian law.\n\nI agree with Mr Yong Weng on the need for both moral clarity and diplomatic effectiveness. Although I would add that we mustn\u2019t try to reduce foreign relations into a morality play. I think you will be hard-pressed to find occasions when the Prime Minister or me ever refer to anyone, any other leader, or any other country as evil or saint. That\u2019s not the way things work in real life.\n\nComing back to Gaza, we have and we will do more to alleviate the suffering in Gaza. And in fact, we have been able to do more precisely because we\u2019ve got extensive diplomatic ties across the entire Middle East, and we\u2019re one of the few countries\u2014and those of you who traveled with me will know\u2014with remarkable access to all sides.\n\nWe have sent 11 tranches of humanitarian aid amounting to more than 25 million Singapore dollars to help the civilians in Gaza so far. And you know that these fundraising efforts are continuing. And more than just money, there are Singaporeans lining up to volunteer their services, their professional services, to help on the ground.\n\nTo answer Mr Gerald Giam, we are still assessing the invitation from the US to formally join the Board of Peace, but in the meantime, we will explore initiatives, including those that were recently announced at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace on 19 February 2026. Singapore will continue to play a constructive role in the pursuit of peace and reconstruction in Gaza.\n\nAnd on Palestine, the larger question: our long-standing position remains that the only path to a just and durable peace is a negotiated two-state solution consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. We oppose attempts to create new facts on the ground that undermine the prospects for a two-state solution. And it is our consistent position that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law.\n\nThese positions that we have taken and explicitly stated over the last few years have not been universally welcomed, and even domestically have elicited active debate. But the point I\u2019m trying to make to you is that people may disagree with certain decisions and positions that we take, but I hope you understand why we take these positions.\n\nAs Mr Foo Chia Siang has emphasized, taking a position rather than lying low and seeking cover in fact aligns with furthering our national interest. Articulating these positions is part of exercising agency, because we must try to shape the environment and to carve out conditions which are most conducive for the survival and success of small states.\n\nI agree with Mr Yam that in this fraught geopolitical environment, the personal touch is still of paramount importance. Building relationships at a personal level between leaders\u2014political leaders\u2014is still the paramount currency of diplomacy. Last year, MFA facilitated over 180 visits, incoming and outgoing, at the political level. If you include officials and civil servants, the number balloons exponentially.\n\nBut the purpose of meeting, of traveling, is not just to show up, just to fly the flag, but to deepen the personal rapport and trust between leaders and officials and their foreign counterparts, particularly when the views are divergent. It won\u2019t resolve the conflict, but building reservoirs of trust and understanding reduces the probability of miscommunications and unnecessary conflicts.\n\nHaving said all that, I go one more layer of resolution down.\n\n### Singapore\u2019s strategic options as superpowers compete\n\n**Vivian Balakrishnan:** MFA has five priority workstreams. First, we want to engage all the great powers constructively, and we want to give them a stake in the stability and prosperity of our region, because that balance of power between great powers is what gives small states like Singapore room for maneuver and options.\n\nThe second workstream is to buttress an even wider network of middle-power partnerships for greater stability. I think in the last couple of years, the need for middle powers\u2014particularly middle powers who share an affinity for international law, multilateralism, free trade\u2014the imperative for middle powers to get together, and for us to engage the middle powers, has become all the more obvious.\n\nOur third workstream is to strengthen a stable and integrated ASEAN, not just because it\u2019s our immediate neighborhood, but because this happens to be a part of the world with great potential over the next couple of decades: in terms of economic growth, in terms of a rising middle class, in terms of technological leapfrogging, in terms of infrastructure and integration.\n\nFourth, obviously we do need to pay attention to our immediate neighbors. And by our immediate neighbors, it\u2019s Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei\u2014the core of our core. And fifth, take an overarching view: we need to do where we can what we can to reinforce a rules-based international architecture, despite the current headwinds.\n\nSo again, it\u2019s an example of not surrendering to our fates. Let me delve in a little bit more detail about the major powers.\n\n### Role of ASEAN and Singapore assuming chairmanship in 2027\n\n**Vivian Balakrishnan:** Starting with the US and China, Mr Edward Chia, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Shawn Huang, Ms Jessica Tan asked: how do we maintain trust with both the US and China whilst preserving Singapore\u2019s strategic options, even while the two superpowers are competing against each other in the realms of security, supply chain, technology, and trade? It\u2019s a tough question.\n\nWell, let me start with the US. We have a substantial, deep, and multifaceted relationship with the US. The US has long been, and continues to be, the largest foreign investor in Singapore by a long way. If you check the figures, you will see that it is multiple times more stock of FDI from the US than the second, third, fourth, and fifth investor, even if you add it up. We purchase US defense equipment, and we cooperate closely on countering terrorism and proliferation, and we are deepening our cooperation in critical and emerging technologies. This year, we celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties with the US.\n\nHaving said that, China is also a vital partner with whom we enjoy a robust and close relationship. Over most of the last 10 years, China has been our largest trading partner in goods. At the last Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, we concluded 27 agreements ranging from finance and innovation to food security and green energy. We marked 35 years of diplomatic relations last year.\n\nActually, if you stop to think about it beyond the numbers, we have a unique relationship with China. China and Singapore are the only two sovereign states in the world with a majority Chinese population, with deep linguistic, cultural, and historical links. This presents both opportunities and is also a burden for us, because Singapore is an independent multi-racial city-state in the heart of Southeast Asia. We have our own identity, our own political system, and our own values.\n\nActually, our value proposition even to China is to be \u201csame same but different,\u201d to quote Mr Lim. We say \u201csame same\u201d: yes, of course we enjoy the affinity, the linguistic, the shared cultural heritage, but different, because Singapore\u2019s destiny and our value proposition is to be distinct and not yet another small Chinese city. Do you see my point?\n\nSo therefore, we have to work with both the US and China where our interests coincide, and where our interests diverge, we will have to courteously stand up and say no. And where we say no, both sides must understand it\u2019s not personal, but it\u2019s based on a principled assessment of Singapore\u2019s national interest, and that we are not acting as a proxy for one or the other against them.\n\nSo long as we can maintain this\u2014and I speak now from experience\u2014in fact, so long as we maintain this principled approach, actually I feel that we come under less pressure, because they know this tiny little city-state is one where the more you push them, the more spine, and the more firmly they will hold their ground. And conducting foreign policy on this basis with superpowers, I\u2019m telling you from experience, I think this is the only way to do it.\n\nThe reality is that all countries, including Singapore, will have to find creative ways to work with both the US and China, because they are the major powers and they are relevant to our future.\n\nTurning to the middle powers, we are growing our network of partnerships with middle powers and with regional blocs. So, for instance, in 2025 we upgraded our partnerships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand, Vietnam. We achieved a new partnership with South Korea. We signed the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement. And we are deepening relations with more like-minded partners.\n\nWe are expanding our global footprint in Africa and Latin America. And to support this, we are establishing new missions in Mexico and Ethiopia. And actually, there will be more to come. And I want to reassure Mr Lee Hong Ann that all these moves in the diplomatic field are also aimed to increase access for our local enterprises to overseas markets.\n\n### The need to protect the global commons and support the multilateral system\n\n**Vivian Balakrishnan:** On ASEAN, I agree with Ms Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Valerie Lee that ASEAN has to remain the cornerstone of our foreign policy. It is a salient platform from which we engage the wider world.\n\nFor ASEAN to remain relevant, you have reminded us that we must deepen our regional integration in order to become more cohesive, more united, and credible. An integrated ASEAN builds a stable regional platform for Singapore and gives us a voice\u2014more so than a unilateral voice\u2014and also the convening power of ASEAN. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re also pushing very hard on key initiatives that bind our ASEAN economies closer together, as emphasized by Mr Yip Hon Weng and Ms Rachel Ong.\n\nWe are making progress on the ASEAN Power Grid. This is about creating a sustainable interconnected infrastructure that supports the entire region\u2019s growth. The ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement was substantially concluded last year. We hope to finalize the agreement this year. I believe it will unlock the immense potential of the digital economy in ASEAN in the years to come.\n\nBut we must also continue to look outwards. We should give all major powers a stake in the stability and prosperity of our region, and to ensure that ASEAN remains a partner of choice. This is the logic behind our open, inclusive, ASEAN-centered regional architecture. The more countries invest in ASEAN\u2019s collective progress, the more stable we will be. This balance of power and interest provides small countries like Singapore with more room for maneuver than an alternative scenario where there was only a single power dominating our region.\n\nMr Gerald Giam, Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Rachel Ong asked how we plan to leverage our upcoming ASEAN chairmanship to deepen integration and unity. We will assume the chair of ASEAN in 2027 during ASEAN\u2019s 60th anniversary. This is a heavy responsibility, but also an opportunity\u2014an opportunity at a time of turmoil. We will deepen integration. We will promote external partnerships. We will continue to keep the ASEAN region open for business, open to the world, committed to peace, stability, and cooperation.\n\nI would like to assure Mr Gerald Giam that we do in fact second officers to the ASEAN Secretariat, particularly at the leadership positions. We\u2019ve done so over the years, including the current Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, Mr Satvinder Singh. MFA will continue to curate and facilitate secondments for MFA and other public officers from other ministries to the ASEAN Secretariat and to other international organizations. This extends our experience and knowledge base of international diplomacy and tradecraft more widely across our civil service.\n\nLet me turn now to our neighbors closer to home. Strong relations with Malaysia, with Indonesia, and Brunei are critical. Mr Patrick Tay asked how we will step up our engagement with them. Mr Vikram Nair asked how we will strengthen economic coordination with our neighbors through city-based and regional partnerships, given the increasing cross-border activities of Singaporean companies and Singaporeans.\n\nWith Indonesia, we have resolved longstanding issues and are now in a position to explore mutually beneficial projects in energy, in food security, education, and healthcare. We\u2019re discussing cross-border electricity trade, carbon capture and storage, and establishing a sustainable industrial zone across the Batam-Bintan-Karimun corridor. These strategic projects will accelerate decarbonization, it will catalyze green investments in both countries, and we look forward to commemorating 60 years of diplomatic ties in 2027.\n\nWith Malaysia, our leaders meet regularly, both formally and informally, for candid discussions. This has allowed us to pursue beneficial regional partnerships, including the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. We are deepening economic and people-to-people ties with East Malaysia. In fact, we will be establishing new consulates, one in Sabah and one in Sarawak, shortly.\n\nBut at the same time, I will also be candid and tell you that we are trying to manage outstanding bilateral issues that are complex, that by definition have been around for a long time, and will take time to resolve. But the fact of the matter is Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei will always be close neighbors\u2014permanent neighbors\u2014and we cannot afford to allow spiky issues to undermine our overall positive cooperation on international organizations, norms, and standards.\n\nI agree with Ms Poa Ming Ling and Mr Lee Li Lian on the need to protect the global commons and to support multilateralism.\n\n### Foreign policy begins at home\n\n**Vivian Balakrishnan:** Despite the challenges, the rules-based multilateral system ultimately provides the architecture of norms, standards, and institutions that protects the global commons and gives all small states a say. So this means, in spite of the headwinds today, we must continue to try, do our best, to build overlapping, flexible circles of plurilateral partnerships with like-minded countries. Wherever we can make common cause, we do so and we proceed.\n\nWe remain fully committed to the World Trade Organization. But achieving consensus amongst 166 members is very difficult. Our strategy is to push the envelope with like-minded partners where we can, who share our commitment to free trade, and we aim for high-ambition agreements that are inclusive and WTO-consistent, so that others can join when ready. In other words: make common cause, move forward, invite other people to come on board, always stay open and inclusive.\n\nThe Joint Statement Initiative on e-commerce agreement began with Singapore, Australia, and Japan. It now has 72 co-sponsors. The Future of Investment and Trade Partnership brings together 16 small and medium-sized economies on supply chain resilience and trade facilitation. Do you see my point\u2014that these are examples where you start small, but you can build and expand these platforms beyond trade?\n\nWe have also built constituencies of support amongst fellow small states in the UN. The Forum of Small States, which Singapore co-founded, brings together 108 countries to address issues like sustainable development, climate change, protecting the global commons, and digitalization. Building consensus in a fractured world is difficult but not impossible. Ambassador Rena Lee presided over the conclusion of the BBNJ Agreement in 2023.\n\nWe will continue to contribute where we can, and our nomination of Ambassador Rena Lee as a candidate for judge in the International Court of Justice reflects our commitment to advancing the international rule of law.\n\nMr Neo has suggested leveraging technology as a soft power. Completely agree with you. We have in fact been stepping up technology cooperation in partnership with other countries. We work together with others, including at the G20 and APEC, to shape the norms and standards and, more importantly, open access to technology that can benefit all countries. We will continue to strengthen such engagements and ensure that Singapore remains an open and trusted hub for technological innovation and scientific collaboration.\n\nI tell my foreign counterparts, send your people to us. We will run an open-book exercise with you. We will show you how we do it, because anyway the challenge is not in the idea; the challenge is in execution. And to the extent that we can show people what we\u2019ve done, including our mistakes, and they can modify it and make it relevant to them, that\u2019s how we exercise thought leadership and cooperation in this field.\n\nLet me come to the challenges ahead. We\u2019re in a very turbulent world. We will face more inflection points, and we will have to take more difficult positions. Singaporeans will have different views on these foreign policy issues. Being interested, or as Eileen has said, literate in global issues, and understanding Singapore\u2019s national interest will help us engage the world with knowledge, understanding, and confidence.\n\nWe do not necessarily have to agree on all our foreign policy stances, but we must agree that these are matters to be discussed and decided by Singaporeans alone. And that means keeping a wary eye on foreign interference and influence. With increased global contestation, foreign actors will want us to align with their views. They will try to seed their narratives, and there will be attempts, as have occurred more recent times, to create fake news and to play on potential internal divisions.\n\nWe have already seen information campaigns targeting Singapore online, including, I must add, during our own general elections last year, where Singaporeans were urged to vote along religious lines. Government statements on regional developments have prompted criticisms from foreign citizens who want us to adopt their interpretations of history, and such attempts will continue. Geopolitical contestation has become a tussle for the hearts and minds in cyberspace as well.\n\nWe must be aware and we must exercise caution, because we have a diverse population, and never, never presume that we are immune to the polarization and fractures in societies elsewhere.\n\nSo where does this leave us? The world today is more dangerous, more unpredictable, than I\u2019ve ever seen in my decade-plus as Foreign Minister. The global order that used to underpin our success has ended, and we do not expect a stable new equilibrium to take shape in 2026, or even, frankly, even the next couple of years. And we must expect more issues on which we will have to take a difficult stand, and external and domestic pressures on us will grow.\n\nBut I also believe we should take heart. The challenges we face today are serious, but they are less severe than what Singapore faced in 1965. Singapore had unexpectedly become independent. We had no hinterland, no resources, no armed forces. Our security was precarious. Our economic viability was in doubt. Our social cohesion was yet to be forged. And we lived in a volatile and dangerous neighborhood that regarded us with suspicion. Despite all this, our pioneers pressed ahead and they built this country.\n\nThis is a narrative that connects Singapore over the decades. We may be small and improbable, but we have never been afraid to stand up to fight for what we believe in. Today, we are in a far, far better position in terms of tools and resources.\n\nWe have three prerequisites for success. The first is our domestic unity, although this is work always, constantly, in progress. As long as we understand that we are all in this together, as long as we can inoculate ourselves from foreign influence, as long as we can disagree maturely and ultimately still forge a domestic consensus, we will continue to thrive, and we cannot be bought or bullied by anyone.\n\nThe second ingredient is our economic vitality and relevance. Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, \u201cSingapore cannot take its relevance for granted. Small countries perform no vital or irreplaceable function in the international system. Hence, we must preserve our relevance to the world.\u201d In 1965, our per capita GDP was US$500. Today, it is over US$90,000.\n\nParadoxically, today\u2019s more fractious world accentuates Singapore\u2019s value as a trusted, stable hub. Our friends and partners know that we speak honestly and independently. They know that we are open and welcoming to all. They know that we honor our word. Contracts are sacrosanct. Investments and intellectual capital are protected. There is a premium in such a world for stability, consistency, and respect for the rule of law.\n\nThe third ingredient is our ability to defend ourselves. We can do that today because we have national service and because of the steady investment in defense for decades. We must preserve this capability because it keeps us safe, and we are a country that can hope for the best but also prepare for the worst.\n\nSo on this note, I thank all members for your long-standing support for MFA\u2019s work as we continue to navigate the challenges. We continue to safeguard Singapore\u2019s national interest, and we seize the opportunities in these troubled times.\n\nI began with Thucydides and the core logic of power. I\u2019ll end on a different note. The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus offered a different kind of wisdom: \u201cCharacter is destiny.\u201d For all the turbulence in the world, I believe Singapore\u2019s destiny is bright, not because of our size or our luck, but because of who we are\u2014that Singapore spirit: indomitable grit, courage, honesty, discipline, diligence, rectitude, and compassion. These are not mere abstractions. This is the Singapore spirit that got us here, and it is what will carry us forward."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"can_save":true,"model_slug":"gpt-5.2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5.2"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0860ffaa-30ae-4229-96dd-3fed41ddaa5d","children":[]}}}
