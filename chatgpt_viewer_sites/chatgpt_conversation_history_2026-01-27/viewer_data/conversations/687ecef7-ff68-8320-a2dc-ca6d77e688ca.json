Meena reflects on the activism she was raised with through her children's book \"Kamala and Maya's Big Idea,\" which tells the story of how Kamala and Maya turned an empty lot into a playground and aims to inspire activist girls, addressing the lack of representation in children's literature. For the Harris women, activism is a consistent practice taught through both words and actions, emphasizing community participation, self-agency, and collective responsibility. They stress the importance of instilling values of activism, responsibility, and the belief in one\u2019s power from a young age while maintaining optimism and perseverance in their goals.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1579630473.217,"attribution":"www.glamour.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_687ecf091ba88007a72fbe6c924f8dca","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"962e85927c1a5fbb-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"f9c6d04b-8b9f-46de-b9b7-0cc3423e1a04","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f9c6d04b-8b9f-46de-b9b7-0cc3423e1a04","children":["f202b748-d255-4991-bd2d-36bc9fa698a2"]},"f202b748-d255-4991-bd2d-36bc9fa698a2":{"id":"f202b748-d255-4991-bd2d-36bc9fa698a2","message":{"id":"f202b748-d255-4991-bd2d-36bc9fa698a2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1753141004.059719,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for a couple of seconds"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":1,"request_id":"962e85927c1a5fbb-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"e4c5a289-cccd-451f-99ee-36ec38be1728","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e4c5a289-cccd-451f-99ee-36ec38be1728","children":["c27286df-0b5d-4b11-b227-27db6dec0bad"]},"c27286df-0b5d-4b11-b227-27db6dec0bad":{"id":"c27286df-0b5d-4b11-b227-27db6dec0bad","message":{"id":"c27286df-0b5d-4b11-b227-27db6dec0bad","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web","sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1753141002.092333,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["A moving, recent variation that\u2019s been circulating online goes:\n\n> **\u201cBless the daughters who sat carrying the trauma of mothers.

Instead of breaking under this weight, they found inner resilience, \u201ccarried themselves to light,\u201d and essentially \u201craised themselves.\u201d It\u2019s both an elegy for what was lost and a tribute to what was won: self-reliance and emotional survival \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.\n\n- **Why It Resonates**  \n  Readers, especially those who\u2019ve experienced fractured mother-daughter relationships or emotional neglect, find in these lines a voice that acknowledges their struggle and validates their journey. The haunting beauty of recognition\u2014of bearing pain without permission, of healing without external help\u2014strikes a chord with many.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf In Short\n\n- **Author**: Ijeoma Umebinyuo  \n- **Source**: _Questions for Ada_ (poetry collection)  \n- **Meaning**: A blessing and acknowledgment for women who, lacking maternal nurture, carried generational trauma and yet found their own way to healing and self-upbringing.\n\nIf you're interested, I can help locate the complete poem or further explore Umebinyuo's work or similar themes.
