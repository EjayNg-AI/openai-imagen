The update, called \u201cAbout This Account,\u201d allows users to see where the account was created, where it\u2019s based, and if the username has been changed. Now, after the feature was rolled out this weekend, X users found many conservative and MAGA-associated accounts with tens of thousands of followers turned out to be based in other countries. So, let\u2019s bring in CBS News contributor Chris Krebs. He\u2019s also the former head of the federal government\u2019s cybersecurity agency, CISA. Good to see you, my friend.  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** Good to see you.  \n\n**Host:** So, in theory, this seems like a good idea for transparency, but has it backfired?  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** I don\u2019t think so. I think this is actually a feature rollout that X deserves a lot of credit for. It\u2019s providing transparency to users. Now, whether they actually take advantage of this feature is a different story, but nonetheless it is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things\u2014what\u2019s the latest event. As we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, there has been a rightward shift of the platform, and I think what we\u2019re really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of the MAGA movement in the moment.  \n\n\n### Foreign-Based Accounts, Monetization, and the Rage Economy\n\n**Host:** So there are two things that I was thinking about when I saw the story that you sent to me yesterday, which is that on one hand you have the economics of it, right, that there is this monetization policy at X that allows people based in Nigeria and Moldova and Nepal, or wherever the people are basing their accounts, to create these accounts that appear to be adjacent to\u2014in this case we\u2019re talking about\u2014the conservative or MAGA movement, and they have no ideology whatsoever. They\u2019re just in it for the dollars and cents. And on the other hand, you\u2019ve got a gullible public\u2014and maybe \u201cgullible\u201d is not the right word\u2014but you have people that are willing to sort of believe anything, even though when you look at some of these accounts, you say, \u201cThese can\u2019t be real people. These can\u2019t be people that actually believe these things.\u201d How does that make you feel as somebody who is responsible for cybersecurity?  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** Look, it has been a longtime concern of mine, this demand for rage-inducing content, kind of activating the fight-or-flight mechanism in the brain. That has been something that we\u2019ve seen foreign actors, whether it\u2019s security services or just grifters, target and take advantage of for years now. So again, I think X deserves some credit for shining a light to kind of expose some of these movements. I suspect you\u2019ll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence and not necessarily be deplatformed, but give a more informed public. And whether people are gullible, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. Again, I think people just want to see more of the stuff that resonates with what their worldview is. And we talk about this\u2014I just dropped a MasterClass.  \n\n**Host:** Yes.  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** On cyber warfare. But this is one of those things where the information that\u2019s readily available on the internet, folks need to take a second, take nine seconds even, and look at what\u2019s being presented to you and why, and you\u2019re going to be much better off financially as well as, I think, mental-health-wise too.  \n\n\n### X\u2019s Motives and Efforts to Increase Transparency\n\n**Host:** So, why do you think X did it? I mean, I know we\u2019re talking about transparency, but if it means that they will perhaps lose some people who have outsized influence on the app and thus provide\u2014for Elon Musk, it\u2019s about, you know, density and mass of the users\u2014why would you do this?  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** Well, over the last year or so they have taken a number of steps to increase the transparency on the platform and reduce the prevalence of bots and scammers and grifters. So what we\u2019re seeing is, there\u2019s verification of anyone that makes money on the platform. You have to give them a credit card, you have to verify your identity. So they already had this information; it wasn\u2019t a new feature they necessarily had to technically develop the capability for. It was more, \u201cHey, we know where these accounts are based, and we\u2019re going to show you.\u201d And I think there is some concern at X about how the platform may be abused, again, not necessarily by foreign security services or intelligence, but by grifters. So the head of product, Nikita, promised this was happening, he rolled it out, and I think it\u2019s been pretty successful.  \n\n\n### Foreign Players, Future Elections, and the Cat-and-Mouse Game\n\n**Host:** Yeah. I read a reporter for The Free Press put out an article where he said, after seeing this, he\u2019s like the only American on X, right, because so many of these accounts are from foreign players. And we looked at some of these accounts that have already been disabled, but should we be concerned about others that pop up?  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** Look, I mean, I think this is going to be something that the platform deals with, that X and the team, the trust and safety team there, deals with for the next several years. And any time that you have these heightened political moments\u2014the \u201926 midterms are always going to be pulling in more foreign activity, domestic activity\u2014and then \u201928, forget about it, the Super Bowl of elections is going to make it even that much more important. So I think it\u2019s going to be a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, as it always is in cybersecurity.  \n\n\n### Cyber Warfare MasterClass and Personal Protection Online\n\n**Host:** So before we go, in 20 seconds, you\u2019ve got a new MasterClass. What do folks learn from somebody like you, who knows about how to protect yourself online?  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** Yeah, I\u2019m super excited. It drops today on the MasterClass platform. It\u2019s called \u201cCyber Warfare: The Front Line Is You.\u201d So what we do is introduce folks to here\u2019s what\u2019s going on big picture, but here are a couple of tips that you can take to secure yourself, your identity, your finances. What a better time, too, with Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the holiday season ramping up. So it\u2019s a great gift for you, for your family, colleagues.  \n\n**Host:** Love it. Mom, I got you sorted, because I think you need this more than anybody. Chris, good to see you, my friend.  \n\n**Chris Krebs:** Thank you, appreciate it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"d9edb510-3c6b-43aa-a61e-9d6314e9a8c9","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"e2fd3e14-c476-4add-8693-fba11904c66c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"18b3d0bd-dacb-4945-8df4-2be3777b3a1c","children":["bb7b046d-1fd7-47d3-804b-1bd0acb5e874"]},"bb7b046d-1fd7-47d3-804b-1bd0acb5e874":{"id":"bb7b046d-1fd7-47d3-804b-1bd0acb5e874","message":{"id":"bb7b046d-1fd7-47d3-804b-1bd0acb5e874","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764212438.7167711,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"d9edb510-3c6b-43aa-a61e-9d6314e9a8c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"8b27094d-4107-4e17-a16a-4ac47b6df081","turn_exchange_id":"e2fd3e14-c476-4add-8693-fba11904c66c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8b27094d-4107-4e17-a16a-4ac47b6df081","children":["0756a931-c0d3-4496-9f9f-7d562626cd9e"]},"0756a931-c0d3-4496-9f9f-7d562626cd9e":{"id":"0756a931-c0d3-4496-9f9f-7d562626cd9e","message":{"id":"0756a931-c0d3-4496-9f9f-7d562626cd9e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764212439.0167646,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"d9edb510-3c6b-43aa-a61e-9d6314e9a8c9","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"bb7b046d-1fd7-47d3-804b-1bd0acb5e874","turn_exchange_id":"e2fd3e14-c476-4add-8693-fba11904c66c"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bb7b046d-1fd7-47d3-804b-1bd0acb5e874","children":["24d84b91-1ec4-4a8d-aff0-ca0a1c45ba65"]},"24d84b91-1ec4-4a8d-aff0-ca0a1c45ba65":{"id":"24d84b91-1ec4-4a8d-aff0-ca0a1c45ba65","message":{"id":"24d84b91-1ec4-4a8d-aff0-ca0a1c45ba65","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764212439.816637,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing X\u2019s new feature and related issues","content":"The user's request involves analyzing X's new transparency feature and its implications, particularly in relation to foreign monetized accounts, the rage economy, the gullible public, and influences on elections.

The rollout exposed surprising results: several pro-MAGA accounts, claiming to represent American voices, were actually based in countries like Bangladesh and Thailand, sparking scrutiny and memes online.\n\nBier clarified that location updates would occur randomly and with delays to protect privacy, and certain verified government accounts would not display locations to mitigate security risks.

The \"About This Account\" tool discloses whether an account is based in a specific country or broader region, with privacy options allowing users in restrictive countries to generalize their location. After its release, researchers found that many high-profile, pro-Trump accounts \u2014 such as @TRUMP_ARMY- and @MAGANationX \u2014 were operated from regions like South Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, despite projecting American identities with U.S. flags and political slogans.\n\nNewsGuard, an online misinformation watchdog, identified these accounts as spreaders of misleading content, including claims about the 2024 presidential debate. Some users attempted to discredit the tool by sharing fake screenshots with incorrect location data. Experts noted that while the feature increases transparency, bad actors may eventually find ways around it, such as using VPNs. The motivation behind many of the accounts appears to be financial rather than political.

The feature, intended to enhance transparency by showing the country where an account was created and where it is currently based, was found to contain several inaccuracies. Following user complaints, X removed the \"account creation location\" due to unreliable data, particularly for older accounts. Head of Product Nikita Bier acknowledged issues with the rollout and pledged fixes by Tuesday.\n\nDespite the flaws, some users exploited the feature to launch politically charged accusations, often labeling opposing accounts as foreign operatives or part of disinformation campaigns, even while acknowledging inaccuracies in their own data. Several high-profile accounts displayed incorrect locations, likely due to factors like VPN usage, old IP addresses, or global staffing.\n\nWhile genuine foreign influence campaigns and politically-driven troll farms do exist, much of the current reaction on X is fueled by political point-scoring and attempts to profit from platform engagement. The incident underscores how misinformation and flawed implementations can quickly escalate into chaos in today\u2019s digital world.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1763924141.0,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/rightwing-influencers-outside-us-x-twitter-tool","title":"Many prominent Maga personalities on X are based outside US, new tool reveals","snippet":"A new transparency feature on X (formerly Twitter), called \"about this account\", has revealed that many influential \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (MAGA) and rightwing users are operating from outside the United States, in countries such as Russia, Nigeria, India, Thailand, and other parts of Eastern Europe and South Asia. The tool allows users to view account details like geographic location and account history. These revelations have led to significant online reactions, especially from liberal voices who have long suspected foreign interference in MAGA discourse. Some controversial accounts, including MAGANationX and IvankaNews, were found to be run from abroad despite presenting themselves as American patriots. There are also concerns about the use of VPNs to disguise account locations. The exposure has reinvigorated discussions about misinformation and foreign influence on social media, particularly since Elon Musk\u2019s 2022 acquisition of the platform. Users across X and Reddit have rallied to investigate further, raising alarms over the platform's role in amplifying misleading content via bots and foreign-controlled accounts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1763921840.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"theweek.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://theweek.com/tech/x-update-foreign-maga-boosters","title":"X update unveils foreign MAGA boosters","snippet":"Over the weekend, Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) introduced a new \"about this account\" feature that reveals the country location of user accounts. This update quickly drew attention as users discovered that many accounts engaging in U.S. political discourse\u2014especially those promoting pro-MAGA content\u2014were actually based outside the United States, including in Russia, Nigeria, India, and Southeast Asia. This revelation sparked a flurry of reactions, with liberal influencers like Harry Sisson calling it a major breakthrough in identifying foreign online influence.\n\nThe platform's head of product, Nikita Bier, emphasized the update\u2019s goal of promoting transparency and authenticity. While some right-wing users pointed out that certain liberal accounts are also misleading about their identity, the broader issue highlighted by this update is the extent of X\u2019s global troll and fake account problem. These accounts may be linked to both state-sponsored disinformation campaigns and individual content creators who profit from inciting political division. In lower-income countries, the platform's revenue-sharing incentives can be significant, encouraging foreign users to engage in U.S. political content.\n\nX acknowledged that the feature could be circumvented using VPNs, and promised technical refinements in the coming days.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1764000352.0,"attribution":"theweek.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.cbsnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/x-foreign-origins-political-accounts/","title":"X's new feature reveals foreign origins of some popular ...","snippet":"1 day ago \u2014 Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1764115740.0,"attribution":"www.cbsnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"help.x.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/verification-policy","title":"ID Verification Policy & Privacy","snippet":"February 2025.

What the segment is actually doing\n\nAt a surface level, this is:\n\n- A news explainer about X\u2019s new **\u201cAbout This Account\u201d** feature, which shows:\n  - the account\u2019s country/region,\n  - creation date,\n  - username change history,\n  - and app-store linkage. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- A narrative that **links the feature to foreign-run, pro\u2013\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (MAGA)** accounts with large followings.\n- A platform-sympathetic cyber expert (Chris Krebs, former head of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA) framing the change as a **net positive transparency measure**.\n- A soft promo for his **MasterClass on \u201ccyber warfare\u201d** at the end.\n\nStructurally, it\u2019s classic morning-show content: light adversariality, clear hero/villain framing (transparency vs. foreign \u201cgrifters\u201d), then a personal brand plug.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Real-world context: what this feature is and why it blew up\n\nOutside the transcript, here\u2019s what\u2019s actually going on:\n\n- X rolled out **\u201cAbout This Account\u201d** around 21\u201323 November 2025. It shows the country/region where an account is \u201cbased,\u201d inferred from IP data, plus some account history info. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search12\ue201  \n- Almost instantly, people noticed that many **high-engagement, pro-MAGA accounts that present as American patriots are actually run from countries like Bangladesh, Nigeria, India, Russia, and parts of Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news28\ue202turn0news30\ue202turn0news31\ue201  \n- This matched what the segment says, but:\n  - It also triggered **privacy and safety concerns** (e.g. people in authoritarian regimes suddenly having their location inferred), and\n  - The rollout was **buggy** \u2013 \u201ccreation location\u201d was unreliable and had to be pulled; location data was sometimes wrong, likely due to Virtual Private Network (VPN) usage, travel, old IPs, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news27\ue202turn0news29\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n\nThe CBS segment largely **filters out** those implementation and privacy problems and focuses almost entirely on **foreign pro-MAGA grifters** and the \u201crage economy.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core framing and assumptions in the transcript\n\n### 3.1. \u201cX deserves a lot of credit\u201d\n\nKrebs repeats the line that **X deserves credit** multiple times. The framing is:\n\n- X already had monetization KYC-ish data (credit cards, identity checks) for paid creators.\n- They simply decided to **surface some of that to users** for transparency.\n- This is presented as an **anti-grift, pro-user move**, not a PR maneuver or a response to external regulatory pressure.\n\nWhat\u2019s *implicitly* assumed but not interrogated:\n\n- That X is **primarily motivated** by integrity rather than:\n  - reputational damage control,\n  - regulatory scrutiny in the U.S./EU over disinformation,\n  - advertiser pressure to demonstrate \u201cbrand safety.\u201d  \n  (All of which have been themes in coverage of X over the last two years.)\n\nThe segment largely takes X\u2019s stated motives at face value.\n\n### 3.2. Foreignness + MAGA + money\n\nThe narrative tightly couples three things:\n\n1. **Foreign location** of accounts,  \n2. **MAGA / conservative branding**,  \n3. **Monetization motives** (not ideology).\n\nKrebs and the host repeatedly emphasize:\n\n- These operators \u201chave no ideology whatsoever. They\u2019re just in it for the dollars and cents.\u201d\n- They are **exploiting** the U.S. right-wing information ecosystem to farm rage for money.\n\nExternal reporting does back up the **profit-driven angle**: in low-income countries, even modest X payouts can be meaningful, which incentivizes content farms to lean into U.S. culture-war politics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news31\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n\nBut the segment **does not** explore:\n\n- Whether similar foreign-run farms exist targeting **left-leaning audiences** (they do, just with less viral coverage).\n- The continuum from:\n  - purely profit-seeking troll farms,\n  - to loosely ideological actors,\n  - to **state-aligned or state-run influence operations**.\n\nEverything is collapsed under the label \u201cgrifters,\u201d which is incomplete but narratively clean.\n\n### 3.3. Users: \u201cgullible\u201d vs confirmation bias\n\nThe host toys with \u201cgullible public,\u201d then half-walks it back. Krebs reframes:\n\n- The problem isn\u2019t innate gullibility, it\u2019s **demand for content that confirms one\u2019s worldview**.\n- That\u2019s essentially an informal nod to **confirmation bias** and **affective polarization**.\n\nThat\u2019s a reasonably fair description: outrage isn\u2019t being \u201cdone to\u201d a passive population; there is strong **demand-side pull** for rage-inducing content. The segment gets this right, albeit briefly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The \u201crage economy\u201d and platform incentives\n\nKrebs\u2019 strongest contribution is the phrase **\u201crage economy\u201d** \u2013 platforms and creators profit by triggering **fight-or-flight responses** (outrage, fear, indignation) because:\n\n- Engagement \u2192 more time on platform \u2192 more ad views or subscription value.\n- X in particular now shares revenue directly with high-engagement accounts, intensifying the incentive to maximize **rage per tweet**.\n\nThe big missing piece in the segment:\n\n> The feature **does not change** the engagement-maximizing ranking algorithms that *create* the rage economy.\n\nInstead, it adds a **small transparency overlay**:\n\n- You *can* click and see that an account is based in, say, Lagos or Dhaka.\n- But the algorithm may still happily boost that content if it drives replies, quote-tweets, and time-on-site.\n\nSo structurally, this is:\n\n> \u201cSmall friction for the most egregious deceivers, while the core incentive structure remains untouched.\u201d\n\nThe segment doesn\u2019t question that asymmetry.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How fair is the \u201cX deserves credit\u201d line?\n\nFrom a security / information-integrity perspective, **surfacing account location is non-trivial useful**:\n\n- It **helps journalists, researchers, and moderately savvy users** distinguish:\n  - apparently \u201cgrassroots\u201d U.S. accounts that are actually foreign,\n  - sockpuppet networks that reuse identity tropes (\u201cUS flag + \u2018Patriot\u2019 + Trump avatar,\u201d etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news28\ue202turn0news30\ue201  \n- It raises the **cost** (slightly) of running large-scale deceptive networks without any transparency.\n\nBut given the rollout:\n\n- **Accuracy issues** were significant enough that X removed the \u201ccreation location\u201d field and acknowledged problems. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news29\ue202turn0search26\ue201  \n- Users in **authoritarian or high-risk environments** have raised serious concerns that this is effectively **forced location disclosure** (you can generalize to \u201cregion,\u201d but can\u2019t fully switch it off if your account is public). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news27\ue202turn0search25\ue201  \n\nSo if you zoom out:\n\n- **Krebs is directionally right** that this is a transparency-enhancing feature.\n- But the segment **over-indexes on the upside** and barely mentions:\n  - privacy/safety risks,\n  - the messy, chaotic rollout,\n  - and the potential for mis-labeling to be weaponized (\u201clook, you\u2019re foreign, therefore a spy\u201d) even when the data is wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s an **unbalanced** but not absurdly misleading portrayal.\n\n---\n\n## 6. X\u2019s motives: what\u2019s said vs what\u2019s left unsaid\n\nThe transcript\u2019s story:\n\n- X has been \u201ctaking steps\u201d to fight bots, scammers, and grifters.\n- Monetization requires identity verification and a credit card.\n- This feature is an extension of that integrity work.\n\nMissing angles:\n\n- **Regulatory pressure**: X has been under scrutiny from EU regulators and national authorities over disinformation, data handling, and content moderation; transparency features are a way to signal \u201cresponsible platform,\u201d especially when ad revenue and institutional trust have taken hits. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search21\ue201  \n- **Reputational math**: exposing foreign MAGA accounts simultaneously:\n  - **validates critics\u2019 concerns** about foreign manipulation of U.S. right-wing discourse, and\n  - lets X say, \u201cWe\u2019re the ones cleaning it up,\u201d without fundamentally changing the engagement model.\n- **Internal politics**: after years of stories about bots and fake engagement, particularly around crypto, NFTs, and political spam, X has to be seen doing *something* structural, not just banning a few accounts ad hoc.\n\nThe CBS segment doesn\u2019t interrogate any of this; it treats X as a mostly benevolent actor making the obvious good move.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Election security and the cat-and-mouse dynamic\n\nKrebs\u2019 prediction that this will be a **cat-and-mouse game** around the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election is almost certainly correct:\n\n- We have a decade of evidence that **foreign and domestic political actors adapt very quickly** to platform rule changes.\n- For \u201cAbout This Account,\u201d adaptation paths are straightforward:\n  - use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to shift apparent location,\n  - use U.S.-based \u201cfront\u201d operators who manage farms abroad,\n  - rotate accounts more frequently to avoid scrutiny.\n\nSo realistically, this feature is:\n\n- **Good for surfacing the lazier and greedier networks** right now.\n- Of **limited long-term value** against more sophisticated state-aligned operations who can afford cleaner infrastructure.\n\nThe segment gets the **\u201congoing struggle\u201d** part right, but (again) doesn\u2019t emphasize how easily this can be routed around.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Media literacy: what a cautious user should take away\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to use this responsibly:\n\n1. **Treat location as a signal, not a verdict.**  \n   - A foreign-based account posting about U.S. politics is **not automatically malicious**; diaspora and global observers exist.  \n   - A U.S.-based account is **not automatically trustworthy**; domestic disinfo is very much a thing.\n2. **Look for *patterns*, not one-off anomalies.**  \n   - Large clusters of \u201cpatriot\u201d accounts with generic avatars, repetitive slogans, and near-identical posting patterns *all based in a handful of foreign countries* is a strong indicator of a farm.\n3. **Remember privacy and error issues.**  \n   - VPNs, corporate networks, and travel can all mislead the system. An obviously wrong location doesn\u2019t mean the tool is useless, but it does mean you shouldn\u2019t treat it as ground truth.\n4. **Don\u2019t confuse feature-level fixes with system-level reform.**  \n   - The underlying **engagement-based ranking** that rewards rage is untouched. This is a diagnostic layer, not a cure.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Overall assessment of the segment\n\nIf you strip it down:\n\n- **Strengths**\n  - Brings a genuinely important feature to public attention.\n  - Highlights **economic incentives** and **user-side demand** for outrage (not just \u201cbad foreigners\u201d pushing poison into an innocent public).\n  - Warns, correctly, that this will be an ongoing fight, not a one-and-done patch.\n\n- **Weaknesses**\n  - **Overly positive about X\u2019s role**, with minimal scrutiny of:\n    - the messy rollout,\n    - privacy implications,\n    - and platform business incentives.\n  - Frames the problem narrowly as **foreign, MAGA-branded grift**, underplaying:\n    - broader cross-ideological manipulation,\n    - domestic astroturf.\n  - Ends with a somewhat jarring pivot into a **commercial plug** for Krebs\u2019 MasterClass, which blurs the line between neutral expert commentary and personal marketing.\n\nNet: it\u2019s a decent **entry-level explainer** for casual viewers, but **analytically shallow and skewed toward a flattering narrative of X** as a responsible steward.\n\n---\n\n\ue200navlist\ue202Further reporting on X\u2019s \u201cAbout This Account\u201d feature\ue202turn0news28,turn0news27,turn0news29,turn0news30,turn0news31\ue201"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search12\ue201","start_idx":304,"end_idx":337,"safe_urls":["https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/x-begins-rolling-out-the-about-this-account-feature-to-users-profiles/","https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/x-begins-rolling-out-the-about-this-account-feature-to-users-profiles/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-rolls-out-about-this-account-feature-that-displays-a-profiles-country-of-origin-and-more-160617187.html","https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-rolls-out-about-this-account-feature-that-displays-a-profiles-country-of-origin-and-more-160617187.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-rolls-out-about-this-account-feature-that-displays-a-profiles-country-of-origin-and-more-160617187.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"X rolls out 'About this account' feature that displays a ...","url":"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-rolls-out-about-this-account-feature-that-displays-a-profiles-country-of-origin-and-more-160617187.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"4 days ago \u2014 X's new About this account feature will show a user's country, the times the username has been changed, and how they're connected.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"X begins rolling out the 'About this account' feature to users' ...","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/x-begins-rolling-out-the-about-this-account-feature-to-users-profiles/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"5 days ago \u2014 In the days since, more people have seen the \u201cAbout this account\u201d feature become available on their own profiles.

After its release, researchers found that many high-profile, pro-Trump accounts \u2014 such as @TRUMP_ARMY- and @MAGANationX \u2014 were operated from regions like South Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, despite projecting American identities with U.S. flags and political slogans.\n\nNewsGuard, an online misinformation watchdog, identified these accounts as spreaders of misleading content, including claims about the 2024 presidential debate.

These revelations have led to significant online reactions, especially from liberal voices who have long suspected foreign interference in MAGA discourse.

The \"About This Account\" tool discloses whether an account is based in a specific country or broader region, with privacy options allowing users in restrictive countries to generalize their location. After its release, researchers found that many high-profile, pro-Trump accounts \u2014 such as @TRUMP_ARMY- and @MAGANationX \u2014 were operated from regions like South Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, despite projecting American identities with U.S. flags and political slogans.\n\nNewsGuard, an online misinformation watchdog, identified these accounts as spreaders of misleading content, including claims about the 2024 presidential debate. Some users attempted to discredit the tool by sharing fake screenshots with incorrect location data. Experts noted that while the feature increases transparency, bad actors may eventually find ways around it, such as using VPNs.

The tool allows users to view account details like geographic location and account history. These revelations have led to significant online reactions, especially from liberal voices who have long suspected foreign interference in MAGA discourse. Some controversial accounts, including MAGANationX and IvankaNews, were found to be run from abroad despite presenting themselves as American patriots. There are also concerns about the use of VPNs to disguise account locations. The exposure has reinvigorated discussions about misinformation and foreign influence on social media, particularly since Elon Musk\u2019s 2022 acquisition of the platform. Users across X and Reddit have rallied to investigate further, raising alarms over the platform's role in amplifying misleading content via bots and foreign-controlled accounts.","attribution":"The Guardian"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"AP News"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0news29\ue202turn0search26\ue201","start_idx":6312,"end_idx":6344,"safe_urls":["https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/xs-about-this-account-feature-shows-many-maga-accounts-operate-from-outside-the-us/articleshow/125534553.cms","https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/xs-about-this-account-feature-shows-many-maga-accounts-operate-from-outside-the-us/articleshow/125534553.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theverge.com/news/827279/xs-messy-about-this-account-rollout-has-caused-utter-chaos","https://www.theverge.com/news/827279/xs-messy-about-this-account-rollout-has-caused-utter-chaos?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/827279/xs-messy-about-this-account-rollout-has-caused-utter-chaos?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"X's messy About This Account rollout has caused utter chaos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/827279/xs-messy-about-this-account-rollout-has-caused-utter-chaos?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1763924141.0,"snippet":"X\u2019s new \"About This Account\" feature rollout has sparked considerable confusion and controversy.
