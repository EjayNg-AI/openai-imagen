Its key consideration in doing so is that such a move should help the progress towards peace and a negotiated two-state solution, he added.\n\n\u201cIn particular, there will need to be an effective Palestinian government that accepts Israel\u2019s right to exist and categorically rejects terrorism,\u201d Dr Balakrishnan said. \u201cBoth sides have legitimate rights, and both peoples have a right to live in peace and dignity within secure borders.\u201d\n\nHe was responding to questions on Singapore\u2019s May 10 decision to vote for a United Nations (UN) resolution backing the admission of Palestine as a member of the world body, which it said was made after \u201cserious and careful consideration\u201d.\n\nPAP MPs Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) and Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang GRC), along with Workers\u2019 Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) and Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai, had subsequently filed parliamentary questions to ask about Singapore\u2019s considerations for officially recognising Palestine as a state.\n\nIn his response, Dr Balakrishnan urged both sides to seize the moment to take steps towards a long-lasting peace and put an end to the suffering that has \u201cgone on for too long\u201d.\n\n\u201cUltimately, Israelis and Palestinians would need to exercise leadership and would have to work together to forge a better future for their peoples. As Singapore is a friend to both, Singapore will continue to offer our encouragement and our tangible support to both Palestinians and Israelis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister also reiterated the principles guiding Singapore\u2019s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He noted that Singapore has consistently advocated a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, as a way for Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in peace and security.\n\n\u201cThis is the only viable path for achieving a comprehensive, a just, and a durable solution to this conflict,\u201d Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\nMr Giam asked about the thresholds that need to be crossed for Singapore to recognise the state of Palestine, to which Dr Balakrishnan said it depends on whether there is an effective Palestinian government or leadership that represents all Palestinians.\n\nThis authority should have effective control over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the mandate and authority to negotiate with the Israelis on behalf of the Palestinians, he said.\n\n\u201cSo I would say that we are not going to lock ourselves in to a specific time, or to whether or not other countries have made decisions in parallel on the same fundamental question,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Balakrishnan said that Singapore has consistently supported the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland.\n\nIn 1988, the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) issued a proclamation on the State of Palestine which affirmed the UN\u2019s partition of the Mandate of Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish State, as well as the PLO\u2019s decision to renounce violence against Israel.\n\nSingapore welcomed this proclamation because the PLO explicitly rejected terrorism and recognised the right of Israel as a state to exist, Dr Balakrishnan said, adding that Singapore saw these moves as progress towards a durable solution.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, a UN Security Council resolution that recommended that Palestine be admitted to membership in the United Nations was vetoed. On May 10, the General Assembly took up a resolution expressing support for Palestine\u2019s membership in the UN and recommending that the Security Council reconsider this matter favourably.\n\nSingapore had voted in favour this resolution. The vote in the UN General Assembly was supported by 143 members and opposed by nine \u2013 including the United States and Israel \u2013 while 25 members abstained.\n\n\u201cSingapore voted in favour of this resolution after very careful consideration, and this reflected our hope to encourage both Israel and Palestine to resume direct negotiations towards a two-state solution, at a time when in fact, the prospects for such negotiations were increasingly bleak,\u201d said Dr Balakrishnan.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe therefore decided to join the majority of the international community in supporting this resolution, which is also in line with our longstanding support for the principles of international law, and for the implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions.\u201d\n\nMr Giam and fellow Workers\u2019 Party MP Faisal Manap (Aljunied GRC) had also asked about Singapore\u2019s plans to provide technical assistance to Palestinian officials and help them with reconstruction efforts after the conflict.\n\nDr Balakrishan said Singapore will continue its engagement with the Palestinian Authority (PA). Singapore continues to implement its S$10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP) to help the PA build capacity and prepare for eventual statehood.\n\nIn 2013, then-Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Masagos Zulkifli presented an ETAP worth S$5 million to then-Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. The package was part of Singapore\u2019s ongoing commitment to support the PA\u2019s capacity building and development needs.\n\nUnder the ETAP, PA officials are provided sponsorship to participate in study visits to Singapore and capacity-building courses under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). It also offers scholarships for PA officials to pursue postgraduate studies at Singapore universities.\n\nIn 2016, then-PM Lee Hsien Loong announced the doubling of the pledge amount of the previous package from S$5 million to S$10 million, with a focus on skills-building.\n\nTo date, Singapore has trained more than 750 officials in areas like diplomacy, water management, economic development, and urban planning - important areas that any government will need expertise in, Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\nDuring his visit to Ramallah in March 2024, the PA\u2019s Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa expressed appreciation for Singapore\u2019s technical assistance and sought further capacity-building support in civil service training and digitalisation, he added.\n\nAs a follow-up, a course on transforming the public service using artificial intelligence will be organised for PA officials from July 8 to 12.\n\nUnder the ETAP, Singapore has disbursed 13 postgraduate scholarships to Palestinian officials to pursue postgraduate studies in various areas, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), international relations and computing at the Nanyang Technological University and the National University of Singapore.\n\nThree Palestinian officials have been awarded scholarships this year, in accountancy, international political economy, and info-communications security.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these training opportunities will help PA officials better serve the Palestinian people, as well as equip them with the necessary skills when it comes to the eventual reconstruction of Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the question of helping Palestinian officials with the reconstruction of Gaza, Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore will assess how best it can assist bilaterally and as part of multilateral efforts, and that he remains in close touch with his counterparts in the region on this issue.\n\nHe shared that Singapore participated in a conference co-hosted by King Abdullah II of Jordan, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on June 11, 2024 to discuss the humanitarian response to Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to contribute, taking into account Gaza\u2019s needs and into account of our own resources and expertise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut clearly, all this can only take effect when the fighting ceases.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, the focus has to be on securing an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all the hostages immediately.\u201d\n\nMr Zhulkarnain then asked about further support that Singapore might provide once it recognises Palestine as a state.\n\nSingapore intends to continue all its assistance packages and look for opportunities to do more, Dr Balakrishnan replied. \u201cAnd quite frankly, the level of support that we provide to the PA will not depend upon whether or not there is formal recognition or not.\u201d\n\nMr Leong also asked whether Singapore has made any defence sales to Israel, such as weapons that can cause any harm to civilians, since Oct 7, 2023. This was the date of the attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nIn response, Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore complies strictly with its international obligations on international arms sales, as well as UN sanctions and embargoes against any country, including submitting regular reports to the UN Register of Conventional Arms.\n\n\u201cApart from this, it is the established policy of the Government not to publicly divulge any details of defence sales for national security reasons.\u201d"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"89ccfa480d610197-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ef77a868-af76-4311-bad1-c5dce0f5510d","children":["74916683-79da-43c8-8b73-ac95779cd52c"]},"74916683-79da-43c8-8b73-ac95779cd52c":{"id":"74916683-79da-43c8-8b73-ac95779cd52c","message":{"id":"74916683-79da-43c8-8b73-ac95779cd52c","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719905943.423673,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa20948-8357-478b-be81-87fcc738849b","request_id":"89ccfa480d610197-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa20948-8357-478b-be81-87fcc738849b","children":["7f16e491-f632-4629-a043-11b0603f32a7"]},"7f16e491-f632-4629-a043-11b0603f32a7":{"id":"7f16e491-f632-4629-a043-11b0603f32a7","message":{"id":"7f16e491-f632-4629-a043-11b0603f32a7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719905943.423778,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"74916683-79da-43c8-8b73-ac95779cd52c","request_id":"89ccfa480d610197-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"74916683-79da-43c8-8b73-ac95779cd52c","children":["5f13cbd4-2b4a-495c-b285-d9f29154b629"]},"5f13cbd4-2b4a-495c-b285-d9f29154b629":{"id":"5f13cbd4-2b4a-495c-b285-d9f29154b629","message":{"id":"5f13cbd4-2b4a-495c-b285-d9f29154b629","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719905943.423877,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Singapore's decision to potentially recognize Palestine as a state has several political implications, both domestically and internationally:\n\n### Domestic Implications:\n1. **Political Discourse and Parliamentary Involvement**:\n   - The involvement of multiple MPs from different political parties in questioning the government\u2019s stance shows a significant level of interest and concern within the political landscape. This can foster more robust parliamentary debates and discussions on foreign policy issues, highlighting the importance of diverse viewpoints in shaping national decisions.\n\n2. **Public Opinion and National Unity**:\n   - Singapore's multicultural society, which includes significant Muslim and Jewish communities, might have varied reactions to this decision. Recognizing Palestine could resonate positively with the Muslim community, potentially strengthening national unity by demonstrating a commitment to global justice and peace. However, it might also lead to concerns or backlash from those who support Israel, necessitating careful management of public discourse to maintain harmony.\n\n3. **Government Transparency and Accountability**:\n   - The detailed explanation and transparent communication by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan underscore the government's commitment to transparency and accountability. This approach can enhance public trust in the government\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\n\n### International Implications:\n1. **Bilateral Relations with Israel and Palestine**:\n   - Singapore's balanced approach in offering support to both Israel and Palestine reflects its commitment to maintaining good relations with both parties. Recognizing Palestine while urging for peaceful negotiations aligns with this stance, but it may require delicate diplomatic efforts to manage relations with Israel, especially given the historical tensions in the region.\n\n2. **Alignment with International Community**:\n   - By voting in favor of the UN resolution supporting Palestine's membership, Singapore aligns itself with the majority of the international community. This move reinforces its image as a supporter of international law and a promoter of peace. However, it also places Singapore at odds with key allies like the United States and Israel, potentially impacting its diplomatic relations with these countries.\n\n3. **Role in Regional and Global Diplomacy**:\n   - Singapore\u2019s active participation in international discussions, such as the conference on Gaza\u2019s humanitarian response, showcases its role as a responsible global citizen and a mediator in international conflicts. This can enhance Singapore's diplomatic clout and reputation as a neutral and peace-promoting nation.\n\n4. **Security and Counterterrorism**:\n   - By insisting on the need for a Palestinian government that rejects terrorism and recognizes Israel, Singapore underscores its firm stance on security and counterterrorism. This aligns with global efforts to combat terrorism and can bolster international cooperation in ensuring regional stability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSingapore's cautious yet proactive stance on recognizing Palestine reflects a nuanced approach to a complex issue. It balances domestic interests, international relations, and global diplomatic responsibilities. This move, while potentially contentious, positions Singapore as a principled and strategic player on the global stage, advocating for peace and the rule of law."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"7f16e491-f632-4629-a043-11b0603f32a7","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"89ccfa480d610197-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7f16e491-f632-4629-a043-11b0603f32a7","children":["aaa26990-c58e-4e1e-86fb-70c945cb5d09"]},"aaa26990-c58e-4e1e-86fb-70c945cb5d09":{"id":"aaa26990-c58e-4e1e-86fb-70c945cb5d09","message":{"id":"aaa26990-c58e-4e1e-86fb-70c945cb5d09","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719906091.889161,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Which countries have also been consistent supporters of a two-state solution?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"89ccfe6d2eb989a7-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5f13cbd4-2b4a-495c-b285-d9f29154b629","children":["27465cbc-ae45-4a03-9d8e-a86b712ea56a"]},"27465cbc-ae45-4a03-9d8e-a86b712ea56a":{"id":"27465cbc-ae45-4a03-9d8e-a86b712ea56a","message":{"id":"27465cbc-ae45-4a03-9d8e-a86b712ea56a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719906108.027879,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Several countries and international entities have consistently supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Singapore\u2019s more balanced approach may lead to differences in diplomatic rhetoric but does not fundamentally oppose the shared goal of Palestinian statehood.\n- **Potential Diplomatic Tensions**: Malaysia and Indonesia might view Singapore's balanced stance and conditional support for Palestine as less committed compared to their unequivocal support. This could lead to occasional diplomatic friction or criticism, particularly in forums where the Palestinian issue is discussed.\n\n#### **Bilateral Cooperation**\n- **Shared Regional Interests**: Despite differences in their approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia have strong bilateral ties based on economic, security, and regional stability interests. These shared interests often overshadow specific foreign policy disagreements.\n- **ASEAN Dynamics**: Within ASEAN, the differing stances on Israel-Palestine can lead to varied diplomatic strategies, but the regional bloc generally respects the diverse foreign policies of its member states. Singapore\u2019s balanced approach might serve as a moderating influence in ASEAN\u2019s collective stance on international conflicts.\n\n#### **Public Perception and Domestic Politics**\n- **Public Opinion**: In Malaysia and Indonesia, where public support for the Palestinian cause is strong, Singapore\u2019s more cautious stance might be viewed critically by some segments of the population. However, this is unlikely to significantly impact overall bilateral relations.\n- **Domestic Political Narratives**: Malaysian and Indonesian leaders might use Singapore\u2019s stance to bolster their own political narratives of strong support for Palestine, potentially leading to public debates or criticisms aimed at differentiating their foreign policies from Singapore\u2019s.\n\n### Conclusion\nSingapore's balanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict contrasts with the more unequivocal support for Palestine from Malaysia and Indonesia. While this difference could lead to occasional diplomatic tensions or public criticisms, the overall impact on bilateral relations is moderated by strong economic, security, and regional cooperation. The shared goal of supporting Palestinian statehood provides a common ground, even if the methods and rhetoric differ."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAA","parent_id":"aaa2d24f-bc4f-4171-ac09-49faac3a2b10","request_id":"89cd04188e319d02-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2d24f-bc4f-4171-ac09-49faac3a2b10","children":["aaa29625-c6d2-447e-9ff3-975c371db85d"]},"aaa29625-c6d2-447e-9ff3-975c371db85d":{"id":"aaa29625-c6d2-447e-9ff3-975c371db85d","message":{"id":"aaa29625-c6d2-447e-9ff3-975c371db85d","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1719906448.927505,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Singapore is often seen as pro Israel.

Here are some key points that provide a more comprehensive view:\n\n### Historical and Diplomatic Relations with Israel\n1. **Early Ties and Cooperation**: Singapore established diplomatic relations with Israel soon after its own independence in 1965. Israel played a significant role in helping to build Singapore\u2019s armed forces, providing training and expertise during a critical period for the young nation.\n2. **Economic and Technological Collaboration**: Over the years, Singapore and Israel have developed strong economic and technological ties. Israel is known for its advancements in technology, cybersecurity, and innovation, areas where Singapore has keen interests and collaborations.\n\n### Balanced Foreign Policy\n1. **Support for Palestinian Rights**: Despite its strong ties with Israel, Singapore has consistently supported the rights of the Palestinian people and advocates for a two-state solution. This is evident from its voting patterns in the United Nations and its participation in international discussions aimed at achieving peace.\n2. **Conditional Recognition of Palestine**: Singapore\u2019s stance is not unconditional support for either side. The country\u2019s position hinges on the presence of an effective Palestinian government that rejects terrorism and recognizes Israel\u2019s right to exist. This balanced approach aims to encourage both sides to work towards a peaceful resolution.\n\n### Regional and International Dynamics\n1. **ASEAN Relations**: Within the context of ASEAN, Singapore must navigate its foreign policy carefully. Countries like Malaysia and Indonesia are strong proponents of the Palestinian cause. Singapore\u2019s balanced approach helps maintain regional diplomatic harmony while pursuing its own national interests.\n2. **Global Diplomatic Image**: Singapore positions itself as a neutral and principled actor on the global stage, advocating for international law and negotiated solutions to conflicts. This image is important for its global diplomatic and economic engagements.\n\n### Public Perception and Media Portrayal\n1. **Media Interpretations**: Media portrayals and public perceptions can sometimes lean towards seeing Singapore as pro-Israel due to its close economic and military ties with Israel. However, these interpretations do not fully capture the balanced and nuanced nature of Singapore\u2019s official stance.\n2. **Community Sentiments**: Singapore\u2019s multicultural society includes diverse views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The government\u2019s balanced approach aims to reflect this diversity and maintain social cohesion.\n\n### Singapore's Contributions to Peace Efforts\n1. **Technical Assistance to Palestine**: Singapore has committed significant resources to support Palestinian capacity building and development through its Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP). This includes training Palestinian officials in various critical sectors.\n2. **Diplomatic Engagements**: Singapore participates in international efforts to mediate and support peace processes, demonstrating its commitment to a durable and just resolution to the conflict.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile Singapore maintains strong ties with Israel, it also supports Palestinian rights and a two-state solution, reflecting a balanced approach in its foreign policy. This nuanced stance aims to promote peace and stability, both regionally and globally, while navigating the complex dynamics of international relations. The perception of Singapore as pro-Israel may arise from its historical and economic ties with Israel, but its official policies and actions reveal a more balanced and principled position."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa29625-c6d2-447e-9ff3-975c371db85d","request_id":"89cd07273afd3f93-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa29625-c6d2-447e-9ff3-975c371db85d","children":[]}}}
