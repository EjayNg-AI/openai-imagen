In PERT, \r\neach project is broken down into individual tasks or activities, with their estimated durations and \r\ndependencies identified. Dependencies define the sequence of tasks, specifying which tasks must \r\nbe completed before others can begin. \r\nEstimation of the duration of projects by modelling task completion times based on optimistic, \r\nmost likely, and pessimistic estimates. \r\n1. Optimistic (O): The minimum time required to complete a task under ideal conditions.\r\n2. Most Likely (M): The most probable duration of the task, assuming normal conditions.\r\n3. Pessimistic (P): The maximum time needed to complete the task, considering potential \r\ndelays.\r\nThese estimates are used to calculate an expected duration for each task, typically using a \r\nweighted average formula: \r\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b =\r\n\ud835\udc42 + 4\ud835\udc40 + \ud835\udc43\r\n6\r\nThe PERT Diagram, which is a graphical representation of the project, where arrows represent \r\ntasks and their flow from one to another, based on dependencies. Nodes mark milestones or \r\npoints where tasks meet. The diagram enables managers to visualise task sequences, \r\ndependencies, and overall project flow. \r\nProject Completion Time","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 18>","To calculate the overall project completion time, PERT identifies the longest path through the \r\nproject\u2019s sequence of tasks, known as the critical path. The sum of expected durations of tasks \r\nalong this path determines the estimated completion time. For a probabilistic approach, PERT \r\nmay also compute the variance of the completion time by summing variances of each task on the \r\ncritical path, allowing managers to assess the risk of completing the project within a specified \r\ntime frame\r\nThe critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible duration for \r\nproject completion. Any delay in the tasks on this path will directly delay the entire project. \r\nIdentifying the critical path is crucial for effective project management, as it helps prioritise \r\nresources and focus on tasks that impact the project timeline the most.\r\nThe non-critical path consists of tasks that have some flexibility, meaning they can be delayed \r\nwithout impacting the overall project timeline. This flexibility is quantified as \u201cfloat\u201d or \u201cslack\u201d \r\ntime, which represents the allowable delay for each task before it affects project completion.\r\n1. Earliest Start Time (ES) and Earliest Finish Time (EF)\u2014these times are calculated \r\nusing a forward pass through the PERT diagram, ensuring that each task\u2019s start and finish \r\nalign with project dependencies:\r\n\u25cf Earliest Start Time (ES) is the earliest time at which a task can begin, assuming \r\nall preceding tasks are completed on time.\r\n\u25cf Earliest Finish Time (EF) is calculated by adding the task\u2019s duration to its ES.\r\n2. Latest Start Time (LS) and Latest Finish Time (LF)\u2014these times are calculated using \r\na backward pass through the PERT diagram, which helps identify the float or slack in \r\nnon-critical tasks:\r\n\u25cf Latest Finish Time (LF) is the latest a task can finish without delaying the \r\nproject.\r\n\u25cf Latest Start Time (LS) is calculated by subtracting the task\u2019s duration from its \r\nLF.\r\nOne example of a PERT diagram is shown below.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 4 / 18>","PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five milestones (10 through 50) and six \r\nactivities (A through F).\r\nThe project has two critical paths: activities B and C, or A, D, and F \u2013 giving a minimum \r\nproject time of 7 months with fast tracking. Activity E is sub-critical, and has a float of 1 \r\nmonth.\r\n1.2 Probability Distributions\r\nIn real-world project management, task durations are rarely fixed. Instead, they are influenced by \r\na range of uncertain factors, which can lead to variability in how long a task actually takes. \r\nFor example: \r\n1. Resource Availability: Insufficient availability of personnel, equipment, or materials can \r\nlead to project delays. For example, if a key team member falls ill or a crucial piece of \r\nequipment breaks down, the completion of related tasks may be postponed.\r\n2. Scope Changes: Projects often evolve over time, with stakeholders requesting changes or \r\nadditional features. Such changes can disrupt timelines and require reallocation of \r\nresources, leading to potential delays.\r\n3. External Dependencies: Many projects rely on external vendors or stakeholders. Delays \r\nin approvals, deliveries, or collaboration from these external parties can ripple through \r\nthe project timeline.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 4 / 18>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-8Gm8isYuwQfMXHY9UFzeQQ","size_bytes":137277,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 5 / 18>","The PERT addresses this uncertainty by estimating task durations using a single expected \r\nduration for each task. However, since task durations in real life often vary in unpredictable \r\nways, relying on a single expected value may not fully capture the complexity and range of \r\npossible outcomes. To better approximate real-world scenarios, we can model task completion \r\ntimes using probability distributions, which represent a range of potential durations and their \r\nlikelihoods. By using probability distributions, project managers gain a more comprehensive \r\nview of each task's possible duration, allowing for more accurate assessments of the risk of \r\ndelays in project completion.\r\nIn probability theory, probability distributions describe how the possible values of a random \r\nvariable are distributed. They allow us to model uncertainty and variability in real-world \r\nscenarios, like task durations in a project. There are two main types of probability distributions: \r\n1. Discrete distributions are used when the variable can take on a countable number of \r\nvalues, such as the number of days a task might be delayed. In these cases, each possible \r\nvalue has an associated probability.\r\n2. Continuous distributions are used when the variable can take on any value within a \r\nrange, such as the precise time it takes to complete a task. For continuous variables, \r\nprobabilities are described by a probability density function (PDF) rather than \r\nindividual values.\r\n\u25cf Probability density function \r\nA function whose value at any given sample in the sample space can be \r\ninterpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable \r\nwould be equal to that sample.

The normal distribution is widely understood and frequently used due to its \r\nsimplicity and symmetrical nature. Unlike the traditionally used beta distribution in PERT, which \r\nrequires specifying minimum and maximum values, the distribution is defined by just two \r\nparameters: the mean and standard deviation. This makes it particularly convenient for cases \r\nwhere task duration estimates centre around a likely average with moderate variation in both \r\ndirections.\r\nScenarios normal distribution are preferable: \r\n- Ideal for tasks where the duration is expected to vary around a central, most likely time, \r\nwith equal likelihood of taking slightly shorter or slightly longer durations. This is \r\ncommon for tasks that are well understood or have consistent processes, where the \r\nlikelihood of delays or early completions is evenly balanced.\r\n- Tasks with small to moderate levels of variability around an average completion time fit \r\nwell with the normal distribution. This is particularly useful in stable environments where \r\ntask execution processes are standardised, minimising extreme deviations. For example, \r\nrepetitive tasks in production processes or routine administrative tasks often have \r\nmoderate, predictable durations that fit a normal distribution.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 18>","2) Research Methodology\r\nEach activity is assigned three time estimates: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic.

Monte Carlo simulations use random sampling from the chosen probability \r\ndistribution for each task duration, allowing for multiple iterations to build a probability \r\ndistribution of the total project completion time. Monte Carlo simulation is valuable in projects \r\nwith many tasks, where each task often depends on several preceding tasks, creating complex \r\nchains of dependencies. In such cases, direct probability calculations can become extremely \r\nchallenging. When tasks follow different or complex probability distributions, calculations grow \r\neven more unmanageable. Assigning unique distributions or parameters to each task only adds to \r\nthis complexity, as traditional methods typically rely on simplifying assumptions that don\u2019t fully \r\ncapture real-world variability. Additionally, task durations are often not independent in real-life \r\nscenarios; a delay in one task can affect subsequent tasks; this makes it difficult to determine the \r\nexact probability distribution of the critical path. Given these challenges, Monte Carlo simulation \r\noffers a practical solution by capturing these dependencies and uncertainties, providing a more ","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 9 / 18>","realistic approach to project timeline estimation. It could be used to identify the likelihood of \r\nmeeting specific deadlines and assess the impact of delays in different tasks. \r\nExample: \r\nhttps://sgmoe\u0002my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/zhang_xin_tian_tina_students_edu_sg/Documents/mrp.xlsx?d=\r\nwf201de854569413f8d31e1bf8fde7d91&csf=1&web=1&e=vbiCg7&nav=MTVfezkzMkZENzg\r\n2LUQ5RTktNENDQS05NjdELTIxQ0NGREQ4MTJCQ30 \r\n2.2.1 Beta Distribution\r\nTo find the most probable project completion time, we used the beta distribution method. The \r\nbeta distribution is widely used in project management for modelling uncertain estimates within \r\na defined range. It is a family of continuous probability distributions set on the interval [0, 1] \r\nhaving two positive shape parameters, expressed by \u03b1 and \u03b2. These parameters control the shape \r\nof the distribution. In our project, we set both \u03b1 and \u03b2 to be 5 so as to obtain a probability \r\ndistribution that is nearly normal. This reflects our assumption that the project completion time \r\nwill cluster around a midpoint rather than be skewed towards either extreme. \r\nUsing the most optimistic task completion time for each task and using the critical path abdef, \r\nwe were able to find the most optimistic completion time of the project, which is 11 days. \r\nSimilarly, we can find the most pessimistic completion time for the project, which happened to \r\nbe 29 days. These completion times are set as the lower bound and upper bound since they \r\nrepresent the minimum and maximum duration of the project, respectively.\r\nUsing the BETA.DIST formula, we found the probability of each duration from 11 to 29, in \r\nincrements of 0.01. Using the data provided, we were able to generate a scatter plot as shown \r\nhere, allowing us to visualise the likelihood of completing the project at various durations.","<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 10 / 18>","This scatter plot tells us that the most probable duration of the project would be approximately \r\n20 days. The symmetrical shape of our distribution suggests that the likelihood of finishing the \r\nproject increases steadily from 11 days, peaks around 20 days, and then gradually decreases as it \r\napproaches 29 days.\r\n2.2.2 Normal Distribution\r\nPath 1 has a duration of 21.0 days, while path 2 has a duration of 21.2 days, meaning that path 2 \r\nis the critical path since it has a longer duration. As such, it determines the minimum time required \r\nfor project completion. The identification of the critical path is a crucial step in project \r\nmanagement, as any delay in this sequence of activities will directly impact the overall project \r\ntimeline.\r\nBy using the what if analysis tool on Excel, we ran 1000 iterations to simulate the project\u2019s duration \r\nbased on the variability in task times derived from their respective distributions. Using this data, \r\nwe generated a histogram, which is a roughly bell-shaped curve, to visualise this distribution, \r\nwhich is characteristic of a normal distribution. The spread of the histogram demonstrates the range \r\nof potential project durations, which is from 10.2 to 29.4 days. Meanwhile, the peak indicates the \r\nmost probable duration range, which we have obtained to be 18.6 days.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 10 / 18>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-1mJNR9HrpgXsf4LFtXv4ba","size_bytes":148085,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 11 / 18>","2.3 Non-Critical Path Becomes Critical \r\nIn a project, the critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible \r\ncompletion time. However, if certain non-critical tasks (those not on the critical path) experience \r\nsignificant delays, they may lengthen enough to form a new critical path. When a non-critical task \r\ntakes longer than usual in a simulation run, it can delay the tasks that follow it, potentially \r\nextending the overall project timeline. \r\nTo determine the probability of a non-critical path becoming critical, we conducted a Monte Carlo \r\nsimulation. To do this, we find the two possible paths that the project can take, which is path a \r\n(abcef) and path b (abdef), of which path b is typically the critical path. Using the what if analysis \r\ntool, we ran 1000 simulations to determine the duration of each path. Using the countif formula, \r\nwe found the number of times where path a became the critical path. \r\nOur simulation showed that the number of times that path a became critical was 84, meaning that \r\nthe percentage that non-critical path becomes critical is approximately 8.4%\r\nNumber of times non-critical path becomes \r\ncritical\r\n84\r\nPercentage of times non-critical path becomes \r\ncritical\r\n8.4%\r\nBy observing these scenarios, project managers can see how a non-critical path might become \r\ncritical, thus identifying which non-critical tasks could pose a risk if they\u2019re delayed.

In the first simulation, we adjusted the mean duration of task C, which is \r\ntypically not on the critical path. In the second simulation, we modified the mean duration of task \r\nA, which lies on the critical path. \r\nFor the first simulation, we increased the mean duration of task c from 3 to 4, which also slightly \r\nraised the variance from approximately 2.7 to 2.9. After running 1000 iterations, we realised that \r\nthis change had a relatively insignificant impact on the mean project duration. Specifically, the \r\nmean project duration increased from 20.088 to 20.112 days, showing a rise of less than 0.03 days. \r\nThis indicates that changes to non-critical path tasks like Task C have minimal impact on overall \r\nproject duration.\r\nFor the second simulation, we changed the mean duration of task a from 2 to 3, which increased \r\nthe variance from approximately 0.67 to 0.92. While maintaining the duration of all other tasks, \r\nchanging the mean duration of task a caused an increase in the mean duration of the project from \r\n20.088 to 20.691, meaning that it rose by more than 0.6 days. This demonstrates that changes to \r\ntasks on the critical path, like task a, have a substantial effect on the project duration because delays \r\ndirectly impact the overall timeline.\r\nThrough our analysis, we concluded tasks that lie on the critical path are most sensitive to changes \r\nand should be subjected to close monitoring to minimise delays. Conversely, changes to tasks not \r\non the critical path have a negligible impact unless they result in a path becoming critical. This \r\nwould allow us to prioritise monitoring and risk management efforts for tasks that directly \r\ninfluence project outcomes.\r\n3.4 Risk Profile Graph \r\nA risk profile graph visually represents the probability of completing a project within a range of \r\ntime frames and helps assess the risk of delays.\r\nTarget Completion Time Z-Score Calculation Probability\r\n10 -2.808988764 0.002484869\r\n11 -2.528089888 0.005734249","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 15 / 18>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-DrwJgtS3VD3sJoEcpvHixH","size_bytes":196351,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 16 / 18>","12 -2.247191011 0.012313911\r\n13 -1.966292135 0.024632437\r\n14 -1.685393258 0.045956362\r\n15 -1.404494382 0.080085842\r\n16 -1.123595506 0.130592332\r\n17 -0.842696629 0.199699066\r\n18 -0.561797753 0.287126912\r\n19 -0.280898876 0.389393981\r\n20 0 0.5\r\n21 0.280898876 0.610606019\r\n22 0.561797753 0.712873088\r\n23 0.842696629 0.800300934\r\n24 1.123595506 0.869407668\r\n25 1.404494382 0.919914158\r\n26 1.685393258 0.954043638\r\n27 1.966292135 0.975367563\r\n28 2.247191011 0.987686089\r\n29 2.528089888 0.994265751\r\n30 2.808988764 0.997515131","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 16 / 18>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-PpZPRzcJaQgURwX4vb9fZ7","size_bytes":122704,"width":768,"height":1024,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 17 / 18>","Steep slopes indicate sensitive areas where small time changes significantly impact the \r\nprobability while flat regions suggest lower sensitivity to changes in time.","<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 18>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-Xfm9gAcZgbbF8YwqAwhjax","size_bytes":63152,"width":1024,"height":768,"fovea":768,"metadata":null},"<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 18>","4) Limitations\r\nWhen modelling task durations with the normal distribution, one potential issue is that it \r\ntheoretically allows for negative values, which are not feasible in practical scenarios.

Adding a concise summary at the beginning will help readers quickly grasp the purpose, methodology, and key findings.\n   - Similarly, a conclusion summarizing insights and practical implications would strengthen the report's structure.\n\n2. **Introduction**:\n   - While the introduction explains PERT well, it could include a brief overview of graph theory's role in scheduling to better frame the topic.\n\n3. **Visual Clarity**:\n   - The scatter plot and histogram (page 10) are clear but could include titles, labeled axes, and annotations to improve readability.\n   - In the PERT network diagram (page 4), use different colors or line styles to distinguish critical and non-critical paths.\n\n4. **Monte Carlo Simulation Details**:\n   - The methodology for the Monte Carlo simulation (page 8) is not fully explained. Adding details about the random sampling process and assumptions would improve reproducibility.\n   - The choice of 1,000 iterations seems arbitrary. Justify this selection or discuss whether more iterations would improve accuracy.\n\n5. **Critical Path Analysis**:\n   - Discuss why path 2 (abdef) is critical (page 10) in more depth. Are there specific task characteristics that lead to its criticality?\n   - Expand on how to manage tasks that frequently become critical during simulation (e.g., path a on page 11).\n\n6. **Sensitivity Analysis**:\n   - The impact of sensitivity analysis on managerial decisions could be emphasized. For example, how would this analysis guide resource allocation?\n\n7. **Risk and Financial Modeling**:\n   - The financial analysis (page 14) could consider additional scenarios, such as incentives for early completion or unexpected cost overruns.\n   - The penalties assigned for delays seem simplistic. Introduce a dynamic model where penalties increase non-linearly with delays.\n\n8. **Technical Accuracy**:\n   - On page 18, the adjustment for negative durations could benefit from a worked-out example showing how truncation or log-normal distribution resolves the issue.\n\n9. **Formatting and Grammar**:\n   - Consistently format all equations (e.g., Equation 1, Equation 2) and refer to them in the text.\n   - Correct minor grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., capitalize task names uniformly).\n\n10. **References**:\n    - Include references to key academic or industry sources supporting the use of Beta and Normal distributions in PERT analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe report provides an excellent foundation for analyzing project timelines using PERT and graph theory.
