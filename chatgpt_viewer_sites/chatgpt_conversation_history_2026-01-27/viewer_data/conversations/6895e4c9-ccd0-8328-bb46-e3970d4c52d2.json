I\u2019m Mike Green of the United States Studies Centre in Sydney and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Welcome back to the Asia Chessboard. I\u2019m joined by Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, a rising and influential IR scholar about the region, a student of Tom Christensen, and introduced to me by my friend Ford Hart, who has decamped to Singapore\u2014one of the State Department\u2019s great China watchers over the years. Ian, great to have you on the show.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: Thanks for having me on.\r\n\r\nEarly Interests and Path into International Relations\r\n\r\nMike Green: We always start by asking how you got into this. Obviously, you\u2019re in Singapore, you\u2019re in Asia. All Singaporeans are taught about geopolitics in school\u2014not detailed IR, of course, but a sense of Singapore\u2019s unique position. What got you into the international relations field and off to Princeton for a doctoral degree?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: I\u2019d always been interested in politics, even as a kid, and for some serendipitous reason, I found international politics\u2014especially security\u2014fascinating. That\u2019s something I figured I would do. It\u2019s quite funny because I\u2019ve actually known of you and we\u2019ve probably met several times a long time ago. I went to Georgetown as an undergraduate and was in DC for a while after that. I worked at CSIS under the International Security Program\u2014this would be the early 2000s\u2014so I\u2019m sure our paths must have crossed. It was interesting because at that point I was figuring out whether I would do more of a policy route or academia. My time at CSIS was very exciting and very fun, but it also taught me that, perhaps for my own constitution, I\u2019m more suited to taking a step back, looking at conceptual dynamics, rather than doing day-to-day policy.\r\n\r\nMike Green: So you were there in the heyday of security studies. That would have been Kurt Campbell, Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, Derek Mitchell.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: That\u2019s right. I worked for them.\r\n\r\nMike Green: Big strategic thinkers. And then that launched you to Princeton. Your work is interesting and multi-dimensional, but one thing you do\u2014which is very much a Tom Christensen thing and something I enjoy\u2014is hybrid history and political science. You did a piece that caught my attention about World War I\u20141914\u2014what the lessons are and aren\u2019t for geopolitics in Asia. Let\u2019s start with the big question: how worried are you about the prospects for war? How confident are you about stability when you look at the conditions before World War I?\r\n\r\nWorld War I Lessons and the Risk of Crisis in Asia\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: That piece\u2014which I did with my good friend and colleague Todd Hall\u2014looked at dynamics unfolding in Asia about ten years ago and what was going on in Europe around the centenary of the First World War. Looking at what\u2019s going on now, I don\u2019t think actors in Asia actively want a conflict. But we\u2019re tying ourselves up in knots in terms of various interests. Our ability to signal is getting muddied by all kinds of issues entering the information stream. My concern is we could stumble into some sort of crisis that escalates out of control. It doesn\u2019t matter whether that\u2019s the Yellow Sea/West Sea, the East China Sea, Taiwan, or the South China Sea. In some ways they become one theater, because if you think about escalation not just in intensity but geographic scope, it\u2019s difficult for the region to escape escalation once it starts. I would prefer more active thinking about conflict prevention. We didn\u2019t see enough of it when Todd and I wrote the article, and I still don\u2019t think we see enough today.\r\n\r\nMike Green: Odd Arne Westad gave a great presentation at Aspen, drawing parallels\u2014history rhymes, it doesn\u2019t repeat\u2014between Asia today and Europe before 1914, and China with Germany. One I\u2019ve long found dangerous is how much the German staff\u2014the Schlieffen Plan\u2014let military planning dominate grand strategy. The plan to defeat France by invading Belgium made military sense, but it was terrible grand strategy because it brought in Britain, and with Britain you got a million Indian troops, the ANZAC Corps, the Canadian Corps, and eventually over four million Americans. To me that\u2019s an eerie precedent for what China seems to be doing. The military dimension makes sense as a military plan to complicate and push back allied responses, but it\u2019s creating bandwagoning against China. What\u2019s your assessment of China\u2019s grand strategy? Is it self-defeating or quite successful? Does it evoke those World War I worries?\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s Strategy, Nationalism, and Escalation Risks\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: It certainly does. There\u2019s not just the dominance of highly securitized thinking; the PRC today isn\u2019t just doing military activity. They\u2019re happy to do a lot of gray-zone and hybrid things that can be quite escalatory. If the point is to quickly seize and control areas, like the Schlieffen Plan, I see the logic. But that sort of thinking doesn\u2019t account for other variables\u2014bandwagoning effects, knock-on effects for other interested actors. Look outside East Asia: Europeans were far less focused on Asia a decade ago. With supply chain issues, PRC efforts to support Russia in Ukraine, and then robust\u2014sometimes risky\u2014Chinese gray-zone and military activity, Europeans got a lot more interested in Asia. We\u2019re seeing some of that interest grow\u2014maybe at a slower pace than 1914\u2014but certainly the PRC\u2019s ability to control escalation is risky. I\u2019ll add another concern: the strong nationalism the current PRC leadership is cultivating. That was another aspect of World War I. Everybody was very confident in their militaries and national capabilities. Pride swelled and created overconfidence. We may be seeing that today. Ultimately some leader makes a call; if they judge wrongly, that can be the trigger.\r\n\r\nWorld War II Echoes: Ideology and Economic Decoupling\r\n\r\nMike Green: Some historians think applying historical precedent is bad practice, but why study history if not to draw lessons? It\u2019s \u00e0 la carte, not a set menu. The other precedent that jumps out is World War II, particularly the Pacific War: economic decoupling with the Great Depression and Smoot-Hawley, and an ideological battle. World War I wasn\u2019t ultimately an existential ideological contest. The war in Asia was a battle between a Japanese vision\u2014anti-Western Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, anti-colonialism\u2014versus the West. Now our Chinese friends emphasize \u201cAsia for Asians\u201d versus the West. It\u2019s almost like the worst precedents from World War I mixed with the worst from just before World War II. The ideational East versus West, and economic decoupling\u2014does that make this more dangerous than before World War I?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: The economic decoupling and the deep suspicion\u2014partly ideological\u2014also mean mechanisms that could roll back or slow down crises are a lot weaker today. That\u2019s a big concern. On the rhetoric\u2014yes, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\u2014a lot of rhetoric out of Beijing today, and if you overlay that sphere with the nine-dash line and the First Island Chain, it\u2019s not completely the same, but there\u2019s a big area of overlap. On the PRC side, there\u2019s a worry about encirclement, suppression, containment\u2014a concern they could be cut off. That sounds very much like Japan in the 1930s. The response is strikingly similar in ways I find scary: break out by controlling access a lot more and denying access to rivals. Couple that with greater confidence and delegating action to military or paramilitary forces. That\u2019s maybe a bit different from the first or second world wars, but it could trigger snowball effects that would be really hard to roll back.\r\n\r\nSingapore\u2019s Strategic Dilemma and ASEAN\u2019s Limits\r\n\r\nMike Green: From Singapore\u2019s perspective, to manage security and prosperity you need more, not less, economic interdependence\u2014sorry, the trend is the other way. You need pragmatism over ideology\u2014sorry, not happening; it\u2019s increasingly ideological. You need decisions driven by economic growth, not autarky or war planning\u2014sorry, not happening in China, and increasingly the U.S. and even allies emphasize economic security, accepting relative gains over absolute gains for secure supply chains and to avoid coercion. All the trend lines are bad for Singapore\u2019s basic view of survival. The government\u2019s clearly unhappy. Do you sense ferment in Singapore about changing strategic assumptions\u2014how Singapore or ASEAN have agency? Publicly there\u2019s pining for the old liberal order. Singaporeans are pragmatic. What are you hearing among scholars and government about agency\u2014positioning Singapore when the world\u2019s not listening to Lee Kuan Yew or Goh Chok Tong or Lee Hsien Loong? Is there ferment about new strategic agency?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: My sense\u2014and you\u2019ve probably heard this at Aspen and elsewhere\u2014is many in the Singapore establishment and foreign policy circles realize some things need to change. What that strategy is or ought to be is not entirely apparent to me. There are aspects: emphasis on needing more and better partners, deepening engagement with India and the European Union, also Australia, Korea, Japan. There\u2019s the idea that if we work on these things, we can bring more actors into East Asia with a stake in stability, and maybe that could work. It\u2019s a modification of what we had previously. But if we\u2019re heading in a very different trajectory\u2014and there\u2019s a good argument we are\u2014it\u2019s not clear what the next step is for Singapore. Singapore enjoyed a privileged and fortuitous period for a long time. For all the rivalry between the U.S. and the PRC, there was a belief in Washington and Beijing that cooperation had to win out. That is going away, if it hasn\u2019t already. For countries like Singapore, \u201cnot choosing sides\u201d was possible when, if you didn\u2019t work with one major actor, they didn\u2019t punish you for it; if you worked with the rival on areas in your interest, you wouldn\u2019t get punished. These days we\u2019re seeing Singapore getting hit with some of the tariffs. We just had the cyberattack allegedly from the PRC. Trying to get a break from both sides is becoming increasingly difficult. So what do you do? There\u2019s some feeling around, but the big vision isn\u2019t quite there yet. There continues to be a lot of reference to Lee Kuan Yew, which I\u2019m skeptical about because he lived in a very different environment. His playbook tells us what would work in that Cold War context. What it tells us about today is less clear. He was in a period of more economic liberalization and globalization. We\u2019re moving in the opposite direction. Some of those basic operating assumptions don\u2019t hold the same way. If Singapore is serious about institutions, talks more about principles and agency\u2014which officials do\u2014then there has to be thinking about the international system and institutions. Are there things we want to salvage and save? If so, who do we work with to get those outcomes? Are there things on which we need to take more initiative? Are there areas where we need to push for reform? ASEAN is due for reform. It performed quite well; it did many useful things for Southeast Asia in calming things down. But it\u2019s designed to slow tensions and make everything calmer. By virtue of slowing things down effectively, it is very inert in its ability to take initiative. So when you have a crisis, ASEAN gets stuck.\r\n\r\nRethinking ASEAN: From \u201cCow\u201d to \u201cTractor\u201d\r\n\r\nMike Green: Bilahhari Kausikan\u2019s line\u2014don\u2019t expect ASEAN to be a thoroughbred; it\u2019s a cow, it can do what a cow does, but not a horse.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: Yes, Bilahhari Kausikan said ASEAN\u2019s a cow, not a horse; you can\u2019t expect it to do what a horse does. I get where he\u2019s coming from. Many older establishment people around ASEAN make that claim\u2014don\u2019t fix what\u2019s not broken. But I would argue maybe we don\u2019t need a cow these days; maybe we might not even need a horse. Maybe we need a tractor. It\u2019s about fitting capabilities to the situation we face. ASEAN might be a great cow, but if we don\u2019t need a cow today\u2014or need less of a cow\u2014and we need other things, then that debate is moot.\r\n\r\nMike Green: What does that ASEAN that\u2019s not a cow or a horse, but more of a tractor\u2014with more horsepower\u2014look like? Sometimes younger, forward-thinking scholars and officials in Indonesia or Singapore or Thailand talk about a coalition of the willing within ASEAN, a smaller grouping\u2014Singapore and Indonesia at the core\u2014that can move without being paralyzed by consensus or held back by countries closer to China\u2019s orbit. What does that tractor ASEAN look like to you?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: A couple of things. Conceptually, ASEAN needs to recognize there are coordination and collective action problems it has to solve, and be serious about them. You need to set up processes. When you have a Myanmar crisis like we did, you don\u2019t just put together an envoy, cobble together a Five-Point Consensus, and then leave where you go from there unclear. You need more planning and better coordination. I understand reform is difficult\u2014touching the Charter or basic treaties is hard\u2014but within the existing context there\u2019s low-hanging fruit. For instance, with the Secretariat: you don\u2019t have to give it more authority\u2014which many capitals are wary of\u2014but you could give it more capability to do what it\u2019s already empowered to do better. Increase its budget, increase the size of the bureaucracy that helps address some of the overhead costs of putting together the thousands of ASEAN meetings, and harmonize issues on the table, so things aren\u2019t so ad hoc. That\u2019s straightforward and possible. It requires resources, attention, and political will, but that\u2019s a first step. We\u2019re not seeing that right now.\r\n\r\nMinilateralism, Multipolarity, and the Costs of Agency\r\n\r\nMike Green: What about leveraging multipolarity within Asia\u2014like the U.S., Japan, Australia, and India have with the Quad; Australia and Japan deepening their bilateral defense relationships; the \u201cSquad\u201d with the Philippines? What about more active Singaporean participation in these minilaterals? Beijing calls them \u201csmall NATOs\u201d and doesn\u2019t like them. Singapore is active with the U.S.\u2014the Strategic Framework Agreement, Talisman Sabre exercises. But what about a more deliberate harnessing of multipolarity to deepen defense, economic security, and diplomatic cooperation with key powers that are not ASEAN and not broad multilaterals? It seems to me Singapore could be doing more.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: Multilateral and minilateral approaches are something Singapore can explore more. But engaging in them is not cost-free or risk-free. As you mentioned, the PRC sees some of these as mini-NATOs, adding to claims of encirclement, suppression, and containment. If Singapore is interested in keeping aspects of the rules-based order\u2014openness and stability\u2014then it needs to figure out how to invest in these and the costs it\u2019s willing to pay. There will be pressure from Beijing on some issues; there could be pressure from Washington as well. You have to take that in stride and understand your appetite. The issue is that Singapore, like many Southeast Asian states, has been in a very comfortable situation for a long time, with a willingness to delegate\u2014if you\u2019re being polite; free-ride, if less polite\u2014on the efforts of other actors. If you have problems in Southeast Asia, let the Americans and Chinese talk it out. If you have issues in Northeast Asia, the Northeast Asians will take care of it. Singapore is a little more forward-leaning than some neighbors, but it can certainly do more if it really wants stability. All the multilateralism and minilateralism is positive for Singapore. A multipolar world would be more challenging, because multipolar systems often involve regional leaders\u2014regional hegemons\u2014who decide to carve out areas for themselves. Singapore and Southeast Asia have been successful because we can connect different actors together\u2014be a conduit for trade, investment, innovation. Being locked into spheres of influence would cut against Singapore and Southeast Asia\u2019s strengths.\r\n\r\nLeadership, Ideas, and Singapore\u2019s Institutional Culture\r\n\r\nMike Green: One of Singapore\u2019s assets is intellectual\u2014embodied in Lee Kuan Yew, and in the excellence of the bureaucracy and universities. George Shultz told me he got interested in Asia at Princeton, wrote about the Pacific before Pearl Harbor, and then Nixon sent him to meet Lee Kuan Yew. Decades later, Lee Kuan Yew would come see President George W. Bush and give strategic advice\u2014on Taiwan, China, Japan. Singapore, frankly, has lost that. The newer generation doesn\u2019t have that gravitas. It wasn\u2019t just Lee\u2019s world experience; it was the grand strategy of Singapore. Singapore\u2019s own national power depends on getting this back on track\u2014figuring out these questions\u2014because otherwise the impression in Washington or Tokyo will be that Singapore wants to go back to the old days, and we can\u2019t. If any country can do it, it\u2019s Singapore, but my sense is it\u2019s not there yet. Is that fair?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: I think that\u2019s fair. I\u2019d be a little more pessimistic. Lee Kuan Yew was a one-off. People talk about him as exceptional. If that\u2019s the case, exceptions are one-offs; they\u2019re not the rule. What he could do is probably not available to current leadership. We have to recognize that and not keep going back to the Lee Kuan Yew playbook. You can\u2019t replicate it. More broadly, one thing I\u2019ve observed\u2014you might have too\u2014is that Singapore\u2019s system doesn\u2019t provide the same space for people who are willing to come up with bold ideas and put their foot forward as much anymore. You mentioned Bilahhari Kausikan, Tommy Koh, Chan Heng Chee, and\u2014whether you agree with him or not\u2014Kishore Mahbubani. These folks are at least in their 70s if not 80s. Who is the next generation?\r\n\r\nMike Green: All very smart, sometimes controversial people, and all had the protection of Lee Kuan Yew. Chan Heng Chee\u2014a good friend of mine, long-serving ambassador to the U.S.\u2014was a critic of Lee Kuan Yew, so he brought her in and made her ambassador. If someone was a true big thinker, not just a thorn in his side, he\u2019d promote them. The system is different now, isn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: Right. You can\u2019t think of a next generation of people. In some ways Singapore is a victim of its own success. In Lee\u2019s period, the system was not as institutionalized. As someone who likes institutions, it\u2019s odd to say, but because it wasn\u2019t, it had space for ideational entrepreneurs\u2014people to come up with new ideas and try them. If you could win over Lee\u2014and it wasn\u2019t just Lee; people like S. Rajaratnam, Goh Keng Swee, Hon Sui Sen, Toh Chin Chye were important\u2014if you could win over these people, you\u2019d get a shot. As we\u2019ve become more professionalized, bureaucratized, and institutionalized, you\u2019ve got to follow the rules and tracks. That means people with new and different ideas could find it more difficult to showcase what they have. Over time, people get frustrated and figure: why am I busting my head trying to get an idea across when, because of my rank or seniority, it doesn\u2019t get heard? I might as well make money in the private sector.\r\n\r\nMike Green: Henry Kissinger\u2019s book \u201cLeadership\u201d profiles Lee Kuan Yew and others. One takeaway is leadership is becoming bureaucratized and institutionalized. Leaders like Lee or Margaret Thatcher endured great hardship and trauma\u2014the Japanese conquest of Singapore, being kicked out of Malaysia\u2014huge traumas that forged toughness and wisdom. This is not just Singapore\u2019s problem. Across the Indo-Pacific, you have strong leaders\u2014Modi, Xi Jinping, I suppose Trump\u2014but not wise leaders. In many countries\u2014Japan, Korea, Australia\u2014you have leaders who are not bold. Institutions, the burdens of older economies, frustrated publics\u2014there\u2019s a macro problem. It\u2019s a lot like 1895\u20131914: Bismarck was gone; even the British\u2014Edward Grey\u2014blew it before World War I. The statesmen who built the Concert of Europe left, and you had more bureaucratized people. Leadership is probably another worrying parallel.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: Leadership is important. Perhaps what friends outside Singapore and many Singaporeans don\u2019t appreciate enough is that Lee, for all his larger-than-life persona, was in his early cabinets first among equals. He had a team around him\u2014Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam, Hon Sui Sen, Toh Chin Chye\u2014people willing and able to stand up to Lee. That helped them get better at policy. Lee was the outward-facing person, but they had big fights about where to go. The fact they had these fights and could respect each other helped course-correct. In Singapore\u2019s system today, the PAP leadership claims this still exists, but it\u2019s less obvious that there are real efforts to come at problems from different angles and figure out what\u2019s best. That fit for Singapore is a bit lost.\r\n\r\nTariffs, Unpredictability, and Business Models\r\n\r\nMike Green: It would also apply to Zhongnanhai with Xi Jinping, and the White House with Donald Trump\u2014leaders not surrounding themselves with people who feel free to challenge them. It\u2019s no secret the Singaporean system is profoundly unhappy with Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy, especially his economic policy. Just before we talked, the U.S. and Japan reached an agreement on tariffs. It seems these \u201cdeals\u201d are starting to happen. The new world looks like 15% tariffs. That\u2019s not good for growth in my view, but it\u2019s possible we\u2019ve reached an equilibrium\u2014less drama and unpredictability that hinder investment, defense cooperation, and diplomacy. We don\u2019t know what this agreement with Japan means, but I\u2019m a little less pessimistic we may reach a new equilibrium\u2014not ideal, with higher tariffs, but more stable. What\u2019s your take on the Trump approach to the region, Southeast Asia, the role of tariffs, and how it\u2019s viewed?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: The unpredictability the Trump administration brought makes Southeast Asian governments and businesspeople uneasy. That includes many Singaporean leaders, hence the criticisms and complaints. But it\u2019s the world we have, and we have to deal with it. It also means we have to rethink some of our business models. Previously, a lot of discussion was about removing trade and investment barriers, including tariff and non-tariff barriers. That\u2019s not happening now. A lot of the system also worked on looking at the U.S. as a final market. Tariffs complicate things beyond bilateral issues. Take Singapore: it receives a lot of capital\u2014its largest investor in FDI terms is the U.S., also the EU and Japan; they\u2019re much bigger than China, and also various tax havens. What happens to that money when it comes to Singapore? Some of it produces services and goods we then sell to the region for them to produce and then sell to the U.S. market. Or Singapore exports that capital\u2014we\u2019re a big capital exporter to Vietnam, the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia\u2014where our firms set up subsidiaries and factories to produce. Tariffs break that circulation. If Singapore firms invest in, say, Indonesia, and Indonesia faces\u2014what is it\u201419% under the deal, it\u2019s more difficult to sell into the U.S. That means lower demand, and our prosperity is likely lower. We have to deal with those knock-on effects. The fact that the Trump administration tends to change its mind even after making deals also makes people uneasy, especially because business and policy need longer-term plans. It\u2019s difficult to do that when you fear there could be a change within weeks or months.\r\n\r\nMike Green: If you have to pick your poison, you\u2019ll take 15% tariffs and stability over 15% tariffs and unpredictability\u2014with the possibility of new tariffs and an inability to plan. Stability and predictability are not adjectives that usually go with President Trump, but he likes to win and doesn\u2019t like to lose. I have no doubt people like the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, are telling him growth depends on more predictability than we\u2019re giving right now. We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s crucial to Singapore.\r\n\r\nTaiwan: Stability, Democracy, and Regional Stakes\r\n\r\nMike Green: Quick last question\u2014or second to last\u2014about Taiwan. You\u2019ve done a fair amount of work on Taiwan. Being a Tom Christensen student, I\u2019d expect no less. Singapore has a unique relationship with Taiwan, including military dimensions, and has stood up to Chinese pressure. What\u2019s your take on the Taiwan situation, how Singapore\u2019s thinking about it, and the impact for Southeast Asia? A lot of people worry that the chance of war\u2014Chinese use of force or coercion\u2014is going up. What\u2019s your take?\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: For Singapore, the overriding concern is a stable region, and Taiwan sits astride Northeast and Southeast Asia. If Singapore wants to do business with Northeast Asia, the area around Taiwan has to be stable. That\u2019s the primary concern. But with increased PRC pressure on Taiwan, that lends itself to instability, unpredictability, and escalation. Singapore and other Southeast and Northeast Asian states need to emphasize that any resolution has to be handled without coercion, without the use of force. Many governments, including Singapore, are wary of punishment from China, so they\u2019ll say this\u2014but up to a point. I don\u2019t think the message is getting through enough. That applies to the South China Sea and East China Sea as well. On the historical relationship between Singapore and Taiwan, I think one area not fully understood about Taiwan is: this is not the KMT\u2019s authoritarian, martial-law-era Taiwan anymore. They are a democracy, and what their people believe and think is good for them matters a lot more now, and that has to factor into any consideration. Unless you\u2019re going to accept PRC rolling over Taiwan\u2014which would get resistance, whether or not it\u2019s effective\u2014it would be highly disruptive. The point is to avoid that. Some of the lag in thinking comes from an assumed familiarity with Taiwan from past interaction\u2014party ties between the KMT and the PAP. They had more interactions before; there\u2019s less familiarity with the DPP. The bureaucracy may be different, but at least on the party side that\u2019s true. This is born out of a close but fairly quiet relationship. Taiwan is Singapore\u2019s fifth-largest trading partner and a large investor. That continues. On what you were referring to earlier: the longstanding unilateral training we have in Taiwan\u2014our armed forces essentially rent land from Taiwan to train. There are specific reasons. If you think about where the Imperial Japanese military trained before invading Malaya, it was southern Taiwan. So there are similarities in geography that are useful. Some of the training has been scaled back as places in Australia have become available. It\u2019s not a secret, but it\u2019s not widely publicized, that the ROC military had a big role in helping Singapore set up our armed forces\u2014especially the air force and the navy. Some early senior leadership in the air force and navy were ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asia who had served their careers in the ROC navy or air force, and then were brought over to set up our air force and navy in Singapore.\r\n\r\nTheater-Wide Coercion and Regional Responses\r\n\r\nMike Green: The ties that Singapore, Japan, and others have to Taiwan are deep and interesting. But the general debate about Taiwan in governments in the region\u2014outside Japan\u2014is a bit outdated and doesn\u2019t fully take into account a democratic Taiwan. It\u2019s convenient to assume Taiwan is not democratizing, or to see democratization as a problem because it brings out voices that upset China. Other than Japan\u2014and I suppose the U.S., although there are problems\u2014a lot of governments haven\u2019t adjusted to the new reality and what\u2019s at stake. People also haven\u2019t adjusted to the new Chinese leadership. For a long time, leaders in China were willing to live with\u2014unhappy, but willing to live with\u2014a certain space for Taiwan. That\u2019s decreasingly the case with the current PRC leadership. If you look at the Anti-Secession Law and explanations, anything short of Taiwan accepting PRC control can be couched by Beijing as destabilizing and provocative. Many regional governments are not willing to challenge that view that Beijing is pushing the envelope much more than before. The other thing governments need to wake up to: the PLA\u2019s campaign plan for coercing Taiwan is not a cross-Strait campaign; it\u2019s a theater-wide campaign. You can see rehearsals in the PLA Navy surface action group that circumnavigated Japan, actions in the Yellow Sea west of Korea, the South China Sea, and between Guam and Japan. These maneuvers are portrayed in national presses as bilateral problems, but they\u2019re not. It\u2019s a pattern and part of a broader Chinese strategy. Militaries and intelligence services know that. It gets back to the strategic wisdom of the Schlieffen Plan versus grand strategy\u2014the folly of aligning all your adversaries. We\u2019ll see if it does, but conditions are ripe for governments\u2014if we can sort out tariffs and so on\u2014to work in concert.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: The issue for a lot of Southeast Asian governments\u2014including my own in Singapore\u2014is that there is understanding of the situation you\u2019ve described, but also a belief that the Americans will take care of it, the Japanese will take care of it, together with the Australians. We just have to lean back, not get our hands dirty, and see how we can profit. This fairly opportunistic and passive approach is exactly what could get us into trouble if we want to avoid World War I or World War II scenarios. If governments were more active in saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept the use of force. You have your differences; resolve them in other ways,\u201d there could be a much stronger voice. But there\u2019s a lot of unwillingness. Look at UNCLOS and the arbitral tribunal ruling with the Philippines\u2014that\u2019s international law. Singapore and others say international law is important, UNCLOS is important, but they\u2019ve largely backed away from talking about these things because they\u2019re afraid of PRC punishment. If this is something you believe in and think is important, you have to put your money where your mouth is.\r\n\r\nGray-Zone Pressure and Societal Resilience\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: I\u2019d add one more element about the theater: the gray-zone stuff, which I find very concerning. The PRC is engaging, in the pre-crisis or pre-conflict phase, in a lot of information operations, cyber activities, and influence operations in Southeast Asia, which is highly pluralistic, playing on cleavages. I can understand from Chinese interests why you\u2019d do it, but it could really rip at the fabric of these societies, including in Singapore\u2014playing different actors, playing on the ethnic card. That could be very dangerous and is underappreciated. Security services are aware of it, but at the political level there\u2019s concern that if you go hard on this, it could really upset Beijing\u2014so let\u2019s not do that.\r\n\r\nMike Green: Fragmenting societies and weakening national resolve is the whole point. We\u2019ll see if governments wake up to that beyond just the security services and police.\r\n\r\nClosing\r\n\r\nMike Green: We could keep going for hours\u2014great, wide-ranging discussion. We did leadership, history, IR theory, Singaporean bureaucratic politics. Many thanks, Ian\u2014Ja Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. We\u2019ll look for your next great work and have you on again.\r\n\r\nJa Ian Chong: Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nMike Green: For more on strategy and the Asia Program\u2019s work, visit the CSIS website at csis.org and click on the Asia Program page.

Below is a critical analysis organised by major thematic areas.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Use of Historical Precedent\n\nBoth Mike Green and Ja Ian Chong lean heavily on the World War I and II analogies. The Schlieffen Plan parallel is well chosen in highlighting the danger of military operational logic crowding out grand strategy. The point that pre-1914 leaders underestimated escalation dynamics\u2014and that East Asia\u2019s maritime flashpoints could merge into a single theatre\u2014is analytically strong.\n\nHowever, the conversation risks over-reliance on historical rhyming. While the parallels with imperial Germany and 1930s Japan are instructive, the PRC\u2019s situation in 2025 has unique constraints and tools\u2014nuclear deterrence, globalised finance, and high interdependence\u2014that complicate the simple mapping of pre-WWI or pre-WWII logics. The risk is that the analogy can shape threat perception more than ground reality warrants, potentially reinforcing a self-fulfilling prophecy of confrontation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Assessment of China\u2019s Strategic Posture\n\nJa Ian Chong\u2019s description of Beijing\u2019s hybrid approach\u2014military, \u201cgray-zone\u201d tactics, nationalism\u2014conveys a nuanced understanding of how coercion operates short of war. His linking of European interest in Asia to Chinese actions (e.g., support for Russia, risky maritime activities) underscores the boomerang effect of over-securitised strategy.\n\nWhere the analysis is strong is in pointing out the bandwagoning risk: China\u2019s moves, intended to pre-empt opposition, can instead galvanise it. What is less developed is how China internally perceives these dynamics; the discussion frames them primarily from an external, Western/ASEAN perspective, leaving PRC domestic drivers underexplored.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Economic Decoupling and Ideational Conflict\n\nThe conversation\u2019s link between economic decoupling, ideological competition, and weakened crisis-management mechanisms is compelling. The \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\u201d analogy, while provocative, draws attention to the geographical overlap of historical and current spheres of influence.\n\nA possible shortcoming is that economic decoupling is treated largely as a top-down, state-driven process. The resilience and adaptiveness of transnational business networks, supply chain innovation, and parallel institutional structures in Asia could counteract some of the rigidities the speakers see as inevitable.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Singapore\u2019s Strategic Dilemma\n\nThis is perhaps the transcript\u2019s richest section. Chong recognises that Singapore\u2019s Cold War-era strategy of \u201cnot choosing sides\u201d is eroding as both the U.S. and PRC impose economic and political costs. The acknowledgment that Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s playbook may not be directly transferable to today\u2019s deglobalising, more ideological environment is a rare piece of candour in Singaporean strategic discourse.\n\nThe discussion is less clear, however, on what *concrete* strategic vision could replace the old one. While diversification of partners (India, EU, Australia, Korea, Japan) is mentioned, it is presented more as a tactical adjustment than a coherent grand strategy.\n\n---\n\n## 5. ASEAN Reform Debate\n\nThe \u201ccow versus tractor\u201d metaphor is a vivid way to frame ASEAN\u2019s institutional inertia. The critique\u2014that ASEAN\u2019s consensus model slows escalation but fails to act decisively in crises\u2014is well supported. Chong\u2019s incremental suggestions (increase Secretariat budget, improve bureaucratic capacity) are realistic, though they stop short of addressing the deeper political reluctance of member states to cede authority.\n\nThe conversation lightly touches on minilateral options within ASEAN (\u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d), but does not explore the potential backlash or fragmentation risks if such coalitions bypass ASEAN\u2019s centrality.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Leadership and Institutional Culture\n\nThe transcript offers an unusually critical view of Singapore\u2019s current leadership culture: fewer ideational entrepreneurs, more bureaucratic conformity, and a system that discourages bold, dissenting voices. The historical reference to Lee\u2019s \u201cfirst among equals\u201d cabinet is apt, but the argument that institutionalisation has crowded out innovation raises a tension\u2014institutions normally provide stability, yet here they are seen as blocking adaptation.\n\nThis critique could have been enriched by considering how Singapore might institutionalise *mechanisms for dissent* within its policy process, thereby regaining some of the benefits of the earlier, more improvisational era.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Taiwan and Theatre-Wide Dynamics\n\nThe section on Taiwan correctly links the island\u2019s strategic position to wider Northeast\u2013Southeast Asian stability. Chong\u2019s point that many regional governments have outdated views of Taiwan, failing to account for its democratic transformation, is important.\n\nThe discussion of the PLA\u2019s theatre-wide campaign plan adds analytical depth\u2014highlighting that Taiwan contingencies cannot be siloed as purely cross-Strait issues. Where the conversation falls short is in offering specific policy prescriptions for how smaller states like Singapore could contribute to deterrence without provoking Beijing.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Gray-Zone and Societal Resilience\n\nChong\u2019s warning about PRC influence operations exploiting ethnic and political cleavages in Southeast Asia is one of the most under-acknowledged but urgent themes. The political reluctance to confront Beijing over such activities, for fear of economic retaliation, points to a structural vulnerability.\n\nThis is one area where the conversation could have been more forward-leaning: suggesting concrete countermeasures (public resilience campaigns, media literacy, cyber defence cooperation) would have made the warning more actionable.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Evaluation\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Rich historical framing, with apt if sometimes overstretched analogies.\n- Clear-eyed realism about ASEAN\u2019s limits and Singapore\u2019s narrowing room for manoeuvre.\n- Willingness to challenge national myths about Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s strategic model.\n- Inclusion of under-discussed topics (gray-zone operations, outdated Taiwan perceptions).\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Heavy reliance on Western-centric historical frames without equal weighting of PRC internal perspectives.\n- Limited exploration of non-state and market-driven adaptive mechanisms in a decoupling world.\n- Few detailed prescriptions for Singapore beyond diversification and \u201cmore partners.\u201d\n- ASEAN reform discussion focuses on bureaucratic fixes rather than deeper political redesign.\n- Gray-zone threat discussion ends at problem diagnosis without actionable policy pathways.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also produce a **synthesis report** from this transcript that distils the strategic takeaways into **Singapore-specific policy options**, structured as an internal government briefing. That would make the insights directly actionable."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"96becdf55f1634c9-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"b8e5f0f1-337d-4f15-b555-5995dac73632","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b8e5f0f1-337d-4f15-b555-5995dac73632","children":[]}}}
