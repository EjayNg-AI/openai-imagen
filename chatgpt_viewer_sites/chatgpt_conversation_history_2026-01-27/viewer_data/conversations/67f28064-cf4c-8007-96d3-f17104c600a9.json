Since gaining independence in 1965, Singapore\u2019s leaders have emphasized that harmony among races and religions is **fundamental** to the nation\u2019s survival\u30105\u2020L219-L227\u3011\u301023\u2020L13-L21\u3011. This commitment was born from painful experience: communal riots in 1964 had torn at Singapore\u2019s social fabric just a year before independence, leaving dozens dead and hundreds injured\u30105\u2020L232-L241\u3011\u30105\u2020L244-L252\u3011. Stability was by no means assured; rather, as Singapore\u2019s government later reflected, **racial harmony \u201cdid not come about by chance\u201d but through hard work and conscious effort**\u301032\u2020L54-L62\u3011. Over the decades, Singapore has implemented a comprehensive suite of policies, laws, and community initiatives to foster social cohesion. These range from constitutional safeguards and education policies, to housing integration and strict laws against hate speech, as well as interfaith dialogues and grassroots outreach programs. As a result, Singapore today is often cited as a model of inter-communal harmony \u2013 for example, a global Gallup poll in 2019 ranked Singapore **highest out of 124 countries** for acceptance of ethnic minorities\u301010\u2020L273-L281\u3011. Yet this harmonious society is **\u201ca constant work in progress\u201d**, continually reinforced to meet new challenges and never taken for granted\u301032\u2020L95-L102\u3011. \n\nThis report provides an in-depth analysis of how Singapore has maintained internal societal stability and fostered social cohesion from 1965 to 2025. It begins with a broad historical overview of major policy milestones that shaped racial and religious harmony, then examines recent developments of the past decade (2015\u20132025). Both top-down policy mechanisms (e.g. legislation, institutions, education and housing policies) and bottom-up community efforts (e.g. interfaith dialogues, grassroots initiatives) are discussed. Finally, Singapore\u2019s approach is considered in light of global and regional dynamics \u2013 especially the **fragile racial and religious tensions in Southeast Asia** \u2013 to understand how external events have influenced domestic cohesion strategies. Throughout, credible sources including government statements, academic analyses and policy research are used to document Singapore\u2019s experience in building a cohesive multicultural society. \n\n## Historical Overview: Nation-Building for Harmony (1965\u20132000)  \n\n### Early Independence Years (1965\u20131970s)  \nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore became an independent republic after a brief union with Malaysia. From the outset, multiracialism was adopted as a **foundational national principle**\u30105\u2020L219-L227\u3011. In his first National Day message, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew vowed to build \u201c**a multi-racial nation in Singapore**\u201d where every community could integrate fully yet preserve its culture and faith\u30106\u2020L323-L331\u3011. This was a direct response to the tensions that had led to Singapore\u2019s split from Malaysia \u2013 whereas Malaysian politics emphasized Malay primacy, Singapore\u2019s leaders insisted on **equal status for all races** (the ideal of a \u201cMalaysian Malaysia\u201d)\u301023\u2020L13-L21\u3011. The new nation\u2019s ideology was enshrined in its National Pledge (first recited in 1966) which calls for unity \u201cregardless of race, language or religion,\u201d and in provisions of the 1965 Constitution guaranteeing all citizens equal protection of the law regardless of race or religion\u30101\u2020L223-L232\u3011\u30101\u2020L227-L234\u3011. Article 152 of the Constitution also acknowledged the special position of the indigenous Malay community, committing the state to support Malay interests in areas like education and culture\u30101\u2020L241-L250\u3011 \u2013 a signal that minority rights would be safeguarded even as meritocracy prevailed. \n\nSeveral early policies set the stage for social cohesion. Education was quickly leveraged as a tool for integration. A **bilingual education policy** was introduced from the late 1960s, requiring every student to learn English (the chosen working language) plus their own \u201cMother Tongue\u201d (Mandarin for Chinese students, Malay for Malays, Tamil for most Indians)\u30101\u2020L258-L266\u3011\u30109\u2020L215-L223\u3011. **English** as the lingua franca put all races on an equal footing and eased communication among communities, without elevating any one ethnic language in official status\u30109\u2020L215-L223\u3011. At the same time, preserving mother tongues as second languages helped each group retain its cultural heritage, and **Malay was symbolically retained as the National Language** in recognition of the Malay community\u2019s heritage\u30109\u2020L217-L223\u3011. Schools that had previously been divided into Chinese-, Malay- or Tamil-medium began to converge toward a national curriculum. By the 1970s and 1980s, most schools used English as the main medium, bringing children of different races together in classrooms and instilling common national values (a process reinforced by nationwide **civics and history curricula emphasising multiculturalism**\u301032\u2020L74-L82\u3011\u301031\u2020L67-L76\u3011). In addition, **National Service (military conscription)** was introduced in 1967 for 18-year-old males, which over time became another integrative rite of passage: young men of all races trained and served together in the armed forces, police or civil defence, forging bonds of camaraderie (even though in the first decade some limitations were placed on Malays in sensitive military roles, these were later relaxed as trust grew)\u30103\u2020L337-L345\u3011. \n\nCrucially, the government also moved to **institutionalize safeguards for minority rights** early on. In 1970, the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) was established as a constitutional watchdog to scrutinize all proposed laws, ensuring they contain no provisions discriminatory to any racial or religious community\u301015\u2020L1-L9\u3011. Any bill flagged by the PCMR for potentially disadvantaging a minority can be reconsidered before it becomes law. This council \u2013 comprising distinguished citizens from various communities \u2013 thus acts as an \u201cupper chamber\u201d reviewing legislation through a multiracial lens. Together, these early measures in politics, education and social policy laid the groundwork for a **national identity based on multiracial equality and secular governance**, in stark contrast to many of Singapore\u2019s neighbors at the time. \n\nCommunity relations in those formative years were also aided by **grassroots efforts and symbolism**. The Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), a voluntary interfaith council established in 1949, played a calming role during the 1964 riots and continued into independence, with religious leaders jointly calling for peace and visiting affected communities\u30106\u2020L317-L325\u3011. Such gestures demonstrated unity among different faiths at the leadership level. The People\u2019s Association (PA) \u2013 a statutory board formed in 1960 to promote community bonding \u2013 organized **Goodwill Committees** in neighborhoods after the 1964 clashes to rebuild trust\u301035\u2020L138-L146\u3011. These early grassroots initiatives showed that beyond government policy, ordinary citizens and community leaders had a part to play in mending the social fabric. By the end of the 1960s, Singapore had survived its initial communal troubles and was shaping a **national ethos of racial and religious harmony**, even as it remained vigilant to extinguish any embers of sectarian strife.\n\n### Consolidating Harmony Policies (1980s\u20131990s)  \nFrom the 1980s through the 1990s, Singapore introduced a series of **innovative policy mechanisms to further institutionalize social cohesion**, while also responding to new societal trends. One major focus was preventing the formation of ethnic enclaves in residential areas. In 1989, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) \u2013 Singapore\u2019s public housing authority \u2013 implemented the **Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)**, a landmark urban policy to ensure that each public housing block and neighborhood has a mix of residents that broadly reflects the national racial proportions\u30103\u2020L308-L316\u3011. This quota system **caps the percentage** of units in any block that can be owned by a particular ethnic group. The goal is to **deliberately mix communities** and avoid segregated \u201cChinatown\u201d, \u201cLittle India\u201d or \u201cMalay village\u201d districts. Over 80% of Singapore\u2019s population lives in HDB estates, so the impact has been profound: within a few decades, **public housing estates became microcosms of Singapore\u2019s diversity**, with neighbors of different races interacting daily \u2013 at common corridors, markets, playgrounds and food centers\u301010\u2020L249-L258\u3011\u301010\u2020L251-L259\u3011. Common public spaces like void decks (ground-floor open spaces in apartment blocks) are often used for multicultural activities \u2013 Malay weddings, Chinese funeral rites, community meetings \u2013 familiarizing all residents with each other\u2019s customs\u30106\u2020L369-L377\u3011\u301010\u2020L253-L261\u3011. This social engineering via housing policy is frequently cited as a cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s harmony, ensuring no community is geographically isolated. As then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said of the EIP\u2019s importance: \u201cracially segregated neighbourhoods limit opportunities to build trust\u201d, whereas integrated living helps **expand the common space** shared by all\u301025\u2020L503-L510\u3011\u301032\u2020L74-L82\u3011. \n\nReforms in the **political system** also bolstered minority representation and moderation during this period. In 1988, Singapore introduced the **Group Representation Constituency (GRC)** scheme for Parliamentary elections. Under this system, electoral districts (especially larger ones) are contested by teams of candidates, and each team **must include at least one member of a minority race** (Malay, Indian or Other)\u30101\u2020L289-L294\u3011. This ensures that Parliament cannot be entirely dominated by members of the Chinese majority; every GRC elects a mixed slate reflecting Singapore\u2019s multiracial society. The GRC system, alongside a norm that political parties themselves are multi-ethnic in composition, prevents the emergence of race-based parties or exclusive racial appeals during campaigns. Indeed, **exploiting race or religion for political points is firmly disallowed** \u2013 a stance reiterated by all major parties that **communal politicking \u201chas no place\u201d in Singapore\u2019s politics**\u301025\u2020L479-L487\u3011\u301025\u2020L497-L504\u3011. In 1991, the Constitution was amended to create the office of an Elected President (previously ceremonial), and provisions were later added (in 2016) to mandate **periodic \u201creserved elections\u201d for President** if no candidate from a major minority community has held the office for too long\u30103\u2020L297-L304\u3011. This culminated in 2017 with Singapore\u2019s first reserved Presidential Election, which ensured the head of state position went to a qualified minority (Madam Halimah Yacob became Singapore\u2019s first female President and first Malay head of state in 47 years). Such measures at the highest levels of government reinforce the principle that **all communities have a stake and representation** in Singapore\u2019s governance.\n\nSocial policy in the 1980s\u201390s also saw the government partnering with community groups to uplift all segments of society, thereby preventing resentment. **Ethnic-based self-help groups** were encouraged to form and complement state welfare efforts. For example, the Malay community\u2019s Mendaki was formed in 1982 to improve educational attainment; the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) in 1992 and Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) in 1991 were established for the Chinese and Indian communities respectively. While education and social support are open to all, these organizations provided *targeted help* (tuition, job assistance, bursaries) within each community to address specific needs and close gaps. The government facilitated these groups by arranging a small **contribution from workers\u2019 monthly CPF (pension) savings to community funds** (opt-out if desired), meaning each working citizen contributes a token sum to their community\u2019s self-help group by default\u30103\u2020L322-L331\u3011. This system, started in the 1990s, fostered responsibility within each ethnic community to help their own, *while* keeping the overall society cohesive and avoiding large disparities. Crucially, these groups have themselves often collaborated on joint projects and are seen as part of the broader social safety net rather than insular charities.\n\nAmid growing religiosity worldwide in the 1980s, Singapore also enacted laws to preempt and manage **religious tensions**. The **Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA)** was passed in 1990 \u2013 a rare piece of legislation specifically empowering the government to act against persons who incite inter-religious hostility or use religion to pursue political ends. Under this law, authorities (with Presidential concurrence) can issue restraining orders against clerics or groups who cause ill-will between faiths or prompt disaffection against the government under the guise of religion\u30109\u2020L199-L204\u3011. The Act was partly a response to incidents of aggressive proselytization and **religious over-zealousness in the late 1980s**, and it underscored Singapore\u2019s stance as a secular state that nevertheless protects every faith from insult or attack. To support the MRHA, a **Presidential Council for Religious Harmony** was also established to advise on such matters (analogous to the PCMR but focusing on religious community interests). Although rarely invoked, the MRHA\u2019s very existence serves as a **deterrent against extremist behaviors** and a reassurance that authorities can step in before any conflict escalates. Laws such as the Sedition Act, Penal Code provisions, and later the Internet Code of Practice further buttressed this protective legal framework \u2013 making it an offence to instigate racial/religious hatred or disturb the public harmony. Singapore\u2019s leadership has consistently maintained that **strong legal guardrails are needed** given how easily hate speech or sectarian propaganda could tear society apart, citing examples from less-regulated societies; as one minister put it, without tough laws against offensive speech, \u201cthe tone and texture of public discourse\u2026 will change\u201d and may eventually lead to discrimination or violence\u301025\u2020L463-L471\u3011.\n\nCulturally, the 1990s saw greater public emphasis on celebrating diversity and **educating the young about harmony**. In 1997 the Ministry of Education introduced **Racial Harmony Day** \u2013 observed on 21 July each year (the anniversary of the 1964 riots) \u2013 to remind students of the consequences of racial strife and to encourage appreciation of each other\u2019s cultures\u30103\u2020L351-L359\u3011. Schools commemorate the day with heritage dress, food and inter-cultural activities, and this observance has since extended into the community. By the end of the 20th century, Singapore had thus built a **multi-layered framework for cohesion**: constitutional principles (secularism, multiracialism, meritocracy)\u301032\u2020L65-L73\u3011, social engineering tools (housing, electoral rules, bilingualism), legal safeguards (acts against incitement), and ongoing community engagement and education to nurture **common norms of respect**. The payoffs were visible \u2013 Singapore experienced no recurrence of large-scale communal violence after 1969, and indicators of social trust were on the rise. Indeed, an ethos of **\u201ccommon spaces\u201d** and **overlapping identities** was gradually taking root: Singaporeans of different races worked in the same offices, studied in the same schools, served in the army together, and increasingly shared a sense of being \u201cone people\u201d despite different ancestries\u301032\u2020L80-L87\u3011.\n\n### Strengthening Cohesion in a New Millennium (2000s)  \nEntering the 21st century, Singapore\u2019s social cohesion was tested and further refined in the face of new challenges: global terrorism, the influx of immigrants, and evolving social attitudes. The 2000s can be characterized by a shift from simply **preventing conflicts to proactively building resilience and trust**, especially at the community level. A watershed moment came with the **September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks** in the United States and the subsequent discovery of a regional Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terror cell operating in Singapore. These events jolted Singapore\u2019s leadership to the reality that a terror incident, especially one implicating a particular religious group, could shatter the hard-won harmony. In response, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong launched new platforms to cement inter-religious trust **before any crisis hit**. In 2002, **Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs)** were established in every constituency\u301018\u2020L73-L80\u3011. These IRCCs \u2013 informal local networks of religious and community leaders \u2013 aimed to build familiarity and friendship across faiths at the grassroots. Members regularly visit each other\u2019s places of worship, jointly celebrate festivals, and are prepared to come together to calm and guide their respective communities should any incident threaten social peace. The IRCC initiative, born in the shadow of 9/11, has since grown into a nationwide institution for **interfaith dialogue and emergency preparedness**. (In 2006, \u201cIRCC\u201d was even renamed to *Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle* \u2013 explicitly including the religious dimension in its title \u2013 and by 2022 the nomenclature evolved to **Racial and Religious Harmony Circles** to reflect their ongoing role in harmony-building\u301018\u2020L79-L87\u3011\u301018\u2020L97-L100\u3011.) \n\nComplementing the IRCCs, the government in 2006 launched the **Community Engagement Programme (CEP)**\u301018\u2020L75-L80\u3011. The CEP was a multi-pronged strategy to involve various sectors \u2013 grassroots organizations, schools, businesses, media \u2013 in strengthening inter-community bonds and emergency readiness. It provided dialogue platforms and training so that, for example, workplaces had **response teams** to handle racial tensions in a crisis, and youth learned about the importance of standing together against extremist threats. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong described the CEP as a *\u201clong-term effort to ensure that we maintain social cohesion and harmony, should a crisis happen\u201d*\u301017\u2020L5-L12\u3011. The lessons of events like the 2005 London bombings (which sparked some backlash against Muslims in the UK) were not lost on Singapore \u2013 the CEP and IRCCs were essentially **insurance policies** for social cohesion, ensuring that **community leaders could act as bridges and \u201cfirst responders\u201d to dispel rumors and fears** in the critical moments after any terror or racial incident\u301035\u2020L138-L146\u3011.\n\nAnother significant trend addressed in the 2000s was the rapid growth of Singapore\u2019s foreign workforce and immigrant population. As globalization accelerated, Singapore welcomed large numbers of migrant workers and new immigrants (for economic and demographic reasons). By the late 2000s, concerns arose about integration \u2013 whether the social fabric could hold with many newcomers of different cultural backgrounds. In 2009, the government set up the **National Integration Council (NIC)** to spearhead integration initiatives across the public, private and people sectors\u301028\u2020L15-L19\u3011. *\u201cThat is why we started the National Integration Council in 2009 \u2013 to specifically address the integration of locals, foreigners and immigrants,\u201d* explained a minister in charge\u301029\u2020L113-L121\u3011. The NIC coordinates programs that encourage interaction between Singaporeans and newcomers, promotes inclusive workplaces and schools, and supports ground-up integration projects. One such effort is the **Integration and Naturalisation Champions (INC)** scheme, where grassroots volunteers help introduce new citizens and residents to local customs and community activities\u301029\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301029\u2020L125-L129\u3011. Through community clubs, welcome parties, and orientation programs, immigrants are gradually drawn into Singapore\u2019s social rhythms, mitigating the risk of social fragmentation along native-vs-foreigner lines. This became increasingly crucial as Singapore\u2019s proportion of foreign-born residents climbed in the 2010s. \n\nThroughout the 2000s, existing strategies continued to be enforced and refined. The housing Ethnic Integration Policy was sustained (and adjusted when needed to account for demographic shifts). Education on multiculturalism was enhanced \u2013 **National Education** programs in schools (introduced from 1997) emphasized key messages of unity and the dangers of racial discord by referencing both local history and global events. The **media and arts** were also co-opted in spreading harmony narratives; for instance, television programming often features multiracial casts and storylines, and mass events like **Chingay** (an annual street parade originally for Chinese New Year) were transformed into showcases of all cultures\u301021\u2020L233-L239\u3011. The People\u2019s Association and community centers ramped up **cross-cultural events** \u2013 from ethnic music/dance performances to neighborhood festive celebrations open to all. One example is **Gentarasa**, a festival initiated in 2002 to share Malay culture with the broader society while involving multi-ethnic audiences and performers\u301021\u2020L221-L230\u3011. Similarly, **OnePeople.sg (OPSG)** was launched as a national-level NGO in 2007 to champion racial harmony, providing a platform for dialogues, youth workshops and public education on race issues\u301021\u2020L253-L261\u3011. OPSG, which works closely with government and community partners, runs an annual HarmonyWorks Conference for students and other programs to **tackle stereotypes and encourage cross-cultural friendships**\u301021\u2020L240-L248\u3011\u301021\u2020L253-L261\u3011. These efforts indicate that by the 2000s, Singapore\u2019s approach to cohesion was not only reactive (preventing violence) but also **proactive and holistic** \u2013 involving **schools, housing estates, workplaces, religious organizations and media** in the collective project of nation-building.\n\nBy 2010, Singapore could point to a track record of stable ethnic relations even during times of potential strain. For instance, when a rare riot broke out in Little India in 2013 (involving South Asian foreign workers angered by a traffic accident), the incident was swiftly contained and framed as a public order issue rather than a racial conflict, with community groups (including Indian and Bangladeshi worker associations) stepping up to restore calm. The absence of ethnic overtones in public reaction was seen as a testament to the maturity of Singapore\u2019s social cohesion. Surveys and studies around this time continued to show robust indicators: e.g. increasing numbers of Singaporeans reported having close friends of other races and higher levels of trust in people of other faiths\u301010\u2020L285-L294\u3011. Nevertheless, new **fault lines** \u2013 such as those between locals and immigrants, or subtler forms of racial bias in everyday life \u2013 required attention, setting the stage for the initiatives of the 2015\u20132025 decade.\n\n**Table: Milestones in Singapore\u2019s Social Cohesion Policies (1965\u20132025)**\n\n| Year | Policy/Initiative | Description & Impact |\n|------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **1965** | **Independence and National Pledge** | Singapore becomes independent (Aug 1965). Founding PM Lee Kuan Yew declares a vision of **\u201cone united people, regardless of race, language or religion,\u201d** rejecting racial dominance\u301023\u2020L13-L21\u3011. The National Pledge, introduced in 1966, enshrines multiracial ideals in schools and public ceremonies. |\n| **1970** | **Presidential Council for Minority Rights** | A constitutional council is established to scrutinize new laws for discrimination. It can flag bills that **differentially affect any racial or religious community**, ensuring legislation upholds equality\u301015\u2020L1-L9\u3011. This became a formal guardian of minority rights in policymaking. |\n| **1970s** | **Bilingual Education Policy** | By the late 1960s\u201370s, schools adopt English as the main medium of instruction (common language for all), while students also learn their Mother Tongue. This policy fosters communication across groups without privileging any one ethnic language\u30109\u2020L215-L223\u3011. It also preserves cultural roots via second-language learning. |\n| **1989** | **Ethnic Integration Policy (Housing)** | Implemented by HDB to **prevent ethnic enclaves**. Ethnic quotas in public housing ensure each block/neighborhood reflects Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic mix\u30103\u2020L308-L316\u3011. This creates daily interactions in shared spaces and norms of living together among races, strengthening communal bonds. |\n| **1988\u201391** | **Electoral Multiracialism** | The Group Representation Constituency (**GRC**) system is introduced (1988) requiring multi-racial candidate teams in elections\u30101\u2020L289-L294\u3011. Also, a constitutional amendment (1990) establishes that minority Presidents are guaranteed periodically (first **reserved election** held in 2017)\u30103\u2020L297-L304\u3011. These ensure minorities have a voice in Parliament and the Presidency. |\n| **1990** | **Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act** | Enacted to preempt sectarian strife. It empowers authorities to **restrain or sanction any instigation of inter-religious hatred** or political exploitation of religion\u30109\u2020L199-L204\u3011. Together with existing laws (Sedition Act, Penal Code), it forms a legal bulwark against hate speech and extremism. |\n| **1997** | **Racial Harmony Day** | Launched in schools on 21 July (anniversary of 1964 riots) to educate youth on racial riots\u2019 lessons and celebrate multiculturalism\u30103\u2020L351-L359\u3011. Students wear ethnic costumes, share cuisines, and learn about each other\u2019s cultures. The annual event has since been observed community-wide, reinforcing historical awareness and mutual respect. |\n| **2002** | **Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs)** | Formed in every constituency in the wake of 9/11, as local interfaith networks\u301018\u2020L73-L80\u3011. IRCCs bring leaders of different religions and races together for dialogues, visits, and to build trust **so that in any crisis, they can jointly quell misinformation and keep social cohesion**. (Renamed Racial and Religious Harmony Circles in 2022). |\n| **2006** | **Community Engagement Programme (CEP)** | A national program launched to involve community, religious, business, and education sectors in **strengthening social cohesion and emergency preparedness**\u301018\u2020L75-L80\u3011. It includes workshops, scenario exercises, and outreach to ensure society stays united if racial or terror incidents occur. |\n| **2007** | **OnePeople.sg (OPSG)** | A ground-up initiative (supported by the state) to champion racial harmony projects\u301021\u2020L253-L261\u3011. OPSG conducts youth forums, training, dialogues, and public campaigns to address racism and deepen understanding. It symbolizes the institutionalization of **community-driven harmony advocacy**. |\n| **2009** | **National Integration Council (NIC)** | Set up to **integrate immigrants and new citizens** into Singapore society\u301029\u2020L113-L121\u3011. It funds and coordinates integration programs at workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. Under NIC, Integration & Naturalisation Champions (INC) at grassroots help organize activities that bridge locals and newcomers, preserving social unity amid diversity. |\n| **2010s** | **Social Media and Harmony Initiatives** | As use of social media grows, authorities increase vigilance against online racial or religious **misinformation**. New protocols and eventually legislation (e.g. Protection from Online Falsehoods Act 2019) are put in place to swiftly counter rumors that could inflame tensions. Community groups also expand **digital outreach** promoting positive narratives of diversity. |\n| **2017** | **Reserved Presidential Election** | A Constitutional mechanism is triggered to rotate the presidency among ethnic groups if none from a group has been President for 5 consecutive terms\u30103\u2020L297-L304\u3011. In 2017, an election was reserved for Malay candidates, resulting in Madam Halimah Yacob becoming President. This illustrated Singapore\u2019s commitment to **symbolic representation** at the highest level. |\n| **2019** | **Updates to Harmony Laws & Infrastructure** | The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act is **updated** to strengthen provisions (e.g. tackling foreign influence and online incitement)\u30109\u2020L199-L204\u3011. A new *Harmony in Diversity Gallery* (an interfaith education gallery) and other initiatives are launched to educate the public on Singapore\u2019s religious diversity and the importance of harmony. Studies find rising indicators of trust and interaction among communities\u301010\u2020L283-L292\u3011, validating past efforts. |\n| **2021** | **Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act** | A new Act passed by Parliament (in force 2022) to **consolidate racial harmony measures** and introduce community-based rehabilitative options for offenders. For instance, someone who commits an act provoking racial tensions may be required to apologize or attend educational programmes, rather than just face punishment\u30105\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u30105\u2020L214-L223\u3011. This law signals a continued **zero-tolerance for racism** while promoting reconciliation. It also formally establishes a **Presidential Council for Religious and Racial Harmony**, enhancing advisory oversight\u30105\u2020L198-L204\u3011. |\n| **2020s** | **Ongoing and Future Efforts** | Singapore persists with a balanced approach: strict enforcement against hate speech or discrimination, **expanding common spaces** (e.g. new housing estates adhere to integration principles), and encouraging **open conversations on race and religion** especially among youth. Recent years saw national discussions on race (prompted by a few high-profile racist incidents in 2021), with leaders urging candid yet respectful dialogue as society matures. The ethos remains that harmony can always be improved, and each generation must renew the commitment. |\n\n*Sources:* Key data drawn from government releases and analyses\u30103\u2020L308-L316\u3011\u30109\u2020L199-L204\u3011\u301018\u2020L73-L80\u3011\u301021\u2020L253-L261\u3011\u301029\u2020L113-L121\u3011.\n\n## Recent Developments and Initiatives (2015\u20132025)  \nIn the last decade, roughly 2015 to 2025, Singapore\u2019s social cohesion measures have both deepened and broadened, responding to emerging trends. A major theme has been **addressing social cohesion in a more nuanced and consultative way**, as the population becomes more educated and discourse on race/religion evolves (often via social media). \n\nOne significant step was Singapore\u2019s decision to **ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD)** in November 2017 (after signing in 2015 on the 50th anniversary of independence)\u301032\u2020L89-L97\u3011. Although Singapore\u2019s laws already largely met the convention\u2019s standards, ratification underscored an international commitment to keep improving in areas like addressing subtle racial biases or ensuring equality of opportunity. Following this, new mechanisms were explored to strengthen harmony. In 2018, for example, the government convened national-level dialogues \u2013 including interfaith conferences and youth discussions \u2013 acknowledging that as society changes, **maintaining harmony must go beyond top-down policy** to involve frank conversation among citizens about race, religion, and even immigrant integration. One notable event was the **International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS)** hosted in June 2019 (with Singapore\u2019s President as patron), bringing local and global experts together to share best practices in interfaith and inter-ethnic relations. Such events signaled Singapore\u2019s readiness to position itself as a **thought leader in managing diversity**, learning from and contributing to global discourse.\n\nOn the policy front, several updates were made to existing frameworks. The **Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA)** underwent its first major amendments in 2019 since 1990, to account for contemporary challenges. Key changes included provisions to counter **online incitement** (recognizing that inflammatory content on social media could spark discord) and to **curb foreign interference** in local religious groups (preventing overseas actors from funding or influencing communities in ways that could threaten harmony)\u30109\u2020L199-L204\u3011. Punishments under the Act were recalibrated and the process streamlined to act more nimbly if necessary. Not long after, the government decided to enact a parallel law addressing racial harmony explicitly: the **Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act (MRHA)** \u2013 note: distinct from the *religious* harmony law \u2013 was passed in Parliament in 2021 and came into effect in 2022\u301013\u2020L23-L27\u3011. This law largely consolidates existing legal provisions (from the Penal Code, etc.) on racist offences under one statute, but also introduces **softer measures** like community remediation. For instance, an individual who makes a racist public remark might be issued an order to apologize or to attend an educational program on diversity, as an alternative or complement to fines/jail\u30105\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u30105\u2020L214-L223\u3011. The Act also sets up a new **body under the President to advise on racial and religious harmony** (merging some functions of the old PCMR and the religious harmony council)\u30105\u2020L198-L204\u3011. Collectively, these moves refresh the legal infrastructure to keep it relevant. As the Home Affairs Minister explained, the aim is not to create entirely new norms but to **\u201cunderline that racial harmony is fundamental\u201d** to Singapore, and to assure the public that there are avenues to deal with racism firmly yet constructively\u30105\u2020L214-L223\u3011\u30105\u2020L220-L227\u3011.\n\nAnother area of focus in recent years has been **combating racism and prejudice in everyday life** through education and social campaigns. While overt racial conflict is absent, there has been greater recognition of subtle discrimination or stereotypes that some minorities may face (for example, at workplaces or in dating and friendship patterns). The government and NGOs like OnePeople.sg have responded with initiatives to raise awareness and encourage introspection. In 2021, after several incidents (such as videos of individuals making racist remarks that went viral), ministers initiated a series of dialogues on race relations, involving community partners and youth groups. This culminated in messages delivered at the **National Day Rally 2021** (a key policy speech) where the Prime Minister addressed the issue of casual racism and emphasized that the majority must be sensitive to minority concerns, and minorities too should feel assured that grievances will be heard. Schools have also updated their **Character and Citizenship Education** curriculum to cover contemporary issues of race and religion more deeply, including discussions on multicultural identity and solidarity\u301031\u2020L67-L76\u3011\u301031\u2020L73-L76\u3011. These efforts represent a shift toward **more open discussion** \u2013 a slight relaxing of earlier decades\u2019 reticence to talk about race publicly \u2013 in order to tackle problems like stereotypes or unconscious biases that policies alone cannot solve.\n\nThe last decade also saw continued **community and ground-up initiatives** blossoming. Youth interfaith groups (for example, the Interfaith Youth Circle, Roses of Peace, etc., often led by young Singaporeans of different faiths) became more active, organizing dialogues, cultural exchanges and even social media campaigns celebrating diversity. The government\u2019s **Harmony Fund** (managed by MCCY) provided grants to support many such projects. The IRCCs (Harmony Circles) commemorated their 20th anniversary in 2022 by renewing their pledge and expanding membership to more laypersons, ensuring the next generation is involved in inter-religious bridge-building\u301018\u2020L91-L99\u3011\u301018\u2020L97-L100\u3011. OnePeople.sg launched updated training modules on identifying discrimination and being an \u201cupstander\u201d against racism, empowering individuals to speak up if they witness bigotry. Community celebrations have also become more inclusive; for instance, Racial Harmony Day events in some neighborhoods now deliberately involve **migrant worker communities**, acknowledging that harmony must extend to transient populations too (the inaugural Racial Harmony Day with migrant workers was held in 2024 as noted by community organizations). \n\nImportantly, empirical data in the past decade generally validates Singapore\u2019s approach. A 2019 study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and OnePeople.sg found **improving trends in interracial trust and friendships** compared to five years prior: more Singaporeans reported having close friends of other races, and a higher proportion (roughly 60%) said they trust people of another faith to help in a crisis, up from ~50% in 2013\u301010\u2020L283-L292\u3011. In national surveys, the vast majority (over 95%) of citizens consistently agree that it is good to have people of different races living together in the same neighborhoods and workplaces\u301010\u2020L273-L281\u3011. However, the same surveys also flagged areas to work on \u2013 for example, certain stereotypes persisted and some minorities felt not fully understood by others. The government has taken these findings into account in fine-tuning policies (for instance, tackling workplace discrimination through proposed legislation on fairness, which while not purely racial in scope, will help minorities who feel discriminated on any grounds). \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic from 2020\u20132022 was another *test* of social cohesion in this period. Early on, there were concerns that stress and fear might trigger scapegoating of particular groups (for instance, when virus variants were dubbed \u201cIndian variant\u201d by some, local Indians faced a few cases of harassment). The government responded swiftly to condemn any racist blaming, and community leaders rallied to reinforce solidarity \u2013 epitomized by messages that *\u201cvirus does not discriminate, and neither should we\u201d*. In the end, Singapore\u2019s multi-racial unity held firm through the pandemic, even as elsewhere in the world outbreaks sometimes fueled xenophobia. In fact, the crisis even *reinforced* cohesion in some ways: people saw frontline workers of all races (and including migrant workers) contributing together, and mutual aid initiatives (like mask distribution and food support) often deliberately spanned across ethnic lines. \n\nIn summary, 2015\u20132025 in Singapore has been a period of **renewal and adaptation** of its social cohesion model. The core principles remain unchanged \u2013 multiracial equality, zero tolerance for hate, and proactive integration \u2013 but the methods have been updated for a new era. Legislation was modernized to cover new domains like online space\u30105\u2020L456-L464\u3011, symbolic inclusion was enhanced via measures like reserved presidency, and perhaps most notably, there has been greater **engagement of citizens in the dialogue on harmony**, recognizing that every generation must internalize these values anew. The decade also reinforced one of Singapore\u2019s key messages: that **harmony is never a settled issue** but one that needs constant nurturing\u301032\u2020L95-L102\u3011, especially as social context shifts.\n\n## Policy Mechanisms and Institutional Measures for Cohesion  \nSingapore\u2019s approach to maintaining societal stability has been heavily characterized by **robust policy frameworks and institutions** engineered to manage diversity. These top-down mechanisms create the **environment and rules** in which harmony is preserved. Below is an analysis of the key policy-level measures:\n\n- **Constitutional Guarantees and Rule of Law:** From independence, Singapore embedded racial and religious equality in its supreme law. Article 12 of the Constitution guarantees all persons are equal before the law and prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, descent or place of birth\u30101\u2020L223-L231\u3011. This provided a strong legal bedrock for minority protection. Additionally, Article 152 explicitly charges the Government to care for the interests of racial and religious minorities and to recognize the Malays as indigenous people, ensuring their needs are not overlooked\u30101\u2020L241-L249\u3011. These constitutional provisions, while general, set the tone that *any* racially targeted policy would be unlawful unless specifically justified (e.g. special assistance to Malays is allowed, as a form of affirmative recognition). The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (described earlier) further strengthens this, acting as a quasi-guardian by reviewing legislation for compliance with multicultural principles\u301015\u2020L1-L9\u3011. Together, they institutionalize the principle that **no community should be marginalized by law**, and they signal to all citizens that integration and fairness are core national values.\n\n- **Secular Governance and Meritocracy:** A key aspect of policy is the strict secularism of the state. While freedom of religion is guaranteed, the state does not endorse any religion and religious influence is kept out of governance\u30106\u2020L323-L331\u3011\u30109\u2020L189-L197\u3011. Civil policies (from education to housing) are formulated based on secular and meritocratic considerations, not communal ones. This secular approach means, for instance, no religious laws (beyond personal/family law for Muslims via Administration of Muslim Law Act for marriage/divorce) override civil law, and policy debates are conducted in terms of national interest rather than communal interest. **Meritocracy** \u2013 the idea that advancement is based on ability and effort, not race or connections \u2013 has been heavily emphasized in public sector hiring, school admissions, and scholarships. By **ensuring equal opportunity** in education and employment, the government minimizes economic disparities between races. In practice, meritocracy helped blunt arguments for communal quotas in jobs or schools; instead, all competed on an ostensibly level playing field. (There are ongoing discussions about the nuances of meritocracy, but broadly it has helped many individuals from humble backgrounds, including minorities, rise to key positions, reinforcing faith that the system is fair.) \n\n- **Ethnic Quotas in Public Housing (Ethnic Integration Policy):** As discussed, this 1989 policy is one of the most lauded Singaporean innovations. By **mandating diverse neighborhoods**, the EIP addressed what social scientists call \u201c**social segregation**,\u201d which can otherwise impede understanding\u301025\u2020L503-L511\u3011. The effectiveness of this policy is evident when contrasted with other societies: many countries struggle with de facto segregated urban enclaves, whereas in Singapore one is *forced* to encounter neighbors of other races daily \u2013 whether in lifts, local shops, or residents\u2019 committees \u2013 making it harder to cling to prejudices. The government has occasionally fine-tuned the quota limits (for example, as the proportion of minorities in the national population shifted slightly or in response to housing market pressures), but its commitment to integrated housing remains unwavering. The policy does impose some inconvenience on housing transactions (owners can only sell to buyers eligible under the quota for that block), yet it is regarded as a necessary trade-off for societal harmony. Surveys consistently show a majority support for the EIP, even among those who might sometimes be constrained by it, indicating public recognition that **mixed communities are beneficial for Singapore\u2019s unity**\u301010\u2020L273-L281\u3011.\n\n- **Education Policy and Common Curriculum:** Education has been perhaps the **most pervasive tool** in shaping inclusive mindsets. Beyond bilingualism, the national curriculum from primary to tertiary levels includes components that inculcate multicultural appreciation. For example, **Social Studies** in secondary school teaches students about Singapore\u2019s history of riots, the importance of religious harmony, and comparative case studies of racial issues in other countries to highlight what to avoid\u301031\u2020L67-L76\u3011\u301032\u2020L45-L53\u3011. **National Education** messages (introduced from 1997) reinforce themes like \u201cWe must preserve racial and religious harmony\u201d as one of six core messages for all students. Schools often deliberately **mix students of different races in classrooms** (ensuring that class groupings are not segregated by mother tongue choice, for instance), and encourage diverse co-curricular activities. From young, students participate in celebrations of each ethnic cultural holiday (Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali) and are taught songs and national symbols that emphasize unity (for example, singing the national anthem in Malay, reciting the pledge together). Even the design of school uniforms and practices is secular and standardized, which the government argues helps avoid visible differentiation (though there have been debates, such as over allowing Muslim headscarves in schools \u2013 gradually moving toward more accommodation in recent years). The **outcome** of these educational measures is a generation that by and large takes interracial mixing as the norm \u2013 it is telling that Singapore\u2019s millennials and Gen-Z often identify strongly as \u201cSingaporean\u201d first and have interracial friendships since childhood. Education has also been extended to adults in subtle ways: mass media, public campaigns and now social media outreach by government agencies frequently promote harmony messages (for instance, televised public service announcements featuring multi-ethnic casts are common during Racial Harmony Day or national celebrations).\n\n- **Laws Against Hate Speech and Conflict Incitement:** Singapore has some of the **toughest laws against racial or religious vilification** in the world. The Sedition Act (until recently) made it an offence to promote hostility between different races or classes. The Penal Code contains provisions (Section 298 for example) criminalizing acts and speech deliberately intended to wound religious or racial feelings. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA) allows swift executive action (subject to later tribunal review) to restrain a person from causing feelings of enmity between religious groups\u30109\u2020L199-L204\u3011. More recently, the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act (MRHA \u2013 2021) extends similar principles to racial issues and introduces rehabilitative measures. The new Act also institutionalizes the practice of requiring offenders to make amends (e.g. a formal apology or partake in harmony-building activity), emphasizing restoration of harmony in addition to punishment\u30105\u2020L183-L191\u3011\u30105\u2020L214-L223\u3011. The government\u2019s philosophy is that **allowing hate speech under the banner of free expression is dangerously na\u00efve** \u2013 pointing to how even advanced democracies have suffered increased racism or violence due to unchecked hateful rhetoric\u301025\u2020L456-L464\u3011\u301025\u2020L465-L473\u3011. In Singapore, not only are such speeches or publications illegal, but the **authorities have not hesitated to enforce** the laws. There have been instances of bloggers or social media users being arrested and charged for making racist statements, and even foreign preachers have been barred from entry for denigrating other faiths. This strict approach has generally had public support, because Singaporeans see it as a price for peace. However, leaders also recognize laws alone aren\u2019t enough \u2013 hence coupling them with education. For example, when a teenager was prosecuted under the MRHA in 2020 for posting incendiary comments, he was directed to undergo a program run by OnePeople.sg to learn about the cultures he had maligned, illustrating the **combination of firm action and reformation**.\n\n- **Representation and Power-Sharing:** Politically, beyond the GRC system mentioned, Singapore ensures minorities are represented in other spheres of power. The Cabinet usually includes members of the Malay, Indian and other communities in significant roles (e.g. since the 1980s there has traditionally been a Malay Minister overseeing Muslim affairs and an Indian Minister in key portfolios). The Presidential Council for Minority Rights itself is headed often by a minority chairperson. There are also **Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs)** and Non-Constituency MPs which have occasionally been used to bring in voices (including from minority communities or ethnic self-help groups) to Parliament. Another feature is the group of **Community Self-Help Organizations** (CDAC, Mendaki, SINDA, Eurasian Association) which receive government support and sit on various advisory boards, ensuring policies can be tailored to community needs without breeding separate development. The government\u2019s engagement with formal religious bodies \u2013 such as the Islamic Religious Council (MUIS), Hindu Endowments Board, Sikh Advisory Board, etc. \u2013 means that the state can hear community concerns and also enlist these bodies to promote moderation within their communities. In essence, **every ethnic/religious group has consultative channels to the government** and is encouraged to be part of solution-building rather than oppositional. This inclusive governance approach contrasts with some neighboring countries where certain minorities might feel shut out of power; in Singapore, minorities are present from the halls of power to the rank-and-file of the civil service, fostering a sense of belonging.\n\n- **Social and Economic Equity Policies:** While not explicitly framed as racial harmony policies, Singapore\u2019s broader socio-economic policies have helped avoid severe inter-racial economic stratification. **Public housing accessibility**, universal education, and national healthcare ensure no group is systematically under-provided. There are also ethnically focused schemes like the Mosque Building Fund (a small payroll deduction from Muslim workers for building mosques) which enable the Malay/Muslim community to expand religious infrastructure without needing large private donations \u2013 this has had the side effect of preventing external funding (which could come with ideological strings) and ensuring that as new towns were built, mosques (and other religious facilities through similar mechanisms for other faiths) kept pace, reducing feelings of neglect\u30106\u2020L341-L349\u3011\u30106\u2020L343-L352\u3011. By tracking indicators (educational results, income levels) by race, the government identifies gaps and tries to close them before they widen. For example, when Malay student performance in schools lagged in the 1980s, initiatives through Mendaki tutoring and school encouragement campaigns were launched; today all races in Singapore have high literacy and improving education outcomes, though some gaps remain. Crucially, by **elevating all boats**, Singapore avoided the scenario of an impoverished minority underclass that could breed social discontent.\n\nIn summary, Singapore\u2019s policy mechanisms for social cohesion are characterized by **comprehensiveness and consistency**. They span constitutional principles, electoral engineering, urban planning, education, legal sanctions, and welfare/integration programs \u2013 all coordinated towards the goal of building one nation out of many communities. These policies are frequently reviewed and adjusted in response to new challenges (like the digital age requiring new regulations, or demographic shifts requiring updated integration strategies), demonstrating a **pragmatic and forward-looking governance**. The underlying belief is that **harmonious society requires active tending by the state** to set norms and frameworks that then guide citizen behavior. While some critics have argued that this top-down approach can be restrictive (for instance, limiting free speech or entrenching racial categorizations through CMIO \u2013 Chinese/Malay/Indian/Other \u2013 classifications on official documents), it is undeniable that the policy architecture has thus far succeeded in preventing the kind of racial/religious strife seen elsewhere.\n\n## Grassroots and Community Efforts  \nParallel to government policies, **ground-up and community initiatives have been critical in fostering everyday social cohesion** in Singapore. The government often provides support or coordination, but much of the on-the-ground harmony is maintained by ordinary citizens interacting through community structures. Here we highlight the main grassroots mechanisms:\n\n- **Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO):** The IRO, established in 1949, is one of Singapore\u2019s oldest interfaith bodies. It brings together representatives of the 10 major religions in Singapore (including Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Taoism, Sikhism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed). The IRO has long promoted mutual respect and understanding \u2013 through interfaith prayers, joint declarations during festive seasons, and educational talks. It played a pivotal role in calming the population during crises like the 1964 riots\u30106\u2020L317-L325\u3011 by showing a united front of religious leaders. Today, the IRO continues to organize interfaith visits and an annual Harmony Day observance. Its sustained presence provides a **reassuring moral voice** that Singapore\u2019s religions stand together for peace. Many religious organizations in Singapore also have bilateral friendships (e.g. churches and mosques in the same district exchanging goodwill visits), often facilitated by IRO or IRCC networks. This **religious harmony at the leadership level** trickles down to the faithful through sermons and community projects that emphasize helping all neighbors regardless of creed.\n\n- **People\u2019s Association (PA) and Grassroots Networks:** The PA is a government statutory board, but it operates by mobilizing community volunteers across all neighborhoods. Its mission is explicitly to **promote racial harmony and social cohesion**\u301031\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Under PA, each locality has grassroots organizations such as Residents\u2019 Committees (for public housing blocks) and Community Clubs, which run a plethora of bonding activities. These range from **multi-cultural festivals, sports days, cooking classes, art workshops, interest groups** (dancing, karaoke, yoga, etc.) deliberately designed to attract a mix of ethnic participants. For instance, a Community Club might hold a food festival featuring Chinese, Malay, Indian cuisines with neighbors manning stalls together. The PA also organizes large-scale cultural events: the **Chingay Parade**, originally a Chinese event, is now a national multi-ethnic carnival with Malay kompang drummers, Indian dancers, and even foreign cultural troupes parading side by side\u301021\u2020L233-L239\u3011. Likewise, PA\u2019s **Soundwaves concert** and **PA Talents** dance troupe showcase fusion performances blending cultural elements\u301021\u2020L204-L212\u3011\u301021\u2020L214-L222\u3011. These creative platforms let Singaporeans appreciate each other\u2019s heritage in fun ways, building camaraderie. At a more intimate level, **Home Visits** are conducted by grassroots volunteers of different races visiting homes during festivals (e.g. bringing oranges for Chinese New Year to Malay families, or dates during Ramadan to Chinese families) \u2013 small gestures that send a powerful message of friendship. During the COVID lockdowns, many such networks helped deliver aid to families regardless of race, reinforcing that the **kampong (village) spirit** transcends ethnicity. The PA\u2019s effectiveness is reflected in the fact that **community ties often defuse potential misunderstandings** \u2013 for example, if a resident is annoyed by a neighbor\u2019s religious practice (like incense burning or prayer chants), they often approach the neighborhood committee first, which mediates amicably by explaining cultural context, rather than it flaring up.\n\n- **Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (Harmony Circles):** As detailed earlier, the IRCCs are grassroots committees in each constituency focusing on interfaith understanding and crisis preparedness. Comprising religious leaders, community leaders and other volunteers, IRCCs meet regularly to share updates and organize collaborative projects. Common IRCC activities include *\u201cheritage trails\u201d* where members tour different places of worship together, public seminars on various religious customs, and **harmony feasts** where festival foods from each religion are shared. They also often respond collectively to global or regional incidents \u2013 for instance, if there is a terror attack overseas, IRCC leaders might jointly visit a local mosque or church to show solidarity and calm any anxieties. The existence of IRCCs in every district means that **dialogue is decentralized and pervasive**; even at the neighborhood level, people see their religious leaders mixing with others. In 2018, a National IRCC Convention brought together hundreds of IRCC activists to exchange best practices, indicating how this network has grown and professionalized over time\u301018\u2020L95-L99\u3011. By 2022, the rebranding to *Harmony Circles* came along with a refreshed mandate to engage youth and use digital platforms to reach wider audiences. These circles act as the **social glue** that holds multi-religious communities together at the local level, and they are a key pillar of resilience if any community relations are strained.\n\n- **Civic Society and \u201cOnePeople.sg\u201d:** OnePeople.sg, launched in 2007, is effectively a national NGO for racial harmony (sometimes described as a GONGO \u2013 government-organized NGO \u2013 due to its close links with state agencies). It serves as a resource center and **think-tank on racism issues**. OPSG conducts surveys to gauge racial sentiments, runs training for educators and community workers on managing diversity, and facilitates dialogues in schools and workplaces. Its **HarmonyWorks! Conference** is a flagship annual event focused on youth, where students from schools nationwide come together to discuss race relations and propose initiatives\u301021\u2020L240-L248\u3011. OPSG also produces educational materials \u2013 for instance, guidebooks on how to talk to children about racism, or video campaigns debunking racial stereotypes. In recent times, they have worked with social media influencers to spread messages of unity and to call out casual racism. The presence of OPSG shows a willingness to confront **sensitive topics like prejudice in a constructive manner**, supplementing the more enforcement-oriented approach of the government. Additionally, various civil society groups have emerged addressing specific aspects: for example, there\u2019s an initiative called *\u201cRegardless of Race\u201d* (inspired by a local documentary) that holds casual dinner conversations on race among diverse participants. Another example is the volunteer group *Roses of Peace*, started by Muslim youth, which distributes roses at churches and temples as a gesture of friendship annually. While small, these efforts accumulate to shape public consciousness that **racial and religious harmony is a collective responsibility**, not something simply policed from above.\n\n- **Community Celebrations and Heritage:** Singapore has also leveraged its multicultural calendar to build inter-community bonds. On major religious festivals (Chinese Lunar New Year, Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Vesak Day, Christmas, etc.), it\u2019s become a norm for leaders of other faiths and government representatives to visit the celebrants. For instance, during Hari Raya at the end of Ramadan, government ministers and even non-Muslim friends attend open houses hosted by Malay/Muslim families; at Chinese New Year, Malay and Indian neighbors visit Chinese homes. The media publicizes these exchanges as examples to emulate. There are also **joint celebrations** \u2013 e.g. some neighborhoods hold a single event that marks *multiple* festivals together, highlighting common values (such as charity, gratitude) across religions. The National Heritage Board curates multi-ethnic heritage trails in historic districts where different communities settled, emphasizing that Singapore\u2019s history was woven from all groups together. A concrete symbol of interfaith unity is the **Harmony in Diversity Gallery** (opened in 2016) which is an exhibition space in the city showcasing the practices of different religions in Singapore and stories of cooperation between faiths. Likewise, the **Harmony Centre** at An-Nahdhah Mosque (opened in 2006) offers visitors of all backgrounds a chance to learn about Islamic traditions and see displays about other religions too\u30106\u2020L361-L368\u3011. These centers receive visitors including students and tourists, projecting an image of Singapore as proud of all its cultural components. Even in architecture, Singapore sometimes intentionally colocates different religious buildings in proximity (for example, a mosque, temple and church might share a common carpark or be adjacent), subtly encouraging interaction and sending the message that **no one is segregated to separate domains**.\n\n- **Online and Youth Engagement:** Recognizing that the younger generation lives digitally, community efforts have extended online. Campaigns like *#regardlessofrace* or viral videos featuring multicultural friendships have been initiated by youth groups, often supported by MCCY or OPSG grants. During Racial Harmony Day, one might find Instagram flooded with posts of friends in each other\u2019s traditional attire, reflecting a celebratory approach by the young. At the same time, there are organized responses to negative online content \u2013 for instance, when a racist comment or video circulates, many Singaporean netizens actively condemn it and assert values of unity, showing a kind of **crowd-sourced moderation** aligned with societal norms. The government\u2019s SGSecure mobile app (while focused on terror response) also pushes out content on how to stay united and report suspicious incidents without speculating on race/religion. This synergy between official messaging and citizen participation online has helped inoculate Singapore, to some degree, against divisive social media trends seen elsewhere. The ethos of **mutual respect** is increasingly internalized such that many Singaporeans themselves will correct peers if someone makes an insensitive remark.\n\nOverall, grassroots efforts in Singapore create the **lived reality** of harmony that complements the policy framework. Policies might ensure people of different backgrounds share spaces, but it is the **daily interactions and relationships** that truly build trust. Through countless community events, dialogues, and acts of neighborliness, Singaporeans have developed a form of **social capital** \u2013 a reservoir of goodwill among communities. This is evidenced by surveys: a 2019 poll found 80% of Singaporeans were satisfied with the state of racial and religious relations\u301010\u2020L279-L287\u3011, and many had close friends of other races (with those numbers on the rise in recent years)\u301010\u2020L285-L294\u3011. The importance of ground-up involvement is recognized at the highest levels; leaders often praise grassroots activists as the **\u201cunsung heroes\u201d** of social cohesion, and policies like the Harmony Circle networks institutionalize the role of community in maintaining peace. By **embedding the values of inclusion into community life** \u2013 from youth activities to senior citizen clubs \u2013 Singapore ensures that harmony is not just a slogan but a social habit reinforced by experience and human connection.\n\n## Regional and Global Context: Adapting to External Developments  \nSingapore\u2019s approaches to social cohesion have not evolved in isolation; they have been significantly shaped by regional and global developments in race and religion relations. As a small, globally-connected nation in Southeast Asia, Singapore keenly observes external events and often **proactively adapts** its strategies to avoid the pitfalls seen elsewhere or to respond to emerging threats. Here we discuss how the broader context influenced Singapore\u2019s harmony model:\n\n**Historical Regional Tensions:** Singapore\u2019s very foundation as a multiracial state was a response to regional communalism. The split from Malaysia in 1965 was fundamentally over racial politics \u2013 the Malaysian leadership\u2019s push for Malay dominance versus Singapore\u2019s vision of a plural society\u301023\u2020L13-L21\u3011. The traumatic **race riots in Singapore in 1964** were themselves intertwined with peninsular politics (provocateurs from outside were involved)\u301035\u2020L131-L139\u3011. These events seared into Singapore\u2019s first-generation leaders the conviction that **racial harmony is extremely fragile**, especially in a Malay-majority surrounding where Singapore\u2019s Chinese majority could become a target, or vice versa. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his team were acutely aware of the **May 13, 1969 racial riots in Malaysia** \u2013 in which hundreds died \u2013 and they drew lessons from that tragedy. One key lesson was to never let inequalities between races fester (as had happened in Malaysia with Chinese economic dominance and Malay marginalization). Singapore\u2019s aggressive drive for inter-racial equality of opportunities and its interventions like public housing quotas can be seen as a direct attempt to avoid the **Malaysia scenario**. Another lesson was the danger of **racial politics** \u2013 thus Singapore outlawed communal parties and implemented the multi-racial GRC system, whereas Malaysia\u2019s politics remained organized along ethnic lines (UMNO for Malays, MCA for Chinese, etc.). By taking a different path, Singapore hoped to prove that stability could be achieved through integration rather than segregation or affirmative action favoring a majority.\n\nIn the wider Southeast Asian context, Singapore has also been mindful of events such as **Indonesia\u2019s turbulent racial history**. For instance, Indonesia experienced anti-Chinese pogroms in 1998 amid economic crisis, where many ethnic Chinese were attacked. Though by then Singapore was already stable internally, such incidents reinforced the government\u2019s narrative to its people: *see what could happen if we are not careful?* They used these regional examples as cautionary tales in National Education, underscoring why Singapore must never take harmony for granted. Likewise, periodic sectarian violence in Indonesia (e.g. Christian-Muslim clashes in the Maluku islands around 2000) highlighted the perils of religious conflict. Singapore responded by tightening surveillance on any local religious extremism and by promoting interfaith understanding \u2013 effectively **inoculating** its population against imported sectarian sentiments. The Islamic Religious Council (MUIS) in Singapore took steps to ensure local Islamic teaching emphasizes peace and is alert to extremist ideologies that might infiltrate from the region (especially given some common Malay linguistic space with Malaysia/Indonesia).\n\n**Terrorism and the Post-9/11 World:** The early 2000s wave of terrorism had a profound effect on Singapore\u2019s cohesion policies. The Jemaah Islamiyah terror plots uncovered in Singapore (where militants had planned to bomb local targets in 2001) posed a dual threat: the physical threat of violence and the social threat of communal backlash (since JI was a Southeast Asian extremist network claiming Islamic motivations). Singapore\u2019s arrest of the JI members (who were Singaporean Malays) could have easily led to **suspicion or stigmatization of the wider Malay/Muslim community**. The government\u2019s approach to this delicate situation became a case study in balancing security and social cohesion. They were transparent about the threat but also went out of their way to distinguish the extremists from the Muslim community at large, often stating that the vast majority of Singaporean Muslims are law-abiding and loyal. They enlisted Muslim community leaders in explaining the situation to their congregations and the public. The formation of IRCCs in 2002 was partly to have local networks ready to respond with unity if any terror incident occurred. When bombs went off in Bali (2002) and Jakarta (2003), Singapore\u2019s leaders and media took the opportunity to **encourage interfaith sympathy** (for example, Singapore\u2019s churches raised funds for victims of a Bali nightclub bombing even though victims were mostly foreign tourists, signaling humanity above religious differences). Later, the rise of the Islamic State in the 2010s and their online radicalization campaigns also prompted Singapore to launch **SGSecure** (a national movement since 2016 to prepare the public against terror). SGSecure includes messaging that urges people not to let a terror attack divide society, and encourages everyone to learn emergency skills and to watch out for signs of radicalization in any group. Essentially, the government recognized that **the social aftershocks of terrorism \u2013 fear, distrust, vigilante reprisals \u2013 can be as damaging as the act itself**, and so built social resilience to mitigate that. This approach mirrors what some other countries did, but Singapore\u2019s advantage was its pre-existing harmony infrastructure (IRCCs, etc.) that could be leveraged in such times. \n\n**Globalisation and Immigration:** Globally, increased migration has tested many societies\u2019 cohesion. Singapore, being very open to migration, felt these pressures perhaps more than any other Asian country (with foreigners making up over a third of the workforce by 2010s). Experiences in Europe with immigrant integration \u2013 ranging from success stories to failures marked by ghettos and ethnic tensions \u2013 were closely studied. Singapore took a very *hands-on approach* to immigrant integration, likely learning from Europe that simply letting demographics change without community bridges can lead to parallel societies. Hence the NIC in 2009 and a slew of integration programs. Additionally, Singapore managed migration in a calibrated way, for example: spreading out rental dormitories for foreign workers across the island to avoid large isolated foreign enclaves; requiring new citizens to undergo induction courses about Singapore\u2019s values (including multiracial harmony as a key value); and publicly urging Singaporeans to welcome newcomers, while also urging newcomers to adapt to local norms. The delicate balancing of maintaining national identity and absorbing new cultures is an ongoing challenge. In regional context, Singapore\u2019s situation is unique \u2013 as neighboring countries like Malaysia and Indonesia are source countries of migration (they send people out, including to Singapore), so Singapore didn\u2019t have peers to emulate in ASEAN. Instead it took cues from global cities like New York, London, and Dubai on how to manage diversity, often concluding that **some Western models of multiculturalism \u2013 which can be laissez-faire \u2013 would not work** for Singapore. The government\u2019s integration stance was more interventionist (for example, forming workplace integration committees and celebrating Racial Harmony Day with *migrant workers* explicitly included by 2024, as noted earlier). This shows a sensitivity to global trends (xenophobia rising in many countries during economic uncertainties) and a determination to avoid a similar fate by **getting ahead of the problem**.\n\n**Rising Identity Politics and Populism:** In the 2010s, many countries saw a resurgence of identity politics \u2013 whether racial nationalism, religious majoritarianism, or nativist sentiments. In Southeast Asia, there have been instances of politicizing race/religion for votes (Malaysia\u2019s communal politics, Indonesia\u2019s Jakarta gubernatorial election in 2017 where Islamic identity was weaponized against a Chinese Christian candidate, etc.). Singapore\u2019s leadership watched these and frequently cited them as things to guard against. For example, the ousting and imprisonment of Jakarta\u2019s then-governor Basuki \u201cAhok\u201d Purnama in 2017 on blasphemy charges after massive Islamist-led protests served as a reminder of how quickly religious sentiment could upend politics. Not long after, Singapore\u2019s constitutional change for a reserved presidency for Malays (leading to President Halimah\u2019s election) can be seen in light of showing recognition to Malay Muslims at the highest office, perhaps as a **counter-narrative to any regional rhetoric of Muslim disenfranchisement**. It\u2019s not that Singapore faced the same scenario, but being in the region, it pays attention to the **psychological climate**. Similarly, with far-right movements gaining ground in the West, Singapore doubled down on its stance that those divisive currents (racism, anti-immigrant fervor) must not take root locally. The government openly disagrees with Western free-speech absolutism on hate speech, pointing to increased racial tensions in the US and Europe as evidence that \u201c**allowing denigration of other races and religions**\u201d is destructive\u301025\u2020L456-L464\u3011. This global contrast helped justify laws like the new MRHA and POFMA (anti-fake-news law) to the public \u2013 packaged as learning from others\u2019 mistakes.\n\n**Fragile Dynamics in Southeast Asia:** The question specifically mentions \u201cfragile racial and religious dynamics within Southeast Asia.\u201d Besides Malaysia and Indonesia, other Southeast Asian examples include: the **Rohingya crisis in Myanmar**, which Shanmugam explicitly referenced as a serious racial/religious conflict in our region\u301024\u2020L7-L10\u3011. The plight of Rohingya Muslims (and the accompanying ethnic cleansing by Myanmar\u2019s military in 2017) had ripple effects \u2013 it galvanized Muslim groups in the region to protest. In Singapore, while the issue did not directly affect domestic relations, it raised awareness among Singaporeans about the horrors of sectarian violence. Singapore\u2019s Muslim community expressed solidarity with the Rohingya in peaceful ways (fundraisers, etc.), and the government gave humanitarian aid but remained cautious in official statements so as not to inflame any communal passions. Another regional dynamic is in **southern Thailand and the southern Philippines**, where long-running insurgencies involve Muslim minorities feeling marginalized. These conflicts are closely monitored by Singapore\u2019s security agencies for any terror links, but socially, they reaffirm to Singaporeans of all faiths that everyone must feel equally valued to avoid such strife. \n\nWithin ASEAN forums, Singapore has quietly promoted interfaith dialogues. It has supported initiatives like the ASEAN Ministerial meetings on religions and cultures. In 2019, as Chair of ASEAN, Singapore issued statements emphasizing moderation and religious tolerance, likely drawing from its own ethos to influence the region. By being an example (e.g. how a plurality Chinese nation can fully include minorities in prosperity and governance), Singapore also counters extremist narratives that might target its neighbors. For instance, militant groups might claim \u201cChristians or Chinese are oppressors\u201d in some contexts; Singapore\u2019s success story undercuts such claims, showing that **inclusive governance is possible in the region**.\n\nFinally, globalization has also meant *transnational influences* on social issues \u2013 like the global Black Lives Matter movement and Western dialogues on racism, which have seeped into Singapore\u2019s younger generation consciousness. There is more discussion now on topics like Chinese privilege (analogous to white privilege) in Singapore. The government\u2019s approach is to allow these conversations but guide them within local context. They often caution against wholesale import of foreign ideologies, while acknowledging legitimate local concerns. So, global movements have nudged Singapore to examine itself more critically, which in the long run can strengthen cohesion by addressing blind spots. The new generation of Singaporeans, thanks to global connectivity, are engaging with concepts of diversity and inclusion in fresh ways \u2013 e.g. advocating for minority representation in media, or questioning casual racism in private settings. The state has taken note and responded by, for example, updating media guidelines to ensure casting in TV shows reflects the nation\u2019s diversity and that racial stereotypes are avoided. In essence, **global cultural shifts toward diversity and inclusion have generally reinforced Singapore\u2019s existing values**, pushing it to keep improving.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore\u2019s strategies for social cohesion have been continually **stress-tested and shaped by external events**. Whenever a racial or religious conflict has flared up in the region or world, Singapore asks: *Can it happen here? How do we prevent it?* This mindset has led to pre-emptive action \u2013 from laws, to community preparedness, to diplomatic positioning \u2013 all aimed at insulating its society from external shocks. At the same time, Singapore shares its experience internationally as a model of a harmonious multicultural society, even as it humbly acknowledges its society is not perfect and must keep working at unity. The delicate balancing act of being **open to the world yet protecting the internal harmony** continues to define Singapore\u2019s nation-building journey in 2025.\n\n## Conclusion  \nFrom 1965 through 2025, Singapore\u2019s achievement of internal stability and social cohesion stands out in a world frequently fractured by ethnic and religious conflicts. This success is the result of a **comprehensive, multi-faceted approach** sustained over decades. Singapore blended **hard policies** \u2013 like enforceable laws, quotas, and national campaigns \u2013 with **soft approaches** \u2013 like dialogue, education, and community activities \u2013 to systematically bridge divides among its Chinese, Malay, Indian, and other citizens. Starting with the foresight of its founding generation and carried on by successive leaders and the public, Singapore built institutions that embed racial and religious harmony into everyday life: students recite a pledge of unity each morning; families of different backgrounds live door-to-door in public housing; politicians must appeal to all races, not just their own; and community events celebrate a mosaic of cultures. Just as importantly, ordinary Singaporeans through countless daily interactions \u2013 a friendly exchange of festival goodies with a neighbor, volunteering in interracial teams, or standing in solidarity when any group faces hurt \u2013 have created a **culture of mutual respect**. Harmony in Singapore is not an absence of differences, but rather the management and appreciation of differences within a shared national identity. \n\nThe past decade\u2019s developments show that Singapore is not resting on its laurels. New challenges such as an expanded immigrant population, the amplifying effect of social media on prejudice, and global ideological currents are being met with refreshed strategies \u2013 from updated legislation to frank conversations about race. The country has demonstrated a willingness to **self-correct and adapt**, for instance by acknowledging the need to address subtle discrimination even as overt racism remains taboo. This adaptive resilience is crucial because social cohesion is never a finished project; it requires continual tending, especially in an evolving socio-political landscape\u301032\u2020L95-L102\u3011. Singapore\u2019s experience also underscores a broader lesson: **diversity can be a source of strength and unity if deliberately cultivated**. By expanding common spaces and narratives while respecting each community\u2019s identity, Singapore managed to turn a potential weakness (being a fragmented immigrant society with no single dominant culture) into a defining strength. \n\nIn the context of Southeast Asia\u2019s fragile dynamics, Singapore\u2019s stability offers a hopeful counterpoint. It shows that **pluralism need not descend into conflict**, and that principled governance \u2013 upholding equality, meritocracy, and rule of law \u2013 can win citizens\u2019 allegiance across racial lines\u301032\u2020L65-L73\u3011. Of course, Singapore\u2019s small size and unique history mean its model may not export wholesale, but elements like integrated housing, education for tolerance, and legal curbs on hate speech could inform policies elsewhere. Moving forward, Singapore will likely continue refining its harmony toolkit, perhaps placing even greater emphasis on **inclusive dialogue and genuine cross-cultural empathy** to deepen the trust that has been built. There will always be extremists and incidents that test the social fabric, but if the last 60 years are any guide, Singapore will respond with a firm hand and an open heart \u2013 **standing united as \u201cone people, regardless of race, language or religion.\u201d**\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":396,"end_ix":409,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"\n\tSecond Reading of the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill and the Constitution (Amendment) Bill \u2013 Opening Speech by Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law\n","url":"http://www.mha.gov.sg/mediaroom/parliamentary/second-reading-of-the-maintenance-of-racial-harmony-bill-and-the-constitution-amendment-bill-opening/#:~:text=22.%20Multi,a%20foundational%20principle%20for%20us","text":"22.
