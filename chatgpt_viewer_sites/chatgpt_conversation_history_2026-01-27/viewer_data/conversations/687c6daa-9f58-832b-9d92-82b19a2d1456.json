Experiments on nanoscopic logic gates confirm the lower bound\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201. |\n| **Maxwell\u2019s demon (measurement)** | The demon extracts work because it *acquires* information; no energy cost there. | When its memory is reset to run cyclically, \u2265\u202f*k*T\u202fln\u202f2 per bit is dissipated; experiments now demonstrate this quantitatively\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Local \u201cinformation creation\u201d is always paid for by a larger entropy export; no free negentropy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. \u202fProcesses where **information seems to disappear**  \n\n| Process | Why erasure appears | Energy / entropy consequences |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Digital memory reset** | Bit overwritten to 0. | Heat \u2265\u202f*k*T\u202fln\u202f2 released (the original Landauer scenario). |\n| **Quantum measurement with discarded record** | We trace out the pointer/environment. | The lost quantum mutual information must raise the environment\u2019s entropy by at least Landauer\u2019s bound (recently measured in ultracold gas simulators\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201). |\n| **Decoherence of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2011cat states** | Off\u2011diagonal phases vanish when environment not monitored. | Phase info is encoded in an astronomically large number of environmental modes, increasing their entropy. |\n| **Matter falling into a black hole** | Classically the horizon hides micro\u2011details; Hawking radiation is nearly thermal. | Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy \\(S_\\text{BH}=k_B A/4\\ell_P^2\\) grows, exactly enough (per recent quantum\u2011gravity models) for \u2265\u202f*k*T_H\u202fln\u202f2 of energy per missing bit to emerge as Hawking quanta\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201. Whether the *microscopic* info is ultimately returned (unitarity) or genuinely destroyed is still under debate, but *if* it were destroyed the radiated energy would have to satisfy Landauer. |\n| **Heat death** | Stars exhaust fuel, gradients flatten, correlations fade. | The cumulative erasure of cosmic structure releases vast waste heat into ever\u2011cooler space; the bound is easily met. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. \u202fAre there *spontaneous*, cost\u2011free violations?  \n\n* **No known physical process violates Landauer.**  \n  Apparent information creation (negentropy) always consumes free energy; apparent destruction always dumps heat. Both statements hold even in exotic settings such as analogue black holes or curved\u2011space quantum fields.\n\n* **Quantum fluctuations or particle\u2013antiparticle pair creation** *do not* violate the rule: the vacuum remains in a minimum\u2011energy pure state; the pairs are entangled and the bookkeeping works out.\n\n* **Boltzmann rare entropy\u2011reducing fluctuations** (e.g., a gas spontaneously re\u2011collapsing into half the box) would require no *external* energy, but they are exponentially unlikely and are exactly what Landauer\u2019s bound predicts when the process is run *backwards*.\n\n---\n\n## 6.\u202fWhat this means for cosmology and technology  \n\n1. **Black\u2011hole thermodynamics** is now regularly formulated as a gigantic Landauer machine: each Planck\u2011area \u201cpixel\u201d erased on the horizon must be compensated by a quantum of Hawking energy\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201.  \n2. **Quantum computers** must still burn \u2265\u202f*k*T\u202fln\u202f2 whenever *classical* information is irreversibly discarded (e.g., during read\u2011out or error\u2011syndrome reset).  \n3. **Ultimate green computing**: room\u2011temperature CMOS CPUs dissipate ~10\u2078\u202f\u00d7\u202fLandauer per bit\u2011flip. Cryogenic reversible logic or single\u2011electron transistors are research paths to approach the bound; experimental many\u2011body tests in 2025 reached within an order of magnitude\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.  \n4. **Astrobiology & thermodynamics of life**: Every organism is an information engine whose efficiency is limited by Landauer plus the Carnot factor; this constrains the plausible power budgets of life on cold exoplanets or in far\u2011future low\u2011temperature universes.\n\n---\n\n### Take\u2011aways\n\n*At the level of fundamental, reversible physics, information is conserved.*  \n*Whenever everyday or cosmic processes make it **look** otherwise, the Landauer limit tells you exactly how much energy must change hands in the background.*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":291,"end_idx":310,"safe_urls":["https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02930-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02930-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Experimentally probing Landauer's principle in the quantum ... -

A real measurement couples the system **S** to a pointer (and, inevitably, to a large environment **E**) through an ordinary unitary interaction.  The joint state \\(|\\Psi_{SPE}\\rangle\\) remains pure; what changes is that \\(S\\) becomes *entangled* with \\(P+E\\).  If you now trace out \\(P+E\\) you get a mixed density matrix for \\(S\\) with larger von\u202fNeumann entropy, creating the *appearance* that information about pre\u2011measurement phases has vanished.  The **no\u2011hiding theorem** makes this precise: whatever entropy you see rise in \\(S\\) must reappear as correlations inside \\(P\\!E\\); it cannot be annihilated\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201.  In other words, at the level of the global wave\u2011function, information is conserved.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u202f\u202fWhy decoherence makes the loss look permanent  \nThose phase correlations now reside in a Hilbert space with ~10\u00b2\u00b3 uncontrolled degrees of freedom.  Reversing the process would require measuring the environment in a fantastically precise, highly non\u2011local basis\u2014practically impossible, though in principle allowed.  This irreversible *for\u2011all\u2011practical\u2011purposes* scrambling is **decoherence**\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.  Collapse is therefore best viewed as an **epistemic update**: observers who ignore \\(E\\) adopt a classical probability distribution over the pointer\u2019s outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fDoes any information actually disappear?  \n* **Standard quantum mechanics (Copenhagen as \u201cshut\u2011up\u2011and\u2011calculate\u201d, Many\u2011Worlds, decoherence programme).**  \n  No.  All amplitudes survive in the larger entangled state.  What you call \u201ccollapse\u201d just means you conditioned on one branch and discarded the rest\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201.  \n\n* **Objective\u2011collapse models (GRW, CSL, Penrose).**  \n  These modify the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with stochastic terms that *really* destroy phase information.  Because they break unitarity, they predict minute violations of energy conservation and are tightly constrained by interferometry and cosmology; so far no evidence supports them.\n\nSo in mainstream physics *information is not destroyed*\u2014it is merely pushed beyond observational reach.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u202f\u202fThermodynamic bookkeeping: Landauer still rules  \nA unitary measurement can, in principle, be performed *reversibly* and need not dissipate heat.  The energetically costly step is **erasure**: resetting the apparatus or memory so it can be reused.  Landauer\u2019s principle demands  \n\\[\nQ_{\\text{diss}} \\;\\ge\\; k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln 2\n\\]\nper classical bit forgotten.  Recent cold\u2011atom and quantum\u2011dot experiments have measured this bound in fully quantum many\u2011body regimes, decomposing the heat flow into lost mutual information and environmental entropy gain\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search11\ue201.  Thus any *practical* loss of information is always matched by at least that much energy dumped into the surroundings.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u202f\u202fBroader implications  \n\n| Context | What happens to the \u201clost\u201d information? | Why it matters |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **Quantum eraser experiments** | Reviving interference by erasing which\u2011path information pulls the hidden correlations back out of the environment\u2014direct evidence of conservation. | Confirms decoherence picture. |\n| **Black\u2011hole information paradox** | If ordinary measurements don\u2019t destroy information, the burden is on quantum gravity to preserve it across evaporation\u2014or else introduce true non\u2011unitarity similar to collapse models. | Drives holography and island proposals. |\n| **Quantum computers** | Logic gates *can* be reversible; read\u2011out and syndrome\u2011reset must still pay Landauer. | Sets the floor for cryogenic \u201cgreen\u201d QC architectures. |\n| **Maxwell\u2011demon engines** | Demon gains negentropy when it *stores* measurement results; the bill arrives when it *erases* them. | Experiments now realise Landauer\u2011limited Szilard engines. |\n\n---\n\n### 6\u202f\u202fConcise answer  \n> **When a quantum measurement is made, no physical law forces information to disappear.**  \n> The apparent collapse\u2014and any increase in the system\u2019s entropy\u2014merely reflects our choice to ignore the vast entanglement with the environment.  Detailed information is still encoded in those correlations (no\u2011hiding theorem).  Only if we irreversibly **erase** the measurement record is information *truly* lost for good, and then the Landauer bound guarantees that at least \\(k_{\\mathrm B}T\\ln 2\\) of heat accompanies each missing bit.\n\nSo the universe keeps perfect account: discard knowledge, and you must pay the thermodynamic fee."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":773,"end_idx":792,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hiding_theorem?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hiding_theorem?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"No-hiding theorem - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hiding_theorem?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The no-hiding theorem [1] states that if information is lost from a system via decoherence, then it moves to the subspace of the environment.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201","start_idx":1284,"end_idx":1303,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1045766062.0,"snippet":"Quantum decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence.

Traditionally, the concept of entropy, the measure of disorder in a system, is used to explain this arrow of time, with the second law of thermodynamics stating that entropy in a closed system always increases. However, a team led by Flavio Mercati from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics suggests that gravity might play a crucial role, showing that time's arrow naturally arises from gravity-governed systems. They simulated a universe with 1,000 particles interacting gravitationally, finding that particles moved from low complexity (akin to a Big Bang clump) to higher complexity, indicating forward time progression. This model sidesteps the need for specific initial conditions and instead relies on the notion of complexity, which can measure temporal direction in the absence of energy and temperature. However, this model primarily uses classical physics, excluding quantum mechanics and general relativity, and more work is needed to incorporate these for a complete picture.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1415187044.0,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_687c6df19e248007ae566e8d0e48f2cc","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"961fd46a3add87f3-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"ae4fb21d-3a38-4dd6-8a78-93bc9f22d220","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ae4fb21d-3a38-4dd6-8a78-93bc9f22d220","children":["9c7551b5-a14b-46a5-a8ef-052ab621ba00"]},"9c7551b5-a14b-46a5-a8ef-052ab621ba00":{"id":"9c7551b5-a14b-46a5-a8ef-052ab621ba00","message":{"id":"9c7551b5-a14b-46a5-a8ef-052ab621ba00","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752986968.826552,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating Big Bang's information creation","content":"The user asks about information in relation to the Big Bang.
