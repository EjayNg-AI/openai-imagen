Download Node.js Installer\n- Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org).\n- You\u2019ll see options for \"LTS\" (Long Term Support) and \"Current\" versions. The LTS version is recommended for most users because it is more stable and suited for production.\n- Download the appropriate installer for your Windows version (usually the `.msi` file for your OS architecture, 64-bit or 32-bit).\n\n### 2. Run the Installer\n- Double-click the downloaded `.msi` file to start the installation.\n- Follow the prompts in the Node.js Setup Wizard.\n- Choose the default settings unless you have a specific reason to change them.\n- Make sure to check the box that says \u201cInstall npm\u201d if it appears as an option.\n\n### 3. Verify the Installation\nAfter the installation completes, you\u2019ll want to verify that Node.js and npm were installed correctly.\n\n1. Open a new Command Prompt (you can search for \"cmd\" in the Start menu).\n2. Type the following commands:\n\n    ```bash\n    node -v\n    npm -v\n    ```\n\n3. You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm, which confirms they were installed successfully.\n\n### 4. Update npm (Optional)\n- After installation, it can be useful to update npm to the latest version (npm is updated more frequently than Node.js).\n- Run the following command in the Command Prompt:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install -g npm@latest\n    ```\n\n### 5. Test Installation\nTo test if Node.js and npm are working, try creating a simple Node script or run `npx` commands to confirm. \n\nYour Node.js and npm should now be fully installed and ready to use on Windows!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"114414d2-25cb-4f49-bcfe-97ddc74e8ef7","request_id":"8da2300c5e5f3df5-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"114414d2-25cb-4f49-bcfe-97ddc74e8ef7","children":[]}}}
