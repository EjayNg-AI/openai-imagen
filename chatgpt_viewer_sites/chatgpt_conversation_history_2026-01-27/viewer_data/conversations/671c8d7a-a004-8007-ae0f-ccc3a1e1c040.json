Radon gas, which can accumulate in buildings, is a significant source of terrestrial radiation.\n\n3. **Internal Radiation**: Radioactive isotopes that are naturally present in the human body, such as potassium-40 and carbon-14, contribute to internal exposure.\n\n4. **Building Materials**: Some construction materials, like granite and certain types of concrete, contain natural radioisotopes that can emit radiation.\n\n5. **Medical Procedures**: Medical imaging techniques, such as X-rays and CT scans, expose individuals to additional radiation, though this is typically not considered part of natural background radiation.\n\n6. **Consumer Products**: Some household items, like smoke detectors (which contain americium-241) and certain types of older watches and clocks that use radium paint, can contribute to background radiation levels.\n\n7. **Nuclear Fallout**: Residual radiation from past nuclear weapons tests and accidents can contribute to background radiation in certain areas.\n\nThese sources together contribute to the average annual dose of background radiation that individuals are exposed to, which varies depending on geographic location and lifestyle."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o-mini","parent_id":"1d6e50b1-6c61-40d0-b056-63b5f58ff84a","request_id":"8d886bddca521910-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1d6e50b1-6c61-40d0-b056-63b5f58ff84a","children":[]}}}
