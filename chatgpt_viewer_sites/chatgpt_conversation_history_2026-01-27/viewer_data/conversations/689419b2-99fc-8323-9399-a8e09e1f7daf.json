These make the laws hollow and irrelevant. We will be only clobbering our own progress and shooting ourselves in the foot.\n- There must be a way to encourage original innovation, art, creativity, without being hobbled by outdated laws.

A prior APRA AMCOS report found that 82% of music creators were worried about AI's impact on earnings, estimating a potential $520 million revenue loss within four years. The Australian Recording Industry Association and APRA AMCOS criticized the proposal as unnecessary and damaging, urging the government to strengthen existing copyright laws, support licensing frameworks, and reject frameworks that protect overseas AI firms at the expense of national creativity.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754475720.0,"attribution":"www.theaustralian.com.au"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.dlapiper.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/blogs/mse-today/2025/training-ai-models-uk-government-proposes-eu-style-opt-out-copyright-exception","title":"Training AI models: UK Government proposes EU style \"opt out ...","snippet":"On 17 December 2024 the UK Government announced its public consultation on 'Copyright and Artificial Intelligence' (Copyright and AI ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1736208000.0,"attribution":"www.dlapiper.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.statnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/14/patent-buyouts-health-care-innovation-cms-drug-price-negotiation/","title":"Patent buyouts are a bold way to spur health innovation - STAT News","snippet":"Patent buyouts could spur vital innovation in antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical fields.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1699920000.0,"attribution":"www.statnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.china-briefing.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/navigating-china-data-as-intellectual-property-regime/","title":"Navigating Data as Intellectual Property Regime in China","snippet":"China is recognizing data as a new form of intellectual property, enabling its registration, licensing, and commercialization.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754483255.0,"attribution":"www.china-briefing.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.mayerbrown.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/06/copyright-and-generative-ai","title":"Copyright and Generative AI | Insights - Mayer Brown","snippet":"This article focuses on the current position in the UK on copyright issues related to generative AI.

Copyright and patent systems were built for an economy of rival physical copies and relatively slow, human-scale creativity.  Large-scale text-and-data mining (TDM), foundation-model training and rapid biotech iteration expose the mismatch.  The past two years have therefore brought a flurry of legislative proposals, court cases and policy experiments that try\u2014only partly successfully\u2014to square that circle.\n\n---\n\n### 1  Why today\u2019s copyright rules feel obsolete\n\n1. **Excessive term length & fragmentation.**  A novel published in 2025 remains under copyright until 2095 in most jurisdictions; AI developers must clear rights territory by territory for corpora that cross borders.\n\n2. **Absence of a clear training exception.**  The U.S. fair-use decisions in *Anthropic*, *Meta* and *OpenAI* have swung both ways within months, leaving developers and creators equally uncertain.  Judge Alsup (N.D. Cal., 24 June 2025) found Anthropic\u2019s use of millions of e-books \u201cexceedingly transformative\u201d, while Judge Stephanos Bibas (D. Del., 11 Feb 2025) held the *Westlaw* headnotes scrape unlawful. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news10\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n3. **Legislative lag.**  The UK\u2019s new Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 and its consultation on an EU-style TDM exception illustrate governments scrambling to retrofit 1980-era statutes for 2025-era model pipelines. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2  AI\u2019s demand for open corpora versus creators\u2019 livelihoods\n\nCreative industries argue that training without permission drains markets for the very works that models ingest; Australian musicians this year called a proposed TDM exception \u201ccultural exploitation\u201d. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news30\ue201  Courts that have ruled in favour of AI companies still emphasise case-specific facts and flag unresolved questions about market harm. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3  The geo-political asymmetry you raised\n\nChina is intensifying, not loosening, IP enforcement domestically\u2014processing \u201cdata\u201d itself as a registrable asset and touting a \u201cPowerful IP Nation\u201d plan for 2025\u2014but its enforcement abroad remains selective and strategic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201  That produces a split-regime world in which:\n\n* Western firms risk litigation at home for conduct their Chinese competitors may carry out with lower legal exposure.  \n* Yet Chinese firms that rely on Western export markets increasingly face suits in those jurisdictions, so the asymmetry is not absolute.\n\nThe practical result is policy pressure in OECD countries to either **(a)** assert extraterritorial liability (the \u201clong arm\u201d approach) or **(b)** redesign incentives so that openness does not equal unilateral disarmament.\n\n---\n\n### 4  Patents, vaccines and life-saving innovation\n\nPharma illustrates the basic dilemma: monopoly rents fund R&D, yet exclusivity drives up prices and slows diffusion.  Reform ideas that have matured since COVID-19 include:\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Pros & cons |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Patent buyouts / prizes** | Governments or pooled funds purchase patents at auction and place them in the public domain. | Preserves R&D incentive *ex ante*; allows rapid generic manufacture *ex post*. Requires credible valuation and big public budgets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201 |\n| **Compulsory licences under TRIPS** | States force licences for public-health emergencies, paying regulated royalties. | Quick, but can chill private investment if used frequently. |\n| **Advance market commitments** | Public funders guarantee a volume purchase at a fixed price for specified vaccine properties. | Aligns incentives with social value; evidence of success in pneumococcal and COVID-19 contexts. |\n\n---\n\n### 5  A reform menu that balances openness with incentive\n\n| Reform lever | Concrete proposal | Why it addresses your concerns |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Narrow, remunerated training exception** | Grant an automatic licence for TDM when the output is *non-substitutive* and developers pay into a collective management organisation. Mirrors the EU\u2019s 2019 TDM directive and the UK consultation. | Frees model training while compensating creators; avoids cryptic fair-use litigation. |\n| **Copyright term reset for digital works** | Reduce term to, say, 25 years for works first fixed electronically, with optional renewals at modest cost. | Retains incentive horizon that matches modern product lifecycles; accelerates public-domain entry. |\n| **Open patent pools for essential medicines & green tech** | Expand WHO\u2019s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool into a permanent multilateral entity; fund via tiered levies on sales. | Keeps know-how flowing internationally while ensuring innovators earn royalties. |\n| **Public-private \u201cmoonshot\u201d funds** | Large sovereign or multilateral funds place results in the commons in exchange for generous upfront grants and milestone payments. | Decouples knowledge commons from recoupment via exclusivity, neutralising enforcement asymmetries. |\n| **Data trusts & research safe harbours** | Authorised intermediaries store sensitive corpora; researchers and AI labs access under audit, with outputs freely licensed. | Preserves privacy and creator attribution; scales better than case-by-case licences. |\n\n---\n\n### 6  Critiquing (and refining) your stance\n\n*You are right* that blanket exclusivity can become self-harming when the marginal cost of copying is near-zero and the upside of recombination is enormous.  The early 20th-century patent pools for aviation and semiconductors show how openness can accelerate progress.\n\n*But*, abolishing IP altogether would likely undercut privately financed, high-risk R&D\u2014particularly in capital-intensive domains like wet-lab biotech\u2014unless large public budgets or prize mechanisms fully replace that signal.  Empirical work after the 2020-21 vaccine race found that expected monopoly rents were a decisive factor for mRNA platform investment.\n\nMoreover, the recent U.S. fair-use rulings demonstrate that courts can interpret existing doctrine as *enabling* innovation when the use is genuinely transformative; a full statutory rewrite is not the only path. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201  What industry lacks is clarity and global convergence, not necessarily the complete demolition of rights.\n\n---\n\n### 7  Looking forward: three scenarios\n\n| Scenario | 2030 outcome | Strategic advice |\n|----------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Patchwork** | Divergent national exceptions; forum-shopping; continued litigation. | Multinational AI labs maintain parallel data pipelines per jurisdiction. |\n| **Managed commons** | OECD plus key emerging markets adopt remunerated TDM licences; patent buyouts normalised for pandemics. | Balance of private and public R&D stable; model access to global corpora routine. |\n| **Open acceleration** | A critical mass of states (perhaps led by the G20) signs a \u201cKnowledge Commons Treaty\u201d capping copyright at 20 years and mandating default compulsory licences for health technologies. | Rapid diffusion of innovation but shifts R&D-investment burden to the public sector; China may sign on to shape rules. |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReform is indeed urgent\u2014but the evidence suggests that *hybrid* solutions, not abolition, best harness AI\u2019s transformative potential while still rewarding creativity and risky R&D.  A sensible package would:\n\n1. **Lock in a clear, limited, paid-for TDM exception worldwide.**  \n2. **Shorten digital-era copyright terms and streamline opt-outs.**  \n3. **Deploy patent buyouts, prize funds and pooled licences for mission-critical technologies.**  \n4. **Expand public-investment vehicles that place resulting knowledge directly into the commons.**\n\nWith such a framework, openness becomes a competitive advantage rather than a unilateral concession, and the world need not choose between human progress and fair remuneration."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1news10\ue202turn1search9\ue201","start_idx":1324,"end_idx":1355,"safe_urls":["https://quicktakes.loeb.com/post/102k035/federal-court-holds-that-creator-of-ai-tool-infringed-copyright-in-training-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/25/anthropic-did-not-breach-copyright-when-training-ai-on-books-without-permission-court-rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/25/anthropic-did-not-breach-copyright-when-training-ai-on-books-without-permission-court-rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Quick Takes](https://quicktakes.loeb.com/post/102k035/federal-court-holds-that-creator-of-ai-tool-infringed-copyright-in-training-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Anthropic did not breach copyright when training AI on books without permission, court rules","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/25/anthropic-did-not-breach-copyright-when-training-ai-on-books-without-permission-court-rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750875414.0,"snippet":"A U.S. federal judge has ruled that Anthropic did not breach copyright law when it used books to train its Claude large language model (LLM), citing the use as \"fair use.\" Judge William Alsup likened the AI's training process to a writer learning from other authors to create something new and transformative.

The report suggests adding a \"fair-dealing\" exception to the Copyright Act to permit \"text and data mining.\" Critics argue this move would let multinational corporations profit from Australian cultural output\u2014songs, stories, and books\u2014without consent or payment, risking cultural exploitation and financial harm to creators.\n\nAuthors like Michael Robotham and Toni Jordan echoed these concerns, warning of a loss to Australia's cultural heritage and creative industry sustainability. A prior APRA AMCOS report found that 82% of music creators were worried about AI's impact on earnings, estimating a potential $520 million revenue loss within four years. The Australian Recording Industry Association and APRA AMCOS criticized the proposal as unnecessary and damaging, urging the government to strengthen existing copyright laws, support licensing frameworks, and reject frameworks that protect overseas AI firms at the expense of national creativity.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Australian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201","start_idx":2030,"end_idx":2049,"safe_urls":["https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ai-companies-prevail-in-path-breaking-decisions-on-fair-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Crowell & Moring](https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ai-companies-prevail-in-path-breaking-decisions-on-fair-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AI Companies Prevail in Path-Breaking Decisions on Fair Use","url":"https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ai-companies-prevail-in-path-breaking-decisions-on-fair-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1751241600.0,"snippet":"Recent California decisions found AI training on copyrighted works can be fair use, but with significant caveats and differing judicial reasoning.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Crowell & Moring"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":2326,"end_idx":2358,"safe_urls":["https://www.china-briefing.com/news/navigating-china-data-as-intellectual-property-regime/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.chinaiplawupdate.com/2025/05/china-issues-the-2025-intellectual-property-nation-building-promotion-plan-to-accelerate-the-construction-of-a-powerful-intellectual-property-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([China Briefing](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/navigating-china-data-as-intellectual-property-regime/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [China IP Law Update](https://www.chinaiplawupdate.com/2025/05/china-issues-the-2025-intellectual-property-nation-building-promotion-plan-to-accelerate-the-construction-of-a-powerful-intellectual-property-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Navigating Data as Intellectual Property Regime in China","url":"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/navigating-china-data-as-intellectual-property-regime/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1754483255.0,"snippet":"China is recognizing data as a new form of intellectual property, enabling its registration, licensing, and commercialization.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"China Briefing"},{"title":"China Issues the 2025 Intellectual Property Nation Building ...","url":"https://www.chinaiplawupdate.com/2025/05/china-issues-the-2025-intellectual-property-nation-building-promotion-plan-to-accelerate-the-construction-of-a-powerful-intellectual-property-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746662400.0,"snippet":"China issues the 2025 intellectual property nation building promotion plan to accelerate the construction of a powerful intellectual property country.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"China IP Law Update"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201","start_idx":3466,"end_idx":3511,"safe_urls":["https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/patent-buyouts-can-help-win-race-against-coronavirus-mutations?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167718716301084?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/14/patent-buyouts-health-care-innovation-cms-drug-price-negotiation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/14/patent-buyouts-health-care-innovation-cms-drug-price-negotiation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [CEPR](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/patent-buyouts-can-help-win-race-against-coronavirus-mutations?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167718716301084?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Patent buyouts are a bold way to spur health innovation -
