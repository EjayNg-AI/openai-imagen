Instead, Polytechnic admission still uses the **ELR2B2** aggregate system (English + 2 *Relevant* + 2 *Best* subjects) though with some tweaks starting 2028. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the relevant changes and criteria (so you see why L1R4 is for JC, not poly):\n\n---\n\n### Current Polytechnic Admission (pre-2028 and continuing in 2028)\n\n- The main admission measure is **ELR2B2 net aggregate score**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n- The net cut-off is currently **26 points** (i.e. your ELR2B2 score must not exceed 26) for most diploma courses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search9\ue201  \n- For **Nursing** diplomas, a looser cut-off (28 points) is allowed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n- In 2028, a change is introduced: **you may use one \u201cbest\u201d subject at the G2 level** (the rest must be G3) for the ELR2B2 aggregate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search20\ue201  \n- The cut-off is correspondingly adjusted **from 26 \u2192 22 points** (for most courses) under the new mapping. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search23\ue202turn0search2\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### What the L1R4 criterion is for\n\n- L1R4 is the new criterion that will apply beginning 2028 **for Junior College (JC) and Millennia Institute (MI)** admission, replacing the earlier L1R5 system. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search18\ue201  \n- Under L1R4 for JC: students are assessed on **5 subjects** (1 language + 4 relevant subjects) and must meet a gross aggregate \u2264 16 points. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search14\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n- The \u201crelevant subjects\u201d requirement ensures coverage in humanities, science/math, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search18\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and conclusion\n\n- For **polytechnic admission**, even in 2028, the **ELR2B2** (English + 2 relevant + 2 best) is the correct aggregate metric (with the allowance of one \u201cbest\u201d subject at G2).  \n- L1R4 is for **JC / MI admission** (pre-university track), not for polytechnic entry.  \n- So your student (graduating in 2028) should aim to satisfy the ELR2B2-based criteria for polytechnic, not L1R4.\n\nIf you like, I can show you sample ELR2B2 computations, or compare projected cut-offs for poly courses in 2028 under the new scheme.

For Business/Accountancy diplomas, **POA can count as a relevant subject**, while **A-Math is not required**. For Computing/Engineering, many courses accept E-Math, but **A-Math strengthens eligibility and readiness**. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\nHere\u2019s the decision rule I use with Sec students who don\u2019t like science:\n\n1) **If he\u2019s likely to choose Business/Accountancy/Banking at poly:**  \n   - **POA is directly useful** and is part of the **ELR2B2-B** relevant-subject basket for those courses. Typical MERs: English \u2265 C6, **Mathematics (E or A) \u2265 C6**, plus one \u201crelevant\u201d subject (POA, humanities, etc.). So POA can both help his aggregate (as R2) and build head-start knowledge. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search11\ue201\n\n2) **If there\u2019s any chance of Computing/Data/Engineering later:**  \n   - **Pick A-Math.** While many IT courses only demand E-Math, A-Math improves fit for more technical diplomas and makes Year-1 math far less painful; some courses explicitly prefer/require stronger math. It also preserves the **option to pivot to JC** later (JC requires \u201cany 1 Mathematics\u201d at least, and A-Math gives a better platform). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n3) **If he\u2019s set on Design/Media/Comms:**  \n   - Neither POA nor A-Math is typically required; choose the subject he\u2019ll **score best in** to lower ELR2B2. (Admission is competitive on net points.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n4) **2028 tweak to scoring (good to know):**  \n   - From 2028 intake, one of the two \u201cB\u201d subjects in ELR2B2 may be at **G2** level; the rest must be **G3**. This doesn\u2019t change the POA vs A-Math trade-off above, but it can slightly improve the aggregate if one weaker subject sits in B2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\n### Practical recommendation\n- **Business/Finance goal \u2192 POA.**  \n- **Any chance of tech/quant paths or keeping JC door open \u2192 A-Math.**  \n- **Unsure:** A-Math is the safer hedge; it keeps more pathways open. If he truly dislikes math and is firmly business-oriented, POA is fine and strategically relevant.\n\nIf you tell me his top 2\u20133 diploma targets, I\u2019ll map exact **ELR2B2 type (A/B/C/D), MERs, and where POA/A-Math slots in** for those courses."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":326,"end_idx":387,"safe_urls":["https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/2026-jae/polytechnic-aggregate-types-computation-2026-jae.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/polytechnics?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.np.edu.sg/schools-courses/academic-schools/school-of-business-accountancy/diploma-in-business-studies?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.nyp.edu.sg/student/study/admissions/o-level/jae/aggregate-score-types?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Ministry of Education](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/polytechnics?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Polytechnics - Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE)","url":"https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/polytechnics?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"To be eligible for admission into a polytechnic diploma course, you must meet these 2 criteria: Your ELR2B2 net aggregate score must not exceed 26.
