I\u2019ve grouped them by primary emphasis so you can structure your reading path.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Mathematical Statistics (Rigorous Foundations)\n\n**Casella, George & Berger, Roger L. \u2013 *Statistical Inference***  \nA gold-standard graduate-level text. Rigorous treatment of probability, estimation, hypothesis testing, likelihood methods, and asymptotics. Strong proofs and exercises. Excellent bridge between probability theory and applied inference.\n\n**Bickel, Peter J. & Doksum, Kjell A. \u2013 *Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics* (Vols. I & II)**  \nMore measure-theoretic than Casella\u2013Berger. Includes asymptotic theory, exponential families, robustness, and semiparametric inference. Volume II ventures into more advanced territory.\n\n**Lehmann, E. L. & Casella, George \u2013 *Theory of Point Estimation* / *Testing Statistical Hypotheses***  \nTwo separate but complementary classics, with a highly rigorous and comprehensive approach to the core theory of estimation and hypothesis testing. The proofs are meticulous, and these are definitive references for mathematical statisticians.\n\n**van der Vaart, Aad W. \u2013 *Asymptotic Statistics***  \nFor a more measure-theoretic, modern asymptotic approach, covering LAN theory, MLE, efficiency, and empirical process methods.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Frequentist & Classical Inference (Applied but Still Mathematical)\n\n**Mood, Alexander M., Graybill, Franklin A., & Boes, Duane C. \u2013 *Introduction to the Theory of Statistics***  \nAn older classic\u2014less measure theory, more probability calculus, with clear examples and derivations. Good for building intuition.\n\n**Hogg, Robert V., McKean, Joseph W., & Craig, Allen T. \u2013 *Introduction to Mathematical Statistics***  \nAnother standard graduate text, with clear coverage of sampling distributions, estimation, and hypothesis testing. Accessible yet mathematically solid.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Bayesian Statistics (Foundations to Advanced)\n\n**Bernardo, Jos\u00e9 M. & Smith, Adrian F. M. \u2013 *Bayesian Theory***  \nA mathematically rigorous foundation of Bayesian inference, including decision-theoretic grounding, reference priors, and asymptotics.\n\n**Robert, Christian P. \u2013 *The Bayesian Choice***  \nCovers Bayesian decision theory, model comparison, computational techniques (MCMC, importance sampling), and asymptotic properties.\n\n**Gelman, Andrew et al. \u2013 *Bayesian Data Analysis*** (BDA3)  \nLess formal than Bernardo\u2013Smith or Robert, but comprehensive in applied Bayesian modeling. Covers hierarchical models, computation, diagnostics, and applied case studies.\n\n**Ghosh, Jayanta K., Delampady, Mohan, & Samanta, Tapas \u2013 *An Introduction to Bayesian Analysis: Theory and Methods***  \nA mathematically precise introduction to Bayesian methods, covering both theoretical foundations and computational methods.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Additional References for Specialized Topics\n\n**Schervish, Mark J. \u2013 *Theory of Statistics***  \nMeasure-theoretic, rigorous, and wide-ranging\u2014covers both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives.\n\n**O\u2019Hagan, Anthony & Forster, Jonathan \u2013 *Kendall\u2019s Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 2B: Bayesian Inference***  \nPart of the Kendall series; highly technical Bayesian treatment.\n\n**Berger, James O. \u2013 *Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis***  \nConnects Bayesian and frequentist decision-theoretic approaches with a solid mathematical backbone.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also **design a structured reading progression** that starts with probability prerequisites, moves into classical inference, then introduces Bayesian theory in a mathematically coherent order. This would ensure you cover both perspectives deeply and without redundancy."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"96ed5051ee0d3d80-DFW","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"bd18adea-8c6c-43c3-8cf0-beddfba40207","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bd18adea-8c6c-43c3-8cf0-beddfba40207","children":[]}}}
