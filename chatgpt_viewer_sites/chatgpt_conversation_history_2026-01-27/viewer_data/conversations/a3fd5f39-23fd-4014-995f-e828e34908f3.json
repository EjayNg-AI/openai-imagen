Let's consider a simple yet fundamental theorem in mathematics: the fact that the sum of two even numbers is even. We will write this theorem and its proof using Lean.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the necessary libraries. For this theorem, the basic arithmetic library is sufficient.\n\nHere's the Lean code:\n\n```lean\n-- Import the basic arithmetic library\nimport data.int.basic\n\n-- Define the theorem\ntheorem sum_of_two_evens_is_even (a b : \u2124) (h1 : even a) (h2 : even b) : even (a + b) :=\nbegin\n  -- Unpack the definitions of evenness for a and b\n  cases h1 with k1 hk1,\n  cases h2 with k2 hk2,\n  -- Show that a + b is also even\n  use (k1 + k2),\n  -- Perform the necessary algebraic manipulations\n  rw [hk1, hk2],\n  ring,\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import the Arithmetic Library**:\n   ```lean\n   import data.int.basic\n   ```\n   This imports basic integer arithmetic functions and the definition of even numbers.\n\n2. **Theorem Definition**:\n   ```lean\n   theorem sum_of_two_evens_is_even (a b : \u2124) (h1 : even a) (h2 : even b) : even (a + b) :=\n   ```\n   This defines the theorem stating that if `a` and `b` are even integers, then their sum `a + b` is also even.\n\n3. **Proof**:\n   - **Unpack the Definitions**:\n     ```lean\n     cases h1 with k1 hk1,\n     cases h2 with k2 hk2,\n     ```\n     Here, `h1` and `h2` provide that `a = 2 * k1` and `b = 2 * k2` for some integers `k1` and `k2`.\n\n   - **Show `a + b` is Even**:\n     ```lean\n     use (k1 + k2),\n     ```\n     We show that the sum `a + b` can be written as `2 * (k1 + k2)`.\n\n   - **Algebraic Manipulations**:\n     ```lean\n     rw [hk1, hk2],\n     ring,\n     ```\n     Substitute the expressions for `a` and `b` and use the `ring` tactic to simplify and prove the equality.\n\nThis is a simple example, but it demonstrates how to write a theorem and its proof in Lean. For more complex theorems, the approach would be similar: importing necessary libraries, defining the theorem, and constructing the proof using Lean's tactics and logical reasoning."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"A","parent_id":"aaa27fd8-83c4-4d4a-81d9-b4dfdf181d08","request_id":"8a94a2365b30410c-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa27fd8-83c4-4d4a-81d9-b4dfdf181d08","children":[]}}}
