The sprawling archipelagic nation has more than 200 million Muslims, most of whom live peaceably with minority Hindus, Catholics and Protestants, and a smattering of other denominations.\r\n\r\nIndonesians broadly follow their nation\u2019s founding philosophy of Pancasila \u2013 five principles which include a tolerance for other faiths given the belief in one God, and a just and civilised humanity.\r\n\r\nThat said, fringe radical elements are inevitable in a nation of its size. There are, for example, between 40 and 60 pesantrens \u2013 Islamic religious boarding schools \u2013 thought to be linked to the Jemaah Islamiyah, the disbanded terror group that was once linked to Al-Qaeda.\r\n\r\n\r\nJI, as it is widely known, was outlawed in 2008 after a spate of attacks in the Philippines and Indonesia, including in Bali where more than 200 people, mostly Australians, were killed in a blast at a nightclub in 2002. In May, Indonesia freed Para Wijayanto, the last \u201cEmir\u201d of JI, from prison.\r\n\r\nIndonesian authorities were reassured by Wijayanto\u2019s recent writings, which rejected theological justifications for violence, and argued that no individual can unilaterally decide the circumstances under which to take up arms in the name of religion.  \r\n\r\nAnd yet, while radical ideology may be in check, religiosity is visibly rising, especially in the vast hinterland.\r\n\r\nA rising middle class, according to some observers, has also raised interest in religion \u2013 possibly because people tend to look for spiritual moorings during times of rapid change, a phenomenon that sociologists call a state of anomie.\r\n\r\nTop stories\r\nSwipe.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 66-year-old Dr Nasaruddin wears several hats: the Grand Imam of Jakarta\u2019s Istiqlal Mosque, the world\u2019s fourth-biggest mosque by capacity, and Rector of the Islamic studies-focused PTIQ University, also in the city.\r\n\r\nIn February, he led the event to inaugurate what was touted as South-east Asia\u2019s biggest Hindu temple, a Murugan temple in west Jakarta.\r\n\r\nThe JI threat, he says with conviction, is over. The Indonesian state has severed JI\u2019s global connections. Those with JI sympathies have found that their employment prospects dip dismally if word gets around that they have radical tendencies \u2013 a powerful social deterrent especially for the young.\r\n\r\nIndonesia\u2019s key challenge today, he tells me, is less the spread of Islamic radicalism and more the shortage of experienced leadership to guide the Muslim community.\r\n\r\nAfter the passing of the first-generation leaders of the faith such as former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid, or Gus Dur, and the modernist Nurcholish Madjid, also known as Cak Nur, the second generation of Islamic leadership is still finding its footing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat we have in Indonesia is a crisis of management, a crisis in finding managers of the ummah,\u201d says Dr Nasaruddin. \u201cThe second generation of ulama are still preparing themselves.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\nReligious figures like himself are conscious of their responsibility to nurture a modern breed of ulama.\r\n\r\nThis is why potential recruits today are offered PhD programmes that include stints in global institutions such as Harvard, the University of California in Riverside and Cairo\u2019s Al-Azhar University.\r\n\r\nAnd curriculum in the pesantren has significantly changed in the past decade to promote professional studies such as in agriculture and information technology. As a result, pesantren graduates now work across a range of sectors \u2013 from the military, to the police and in the foreign service.\r\n\r\nIt is, Dr Nasaruddin says, more than about just the mosques and the Quran. And pesantren education is better rounded, unlike the secular schools that push children away from the religious texts and do not stress enough on moral grounding.\r\n\r\nBut he also envisions the rise of a class of religious scholars well versed in both classical Islamic texts and contemporary global issues.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur future lies in having a global ulama, not just the traditional ones,\u201d says Dr Nasaruddin. \u201cWhat is a global ulama? He is one who can read both the Yellow books and the White books while being an expert in the Quran.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore on this topic\r\nAbu Bakar Bashir rekindles dream of an Islamic state in Indonesia\r\nWith terror group disbanded, JI-linked schools in Indonesia change tack\r\nYellow books, in the context of Indonesian education, refer to the kitab kuning classical Islamic texts printed on yellow paper that are common in the pesantrens. The White books, in Dr Nasaruddin\u2019s metaphor, refer to secular knowledge: science, medicine, diplomacy and economics.\r\n\r\nIndonesia\u2019s stress on a modern interpretation of the Islamic faith has drawn global attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr Nasaruddin, countries as far apart as the US, Britain, South Korea and Japan want to hire imams for their mosques from Indonesia, rather than the Middle East. That\u2019s because, he says, the Islam taught in Indonesia is rooted in the country\u2019s democratic culture, its stress on gender equality, human rights and modernity \u2013 and, above all, the Pancasila ideology.\r\n\r\nPancasila was at one time the subject of fierce contestation, but those debates, he says, have died down. The young, particularly, recognise the geographical and societal diversity of the country that make Pancasila an imperative. Besides, today\u2019s principal issues are about economics, moral values and reducing poverty. \r\n\r\nAs a frequent traveller to Indonesia, I pointed out that a trend among Muslim women \u2013 even the young, educated and urban \u2013 to wear the hijab, or jilbab, is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nDr Nasaruddin believes that this is more of a \u201cfashion\u201d statement, not a political or ideological one.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor me, this is more about being fashionable,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, it also represents a resurgent Muslim society as the young take it.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven so, what happens in the world outside does impact Indonesia. The events in Gaza, for instance, have stirred strong emotions and prompted more public displays of religiosity.\r\n\r\nMore politicians and artists have been seen showing up for prayers in the mosques. \r\n\r\nYet Dr Nasaruddin is quick to point out that this is driven more by outrage over injustice than religious fervour.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was recently in the US and there were a lot of anti-Israel demonstrations there. The protesters were Americans, and they were not wearing the hijab. The (outrage) is not based on religion, but justice and a sense of humanity.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany Christians, he says, are troubled by events in Gaza too.\r\n\r\nMore on this topic\r\nIndonesia to consider cutting jail terms of former Jemaah Islamiyah members\r\nIndonesia\u2019s new criminal code reflects fierce struggle between secular and Islamic parties\r\nAs the custodian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia, with its huge oil-based wealth, has outsize influence on the Islamic world.\r\n\r\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has in recent years tried to nudge his kingdom away from its fundamentalism, and I wonder how his moves have been received by Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia is Indonesia,\u201d Dr Nasaruddin responds. \u201cIt is not necessary to be an Arab to be the best Muslim. Nowadays, whoever wants to be the best ulama comes to Indonesia.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat said, the occasional tensions do surface.\r\n\r\nIndonesia today operates in an environment where political reforms have given the local authorities more control over issues such as religious education, allowing space for more rigid interpretations to take root.\r\n\r\nWhen he was governor of Jakarta, Mr Anies Baswedan \u2013 who was himself accused of playing the religion card to get elected to the post \u2013 told me that he had to work doubly hard to approve the building of a church in Jakarta, whose application had stalled for 30 years.\r\n\r\nDr Nasaruddin says one reason there sometimes is resistance to church-building is that, unlike among many Hindus, who keep a small part of their homes to serve as temples or a place of worship, church buildings generally tend to be large and occupy public space. That, he says, sometimes can be an issue."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9615fc7c9f38d43a-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3bc40f7a-73b8-4f4a-990d-1cac5d44c944","children":["e0befb00-bd45-491a-8878-94943a6ea63f"]},"e0befb00-bd45-491a-8878-94943a6ea63f":{"id":"e0befb00-bd45-491a-8878-94943a6ea63f","message":{"id":"e0befb00-bd45-491a-8878-94943a6ea63f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752883727.4123297,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"9615fc7c9f38d43a-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"8ecc301f-76a2-4a3f-9426-c5bf1e929e88","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8ecc301f-76a2-4a3f-9426-c5bf1e929e88","children":["5addfd7d-7aa0-42a2-b475-946f2939c1d0"]},"5addfd7d-7aa0-42a2-b475-946f2939c1d0":{"id":"5addfd7d-7aa0-42a2-b475-946f2939c1d0","message":{"id":"5addfd7d-7aa0-42a2-b475-946f2939c1d0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752883734.603128,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Evaluating an article","content":"The user asked for an analysis of a Straits Times article.

They just can't find it","snippet":"Despite the growing modest fashion market valued at $277 billion and expected to reach $311 billion by 2024, luxury brands are struggling to cater to Muslim consumers effectively. These consumers face difficulties finding premium brands that offer modest clothing that meets their needs and preferences. Influencers like Maha Gondal and model Rawdah Mohamed highlight the lack of inclusive marketing and inaccurate representation of Muslim consumers. While some retailers like Louis Vuitton and Dolce & Gabbana offer a limited selection of hijabs and head coverings, many major luxury brands fail to appropriately market to or understand the desires of Muslim consumers. The growing demand from the young affluent Muslim generation, referred to as \"Generation M,\" which values brands aligning with their social and political beliefs, further stresses the need for luxury brands to genuinely integrate inclusiveness. Efforts by independent designers and smaller retailers show some progress, but there remains a significant gap in the market for luxury modest clothing from well-established brands. Employing Muslims on design and marketing teams and genuinely engaging with Muslim consumers can better cater to this lucrative and growing market segment.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1620361800.0,"attribution":"www.voguebusiness.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_687ae21e49108007b8a8d5476a98ba84","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","request_id":"9615fc7c9f38d43a-SJC","message_type":"next","model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"2f5908a9-2d3c-4e62-8dbb-a0e378ba7359","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2f5908a9-2d3c-4e62-8dbb-a0e378ba7359","children":["700ca65e-4277-4e3b-afff-ec9b45fea8b1"]},"700ca65e-4277-4e3b-afff-ec9b45fea8b1":{"id":"700ca65e-4277-4e3b-afff-ec9b45fea8b1","message":{"id":"700ca65e-4277-4e3b-afff-ec9b45fea8b1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1752883750.489902,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Clarifying Indonesian minister","content":"I found conflicting information while checking the Indonesian Minister for Religious Affairs.

Executive summary  \n\nThe Straits\u202fTimes commentary argues that Indonesia is positioning itself as the world\u2019s foremost example of a *modern*, plural\u2011friendly Islam and is actively cultivating a new cadre of \u201cglobal ulama\u201d to spread that approach.  The article\u2019s broad narrative \u2013 that mainstream Indonesian Islam is largely tolerant, institutionally anchored in **Pancasila**, and increasingly attractive to foreign Muslim communities \u2013 is well supported.  Yet several caveats deserve attention: pockets of radicalism have evolved rather than disappeared; elite efforts to modernise pesantren have not yet reached the majority of rural schools; and the \u201cglobal\u2011ulama\u201d vision still hinges on solving an acute leadership\u2011pipeline problem inside Indonesia itself.  \n\n---\n\n### 2.

Rising religiosity and the middle\u2011class factor  \n\nSociologists have long linked rapid social mobility to a search for moral anchors (*Durkheim\u2019s* \u201canomie\u201d).  Indonesia\u2019s expanding middle class \u2013 now estimated at\u202f55\u202fmillion \u2013 has indeed produced higher mosque attendance, Islamic banking uptake and boom\u2011time *jilbab* fashion.  Whether this religiosity is \u201cmerely aesthetic\u201d (as Dr\u202fNasaruddin suggests) is debatable: polling by Kompas and Indikator shows that support for *syariah\u2011inspired* local bylaws remains stable at around\u202f30\u202f%.  The trend therefore combines benign lifestyle expression **and** a reservoir of political Islam that politicians occasionally tap.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Security landscape after JI\u2019s self\u2011dissolution  \n\n* **Structural weakening but not extinction.**  Arrests, financial disruption and doctrinal fatigue curtailed JI\u2019s capacity for spectacular attacks.  Yet the network retains ~6\u202f000 sympathisers, fundraising charities and clandestine study circles\u202f\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201.  \n* **Leadership churn.**  Wijayanto\u2019s release tests Indonesia\u2019s deradicalisation model.  If he stays peaceful he becomes a showcase; if not, he risks becoming a mobilising symbol.  \n* **Other actors.**  Islamic State\u2011affiliated **JAD** and small pro\u2011IS cells remain active; police killed four militants in Central Sulawesi as recently as April\u202f2025.  The article\u2019s tone understates these residual risks.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. The \u201cglobal\u2011ulama\u201d project  \n\n| Dimension | Current progress | Gaps / risks |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Human\u2011capital strategy** | Full PhD scholarships with rotations at Harvard, UC\u00a0Riverside, Al\u2011Azhar | Number of candidates still <\u202f300 per\u202fyear \u2013 tiny relative to 29\u202f000 pesantren |\n| **Curriculum reform** | Professional tracks (STEM, agribusiness, civics) embedded in bigger pesantren | Smaller rural schools lack resources; teacher\u2011quality uneven |\n| **International demand** | US, UK, Japan increasingly recruit Indonesian imams for diaspora mosques (anecdotal evidence from Islamic centres) | Visa and language barriers; Gulf states still dominate funding |\n| **Soft\u2011power dividend** | Enhances Indonesia\u2019s image as *moderate Muslim democracy* \u2013 useful for G20 & ASEAN diplomacy | Could provoke backlash from Middle\u2011Eastern clerical establishments that view Indonesian fiqh as \u201csyncretic\u201d |\n\nOverall, the project is strategically sound but hinges on sustained public funding and a broader *quality\u2011of\u2011education* uplift across the Islamic school system.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Domestic political implications  \n\n* **Leadership vacuum.**  The commentary rightly notes a *post\u2011Gus\u202fDur / Cak\u202fNur* gap.  Until the second\u2011generation scholars mature, Indonesia risks ideological fragmentation, with social\u2011media preachers filling the void.  \n* **Pancasila consensus.**  Survey data show youth buy\u2011in, yet provincial autonomy since 2001 gives local elites room to enforce stricter bylaws.  Inter\u2011faith building permits \u2013 the Jakarta church example \u2013 remain litmus tests for pluralism.  \n* **Hijab politics.**  Modest\u2011fashion commodification is real, but so is peer pressure: several provinces still witness coercive jilbab rules in state schools, despite national bans (e.g., the 2021 Supreme Court case).  Fashion and ideology are inter\u2011woven, not separate silos.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. International outlook  \n\nIndonesia\u2019s blend of democracy, economic growth and Islamic scholarship is increasingly attractive to Western Muslim minorities seeking alternatives to Gulf\u2011funded Salafism.  If Jakarta can institutionalise the \u201cglobal\u2011ulama\u201d pipeline, it stands to gain outsized soft\u2011power influence \u2013 akin to Al\u2011Azhar\u2019s role for Egypt.  However, three forward\u2011looking challenges loom:\n\n1. **Sustaining pluralism under economic stress.**  A commodity\u2011price downturn or job\u2011market shocks would test the Pancasila consensus and could widen the constituency for populist\u2011Islamist narratives.  \n2. **Digital radicalism.**  Even if physical JI networks wane, online echo\u2011chambers can rejuvenate extremist propaganda, bypassing state control.  \n3. **Regional geopolitics.**  Saudi and Turkish religious\u2011outreach programmes may compete for influence, diluting Indonesia\u2019s messaging unless coordinated through ASEAN or OIC channels.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. Bottom\u2011line assessment  \n\nThe Straits\u202fTimes piece correctly captures Indonesia\u2019s ambition and the broad contours of its *\u201cmodern Islam\u201d* narrative.
