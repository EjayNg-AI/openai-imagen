In the decades since, physicists have struggled to extend these theories or solve their open questions. Experiments have grown larger and more expensive, but often returned null results. As physicist Sabine Hossenfelder observes, \u201cnothing is moving in the foundations of physics\u201d \u2014 no new particles, no new symmetries, no extra dimensions have turned up despite countless predictions\u30105\u2020L17-L24\u3011. Some refer to a *\u201ccrisis\u201d* in physics\u30105\u2020L29-L37\u3011, though Hossenfelder prefers to call it a **stagnation**: a decades-long era where theoretical speculation has vastly outpaced empirical discovery\u30105\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u30105\u2020L42-L50\u3011. \n\nThis report examines the evidence for a slowdown in fundamental physics since the 1980s, focusing on three areas: \n\n- **The Standard Model of Particle Physics** \u2013 We review its status, the major open problems (like the hierarchy problem, matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry, neutrino mass), and whether any significant extensions have been achieved in the past ~40 years.  \n- **Cosmology and the Big Bang** \u2013 We assess theories of cosmic origins (inflation, etc.) and cosmic ingredients (dark matter, dark energy), asking if they have become more predictive or testable, and whether we\u2019ve made progress understanding the early universe (e.g. inflation\u2019s cause or the initial singularity).  \n- **Quantum Gravity** \u2013 We survey leading approaches (string theory, loop quantum gravity, asymptotic safety, emergent spacetime models) and ask if any have yielded testable predictions or deep unifying insights.  \n\nFinally, we discuss to what extent fundamental physics may have stalled and whether current strategies are yielding diminishing returns. We include commentary from leading physicists on both the pessimistic and optimistic sides, and highlight some promising or contrarian approaches that might break the logjam. Throughout, we cite major theoretical and experimental developments since the 1980s to ground the analysis.\n\n## The Standard Model: Triumphs, Open Questions, and a Lack of New Particles  \nThe **Standard Model (SM)** is a quantum field theory describing the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces and all known elementary particles. It was formulated in the 1960s\u201370s and by the mid-1970s all its components were in place\u301023\u2020L52-L59\u3011. For the next few decades, experiments returned a blizzard of data *confirming* the SM\u2019s predictions, but **no clear inconsistencies** to guide further breakthroughs\u301023\u2020L52-L59\u3011. The SM\u2019s crowning moment came in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson, the final predicted particle, which \u201cfulfilled a 45-year-old prediction\u201d and **completed the Standard Model**\u301020\u2020L30-L38\u3011\u301020\u2020L33-L41\u3011. Yet even as this success was celebrated, physicists grew uneasy: the Higgs turned out to behave exactly as the SM predicted, and *nothing else new* appeared\u301023\u2020L67-L75\u3011. This outcome \u2013 sometimes called the LHC\u2019s **\u201cnightmare scenario\u201d** \u2013 meant no obvious clues to \u201cwhat lies beyond the Standard Model\u201d were found\u301020\u2020L38-L44\u3011. Caltech physicist Barry Barish voiced the disappointment shared by many: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit disappointing\u2026 I thought we would discover supersymmetry,\u201d he said when reflecting on a decade of LHC results\u301020\u2020L38-L44\u3011. In short, **no extension to the Standard Model has been confirmed by experiment in decades**, despite strong theoretical arguments that new physics should exist.  \n\nBelow we outline the Standard Model\u2019s key open questions and what progress (or lack thereof) has been made on each since the 1980s:\n\n- **Why is the Higgs so light? (The Hierarchy Problem & Naturalness):** In the SM, the Higgs boson\u2019s mass is unstable against quantum corrections, which naively push it up to the scale of new physics (such as the Planck scale). Yet the Higgs mass is around 125 GeV \u2013 **unnaturally small** unless cancellations occur. This *hierarchy problem* led to myriad theories in the 1980s\u201390s (supersymmetry, technicolor, extra dimensions, etc.) predicting new particles or symmetries to stabilize the Higgs. However, **none of these proposed particles (no supersymmetric partners, no extra-dimensional gravitons, etc.) have been found**\u30105\u2020L17-L24\u3011\u30105\u2020L59-L67\u3011. The LHC\u2019s null results for such beyond-SM (BSM) particles put naturalness-based solutions under severe strain\u30109\u2020L15-L23\u3011. This has prompted some theorists to consider more radical ideas \u2013 e.g. \u201cneutral naturalness\u201d models where new particles are hidden from us, or even invoking the **multiverse** and anthropic selection to explain why the Higgs mass is fine-tuned\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011. Hossenfelder wryly notes that particle physicists have now spent \u201c40 years blathering about naturalness and multiverses,\u201d shifting their \u201cpredictions\u2026 once again to the next larger particle collider\u201d each time a smaller one fails to find anything\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011. In summary, **the hierarchy problem remains unsolved**, and the guiding principle of naturalness is in crisis after decades of fruitless searches\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011. Some now question whether naturalness was a reliable guide at all in this regime\u30109\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u30109\u2020L25-L28\u3011.\n\n- **Why is there more matter than antimatter? (Baryon Asymmetry):** The observable universe is made almost entirely of matter, even though the Big Bang should have created matter and antimatter in equal quantities. Some process in the early universe must have *biased* matter over antimatter. The Standard Model, however, **cannot explain this asymmetry** \u2013 its built-in CP-violation (in quark decays) is far too weak to produce the observed imbalance\u301011\u2020L115-L122\u3011. Since the 1980s, physicists have proposed mechanisms like **electroweak baryogenesis** or **leptogenesis** (where heavy neutrinos decay in a CP-violating way to yield the asymmetry), but these require new particles or high-scale physics not yet observed. Experimental efforts have focused on looking for CP-violation in new sectors (e.g. measuring CP phases in neutrino oscillations, searching for an electric dipole moment of the neutron or electron, etc.). *Progress:* We have measured that neutrinos oscillate with a possible CP-violating phase (recent experiments hint that leptonic CP-violation might be substantial), but it\u2019s not confirmed or sufficient to explain the cosmic matter surplus. Bottom line, **the matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry remains an open puzzle**. The Standard Model *\u201ccannot explain the imbalance,\u201d* so this is direct evidence of BSM physics, but we do not yet know its nature\u301011\u2020L115-L122\u3011.\n\n- **Do neutrinos have mass, and why?** Yes \u2013 an important experimental breakthrough in the late 1990s was the discovery of **neutrino oscillations**, proving that neutrinos have tiny but nonzero masses. This required extending the Standard Model, which originally assumed neutrinos were massless\u301011\u2020L60-L68\u3011. We now know the three known neutrino flavors *mix* into each other and have mass differences, but we still don\u2019t know the absolute mass scale or the mechanism that generates their masses. One leading idea is the **see-saw mechanism** involving heavy \u201cright-handed\u201d neutrinos, but those hypothetical heavy neutrinos (which could also enable leptogenesis for the baryon asymmetry) have not been observed. Over the past decade, neutrino physics has advanced (pinning down mixing angles and the mass-squared differences), yet **fundamental questions remain**: Are neutrinos their own antiparticles (Majorana particles)? Why are their masses so small? Is there perhaps a fourth \u201csterile\u201d neutrino?\u301011\u2020L72-L80\u3011 These are active research areas. In summary, **the Standard Model was incomplete regarding neutrinos** \u2013 it \u201cgot neutrinos wrong\u201d\u301011\u2020L69-L77\u3011 \u2013 and while we\u2019ve characterized neutrino properties better, **we have not identified the new physics behind neutrino mass**.\n\n- **What is the origin of dark matter and dark energy?** (These are not strictly part of the Standard Model, but their existence underscores the SM\u2019s incompleteness.) The SM does not contain a dark matter particle or an explanation for dark energy, yet astrophysical and cosmological evidence shows our universe is ~95% made of these unknown components\u301011\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301011\u2020L93-L101\u3011\u301011\u2020L139-L147\u3011 (discussed in the next section). Their omission in the SM is a glaring deficiency: **5 of the 5 \u201cbig questions\u201d** that the Standard Model fails to answer include *\u201cWhat is dark matter?\u201d* and *\u201cWhy is the expansion of the universe accelerating?\u201d*\u301011\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301011\u2020L84-L93\u3011\u301011\u2020L127-L135\u3011.\n\n- **Other theoretical problems:** The SM has a few other known issues. One is the **strong CP problem** \u2013 why quantum chromodynamics does not violate CP symmetry (the SM\u2019s CP-violating QCD theta angle is experimentally constrained to be extremely close to zero). The likely solution is a new particle, the **axion**, proposed in the late 70s. Axion searches have been ongoing for decades, but so far none has been detected. Another issue is that the SM has many arbitrary parameters (particle masses, mixing angles) and does not unify the forces in a single framework at attainable energies. Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) that were popular in the 1980s (which unify quarks and leptons and predict proton decay) have not seen experimental vindication \u2013 proton decay has not been observed down to very strict limits, disfavoring simplest GUT models. So while **the SM is extraordinarily successful**, it appears to be part of a larger story that remains elusive.\n\nDespite these many open questions, **no significant extension to the Standard Model has been empirically established since the 1980s**. The one clear experimental discovery beyond the original SM was neutrino mass, which *implies* new physics but has not pointed to a full theory of that new physics yet. Other than that, every particle we\u2019ve discovered (top quark in 1995, Higgs in 2012) was an expected part of the SM. In collider experiments, we have essentially been **filling out the pre-existing Standard Model checklist** rather than finding surprises. As Hossenfelder notes, \u201call the data are well explained by the existing theories \u2013 the Standard Model of particle physics and the cosmological concordance model\u201d (\u039bCDM for cosmology)\u30105\u2020L46-L54\u3011. It\u2019s a triumph of those models, but also a frustration: we *know* the current theories are incomplete (for reasons like dark matter and the inconsistency between quantum theory and gravity), yet nature hasn\u2019t yet tipped its hand about what lies beyond\u30105\u2020L51-L59\u3011. \n\nIndeed, the Large Hadron Collider\u2019s primary hope *after* the Higgs was to find evidence of new physics (supersymmetric particles, extra dimensions, or other exotica) at the TeV scale. Prior to the LHC turn-on in 2010, many physicists feared a scenario where **\u201cit might produce the Higgs and nothing else, leaving no clue to what lies beyond the Standard Model.\u201d** As Science magazine reported, *\u201cSo far, that nightmare scenario is coming true.\u201d*\u301020\u2020L38-L44\u3011  The Higgs discovery, while a landmark, provided no hint of supersymmetry or other new phenomena \u2013 the Higgs properties measured so far closely match SM predictions, with no deviations up to the precision of current data\u301023\u2020L69-L75\u3011. With LHC Run 2 and 3, still no statistically significant discovery of any new particle has emerged (occasional anomalies have come and gone). Consequently, there\u2019s a sense that **the SM \u201cworks too well\u201d**: it continues to accurately describe results up to the highest energies probed\u30107\u2020L23-L30\u3011. This leaves physicists in a bind \u2013 we have a theory that *we know* can\u2019t be the final word (it leaves gravity out, etc.), but we lack clear experimental directions to guide the next theory. As theoretical physicist Peter Woit summarizes, by the end of the 1990s *\u201cthe Standard Model was not fully satisfactory, leaving various important questions unanswered, but [there were] no experimental results disagreeing with it. Physicists had little to nothing in the way of hints as to how to proceed.\u201d*\u301023\u2020L52-L59\u3011\n\nOne consequence of the lack of new data is that some theoretical ideas have lingered well past their expiration date. For example, the **supersymmetry (SUSY)** theory (once the dominant candidate for BSM physics) has *so far* failed every empirical test at the LHC, yet many researchers were reluctant to give it up. Woit notes that not seeing superpartners at the LHC *\u201cshould have put the final nail in the coffin\u201d* of low-energy SUSY, which *\u201cexplained nothing\u201d* fundamental and introduced a hundred new parameters\u301026\u2020L76-L84\u3011\u301026\u2020L85-L89\u3011. And yet, until recently, top universities were still teaching graduate courses devoted to SUSY or string theory as if they were the established path forward\u301026\u2020L76-L84\u3011\u301026\u2020L93-L100\u3011. This inertia is now fading \u2013 even **John Ellis**, a prominent CERN theorist and SUSY advocate, concedes that *\u201ctimes have now changed\u201d* and he *\u201cwould be rather reluctant at this time to propose to a PhD student a thesis\u2026 based solely on SUSY,\u201d* given the lack of evidence\u301026\u2020L154-L160\u3011. Young theorists are increasingly exploring other ideas (such as novel approaches in quantum gravity or collider-independent avenues)\u301026\u2020L154-L160\u3011.\n\nIn summary, the Standard Model today stands *victorious yet incomplete*. It elegantly explains **\u201cabout 5 percent of the universe\u201d** \u2013 namely ordinary matter \u2013 but cannot account for the rest\u301011\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301011\u2020L34-L42\u3011. Its internal puzzles (hierarchies, flavor mixing, etc.) remain unresolved. And crucially, since the 1980s physicists have **not been able to extend or supersede the SM** in any experimentally verified way. This stagnation is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that every fundamental particle discovered in the past 40+ years was either already in the SM or implied by an SM extension required decades earlier (neutrino mass). No \u201cunknown\u201d new particle or force has been found despite extensive searches. As Hossenfelder puts it, *\u201cNo new particles, no new dimensions, no new symmetries\u201d* have turned up \u2013 experimenters are \u201cpoking in the dark\u201d without guidance, while theorists are \u201cof no help\u201d because their BSM predictions keep failing\u30105\u2020L17-L25\u3011. The resulting mood in particle physics is one of frustration and reevaluation: has fundamental physics run out of steam, or are we just looking in the wrong places?\n\n## Cosmology and the Big Bang: Inflation, Dark Matter/Energy, and the Early Universe  \nIn parallel with particle physics\u2019 developments, **cosmology** evolved from speculative theory to precision science between the 1980s and today. The **Big Bang model** \u2013 the idea that the universe began in a hot, dense state and has been expanding \u2013 became firmly supported by observations (cosmic microwave background, expansion of galaxies, light element abundances). Yet as the data poured in, cosmologists were forced to confront new ingredients and puzzling phenomena that lie beyond the Standard Model\u2019s scope. Chief among them: the mechanism that set up the Big Bang\u2019s initial conditions (inflation), the constituents of the universe that dominate gravitationally (dark matter) and energetically (dark energy), and the very beginning of time (the singularity problem). Have these issues seen progress in the past few decades? Yes and no \u2013 there have been remarkable theoretical ideas and more precise measurements, but many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Below, we examine each in turn:\n\n- **Cosmic Inflation:** In the early 1980s, inflation was proposed as an add-on to the Big Bang theory \u2013 a brief epoch of enormously rapid expansion in the universe\u2019s first instants. Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Paul Steinhardt and others developed this idea to solve the Big Bang\u2019s nagging puzzles: why is the universe so **uniform** and **geometrically flat** on large scales, and why are there no unwanted relics (magnetic monopoles, etc.)? Inflation provides an elegant explanation: if a patch of the young universe blew up by a factor of at least ~$10^{25}$ in a fraction of a second, any initial curvature or inhomogeneity would be stretched out, yielding an almost-flat, smooth cosmos as observed\u301013\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301013\u2020L41-L49\u3011. Crucially, quantum fluctuations during inflation would seed slight density variations that later grow into galaxies \u2013 and inflation predicts those primordial ripples should be **\u201cnearly scale-invariant,\u201d** meaning fluctuations of all sizes have almost equal amplitude\u301013\u2020L122-L130\u3011.  \n\n  **Successes:** Over the past decades, many predictions of the simplest inflation models have been *confirmed qualitatively* by observations. Satellite missions like COBE, WMAP, and Planck mapped the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and found the density fluctuations to indeed be ~scale-invariant (with a slight tilt), as well as the universe\u2019s geometry to be extremely flat \u2013 consistent with inflation\u2019s expectations\u301013\u2020L62-L70\u3011\u301029\u2020L145-L153\u3011. These successes have made inflation the prevailing paradigm for early-universe cosmology; it is often treated as *\u201cestablished fact\u201d* by cosmologists\u301013\u2020L62-L70\u3011. Yet notably, **inflation is not a concrete single theory but a class of models** \u2013 and so far, observations have not singled out a unique model or unambiguously proved the *physical reality* of inflation. Key evidence is still missing: for example, inflation generically predicts a faint background of **gravity waves** imprinted in the CMB polarization. Experiments are searching for this (the \u201csmoking gun\u201d B-mode polarization signal), but so far results are consistent with zero or a value too small to detect. \n\n  **Open Issues:** Despite its ability to *fit* the data, inflation has become controversial in the past decade on theoretical grounds. One issue is that inflation\u2019s flexibility undermines its predictiveness: with enough adjustment of the inflationary potential and initial conditions, inflationary models can yield a wide range of outcomes. Critics argue it\u2019s sometimes **too easy to retrofit inflation to whatever the data show**, making it hard to falsify. As Steinhardt pointed out, the \u201ctextbook\u201d predictions from the 1980s were based on simple assumptions, but our modern understanding (including the possibility of *eternal inflation*) means *\u201cthe predictions made in the early 1980s\u201d may no longer be the definite predictions of inflation today*\u301029\u2020L151-L158\u3011. In other words, **does inflation still predict anything definite, or can it accommodate almost anything?** This concern became acute with the realization that inflation can be *eternal*: quantum fluctuations can cause inflation to never completely stop, spawning an infinite \u201cmultiverse\u201d of bubble universes with potentially diverse properties\u301029\u2020L216-L224\u3011\u301029\u2020L225-L234\u3011. In an eternally inflating multiverse, \u201canything that can happen will happen, in fact it will happen an infinite number of times\u201d as Alan Guth put it\u301029\u2020L243-L249\u3011. This erodes inflation\u2019s explanatory power \u2013 if all outcomes occur somewhere, one cannot derive unique predictions for our universe without additional \u201cmeasure\u201d rules (which are ambiguous). As Steinhardt and colleagues argue, **inflation\u2019s logical foundations are shaky**: it requires very special initial conditions to start (ironic, given it was meant to relieve fine-tuning), and those conditions might actually be *less likely* than a universe that simply started out homogeneous without inflation\u301029\u2020L160-L168\u3011\u301029\u2020L179-L187\u3011. Moreover, the **\u201cmultiverse\u201d** picture makes it impossible to calculate clear probabilities for observables\u301029\u2020L243-L249\u3011\u301029\u2020L250-L258\u3011. These critiques, voiced in a series of high-profile papers and articles in the 2010s, suggest that inflation *may not* satisfy the standards of a scientific theory that can be conclusively tested\u301012\u2020L23-L26\u3011\u301029\u2020L208-L216\u3011. Supporters of inflation respond that its **track record of successful empirical predictions** (flatness, spectrum, etc.) outweighs these theoretical worries \u2013 \u201ccorroborating evidence trumps any theoretical argument,\u201d as Steinhardt notes, acknowledging why many remain bullish on inflation\u301029\u2020L208-L216\u3011. The debate is ongoing. \n\n  **Alternatives:** The perceived issues with inflation have reinvigorated alternative early-universe models. One idea is a **\u201cbouncing\u201d universe** \u2013 perhaps the Big Bang was actually a Big Bounce from a prior contracting phase. Steinhardt himself has developed a cyclic cosmology model (with multiple bangs and crunches) that tries to explain the same data without inflation\u2019s multiverse issues\u301012\u2020L32-L35\u3011. Other proposals involve a **\u201cslow contraction\u201d** (ekpyrotic universe) or using quantum gravity effects (loop quantum cosmology predicts a bounce that avoids the singularity). So far these are speculative and also face challenges (e.g., producing the right spectrum of perturbations). None has achieved the broad consensus that inflation currently enjoys, but they serve as *contrarian approaches* that could gain traction if inflationary theory hits a dead-end or if some odd observational result (e.g. a particular pattern in CMB anomalies) favors them. It\u2019s worth noting that **the initial singularity** \u2013 the very start of the Big Bang, *t = 0* \u2013 remains outside known physics. Even inflation does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe; it typically assumes a pre-existing inflaton field and spacetime. We likely need a theory of quantum gravity to address what (if anything) came \u201cbefore\u201d or how time and space began. To date, **cosmology has not answered the question of the singularity**. Models like the no-boundary proposal (Hawking & Hartle) or various multiverse ideas are intriguing, but not testable. In short, **since the 1980s we have developed a credible narrative for the universe from ~$10^{-30}$ seconds after the Big Bang to today, but the very beginning remains mysterious**. And inflation, while highly successful phenomenologically, has grown into a theory so flexible that its scientific status is debated.\n\n- **Dark Matter:** In the 1970s and 80s, astronomers like Vera Rubin and others found that galaxies were rotating in a way that **implied far more mass than visible matter could account for**\u301017\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301017\u2020L83-L91\u3011. Similarly, galaxy clusters and large-scale structures indicated a huge unseen mass component. This gave rise to the concept of **dark matter (DM)** \u2013 some new, non-luminous form of matter that gravitates. Over the decades, the evidence for dark matter has become overwhelming: it makes up roughly 27% of the universe\u301011\u2020L91-L99\u3011, dominates galaxy dynamics, and is essential to the successful \u039bCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model of structure formation. **What dark matter *is***, however, remains one of the biggest questions in physics. Since the 1980s, the leading candidates have been **WIMPs** (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) \u2013 hypothetical particles (often predicted by supersymmetry) with mass ~10\u20131000 GeV that interact via the weak force. WIMPs were attractive because a stable particle of that mass and interaction strength could naturally be produced in the right abundance in the early universe (the \u201cWIMP miracle\u201d). For decades, huge efforts have been undertaken to detect WIMPs: deep underground detectors looking for WIMP-nucleus scatters, accelerator experiments at the LHC looking for missing-energy events, and telescopes seeking byproducts of WIMP annihilation in space. *Result:* **nothing has been found.** As one essay flatly put it, *\u201cover the past half century, no one has ever directly detected a single particle of dark matter\u2026 searches for them have repeatedly turned up nothing.\u201d*\u301017\u2020L99-L107\u3011\u301017\u2020L100-L108\u3011  The once-leading WIMP paradigm is now in serious doubt \u2014 **\u201cwith the WIMP candidacy all but dead, dark matter is apparently the most ubiquitous thing physicists have never found.\u201d**\u301017\u2020L108-L115\u3011. Despite increasingly sensitive detectors (able to detect interaction rates many orders of magnitude lower than when the hunt began), every signal so far has either been a false alarm or an exclusion. \n\n  This persisting null result has opened the door to more **contrarian explanations**. One possibility is that perhaps **dark matter doesn\u2019t exist at all** \u2013 instead, maybe our understanding of gravity is incomplete on galaxy scales. A small community has long advocated **Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)** or other modified gravity theories to explain galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. For decades this idea was considered fringe, but given the frustration with dark matter searches, *\u201cit\u2019s time to take alternatives to dark matter seriously,\u201d* as astrophysicist Ramin Skibba writes\u301017\u2020L115-L124\u3011. MOND and its relativistic extensions can indeed explain some galactic dynamics nicely (MOND, for instance, predicted a relationship between a galaxy\u2019s rotation curve and its visible mass known as the Tully-Fisher relation, which was observed\u301015\u2020L151-L158\u3011). **Emergent gravity** is another idea, proposed by Erik Verlinde, suggesting that gravity\u2019s laws might arise from quantum information bits and lead to MOND-like behavior as an \u201cillusion\u201d of dark matter\u301015\u2020L185-L194\u3011\u301015\u2020L195-L203\u3011. However, modified gravity struggles with other observations (like the dynamics of galaxy clusters and the precise patterns in the CMB) that are well-explained by dark matter. Most physicists still favor some form of dark matter particle. The null WIMP results have broadened the search to other candidates: **axions** (ultra-light particles arising from the strong-CP solution) are a well-motivated alternative, with new experiments (like ADMX and others) homing in on the plausible axion parameter space. There are also models of \u201chidden sector\u201d dark matter, sterile neutrinos, or primordial black holes as dark matter. So far, none of these have clear evidence either. The situation has been aptly summarized: dark matter is *\u201cthe most ubiquitous thing physicists have never found\u201d*\u301017\u2020L108-L115\u3011 \u2013 we have decades of indirect evidence *for its gravitational effects*, yet **after 40+ years we still don\u2019t know what dark matter is composed of**.\n\n  One might ask, has there been *any* progress? Yes in some sense: experiments have ruled out large swathes of WIMP parameter space and pushed sensitivities to remarkable lows. These null results are progress by exclusion \u2013 for example, the simplest supersymmetric dark matter (lightest neutralino) would likely have shown up by now if it were the bulk of dark matter, so either supersymmetry is not realized at the weak scale or the dark matter is something else. Also, astrophysical observations have characterized dark matter\u2019s distribution in the cosmos much better (e.g., via gravitational lensing maps, the dynamics of the Bullet Cluster separating dark from normal matter, etc.). We know dark matter behaves as a cold, collisionless fluid on large scales \u2013 ruling out very fast (\u201chot\u201d) dark matter or very strongly interacting dark matter. So while **the dark matter particle hasn\u2019t been found, our knowledge of what it *is not*** has improved. This has forced theorists to get creative, and as a result the field has diversified. There is a newfound (if reluctant) openness to ideas like modifying gravity or exploring a wider mass range (dark matter could be much lighter or heavier than WIMPs). Some physicists urge that funding agencies *\u201cencourage research on alternatives\u201d* to the standard dark matter paradigm to make sure all bases are covered\u301017\u2020L115-L124\u3011. In summary, **dark matter remains one of the biggest outstanding problems** in fundamental physics: a form of matter that accounts for ~5 times more mass than all visible matter\u301011\u2020L91-L99\u3011, yet whose identity continues to elude detection. It exemplifies the theme of promising theories yielding *diminishing returns* \u2013 each decade of dark matter searches have extended sensitivities by orders of magnitude, only to confirm the absence of any signal.\n\n- **Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe:** In 1998, one of the most shocking discoveries in cosmology was made: the expansion of the universe is not slowing down (as almost everyone expected) but **speeding up**. Distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than they should in a decelerating universe, implying a mysterious repulsive force or energy was driving accelerated expansion. This was soon confirmed by other data, and the standard cosmology was revised to a **\u039bCDM model**: ~68% of the cosmos is a smoothly-distributed \u201cdark energy\u201d (often identified with Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant \u039b), ~27% dark matter, and only ~5% normal matter\u301011\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301011\u2020L139-L147\u3011. In terms of fundamental physics, dark energy is deeply puzzling. A true cosmological constant can be thought of as vacuum energy \u2013 but theoretical estimates of vacuum energy from quantum field theory overshoot the observed value by an astounding 10^120 factor. This *\u201ccosmological constant problem\u201d* is arguably an even bigger naturalness problem than the Higgs hierarchy. Why is \u039b so tiny yet nonzero? Since the 1980s, no convincing solution has emerged. Anthropic reasoning in a multiverse is one suggestion: Steven Weinberg noted that if \u039b were much larger, galaxies (and life) couldn\u2019t form, so perhaps we observe a small \u039b because we couldn\u2019t exist otherwise. This line of thought was later embedded in string theory\u2019s **landscape of vacua**, providing a possible (if unpalatably non-predictive) explanation\u301023\u2020L89-L98\u3011. Apart from the constant \u039b, other ideas for dark energy include a new light scalar field (**quintessence**) that varies slowly, or modifications of gravity on the largest scales. Distinguishing a dynamic dark energy from a true constant requires precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history and growth of structure. Over the past decade, multiple probes (supernova surveys, cosmic microwave background data from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, etc.) have consistently pointed to an equation-of-state parameter *w \u2248 -1*, right in line with a cosmological constant. No convincing sign of evolution in dark energy has been detected \u2014 if quintessence exists, its variation is too small to see so far. \n\n  **Present status:** We have a simple model (\u039bCDM) that fits all cosmological observations superbly, yet **we have no physical understanding of \u039b**. As physicist Andr\u00e9 de Gouv\u00eaa said, *\u201cThat is something very fundamental that nobody could have anticipated just by looking at the Standard Model.\u201d*\u301011\u2020L139-L147\u3011 In other words, the discovery of dark energy revealed a fundamental blind spot in our theories. Since 1998, we have improved measurements of the cosmological parameters dramatically (the error bars on the dark energy density are a few percent). Projects in the past decade like the Dark Energy Survey and others have tried to detect any deviation from w = -1 or any evidence that dark energy interacts or varies, but so far *dark energy behaves indistinguishably from a constant vacuum energy*. This deepens the mystery: why this value? why now (in cosmic history, dark energy became dominant only recently)? Without a fundamental theory, some consider the possibility that **general relativity itself might need modification on cosmic scales**, instead of invoking an inexplicable energy substance. However, modified gravity models have a hard time avoiding contradictions with precision tests of GR or with structure formation data, so none have surpassed \u039bCDM in viability. The community is essentially stuck with an extraordinarily successful phenomenological model (\u039bCDM) lacking a known theoretical origin. Dark energy thus epitomizes the **\u201cincomplete\u201d** nature of our understanding: a new phenomenon was discovered (acceleration), but *explaining* it from first principles remains beyond us. It\u2019s another area where fundamental physics has stalled \u2013 many ideas, no consensus or empirical breakthrough. Future experiments like the Euclid satellite and the Vera Rubin Observatory will further sharpen the measurements; they may uncover subtleties (e.g., if the Hubble expansion rate today versus as inferred from CMB signals new physics, as hinted by the current **Hubble tension**). Barring that, dark energy might remain an enigma, possibly pointing to physics at the interface of gravity and quantum theory that we don\u2019t yet grasp.\n\n- **The Big Bang Singularity and Quantum Gravity in Cosmology:** The *initial singularity* (the state of infinite density at *t* = 0 in classical Big Bang models) signals a breakdown of known physics. Resolving this requires a theory of quantum gravity. While we will discuss quantum gravity separately, it\u2019s worth noting here that cosmology provides potential arenas for quantum gravity ideas \u2013 e.g., in the very early universe or inside black holes. Some **progress in concept** has been made: for instance, **loop quantum cosmology** (applying LQG ideas to the whole universe) suggests the Big Bang might be replaced by a \u201cBig Bounce\u201d \u2013 a prior universe collapsing and then re-expanding, avoiding a true t=0 singularity. Such models achieve singularity resolution in a mathematical sense, but are they testable? So far, not really \u2013 their predictions can often be tweaked to resemble inflationary cosmology at later times, making it hard to find a distinctive observable signature (though some work suggests specific features in the spectrum of perturbations could arise). Another intriguing development is the idea that the universe could have begun in a simple quantum state that is *smooth* (Hartle\u2013Hawking no-boundary proposal) \u2013 but again, it\u2019s hard to see how to confirm that experimentally. \n\nIn summary, **cosmology since the 1980s has been a tale of both explanatory power and deepening mysteries**. We have a \u201cStandard Model of cosmology\u201d (\u039bCDM + inflation) that describes the universe\u2019s history and contents with astonishing accuracy. Yet that model relies on *fundamental physics inputs that are unknown*: an **inflationary origin** (with unknown inflaton field and potential), a **dark matter particle** (of unknown identity), and a **dark energy component** (of unknown nature). Each of these is an active frontier. Have they become \u201cmore predictive or testable\u201d? In some ways, yes: cosmological data have improved to the point where they *do* constrain these ideas (e.g., ruling out many inflation models with too large primordial fluctuations, or many dark matter models that would alter structure formation too much, etc.). But in other ways, these ideas remain **frustratingly elusive to test in the laboratory**. Dark matter might be discovered in a detector \u2013 or it might not interact except via gravity, making it essentially invisible except through cosmology. Inflation took what were initial condition problems and replaced them with a dynamical mechanism, but proving that mechanism happened is tricky, and its possible connection to particle physics (GUT-scale processes, etc.) is speculative. As for dark energy, it is so diffuse and feeble (aside from its global effect on expansion) that we have *no clue* how to probe it locally; it may just be a vacuum property. Thus, cosmology finds itself with a **compelling empirical model that lacks a microphysical foundation**. Some leading physicists worry this might signal a fundamental limit: certain aspects of the universe (like the precise value of dark energy) might only be \u201cexplained\u201d anthropically or not at all\u301023\u2020L89-L98\u3011. Others are more optimistic that a unifying theory (perhaps a \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d including quantum gravity) will eventually explain these cosmic parameters. For now, cosmology gives us *strong evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model*, but not the content of that new physics.\n\n## The Quest for Quantum Gravity: Strings, Loops, and Other Approaches  \nPerhaps the most profound gap in fundamental physics is the mismatch between **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity**. The Standard Model is a quantum field theory of particles, while Einstein\u2019s General Relativity (GR) is our theory of gravity and spacetime, which is fundamentally classical (non-quantum) and geometric. Each theory works extraordinarily well in its own domain, but they are formulated on incompatible principles. A *unified theory* that includes gravity and quantum mechanics \u2013 often called a **Theory of Quantum Gravity** or \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d if it also unifies all forces \u2013 has been the holy grail since at least the 1980s. Over the past 40+ years, several leading frameworks have emerged. We will review the state of the **leading approaches** and ask: have they delivered on their promises? Have they made **testable predictions** or provided unifying insights that advance our understanding? \n\n- **String Theory:** By far the most dominant quantum gravity approach in the past few decades is **superstring theory** (or its extended version, M-theory). String theory posits that the fundamental entities are not point particles but tiny one-dimensional \u201cstrings\u201d (~$10^{-33}$ cm in length) whose vibrational modes correspond to different particles. Remarkably, string theory automatically includes a quantum gravity particle (the graviton emerges as one vibration mode), and it requires additional spatial dimensions (typically 6 or 7 extra dimensions beyond our familiar 3). In the 1980s, string theory took off as a candidate for a **unified theory of all forces**: with appropriate compactification of the extra dimensions, strings could in principle reproduce the particles and gauge forces of the Standard Model, while also incorporating gravity. This potential for unification made string theory incredibly compelling, and a generation of top minds devoted themselves to it. **Mathematical breakthroughs** ensued \u2013 string theory pioneered concepts like supersymmetry, dualities between seemingly different theories, and insights into black hole entropy. A highlight was the discovery of the **AdS/CFT correspondence** (late 1990s), a duality showing that a string theory with gravity in a higher-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime is equivalent to a quantum field theory (CFT) on the lower-dimensional boundary\u301029\u2020L216-L224\u3011\u301029\u2020L225-L234\u3011. This *holographic principle* gave a concrete realization to the idea that spacetime and gravity can be \u201cemergent\u201d from quantum dynamics \u2013 a profound conceptual advance influencing even quantum information theory. From a **unification** perspective, string theory also offered a tantalizing scenario for force-unification at high energy and even an explanation for the cosmological constant (but one that leads to a multiverse of possible universes). \n\n  However, **when it comes to experimental predictions, string theory has not yet delivered anything testable**. In the 1980s\u201390s, physicists hoped that supersymmetry (required by string theory for consistency) would appear at accessible energies, or that strings might produce subtle signatures (like certain rare processes or deviations in gravity at sub-millimeter scales due to extra dimensions). These hopes have not been realized: supersymmetry has *not* been observed at the LHC, and table-top tests of gravity have found no evidence of extra dimensions down to ~micron scales. Meanwhile, string theory\u2019s mathematical richness turned out to be a double-edged sword: rather than a unique solution, it has an enormous number of possible vacuum solutions (the so-called \u201clandscape\u201d of ~$10^{500}$ vacuum states with different physical constants). This means string theory did not make a single crisp prediction like \u201cparticle X will have Y mass\u201d \u2013 instead it can accommodate almost any low-energy world by choosing a suitable compactification. This **lack of falsifiability** has drawn criticism. As Hossenfelder quips, *\u201cString theory, supersymmetry, multiverses\u2026 There\u2019s math for it, alright. Pretty math, even. But that doesn\u2019t mean this math describes reality.\u201d*\u30108\u2020L151-L158\u3011  After decades, not one of the new particles or phenomena that string theory (or SUSY, which is a part of many string models) suggested has been seen in the laboratory\u30105\u2020L59-L67\u3011\u301023\u2020L67-L75\u3011. \n\n  That said, string theory **has yielded unifying insights** in a theoretical sense. It provides a possible consistent theory of quantum gravity (something many thought impossible), and unifies many different mathematical frameworks (for example, it revealed that seemingly different quantum field theories are related by dualities, and that gravity in certain spacetimes is equivalent to non-gravitational physics on a boundary). It has shed light on black hole microphysics: using string theory, researchers were able to count the microstates of certain black holes and exactly reproduce the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy formula \u2013 a major validation for the theory. Also, string-inspired methods have trickled into other fields (like using AdS/CFT to study quark-gluon plasmas or condensed matter systems in a dual gravity description). Nonetheless, the **core promise of string theory** as a description of our universe remains unfulfilled and perhaps unfalsifiable in the foreseeable future. Critics like Lee Smolin and Peter Woit have argued since the mid-2000s that the dominance of string theory stifled other approaches without yielding empirical progress\u30107\u2020L21-L29\u3011. Supporters argue that it\u2019s unfair to expect quick empirical tests for Planck-scale physics and that string theory is a long-term investment \u2013 it might take a revolutionary experiment or more theoretical breakthroughs to connect it to observations.\n\n- **Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG):** Loop quantum gravity emerged in the mid-1980s as an attempt to directly quantize spacetime geometry, without introducing additional dimensions or unification of forces. The approach, developed by Rovelli, Smolin, Ashtekar and others, reformulates GR in terms of quantized loops of gravitational field (\u201cspin networks\u201d). **Achievements:** LQG succeeded in demonstrating that at the Planck scale, space could have a discrete granular structure \u2013 areas and volumes have quantized spectra in LQG. It\u2019s a background-independent quantization, meaning it doesn\u2019t presuppose a fixed spacetime \u2013 it aims to derive spacetime itself as a quantum state. LQG can handle **black hole entropy** too: it is able to derive the entropy of a black hole proportional to its horizon area (though with an undetermined proportionality constant). It also provides a framework for **Big Bang cosmology** where the Big Bang is replaced by a bounce (as mentioned). Importantly, LQG is more than just a toy \u2013 it\u2019s a rigorous canonical quantization of gravity, which is a nontrivial technical accomplishment.\n\n  **Challenges:** LQG\u2019s biggest issue is that it hasn\u2019t shown how to reduce to *known physics* in a way that is useful. While it naturally describes quantum spacetime, incorporating the Standard Model\u2019s matter fields and recovering the familiar large-scale universe has been nontrivial. Some work has been done coupling matter to LQG, but it\u2019s fair to say LQG has not demonstrated a fully convincing semi-classical limit that yields Einstein\u2019s GR plus conventional matter. Another issue is testability: **does LQG make any observable predictions?** Early on, some theorists suggested that LQG might imply slight violations of Lorentz symmetry at extremely high energies, which could lead to effects like energy-dependent speed of light (photons from distant gamma-ray bursts arriving spread out due to interaction with discrete spacetime). Experiments (e.g. observations of GRBs and active galactic nuclei) have not found any such dispersion to the precision capable of detecting Planck-scale effects, thus *either* Lorentz symmetry is preserved (which many argue it should be even in LQG) *or* the effects are far too small to see. Currently, **LQG has not produced a clear experimental test**. Its successes are mostly theoretical consistency checks (e.g., showing singularities might be resolved). It remains a vibrant research area, but smaller in community than string theory. Some see LQG and string as potentially complementary (one is background-independent, the other is more unified and uses higher dimensions), but no synthesis exists yet.\n\n- **Asymptotic Safety and Other Quantum Gravity Approaches:** Another approach, stemming from an idea by Steven Weinberg, is **asymptotically safe gravity**. This hypothesis is that while quantizing gravity in a straightforward way is perturbatively non-renormalizable, the theory might **possess a non-trivial renormalization group fixed point** at high energies (the \u201cUV fixed point\u201d), which would render it well-defined and \u201csafe\u201d from infinities\u30109\u2020L15-L23\u3011. In the early 2000s, researchers like Christofferson, Percacci, and Shaposhnikov reinvigorated this idea by finding hints of such a fixed point in approximate calculations. If gravity is asymptotically safe, it could mean that no new particles or forces are needed even up to the Planck scale \u2013 gravity plus the Standard Model could be fundamental, with high-energy predictivity coming from the fixed point. One intriguing consequence: asymptotic safety models by Shaposhnikov et al. have suggested that the values of certain parameters (like the Higgs mass) might be such that the electroweak vacuum is barely metastable, something that current measurements actually indicate (the measured 125 GeV Higgs and 173 GeV top quark put us right near a stability bound). This could be a coincidence or a hint of asymptotic safety at work. **Testability:** Asymptotic safety is hard to test directly because its effects would show up at extremely high energies. However, if it\u2019s true, it might impose relationships between low-energy parameters (like the Higgs, top, and strong coupling, etc.). Right now, it\u2019s fair to say **asymptotic safety is a plausible but unproven scenario**. It hasn\u2019t reached a status of wide acceptance yet; it\u2019s an active research front, particularly in theoretical and mathematical physics circles.\n\n- **Emergent Spacetime and Other Novel Ideas:** In recent years, there\u2019s been growing interest in the idea that spacetime and gravity might not be fundamental at all, but emergent from deeper degrees of freedom (often quantum and informational in nature). The AdS/CFT correspondence we mentioned provides a concrete toy model: in that duality, a standard quantum field theory (with no gravity) on the boundary can be equivalent to a gravity theory in a higher-dimensional space, implying the higher-dimensional spacetime \u201cemerges\u201d from the quantum degrees of freedom of the lower-dimensional theory. This has led some physicists (like Mark Van Raamsdonk, Maldacena, Susskind, etc.) to propose that *quantum entanglement* is the fundamental fabric that builds spacetime (\u201cER=EPR\u201d conjecture relates wormholes \u2013 Einstein-Rosen bridges \u2013 to entangled particle pairs) and that gravity might be a manifestation of quantum information geometry. These ideas are speculative but tantalizing; they offer a fresh perspective that *might* circumvent some old problems. For example, **Erik Verlinde\u2019s emergent gravity** proposal (2016) tries to derive Newtonian gravity and an extra \u201cdark matter-like\u201d effect from principles of thermodynamics and quantum information in spacetime, as mentioned above\u301015\u2020L185-L194\u3011\u301015\u2020L195-L203\u3011. While his specific model doesn\u2019t yet fit all data (and he admits it *\u201ccan\u2019t compete yet\u201d* with dark matter in explaining cosmic structure\u301015\u2020L195-L203\u3011), it represents a bold attempt to rethink gravity\u2019s origin. \n\n  Another emergent approach is studying **simplicity in quantum networks or computations** that could give rise to space. This overlaps with quantum gravity research involving **causal sets** (spacetime as a discrete set of events with only partial order relations) or **causal dynamical triangulations** (a numerical lattice approach that has surprisingly generated 4D spacetimes from random microscopic building blocks). These approaches are still maturing and have not made contact with experiment. They do show that general relativity could emerge as an *average* behavior of more fundamental constituents of spacetime \u2013 analogously to how fluid hydrodynamics emerges from molecular dynamics. If so, looking for subtle \u201cresiduals\u201d of discreteness or violations of GR might be one way to test them, but nothing definitive has been found.\n\n**In summary, the quantum gravity quest has been long and technically rich, but empirically barren so far.** None of the leading approaches \u2013 **string theory, loop quantum gravity, asymptotic safety, emergent gravity, etc.** \u2013 has made a prediction that was both distinctive and experimentally verified. As a result, some physicists have started to question whether the field\u2019s dominance by a few approaches (especially strings) has been productive, or whether it reflects a kind of groupthink given the lack of guiding data\u30108\u2020L127-L136\u3011\u30108\u2020L137-L144\u3011. Hossenfelder and others criticize that \u201cphysicists today can happily make a career by writing papers about things no one has ever observed, and never will observe\u201d\u30107\u2020L65-L69\u3011, and that there\u2019s little incentive to abandon a failed research program when there is no clear alternative and experiments seem out of reach\u30107\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u30107\u2020L46-L54\u3011. \n\nOn the other hand, **quantum gravity has seen genuine if subtle progress**: theoretical consistency checks (like black hole entropy or avoidance of infinities) are important milestones. And it may be unrealistic to expect quick experimental payoff when the Planck scale (where quantum gravity effects become strong) is $10^{19}$ GeV, utterly beyond any earth-bound accelerator. That said, physicists are devising clever *indirect* experiments. For instance, there are proposals to test the quantum nature of gravity in tabletop experiments: if two microscopic masses can become *quantum entangled* via their mutual gravitational attraction, that would imply gravity must have a quantum mediator (graviton) even if we can\u2019t detect it directly\u301024\u2020L0-L8\u3011\u301024\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Such experiments are extremely challenging but perhaps feasible within a decade or two. Also, gravitational wave astronomy (just a few years old) might one day probe Planck-scale physics via exotic signals (e.g., echoes in black hole mergers could hint at quantum remnant structures instead of classical horizons). So, while **quantum gravity remains untested in 2025**, the coming years hold some opportunity for at least *ruling out* certain ideas or confirming general expectations (like that gravity can cause entanglement). For now, each approach continues to refine itself, waiting for either a breakthrough insight or a stroke of experimental luck (such as detecting a sign of extra dimensions, or microscopic black holes, or any clue that might emerge from high-energy astrophysical phenomena). Until then, **the unification of quantum theory and gravity stands as an unfinished revolution** \u2013 one that, in terms of empirical feedback, has made little headway since the 1980s.\n\n## Stagnation or Natural Progression? Perspectives on the Current Impasse  \nBy surveying particle physics, cosmology, and quantum gravity, we see a common theme: **since the 1970s/80s, fundamental physics has not delivered a paradigm-shifting breakthrough or a confirmed new theory**. The **perceived stagnation** is real in the sense that the frameworks established by the 1970s (the Standard Model and general relativity/Big Bang cosmology) still dominate, and extensions remain unverified. Many prominent physicists have commented on this state of affairs, diagnosing causes and proposing remedies. Here we compile some perspectives:\n\n- **Sabine Hossenfelder (Frankfurt theoretical physicist)** has been one of the most vocal commentators on the lack of progress. She observes that *\u201csince [the 1970s], theory development in the foundations of physics has stalled\u201d*\u30105\u2020L51-L59\u3011. In her view, the problem isn\u2019t a lack of data per se \u2013 we have plenty of data, but it all fits the existing theories\u30105\u2020L46-L54\u3011. Instead, she blames a **methodological inertia among theorists**. They continue using the same tools (e.g., arguments about \u201cnaturalness\u201d or beauty) and generating thousands of **\u201centirely baseless speculations\u201d** that are never confronted by experiment\u30107\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u30107\u2020L59-L67\u3011. She notes with some exasperation that *\u201cover and over I have heard [theorists] justifying their mindless production of mathematical fiction as \u2018healthy speculation\u2019 \u2013 entirely ignoring that this type of speculation has demonstrably not worked for decades\u2026 There is nothing healthy about this. It\u2019s sick science.\u201d*\u30107\u2020L49-L57\u3011. This strong statement reflects her belief that the field has fallen victim to **groupthink** and lost its empirical footing. In an essay tellingly titled *\u201cThe present phase of stagnation in the foundations of physics is not normal,\u201d* she writes that *\u201cphysicists just keep doing what they\u2019ve been doing for 40 years,\u201d* shuffling around the same ideas for ever-bigger colliders\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011. Each time a collider fails to find, say, supersymmetry, the response has been to **move the goalpost**: theorists suggest a slightly adjusted model that could be probed by an even larger collider, ad infinitum\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011. The result: **40 years of null results and \u201cten-thousands of wrong predictions\u201d** for new physics at colliders\u30105\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Hossenfelder argues that this situation is unprecedented given the *huge increase in the number of physicists and resources* over the 20th century \u2013 by her estimate, by today\u2019s manpower, what used to take 40 years of physics progress (early 20th century) should now take only ~14 months (a tongue-in-cheek extrapolation)\u30105\u2020L81-L90\u3011\u30105\u2020L93-L101\u3011. Instead, we\u2019ve invested more than ever, *\u201cand yet nothing is coming out of it. That\u2019s a problem and it\u2019s a problem we should talk about.\u201d*\u30105\u2020L111-L115\u3011.\n\n  Hossenfelder and others attribute part of the problem to **sociology of science**: the way hiring, funding, and prestige can create echo chambers. Popular ideas (like string theory or SUSY) dominated despite lack of empirical support, in part because they were mathematically rich and became entrenched in academia. It was (until recently) hard for a young researcher to get a job doing something else; as John Ellis mentioned, focusing only on SUSY now might even be a career handicap\u301026\u2020L154-L160\u3011, but that\u2019s a very recent shift. For decades, alternate ideas (e.g., modified gravity, non-string QG) were marginal. Hossenfelder calls for *\u201cbetter methods\u2026 appropriate to the present century\u201d*\u30108\u2020L155-L160\u3011. She suggests physicists should pay attention to philosophy of science, learn to identify when a research program is stuck, and diversify their approaches instead of chasing elegance for its own sake\u30108\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u30108\u2020L127-L136\u3011. In her view, **continually doing the same (theoretical) thing and expecting different results is folly**.\n\n- **Peter Woit (Columbia University mathematician/physicist)** is another critic who in *\u201cNot Even Wrong\u201d* (2006) and subsequent writings argued that string theory\u2019s dominance was unhealthy. In a 2013 piece aptly titled *\u201cThe \u2018Nightmare Scenario\u2019 for Fundamental Physics,\u201d* he described the exact situation we find ourselves in: the LHC finds a Higgs and nothing else, no guidance for new physics\u301023\u2020L71-L75\u3011. He expressed worry that if no new input arrives, the field could enter *\u201ca new kind of era\u201d* where **\u201cintellectual progress [becomes] just a memory\u201d**, with fundamental physics characterized by stasis\u301023\u2020L95-L102\u3011. Woit notes the *\u201cunprecedented collapse of decades of speculative work\u201d* \u2013 referring to the failure of SUSY, GUTs, etc. \u2013 and that some theorists have responded with **fatalism** (embracing the multiverse and saying many questions may be unanswerable)\u301023\u2020L86-L94\u3011. This he finds deeply troubling, as it abandons the traditional aim of physics to find definite answers. He, like Hossenfelder, points to the social aspect: *\u201cthe sociological structure of the field is ill-equipped to handle this situation\u201d* of no experimental guidance\u301023\u2020L86-L94\u3011. How do we move on from failed ideas if our education and peer expectations keep us tied to them? Woit highlights the problem that even after LHC\u2019s null results, *\u201cremarkable how many theorists won\u2019t abandon the failed idea of a SUSY extension\u2026 [it] explained nothing\u2026 and [has] been a huge failure.\u201d*\u301026\u2020L76-L84\u3011\u301026\u2020L85-L89\u3011. He also points out the irony that **the two major focuses of theoretical particles physics education for decades \u2013 SUSY and string theory \u2013 have both failed to produce anything empirically**\u301026\u2020L93-L100\u3011, yet until very recently they remained central in curricula. He suggests the field may need to pivot to other topics (he mentions quantum information, cosmology, etc., which indeed now are gaining popularity)\u301026\u2020L99-L107\u3011.\n\n- **Lee Smolin (Perimeter Institute)**, in his 2006 book *\u201cThe Trouble with Physics,\u201d* similarly critiqued the stagnation, identifying \u201cfive great problems\u201d (including the ones we\u2019ve discussed \u2013 quantum gravity, unification, dark matter, etc.) that remained unsolved and arguing that the research community\u2019s focus on a narrow set of approaches (especially string theory) had crowded out fresh ideas. He advocated for more **pluralism in theory** and for institutions to support high-risk, unconventional research \u2014 because revolutions often come from the fringe. Smolin\u2019s perspective is that new ideas (like those that might replace or extend the Standard Model) need nurturing, and that young physicists should be encouraged to challenge prevailing paradigms rather than conform. These calls tie into the broader theme of whether the *culture of the field* is adapting appropriately to the lack of progress.\n\nNot everyone is entirely pessimistic, however. Some argue that **stagnation might be temporary or even illusory**. For example, **Steven Weinberg** (Nobel laureate) in the 1990s and 2000s often acknowledged the *\u201cnightmare scenario\u201d* possibility but remained hopeful that clever experimentation or theoretical clues would emerge. He championed proposals for larger colliders, noting that historically, whenever we\u2019ve pushed to higher energies, nature eventually yielded something new \u2013 but he also admitted there\u2019s no guarantee (and indeed, Weinberg\u2019s passing in 2021 came with SUSY and other ideas he helped pioneer still unverified). **Nima Arkani-Hamed**, a leading theorist, has a nuanced view: after the LHC\u2019s early runs, he conceded that the simplicity many hoped for (like low-hanging-fruit solutions to naturalness) didn\u2019t materialize, but he encourages exploration of **\u201ccreative, risky ideas\u201d** including those that abandon some cherished principles. He helped develop alternative naturalness ideas (e.g. **\u201cneutral naturalness\u201d** or the **\u201cmultiverse/landscape\u201d** approach) to explain the Higgs fine-tuning without accessible new particles\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011. Arkani-Hamed argues that maybe we got **\u201clucky\u201d** in the past when many new phenomena were within reach, and now we might be entering an era where new physics exists at scales that are just beyond practical reach \u2013 meaning we need either new technologies or to exploit less direct avenues (like precise measurements of rare processes) to find clues. \n\nAnother perspective is that **our expectations might be too impatient**. Fundamental physics breakthroughs have historically sometimes taken many decades. For instance, the gap between the formulation of quantum mechanics (1920s) and the acceptance of the modern Standard Model (1970s) was ~50 years. We\u2019re now about 50 years out from the SM \u2013 maybe we are on the cusp of something but can\u2019t see it yet. The discovery of dark energy (1998) *was* a big surprise and could be seen as a fundamental breakthrough \u2013 just one that is hard to interpret. Likewise, the detection of gravitational waves (2015) opened a new observational window. While that confirmed GR rather than beyond-GR physics, it was still a milestone that took a century after GR\u2019s prediction. \n\nSo, **is fundamental physics \u201cfailing\u201d or just in a slow period?** Sabine Hossenfelder rejects calling it a crisis because \u201ccrisis\u201d implies a quick turning point; she fears it\u2019s more of a chronic condition\u30105\u2020L29-L37\u3011. But historically, long plateaus have happened. The difference now, as she and Woit emphasize, is the *scale* of effort and the *lack of paradigm change*. From 1930s to 1970s, major shifts happened (quantum field theory matured, the Standard Model was constructed, etc.) while today\u2019s theories look similar to those decades ago. And indeed, some open problems like dark matter and the quantization of gravity have been known since the 1930s (Zwicky\u2019s DM suggestion, Einstein\u2019s struggles with unified field theory)\u30105\u2020L51-L59\u3011, yet we\u2019re not much closer to answers. \n\nOne could argue that **current methodologies are yielding diminishing returns**. The Large Hadron Collider, the largest experiment ever built, added one particle (Higgs) that we expected, and then simply provided precision measurements confirming the SM. In contrast, the early generations of particle colliders discovered whole families of new particles (psi/J particle, the W and Z bosons, quark bound states, etc.). Each new telescope and cosmic survey nowadays still feeds the \u039bCDM paradigm, refining parameters but not exposing new physics (with the possible exception of the Hubble tension, which *might* hint at something like \u201cearly dark energy\u201d). There\u2019s a sense of **\u201cwe\u2019re squeezing incremental knowledge from the same theories\u201d** rather than making conceptual leaps. \n\nAnother concrete indicator: **publication volume vs. breakthroughs**. Hossenfelder points out that the number of physicists and papers has grown exponentially, yet this hasn\u2019t translated to faster fundamental discoveries\u30105\u2020L81-L90\u3011\u30105\u2020L93-L101\u3011. In her blunt assessment, *\u201cwe are today making more investments into the foundations of physics than ever before. And yet nothing is coming out of it.\u201d*\u30105\u2020L111-L115\u3011. This raises difficult questions about resource allocation: e.g., should billions be spent on a next-generation collider if the likelihood of new phenomena is unknown or small? Or should we invest more in table-top experiments, astrophysical observations, and novel quantum probes which might catch BSM physics in indirect ways? There is a growing movement in the community to **broaden the strategy** \u2013 for instance, China and Europe are considering large colliders, but simultaneously, many are championing smaller scale precision experiments (measuring magnetic moments, searching for rare decays, gravitational experiments, etc.) which could reveal cracks in the SM.\n\n## The Way Forward: Promising and Contrarian Approaches  \nIf traditional approaches have hit diminishing returns, what can be done? Here are some possible directions that physicists are pursuing or advocating, which might shake up the field:\n\n- **Precision Frontier:** Even if high-energy colliders find nothing new, extremely precise measurements at lower energies can indirectly probe heavy new physics. This is the strategy behind efforts like the **muon *g*-2 experiment** (measuring the muon\u2019s magnetic moment to extraordinary precision) and searches for electric dipole moments of neutrons or electrons (which could signal CP-violating new physics). Intriguingly, the Muon g\u20132 experiment at Fermilab reported results that strengthen a long-standing discrepancy between the measured muon magnetic moment and the SM prediction\u301021\u2020L1-L9\u3011. If this deviation holds up (and theoretical calculations confirm it\u2019s real), it *hints at new physics* influencing the muon\u301021\u2020L1-L9\u3011. Similarly, experiments on B-meson decays (at LHCb, Belle II, etc.) have shown some anomalies in lepton universality (muons vs electrons) \u2013 not yet conclusive, but suggestive of possible new particles or forces. These precision tests might uncover subtle quantum effects of new physics that aren\u2019t obvious at energy frontier. As the saying goes, **\u201cthe devil is in the details\u201d** \u2013 next-generation detectors could catch minute deviations that signal beyond-SM interactions.\n\n- **Astrophysical and Cosmological Observations:** The cosmos provides natural laboratories at scales and energies unattainable on Earth. For example, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos (e.g., detected by observatories like IceCube) reach energies orders of magnitude beyond LHC; if any exotic interactions happen, they might be revealed in these messengers (though interpreting cosmic events is challenging). Gravitational wave astronomy is just beginning \u2013 who knows, a future detection of a primordial gravitational wave background could confirm inflation and even give hints about its energy scale. Precise maps of cosmic microwave background polarization or the large-scale distribution of galaxies might unveil tiny effects of new physics (like early dark energy or properties of neutrinos beyond the SM). The **Hubble tension** (the disagreement between the cosmic expansion rate inferred from early-universe data vs local measurements) is one intriguing crack; if it\u2019s not due to hidden systematics, it could require new physics such as an extra early-universe component. All these observations are becoming more precise. While they might simply refine \u039bCDM, there\u2019s always a chance they stumble on an anomaly that upends our understanding (just like dark energy did). \n\n- **Smaller, Innovative Experiments:** Not all breakthroughs require giant machines. There is growing interest in **\u201ctable-top\u201d experiments that probe quantum gravity or hidden sectors**. For instance, as mentioned, experiments with quantum-entangled masses could test whether gravity must be quantized (if successful, they would demonstrate gravitationally-induced entanglement, essentially observing a graviton\u2019s effects without detecting single gravitons)\u301024\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301024\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Another example is high-sensitivity searches for **axions** or axion-like particles (using resonant cavities in strong magnetic fields to detect axions converting to photons). These experiments (ADMX, HAYSTAC, etc.) are being refined and could potentially detect the fuzzy dark matter. There are also new detector concepts (like superconducting sensors, ultra-cold quantum sensors, atom interferometers) to search for very weakly coupled particles (e.g., \u201cdark photons\u201d) or test gravity at short ranges. As technology from quantum computing and photonics advances, these small-scale experiments gain in capability. They exemplify a more **diverse approach** to finding new physics, rather than betting everything on one giant collider.\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Crossroads:** Some of the most promising theoretical ideas are emerging at the intersection of fields. For example, **quantum information science** has surprisingly become relevant to quantum gravity (through holography and simulations of quantum systems that mimic spacetime behavior). This cross-pollination might yield new insights and even experimental tests (perhaps quantum simulators could mimic certain aspects of particle physics or cosmology in the lab). Also, techniques from **machine learning** are being applied to analyze data for patterns that humans might miss, potentially uncovering anomalies in large data sets from LHC or elsewhere that were overlooked.\n\n- **Contrarian Theories:** As we noted, ideas like modified gravity (MOND) and cyclic cosmology have often been dismissed by the mainstream, but they persist because they *might* be partially right. Encouraging exploration of these contrarian frameworks could be healthy. For instance, even if MOND is not the whole story, it identified real galaxy-scale phenomenology that any successful theory must reproduce (MOND\u2019s empirical success in galaxies is something dark matter theories must explain, possibly via feedback or interactions). By studying MOND alongside dark matter, physicists can better understand the requirements for any complete solution\u301017\u2020L128-L136\u3011\u301015\u2020L147-L155\u3011. The same goes for alternative cosmologies: examining where they succeed or fail helps sharpen the inflationary theory\u2019s own predictions and alternatives. In particle physics, contrarian ideas include things like **bilinear Higgs models, composite Higgs (technicolor revived in new guise), extra-dimensional braneworlds** (still possible in some forms), or even more exotic notions (e.g., CPT-violating worlds, mirror matter, etc.). After years of no new physics, some are revisiting discarded ideas or coming up with entirely new ones (for example, recently there\u2019s interest in whether the early universe had a different phase that could address hierarchy, such as *\u201cthermal freeze-out of the weak scale\u201d* scenarios). The key is to **foster a climate where exploring unconventional ideas is welcome**, rather than sticking only to well-trodden but fruitless paths.\n\n- **New Collider Technologies:** If big accelerators are to continue, innovation is needed to avoid the cost spiral. Some promising technologies like **plasma wakefield accelerators** might eventually allow particle beams to be accelerated over much shorter distances (1000x gradients of conventional magnets). This could make compact \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 high-energy colliders feasible. There is also discussion of a **muon collider** in the coming decades: muons can give cleaner collisions than protons at equivalent energy because they\u2019re point-like, and muon colliders could potentially reach multi-TeV energies in a smaller ring. A ~10 TeV muon collider, for instance, could probe certain new physics scenarios far better than the LHC (e.g., it could produce pairs of heavy Higgs bosons or supersymmetric particles if they exist at a few TeV). While these are long-term prospects, they represent ways to keep experimentally probing higher energy scales without a $100 billion$ price tag. \n\n- **Embracing Uncertainty:** Perhaps an important shift is philosophical. Physicists may need to **embrace not knowing** as an opportunity to be creative. When data was abundant and quickly confirming theory (think 1950s\u20131970s), a certain inertia set in \u2013 an expectation that beautiful theories (gauge theories, symmetry unification) were the way nature worked, because it worked so well up to a point. Now, without guidance, it might be time to question some assumptions. For example, do all fundamental questions *have* neat answers? It\u2019s possible that some puzzles (like the values of the fundamental constants) are environmental or statistical, as the multiverse proponents say. If that\u2019s the case, physics might shift toward *characterizing* the multiverse indirectly (by looking for evidence of bubble universe collisions in the CMB or other subtle effects). Alternatively, maybe new principles are needed \u2013 something as radical as the leap to quantum mechanics was. Some have speculated that maybe to solve quantum gravity or consciousness or other deep issues, we might need to enlarge our framework (just as classical mechanics had to be replaced by quantum). What that would be is anyone\u2019s guess \u2013 proposals range from superdeterminism in quantum mechanics (to address quantum measurement) to panpsychism (very fringe) or other unorthodox ideas. These are not mainstream by any means, but history has shown that sometimes the resolution of a crisis comes from left field.\n\nIn essence, **promising approaches going forward involve both perseverance and open-mindedness**. On one hand, we continue to push known frontiers (energy, precision, cosmic volume) with better tools \u2013 because the next surprise could lurk just beyond our current reach. On the other hand, we must be willing to rethink cherished doctrines if they continue not to bear fruit. Already, there are hints of change: for example, younger cosmologists are more open to the idea that inflation might not be the final answer and are investigating alternatives; particle theory groups now often hire people in **quantum information or amplitudes (mathematical structures)** rather than solely on string/SUSY model-building, reflecting a diversification. As John Ellis mentioned, *\u201cpeople are certainly exploring new theoretical avenues, which is very healthy\u2026 there is much more freedom for young theorists today than in the past.\u201d*\u301026\u2020L154-L160\u3011 This suggests the field is responding to the stagnation by broadening its horizons.\n\n## Conclusion  \n**Has fundamental physics stalled?** By many measures, **yes**: the last few decades brought enormous refinements in our existing theories but no major new theory. The Standard Model remains essentially unchallenged since its completion in the 1970s, and its many open questions (the hierarchy of scales, the matter\u2013antimatter imbalance, the origin of neutrino mass, etc.) still loom large with no consensus solution. In cosmology, we have had to bolt on dark matter and dark energy as \u201cunknowns\u201d to make the Big Bang model fit observations; they solve the symptoms but deepen the mystery of what they are. Quantum gravity, the most profound theory unification problem, is still unsolved despite elegant proposals like string theory \u2013 which, for all its mathematical beauty, has yet to contact experiment. Leading physicists have openly lamented this situation: *\u201cwe were left in an uncomfortable state\u201d* by the end of the 20th century, with a great theory that had no glaring flaws but also unanswered questions and no guidance where to go\u301023\u2020L52-L59\u3011. The **\u201cnightmare scenario\u201d** of a Higgs and nothing else at the LHC has indeed come to pass\u301020\u2020L38-L44\u3011, prompting concern that we may not get timely clues to the next theory. Some fear an era of **\u201cindefinite stagnation\u201d**, where progress slows to a crawl and fundamental physics questions remain stuck, perhaps even slipping into the realm of the philosophically unanswerable\u301023\u2020L95-L102\u3011.\n\nAnd yet, physics has been here before. At the end of the 19th century, many thought physics was essentially done, just polishing decimal points \u2013 only for relativity and quantum mechanics to upend everything. In the 1970s, after the Standard Model\u2019s success, some thought particle physics might be over \u2013 and then came discoveries like asymptotic freedom, neutrino oscillations, and dark energy which, while not overturning the SM, showed the universe still had surprises. We cannot predict where the next breakthrough will come from. It might be a serendipitous discovery (like a detector sees an anomaly that leads to a new particle \u2013 akin to how X-rays or superconductivity were found by accident in other fields). It might be a brilliant conceptual leap by an individual or small group, proposing a radically new framework that initially sounds crazy but proves correct. Or it could be that we gradually accumulate enough anomalies and contradictions that a new paradigm crystallizes out of necessity.\n\nWhat is clear is that **current methodologies need reflection and likely revision**. Building ever-bigger colliders with blind faith in theoretical priors has not paid off in the last generation; as Hossenfelder says, *\u201cthe impression [that] theorists realized the error of their ways\u201d* and are changing course is unfortunately not yet evident\u30105\u2020L29-L37\u3011. But perhaps in the coming years, as the cost-benefit calculus of big projects is scrutinized and young researchers diversify, the field will correct its course. Already we see more focus on **foundational questions** (e.g., the quantum foundations community has gained more respect, realizing issues like quantum measurement could hold keys to new physics) and on **interdisciplinary approaches**. There is also a push for more **open science and collaboration**, using tools like machine learning to comb through old data for missed clues, and open data policies to allow more eyes to search for signals.\n\nIn the grand view, fundamental physics isn\u2019t a straight march forward but a series of bursts and plateaus. We are arguably in a plateau \u2013 perhaps the longest since modern science began. How long it will last, no one knows. It could be ended next year by a surprise discovery, or it could persist until entirely new experimental capabilities emerge (like a quantum gravity experiment or a precision cosmology observation that cracks a problem). \n\nTo avoid despair, it\u2019s worth noting some **positives**: We have built incredibly successful theories that *so far* explain all experiments (a triumph in itself). The lack of new particles at the LHC, while disappointing, also means the Standard Model is a remarkably robust description up to energies of ~several TeV \u2013 that\u2019s impressive and itself informative (it tells us new physics, if there, is perhaps at higher scales or more weakly coupled than many thought). Cosmology\u2019s standard model (\u039bCDM with inflation) works so well that it\u2019s often taken for granted, yet it\u2019s a model of breathtaking scope: it explains 14 billion years of cosmic evolution in a few equations. These achievements shouldn\u2019t be undervalued. Our theories might be incomplete, but they are not *wrong* in their domains of validity; this means any new theory will have to reproduce their successes, which is a strong constraint.\n\nIn concluding, we might paraphrase a sentiment from Nobel laureate **David Gross**, who once commented on the string theory situation: *\u201cWe do not know the answers, but we have confidence that asking the right questions will eventually lead us there.\u201d* Fundamental physics has not solved its greatest puzzles yet, but the very recognition of this **\u201ccrisis\u201d** is perhaps a healthy step. As Science historian Thomas Kuhn noted, crises often precede revolutions in science \u2013 they are the periods when the community realizes the current paradigm is insufficient and starts looking outside the box. Whether we are indeed at such a juncture remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: **the quest for understanding the universe at its deepest level continues**. It may require new ideas, new methods, and perhaps a rethinking of what constitutes an explanation. The coming decade will be crucial \u2013 with the high-luminosity LHC, new astrophysical surveys, gravitational wave detectors, and a new generation of quantum experiments \u2013 in determining whether this perceived stagnation is broken by fresh discoveries, or whether fundamental physics must content itself with very slow incremental progress while awaiting a future renaissance. As Hossenfelder urges, *\u201cphysicists need new methods\u201d* and to collectively address the stagnation problem\u30108\u2020L155-L160\u3011. If that introspection leads to more innovative thinking and a broader exploration of ideas, the field will be better poised for the next breakthrough when it comes. In the words of one commenter on Woit\u2019s blog, reflecting on why physicists persist despite the dry spell: *\u201cincreasingly imaginative ideas are being tested\u201d because \u201chigh-energy physics as we have known it no longer produces new results\u201d*\u301026\u2020L179-L187\u3011\u301026\u2020L183-L190\u3011. We can take that as a hopeful sign \u2013 that imagination is not in short supply. Eventually, experiment and imagination will meet again to advance our understanding, as they always have, and the current \u201ccrisis\u201d will be viewed in hindsight as the *gestation period* for a new era of fundamental physics. \n\n**Sources:** Fundamental physics stagnation discussions\u30105\u2020L17-L25\u3011\u30105\u2020L33-L40\u3011\u301023\u2020L67-L75\u3011\u301023\u2020L86-L94\u3011; Standard Model open questions\u301011\u2020L60-L68\u3011\u301011\u2020L115-L122\u3011; inflation debates\u301029\u2020L151-L158\u3011\u301029\u2020L243-L249\u3011; dark matter search status\u301017\u2020L99-L108\u3011\u301017\u2020L108-L115\u3011; dark energy and gravity gaps\u301011\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u301011\u2020L150-L158\u3011; commentary by physicists\u301020\u2020L38-L44\u3011\u301026\u2020L154-L160\u3011\u30107\u2020L49-L57\u3011.\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":859,"end_ix":870,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Sabine Hossenfelder: Backreaction: The present phase of stagnation in the foundations of physics is not normal","url":"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-present-phase-of-stagnation-in.html#:~:text=Nothing%20is%20moving%20in%20the,theory%20development%20are%20of%20no","text":"Nothing is moving in the foundations of physics.
