Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm widely used for securing data.\ue204 \ue203In the context of quantum computing, AES's security is primarily affected by Grover's algorithm, which can theoretically reduce the effective key length by half.\ue204 \ue203This means that AES-256, with a 256-bit key, would offer approximately 128 bits of security against quantum attacks, which is still considered robust.\ue204 \ue203In contrast, AES-128 and AES-192 would provide 64 and 96 bits of security, respectively, making them less secure in a post-quantum scenario.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue201\ue206\n\n\ue203However, it's important to note that while AES-256 remains relatively secure against quantum attacks, it is not classified as a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm.\ue204 \ue203Post-quantum cryptography focuses on developing new algorithms that are inherently resistant to quantum computing threats.\ue204 \ue203These algorithms are based on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been leading efforts to standardize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.\ue204 \ue203As of August 2024, NIST has finalized several standards, including:\ue204\ue206\n\n- **FIPS 203: Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM)**  \n  \ue203Based on the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm, ML-KEM is designed for general encryption purposes and offers quantum-resistant security.\ue204 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search19\ue201\ue206\n\n- **FIPS 204: Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA)**  \n  \ue203Utilizing the CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm, ML-DSA is intended for protecting digital signatures against quantum attacks.\ue204\ue206\n\n- **FIPS 205: Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA)**  \n  \ue203Based on the SPHINCS+ algorithm, SLH-DSA serves as a backup method for digital signatures, employing a different mathematical approach than ML-DSA.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203These post-quantum algorithms are specifically designed to withstand the capabilities of quantum computers, offering a higher level of security in a future where quantum computing becomes more prevalent.\ue204\ue206\n\n\ue203In summary, while AES-256 provides a degree of resistance against quantum attacks, it is not considered a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm.\ue204 \ue203For long-term security, especially in anticipation of advancements in quantum computing, it is advisable to implement standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms such as those recommended by NIST.\ue204\ue206

This example is based on the `ml-kem` library available on GitHub and is suitable for integration into personal applications.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation:\n\n**Step 1: Setup and Installation**\n\nFirst, clone the library and prepare your environment:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ml-kem.git\ncd ml-kem\n```\n\nEnsure your compiler supports C++20 (for example, `g++` version 10+ or `clang++` 13+).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Basic Usage Example (ML-KEM-768)\n\nCreate a new file called `mlkem_example.cpp` and insert the following code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"ml_kem.hpp\"\n\nusing namespace ml_kem;\n\nint main() {\n    // Generate public/private keypair\n    auto [public_key, secret_key] = mlkem768::keygen();\n\n    // Encapsulate: Generate ciphertext and shared secret\n    auto [ciphertext, shared_secret_sender] = mlkem768::encapsulate(public_key);\n\n    // Decapsulate: Extract shared secret from ciphertext\n    auto shared_secret_receiver = mlkem768::decapsulate(secret_key, ciphertext);\n\n    // Verify both sender and receiver derived the same shared secret\n    if (shared_secret_sender == shared_secret_receiver) {\n        std::cout << \"Key encapsulation successful!\\n\";\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Key encapsulation failed.\\n\";\n    }\n\n    // Display the shared secret in hexadecimal\n    std::cout << \"Shared Secret: \";\n    for (const auto &byte : shared_secret_sender) {\n        printf(\"%02x\", byte);\n    }\n    std::cout << \"\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compile the Example\n\nCompile the code with a modern C++ compiler:\n```bash\ng++ -std=c++20 -O3 mlkem_example.cpp -o mlkem_example\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Run the Application\n\nExecute your program:\n```bash\n./mlkem_example\n```\n\n**Example output:**\n```\nKey encapsulation successful!\nShared Secret: e3f1a5b6c8d9...\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Steps:\n\n- **Key Generation**: Produces a public/private keypair.\n- **Encapsulation**: Generates a ciphertext and a shared secret based on the public key.\n- **Decapsulation**: Extracts the shared secret from ciphertext using the private key.\n- **Verification**: Ensures both parties derived identical secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Important Security Notes:\n- Ensure your runtime environment is secure (memory, RNG quality).\n- This implementation has not undergone a formal security audit; consider this when used in critical applications.\n\nThis example provides a practical, straightforward way to incorporate quantum-resistant encryption into your personal applications."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"55f7ef0f-fb8a-45ae-8a14-05f61b131a0e","request_id":"91ea5afba83ca8e1-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"55f7ef0f-fb8a-45ae-8a14-05f61b131a0e","children":[]}}}
