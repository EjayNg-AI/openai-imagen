Here is the precise breakdown, with no hand-waving.\n\n---\n\n## 1) CPF simply **stops being deducted** beyond S$102,000\n\nThe **CPF Annual Salary Ceiling (ASC)** caps the amount of wages on which CPF contributions are payable **per calendar year**.\n\n- **Up to S$102,000** of *total wages* \u2192 CPF contributions apply  \n- **Beyond S$102,000** \u2192 **no CPF contributions at all**, from both **employee and employer**\n\nThis applies regardless of:\n- How high your income goes (S$150k, S$300k, S$1m \u2014 irrelevant)\n- Whether the excess comes from monthly wages or bonuses\n\nOnce you hit the ceiling:\n- **Employee CPF deductions stop**\n- **Employer CPF contributions stop**\n- Your payslip suddenly jumps up in **net cash**\n\n---\n\n## 2) What counts toward the S$102,000?\n\nCPF distinguishes two wage types:\n\n### (a) Ordinary Wages (OW)\n- Monthly salary\n- Subject to the **monthly OW ceiling** (S$7,400 in 2025 \u2192 **S$8,000 from 1 Jan 2026**)\n\n### (b) Additional Wages (AW)\n- Bonus, commissions, leave pay, AWS, etc.\n\nThe annual ceiling formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CPF-contributable AW} = \\min\\bigl(\\text{AW},\\; 102{,}000 - \\text{total OW already counted}\\bigr)\n\\]\n\nOnce:\n\\[\n\\text{OW} + \\text{AW} = 102{,}000\n\\]\nCPF is **done for the year**.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Concrete examples (this is where intuition often fails)\n\n### Example 1: High fixed salary, no bonus\n- Monthly salary = S$9,000 (2026)\n- OW ceiling = S$8,000\n- Annual OW counted = 8,000 \u00d7 12 = **S$96,000**\n\nCPF applies only on:\n- First **S$96,000**\n- Remaining **S$6,000** of the annual ceiling unused\n\nIf you receive:\n- Bonus \u2264 S$6,000 \u2192 CPF applies partially\n- Bonus > S$6,000 \u2192 CPF applies only on S$6,000, rest is cash\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Salary + big bonus\n- Monthly OW counted = S$7,400 \u00d7 12 = S$88,800 (2025)\n- Bonus = S$40,000\n\nCPF applies on:\n- First **S$13,200** of bonus  \n  (because 102,000 \u2212 88,800 = 13,200)\n\nCPF **does not apply** on:\n- Remaining **S$26,800** of the bonus\n\n---\n\n### Example 3: You hit the ceiling mid-year\nOnce cumulative wages hit S$102,000:\n- **All subsequent months** \u2192 zero CPF\n- Your take-home pay rises abruptly\n- Employer cost drops abruptly\n\nThis is very noticeable in payslips.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Strategic implications (this is the part people often miss)\n\n### (i) CPF becomes a **regressive system above S$102k**\n- Effective CPF rate **falls with income** above the ceiling\n- Marginal CPF rate beyond S$102k = **0%**\n\nThis is intentional policy design.\n\n---\n\n### (ii) You cannot \u201cforce\u201d mandatory CPF beyond the ceiling\nEven if you want more CPF:\n- Mandatory CPF **cannot exceed** the ceiling\n- Employer **cannot contribute more** under mandatory CPF\n\nOnly **voluntary top-ups** are allowed.\n\n---\n\n### (iii) Voluntary options (if you want to compensate)\nIf your income is well above S$102k and you want CPF-like benefits:\n\n- **VC3 (Voluntary Contribution to all three accounts)**  \n  Subject to the **CPF Annual Limit (S$37,740)**\n\n- **RSTU (Retirement Sum Topping-Up)**  \n  Tax-relieved, but **SA/RA only**\n\nThese are **separate caps**, unrelated to the salary ceiling.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Bottom line (one-sentence version)\n\n> When your annual wages exceed **S$102,000**, CPF contributions stop completely for the rest of the year, and all additional income is paid out fully in cash, with no CPF deduction or employer contribution.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- your **age band**\n- salary vs bonus split\n- whether you\u2019re **employee or self-employed**\n\nand I\u2019ll quantify exactly **how much CPF you\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d** and whether voluntary top-ups make mathematical

case."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":23.706056992523372,"simple_search_prob":0.5675525877102698,"complex_search_prob":0.2500788232292989,"no_search_prob":0.18236858906043124,"search_complexity_decision":"no_search","search_decision":false,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","model_config_name":"chatgpt_sonic_classifier_model_config","disable_sonic_prefetch_classifier":false,"force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"prefetch_threshold":0.55,"first_turn_prefetch_threshold":null,"force_search_first_turn_threshold":1e-05,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"passthrough_tool_calls":true,"passthrough_tool_name_exclusions":["genui"],"timeout":1.0},"classifier_snapshot_id":null,"decision_source":"classifier","passthrough_tool_names":["api_tool","automations","bio","canmore","container","file_search","gcal","gcontacts","gmail","image_gen","python","python_user_visible"]},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"098f2181-8962-4938-9c92-dea0919196aa","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"efe94904-6b81-4c6c-b19c-046b71f4d205","turn_exchange_id":"dfdfc377-b03d-4b1f-adcb-eab75d6da507"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"efe94904-6b81-4c6c-b19c-046b71f4d205","children":["601380a0-607c-49e3-b5db-c20034bca0ab"]},"601380a0-607c-49e3-b5db-c20034bca0ab":{"id":"601380a0-607c-49e3-b5db-c20034bca0ab","message":{"id":"601380a0-607c-49e3-b5db-c20034bca0ab","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765704199.416,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["My

The reason is subtle but mechanical.\n\nLet me unpack this carefully and precisely.\n\n---\n\n## 1) What your employer is *actually* doing\n\nYour employer is **correctly applying the Ordinary Wage (OW) ceiling every month**.\n\n- 2025: OW ceiling = **S$7,400**\n- From 1 Jan 2026: OW ceiling = **S$8,000**\n\nEach month:\n- CPF is calculated **only on the capped OW**\n- Same CPF amount is paid every month\n- No bonus / AW tracking is involved\n\nThis **does not require annual tracking** as long as:\n- You have **no Additional Wages (AW)** such as bonuses, commissions, AWS, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Why this does *not* violate the S$102,000 annual ceiling\n\nHere is the key point most people miss:\n\n> **The annual salary ceiling is not an independent constraint if you only receive Ordinary Wages and no Additional Wages.**\n\nWhy?\n\n### With OW only:\n\\[\n\\text{Total CPF-contributable wages}\n=\n12 \\times (\\text{monthly OW ceiling})\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n- In **2025**:  \n  \\[\n  7{,}400 \\times 12 = 88{,}800 < 102{,}000\n  \\]\n\n- In **2026**:  \n  \\[\n  8{,}000 \\times 12 = 96{,}000 < 102{,}000\n  \\]\n\nYou **never reach** the annual ceiling.\n\nTherefore:\n- There is **nothing to track**\n- CPF will **never exceed** the annual cap\n- Paying the same CPF every month is **mathematically safe**\n\n---\n\n## 3) When annual tracking becomes mandatory (and your employer must act)\n\nYour employer **must** start tracking cumulative wages **only if Additional Wages (AW) are paid**.\n\nExamples:\n- Year-end bonus\n- Performance bonus\n- Commission\n- AWS / 13th-month pay\n- Leave encashment\n\nThen the formula kicks in:\n\\[\n\\text{AW CPF cap} = 102{,}000 - (\\text{total OW already counted})\n\\]\n\nIf your employer fails to do this **and pays CPF on the full bonus**, that would be **incorrect** and CPF Board will flag it.\n\nBut in a **pure OW-only setup**, there is nothing to reconcile.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Why employers like this setup\n\nFrom a payroll systems perspective:\n\n- Monthly OW cap \u2192 **deterministic**\n- No need to track cumulative salary\n- No risk of over-contribution\n- No refund workflows with CPF Board\n\nThis is why many high-salary professionals are paid this way.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Edge cases to watch (important)\n\nEven in your setup, watch out for:\n\n1. **Irregular payments**\n   - One-off allowance\n   - Ad-hoc incentives\n   - \u201cSpecial payment\u201d outside monthly salary\n\n   These are **AW**, not OW.\n\n2. **Salary restructuring**\n   - Switching from fixed pay to bonus-heavy pay\n   - Deferred compensation\n\n3. **Mid-year employer change**\n   - New employer **does not know** how much CPF-counted OW you already had\n   - Annual ceiling applies **across employers**, not per employer\n\nIf any of these occur, **you** should proactively flag it.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Bottom line (precise and blunt)\n\n> If you are paid **only fixed monthly salary**, your employer can safely pay the **same capped CPF every month**, without tracking annual salary, and this will **never breach the S$102,000 ceiling**, even after the OW ceiling rises to S$8,000.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- sanity-check your **2026 CPF numbers down to the dollar**\n- model what happens if you introduce a **bonus**\n- assess whether **voluntary CPF top-ups** make sense given your cash flow\n\nJust say the word."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":32.03202900476754,"simple_search_prob":0.21423619471220756,"complex_search_prob":0.011608958468152276,"no_search_prob":0.7741548468196402,"search_complexity_decision":"no_search","search_decision":false,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","model_config_name":"chatgpt_sonic_classifier_model_config","disable_sonic_prefetch_classifier":false,"force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"prefetch_threshold":0.55,"first_turn_prefetch_threshold":null,"force_search_first_turn_threshold":1e-05,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"passthrough_tool_calls":true,"passthrough_tool_name_exclusions":["genui"],"timeout":1.0},"classifier_snapshot_id":null,"decision_source":"classifier","passthrough_tool_names":["api_tool","automations","bio","canmore","container","file_search","gcal","gcontacts","gmail","image_gen","python","python_user_visible"]},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9035869b-8677-4dc8-9fce-d5a0212576bc","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"601380a0-607c-49e3-b5db-c20034bca0ab","turn_exchange_id":"563569dd-7294-4fdd-accd-867d345795a9"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"601380a0-607c-49e3-b5db-c20034bca0ab","children":["94de5938-0f48-4c34-8c2e-94209673e9a3"]},"94de5938-0f48-4c34-8c2e-94209673e9a3":{"id":"94de5938-0f48-4c34-8c2e-94209673e9a3","message":{"id":"94de5938-0f48-4c34-8c2e-94209673e9a3","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765704328.001,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["My tuition industry has no bonus or special payment.

No edge cases.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Exact CPF numbers you will hit\n\n### 2025\n- OW ceiling = **S$7,400**\n- Annual CPF-counted wages = **S$88,800**\n\n### 2026 onwards\n- OW ceiling = **S$8,000**\n- Annual CPF-counted wages = **S$96,000**\n\nBoth are **well below** the **S$102,000 annual ceiling**.\n\nSo:\n- Annual ceiling is **irrelevant** in your case\n- Employer **never** needs to track cumulative salary\n- CPF Board **will never claw back or refund**\n\n---\n\n## 3) Your *effective* CPF rate drops as you teach more\n\nThis is the part worth stating plainly.\n\nSuppose (for illustration):\n- You earn S$180k/year\n- CPF applies only on S$96k (2026)\n\nThen:\n\\[\n\\text{Effective CPF rate} = \\frac{0.37 \\times 96{,}000}{180{,}000} \\approx 19.7\\%\n\\]\n\nTeach more \u2192 higher cash fraction \u2192 **lower effective CPF rate**.\n\nThis is **structural**, not a loophole.\n\n---\n\n## 4) From a policy lens: you are exactly the \u201cintended case\u201d\n\nCPF is designed to:\n- Enforce minimum retirement saving\n- **Not** confiscate unlimited income\n- Cap compulsory savings for high earners\n\nYour situation:\n- High effort, high marginal productivity\n- No deferred pay games\n- No bonus manipulation\n\nCPF treats this as:\n> \u201cYou\u2019ve satisfied the compulsory savings requirement. Everything else is yours.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5) What *could* break this simplicity (watchlist)\n\nOnly three things:\n\n1. **Change in pay structure**\n   - Introduction of incentives / performance pay\n2. **Mid-year employer change**\n   - Still fine, but AW logic may appear if paid lump sums\n3. **Policy change**\n   - Raising annual ceiling above 12 \u00d7 OW cap  \n   (not announced; historically very slow and politically sensitive)\n\nAs of now, none apply.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Practical advice (since you\u2019re mathematically inclined)\n\n- Treat CPF as a **fixed annual constant** in your planning:\n  - 2025: fixed\n  - 2026+: fixed (but higher)\n- All marginal income beyond the OW cap is **pure cash**\n- If you want CPF-like risk-free yield:\n  - Use **SA/RA top-ups selectively**\n  - Compare against SGS / T-bills / SSBs\n\nCPF is a *tool*, not a religion.\n\n---\n\n## 7) One-line summary\n\n> Your CPF is already maximally \u201csaturated\u201d every month; teaching more simply converts effort into cash with zero additional CPF friction, and the annual ceiling never enters the picture.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- compute your **exact OA/SA/MA split** post-2026\n- compare CPF vs T-bills vs SSBs quantitatively\n- stress-test retirement scenarios assuming zero further CPF growth beyond the cap\n\nJust say what angle you want next."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":56.094745988957584,"simple_search_prob":0.12672288426257683,"complex_search_prob":0.009419721651143728,"no_search_prob":0.8638573940862795,"search_complexity_decision":"no_search","search_decision":false,"simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","classifier_config":{"model_name":"snc-pg-sw-3cls-ev3","renderer_name":"harmony_v4.0.15_16k_orion_text_only_no_asr_2k_action","classifier_config_name":"sonic_classifier_5p2_3cls_ev3","model_config_name":"chatgpt_sonic_classifier_model_config","disable_sonic_prefetch_classifier":false,"force_disabled_rate":0.0,"force_enabled_rate":0.0,"num_messages":20,"only_user_messages":false,"remove_memory":true,"support_mm":true,"n_ctx":2048,"max_action_length":4,"dynamic_set_max_message_size":false,"max_message_tokens":2000,"append_base_config":false,"no_search_token":"1","simple_search_token":"7","complex_search_token":"5","simple_search_threshold":0.0,"complex_search_threshold":0.4,"no_search_threshold":0.175,"prefetch_threshold":0.55,"first_turn_prefetch_threshold":null,"force_search_first_turn_threshold":1e-05,"threshold_order":["no_search","complex","simple"],"passthrough_tool_calls":true,"passthrough_tool_name_exclusions":["genui"],"timeout":1.0},"classifier_snapshot_id":null,"decision_source":"classifier","passthrough_tool_names":["api_tool","automations","bio","canmore","container","file_search","gcal","gcontacts","gmail","image_gen","python","python_user_visible"]},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"a329f735-e658-460d-a848-f87b4bf05da5","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"94de5938-0f48-4c34-8c2e-94209673e9a3","turn_exchange_id":"d3ebb747-7366-4f61-8da4-3dafbcfd0d5d"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"94de5938-0f48-4c34-8c2e-94209673e9a3","children":[]}}}
