Celebrities such as Lizzo, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Amy Schumer, and many others have faced public scrutiny and harsh commentary about their bodies. Each has used their platform to advocate for body acceptance, debunk societal beauty standards, and shut down unsolicited criticism.\n\nFor example, Kelly Osbourne addressed criticisms following her father Ozzy's death, emphasizing survival over appearance. Lizzo defended her weight journey while promoting inclusivity and mental health awareness. Ariana Grande reminded fans that health and beauty take many forms, while Selena Gomez opened up about the impact of medication on her body. Stars like Sydney Sweeney, SZA, Kesha, and Gigi Hadid also spoke out against judgment, calling for compassion and acceptance.\n\nThe overarching theme underscores the toxic culture of body-shaming and the empowerment that comes from rejecting it. These stars highlight the importance of self-love, finding strength through adversity, and challenging narrow societal ideals.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1767960000.0,"attribution":"people.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://people.com/critics-choice-awards-2026-ariana-grande-debuts-darker-hair-11878873","title":"Ariana Grande Debuts Her Darkest Hair Yet After Rocking Her Glinda Blonde for Years at the Critics Choice Awards 2026","snippet":"At the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, Ariana Grande debuted her darkest hair color yet, marking a striking departure from the platinum blonde look she maintained for her role as Glinda in the film \"Wicked.\" Styled by Law Roach, Grande complemented her dramatic brunette updo with a romantic baby pink Alberta Ferretti gown, complete with cape sleeves and Swarovski jewelry, continuing her tradition of \u201cmethod dressing\u201d inspired by her Glinda character. \n\nThis bold hair transformation follows her return to her natural hair color in October 2025 during the \"Wicked: For Good\" press tour, tying into the darker storyline of the film\u2019s sequel. Despite embracing the change, Grande humorously revealed challenges with the transition, noting her hair \"rejects\" the brunette toner and frequently reverts to blonde. Nominated for Best Supporting Actress, she described parting with her beloved character and the film as \u201cpeaceful\u201d and felt proud of the work completed. The Critics Choice Awards aired live on Jan. 4 from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1767572737.0,"attribution":"people.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://people.com/ariana-grande-undergoes-dramatic-old-lady-makeover-with-wrinkle-prosthetics-eternal-sunshine-deluxe-short-film-11705213","title":"Ariana Grande Transforms into a Much Older Version of Herself with Wrinkle Prosthetics - and the Results Are Drastic","snippet":"Ariana Grande has undergone a striking transformation into an elderly version of herself for her new short film \"Brighter Days Ahead,\" which accompanies the deluxe version of her album *Eternal Sunshine*. Premiered on March 28, the 26-minute film is directed by Christian Breslauer and sees Grande reprise her character Peaches from the music video \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love).\" The transformation involved prosthetic wrinkles and a gray wig, making the 31-year-old pop star nearly unrecognizable. The storyline follows an older Peaches seeking \"advanced memory restoration\" to revisit pivotal life memories.\n\nGrande shared a behind-the-scenes glimpse of her aged appearance on Instagram, including close-ups of the facial prosthetics. Though she\u2019s thrilling fans with new music, Grande confirmed she does not plan to tour soon, expressing a growing passion for acting. Her portrayal of Glinda in *Wicked* earned her critical acclaim and her first Oscar nomination. During awards season, she showcased glamorous designer looks curated by stylist Mimi Cuttrell, especially at the 2025 Oscars, where she wore a dazzling Schiaparelli Haute Couture gown. The deluxe album was hinted at months earlier, rounding out a major artistic year for the singer-turned-actress.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1743188670.0,"attribution":"people.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"nypost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/10/lifestyle/hollywoods-new-ultra-thin-trend-is-dangerously-contagious/","title":"Hollywood's new ultra-thin trend is contagious - and here's what parents must do to keep kids safe","snippet":"The article from the New York Post discusses the growing concern over Hollywood's revival of ultra-thin beauty standards, exemplified by recent images of celebrities like Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande appearing drastically thin. This trend, associated with weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and the return of early 2000s (Y2K) fashion, contributes to the resurgence of unrealistic body ideals. Social media, particularly platforms like TikTok, amplify these toxic messages through trends like #SkinnyTok and \u201cthinfluencers,\u201d spreading potentially harmful content that glorifies disordered eating. Studies cited in the article show that eating disorders can spread through social influence, especially among adolescents. The article emphasizes that while celebrities' weight choices deserve privacy, their visibility influences impressionable youth. It underscores the role of parents and society in protecting children, recommending limited social media exposure until high school to lessen the harmful impact on body image and mental health.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1765398262.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.fridaythings.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.fridaythings.com/recent-posts/wicked-for-good-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-eating-disorder","title":"How Do We Talk About Ariana Grande's Weight Loss?","snippet":"2 days ago \u2014 Two years ago, Ariana Grande posted a TikTok asking people to stop talking about her body.

While this transparency is praised by some as a new form of body positivity, critics argue it marks a regression from the size inclusivity gains of the past decade.\n\nCelebrity insiders and industry professionals voice concerns about a return to narrow beauty standards, with casting preferences reportedly skewing toward smaller sizes once again. While some stars claim their thinner appearances reflect a journey to better health, others suggest the pressure to conform in Hollywood is immense. The conversation also extends to the rising normalization of cosmetic procedures. Ultimately, the question remains: is this shift truly about health and personal choice, or is it a new guise for the same old societal pressures?","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1763211600.0,"attribution":"pagesix.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.hellomagazine.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/816873/ariana-grande-health-own-words/","title":"Ariana Grande's health in her own words | HELLO!","snippet":"20 Nov 2025 \u2014 Ariana said the public was \"comparing my current body\" to \"the unhealthiest version of my body\", addressing comparisons between her smaller ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.hellomagazine.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/Billboard/posts/ariana-grande-discussed-the-way-people-talk-about-her-appearance-saying-that-nob/958206702846575/","title":"Ariana Grande discussed the way people talk about her ...","snippet":"Ariana Grande appears very thin, pale, and frail\u2014these can be red flags for health issues like an eating disorder, anorexia, or another medical ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":12},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.facebook.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"msmagazine.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://msmagazine.com/2025/12/17/wicked-weight-loss-anorexia-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-body-image-eating-disorder-thin/","title":"What the 'Wicked' Weight-Loss Discourse Gets Wrong","snippet":"3 days ago \u2014 What the 'Wicked' Ariana Grande weight-loss discourse gets wrong: the larger, deadlier return of extreme thinness as a cultural ideal.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"msmagazine.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.shefinds.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.shefinds.com/collections/ariana-grande-snl-skinny-appearance/","title":"Ariana Grande Fans Are 'Worried' After Seeing Her 'Skinny' ...","snippet":"6 hours ago \u2014 Over the last year, internet users have become increasingly worried about Ariana's health and well-being, as she's looked noticeably skinnier ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":15},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.shefinds.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"idir.uta.edu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://idir.uta.edu/stance_annotation/news/?id=why-experts-say-ariana-grandes-recent-shift-points-to-a-health-first-change-6937a3af62111","title":"Why Experts Say Ariana Grande's Recent Shift Points to a ...","snippet":"9 Dec 2025 \u2014 Ariana has shared that she had lived on junk food for years\u2014a factor that contributed to her unhealthy eating habits and took a toll on her well ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":16},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"idir.uta.edu"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.aol.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.aol.com/articles/ariana-grande-sparks-concern-fans-140000189.html","title":"Ariana Grande Sparks Concern as Fans Fear She's ' ...","snippet":"Ariana Grande Sparks Concern as Fans Fear She's 'Wasting Away' After Past Eating Struggles ; Fans are starting to grow nervous as Ariana Grande looks thinner ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":19},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.aol.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.foxnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ariana-grande-fights-back-against-body-shamers-critics-comment-her-weight-during-wicked-press-tour","title":"Ariana Grande fights back against body-shamers as critics ...","snippet":"13 hours ago \u2014 One person on X wrote that parts of \"Wicked: For Good\" were \"hard to watch\" because Grande \"looked so unhealthily thin and it concerns me for ...","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":20},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.foxnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ew.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://ew.com/ariana-grande-slams-dangerous-body-shaming-comments-with-reminder-to-fans-11859056","title":"Ariana Grande shares a 'loving reminder' to fans about the dangers of body-shaming amid \"Wicked\" press tour","snippet":"Ariana Grande has shared a heartfelt reminder to her fans about the dangers of body-shaming, resurfacing a 2024 interview clip during the press tour for the film *Wicked: For Good*.

Many online narratives use side-by-side images to suggest potential eating disorders or unhealthy methods for achieving thinness, despite acknowledging body commentary is usually discouraged. These discussions have morphed from expressing concern into speculative gossip, involving unfounded theories about on-set behavior and dangerous comparisons to past Hollywood figures like Judy Garland.\n\nThe article critiques how such discourse, framed as concern, often shifts toward voyeurism and click-driven speculation, blurring the line between advocating for public health awareness and perpetuating damaging body scrutiny. Experts emphasize the importance of considering cultural pressures around body image rather than targeting individual celebrities. They advocate for thoughtful, non-shaming conversations that focus on media influence rather than personal appearances. Ultimately, the piece warns that such discussions risk harming both the celebrities involved and impressionable audiences, reiterating that diseases like eating disorders are not moral failures, and sensationalizing them only contributes to a harmful culture.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1764100680.0,"attribution":"www.cosmopolitan.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Rings","title":"7 Rings","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":36},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande","title":"Ariana Grande","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":37},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetener_World_Tour","title":"Sweetener World Tour","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":38},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6963064dc0008329b05d5556252d0369","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"5971b09b-b7c2-463b-9825-e14b8f8eb4ad","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2","parent_id":"e120ec04-36e2-47a2-af37-ea1c1d0f428d","turn_exchange_id":"bc571fa9-820e-4de2-9eca-6f194a9b2754"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e120ec04-36e2-47a2-af37-ea1c1d0f428d","children":["161bcfc5-9ef4-4597-981a-0d4ddcf479a4"]},"161bcfc5-9ef4-4597-981a-0d4ddcf479a4":{"id":"161bcfc5-9ef4-4597-981a-0d4ddcf479a4","message":{"id":"161bcfc5-9ef4-4597-981a-0d4ddcf479a4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"alpha.sonic_thinky_v1_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1768097359.003354,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["In short: **yes \u2014 Ariana Grande\u2019s physique *does* look noticeably slimmer now compared with how she appeared back around the *\u201c7 Rings\u201d* era (2018\u20132019)**, and that shift has attracted a lot of public commentary.

This trend, associated with weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and the return of early 2000s (Y2K) fashion, contributes to the resurgence of unrealistic body ideals. Social media, particularly platforms like TikTok, amplify these toxic messages through trends like #SkinnyTok and \u201cthinfluencers,\u201d spreading potentially harmful content that glorifies disordered eating. Studies cited in the article show that eating disorders can spread through social influence, especially among adolescents. The article emphasizes that while celebrities' weight choices deserve privacy, their visibility influences impressionable youth.

Celebrities such as Lizzo, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Amy Schumer, and many others have faced public scrutiny and harsh commentary about their bodies. Each has used their platform to advocate for body acceptance, debunk societal beauty standards, and shut down unsolicited criticism.\n\nFor example, Kelly Osbourne addressed criticisms following her father Ozzy's death, emphasizing survival over appearance. Lizzo defended her weight journey while promoting inclusivity and mental health awareness. Ariana Grande reminded fans that health and beauty take many forms, while Selena Gomez opened up about the impact of medication on her body. Stars like Sydney Sweeney, SZA, Kesha, and Gigi Hadid also spoke out against judgment, calling for compassion and acceptance.\n\nThe overarching theme underscores the toxic culture of body-shaming and the empowerment that comes from rejecting it. These stars highlight the importance of self-love, finding strength through adversity, and challenging narrow societal ideals.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Ariana Grande shares a 'loving reminder' to fans about the dangers of body-shaming amid \"Wicked\" press tour","url":"https://ew.com/ariana-grande-slams-dangerous-body-shaming-comments-with-reminder-to-fans-11859056?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Ariana Grande has shared a heartfelt reminder to her fans about the dangers of body-shaming, resurfacing a 2024 interview clip during the press tour for the film *Wicked: For Good*. In the video, she addresses the relentless scrutiny over her appearance since early in her career, expressing how deeply damaging such commentary can be. Grande emphasized the societal comfort with commenting on others' bodies, calling it \"really dangerous,\" and advised fans to protect themselves\u2014whether by blocking people or removing social media apps.\n\nShe candidly reflected on her own struggles, recounting how past perceptions of her \"healthiest\" body were actually during one of the darkest periods of her life, affected by antidepressant use, alcohol, and poor diet. Reasserting that beauty comes in many forms, Grande urged viewers to reject harmful narratives and prioritize mental wellbeing.\n\nThis comes amid increasing speculation about the appearance of *Wicked* cast members, though Grande has long advocated for body positivity. She continues to promote the film, co-starring Cynthia Erivo, Jonathan Bailey, Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, and others, under the direction of Jon M. Chu.","attribution":"EW.com"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"people.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2988,"end_idx":2988,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"7 Rings","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Rings?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"How Do We Talk About Ariana Grande's Weight Loss?","url":"https://www.fridaythings.com/recent-posts/wicked-for-good-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-eating-disorder?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Friday Things"},{"title":"Ariana Grande shares a 'loving reminder' to fans about the dangers of body-shaming amid \"Wicked\" press tour","url":"https://ew.com/ariana-grande-slams-dangerous-body-shaming-comments-with-reminder-to-fans-11859056?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"EW.com"},{"title":"Hollywood's new ultra-thin trend is contagious - and here's what parents must do to keep kids safe","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/10/lifestyle/hollywoods-new-ultra-thin-trend-is-dangerously-contagious/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"New York Post"},{"title":"\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435, \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0430","url":"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%2C_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"'I Ain't Got Time For You': How Stars Have Shut Down Body-Shamers","url":"https://people.com/celebrities-responding-body-shaming-11876049?utm_source=chatgpt.com","attribution":"people.com"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Rings","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Rings?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ew.com/ariana-grande-slams-dangerous-body-shaming-comments-with-reminder-to-fans-11859056","https://ew.com/ariana-grande-slams-dangerous-body-shaming-comments-with-reminder-to-fans-11859056?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://nypost.com/2025/12/10/lifestyle/hollywoods-new-ultra-thin-trend-is-dangerously-contagious/","https://nypost.com/2025/12/10/lifestyle/hollywoods-new-ultra-thin-trend-is-dangerously-contagious/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://people.com/celebrities-responding-body-shaming-11876049","https://people.com/celebrities-responding-body-shaming-11876049?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%2C_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0","https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%2C_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.fridaythings.com/recent-posts/wicked-for-good-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-eating-disorder","https://www.fridaythings.com/recent-posts/wicked-for-good-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-eating-disorder?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/816873/ariana-grande-health-own-words/","https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/816873/ariana-grande-health-own-words/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.shefinds.com/collections/ariana-grande-snl-skinny-appearance/","https://www.shefinds.com/collections/ariana-grande-snl-skinny-appearance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y38hbAtS_2c&utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"ARIANA GRANDE DESTROYED HER FACE (irreversible damage)","snippet":"I know this is a hard subject but I think a lot of her changes come from weight loss.
