Brand-specific claims are rare, so typical ranges and extraction types are discussed.\n\n**Assessing brand choices**\n\nI\u2019m gathering info on high polyphenol-count avocado and olive oils, comparing brands like O-MED, Merula, and Chosen Foods.\n\n**Discussing polyphenol levels**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together the polyphenol counts for both avocado and olive oils, covering styles and typical ranges, and researching specific olive oil brands for 2023-24 data.\n\n**Investigating polyphenol units**\n\nI'm gathering info on O-Med Novo Picual retailing at 520 mg caffeic acid equivalents. Clarifying the distinction between caffeic acid and gallic acid equivalents is crucial for consistency.\n\n**Assessing polyphenol data**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the polyphenol numbers for different olive oils. The Merula and Marques de Valdueza figures seem credible, but specifying the harvest and distributor is essential. For O-MED, the value is reliable. For Ardoino Fructus Taggiasca, I\u2019d need to search specifically for brand numbers or general cultivar ranges.\n\n**Searching database**\n\nI'm pulling up Favuzzi's distribution pages to find Merula and Marques numbers. For Ardoino, I might look into \"Fiordiliguria\" or \"Ardoino polifenoli 500 mg/kg.\" Let's see what the Italian search reveals.\n\n**Gathering data**\n\nI\u2019m collecting polyphenol numbers for different olive oils. Some, like Merula and Marques de Valdueza, have clear data. For others, I need to cross-check retailer listings or specific product pages.\n\n**Gathering polyphenol insights**  \nI'm pulling together polyphenol data from various sources, including EVOO and avocado oil. The goal is to provide a comprehensive list of measurements and sources.\n\n**Choose to search**\n\nI\u2019m gathering info on Alce Nero's polyphenol measurements to see if they publish this data. This will enhance the accuracy of the current polyphenol analysis.\n\n**Analyzing polyphenol sources**\n\nI\u2019m gathering info on olive oil polyphenol counts: Merula and O-MED Picual are top, Terre Francescane Moraiolo likely high, while Ardoino Taggiasca and Alce Nero Organic come in lower.\n\n**Navigating data**\n\nFocusing on known olive oil polyphenol levels from O-Med Novo Picual and Merula, while clearly marking unknowns. Considering the data availability matrix for precision.\n\n**Synthesizing rankings**\n\nOK, let's break these down: EVOO Tier A includes Merula, Marques de Valdueza, and O-Med Picual, while avocado oils show variable polyphenol content."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for 7m 50s","initial_text":"Reasoning","summarization_headline":"Request for GPT-5 Pro","async_source":"bon-user-BCJOyZGunEUKDxRwBvjpnlad-57fd3bc2-5d4b-4cbb-a41d-faceb3c0fb6d","parent_id":"79265808-3531-42d0-b68e-e0df0a26b88e","poll_on_websocket_inactivity_ms":30000,"poll_freshness_max_mins":30,"poll_interval_ms":10000,"request_id":"57fd3bc2-5d4b-4cbb-a41d-faceb3c0fb6d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-pro","turn_exchange_id":"860555ef-c046-4de8-9b7c-0bb9538208fb","timestamp_":"absolute","finished_duration_sec":470,"pro_skipped":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"79265808-3531-42d0-b68e-e0df0a26b88e","children":["b612a3e5-b963-4ce2-8db4-cc8b919fcb6a"]},"b612a3e5-b963-4ce2-8db4-cc8b919fcb6a":{"id":"b612a3e5-b963-4ce2-8db4-cc8b919fcb6a","message":{"id":"b612a3e5-b963-4ce2-8db4-cc8b919fcb6a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761709418.88412,"update_time":1761709289.040622,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below I\u2019m assuming you meant the **Tier\u2011A extra\u2011virgin olive oils** we shortlisted earlier (O\u2011MED, Merula / Marqu\u00e9s de Valdueza, Ardoino Fructus, Terre Francescane/Gradassi, Alce Nero). \u201cPolyphenols\u201d = total phenolic content (TPC) in **mg/kg**; counts vary by cultivar, harvest date, and lab method (Folin\u2013Ciocalteu as caffeic/gallic\u2011acid equivalents vs. EFSA\u2019s hydroxytyrosol\u2011derivatives basis), so treat cross\u2011brand comparisons as indicative rather than exact.
