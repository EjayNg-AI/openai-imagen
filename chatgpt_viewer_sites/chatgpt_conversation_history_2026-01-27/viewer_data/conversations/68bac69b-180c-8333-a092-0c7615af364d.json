daily vitamin shown to slow aging process over 4-year period, new Harvard study confirms","snippet":"A new Harvard study published in *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* has confirmed that taking a daily vitamin D supplement may significantly slow the aging process. The research followed 1,000 individuals aged 50 and older over a four-year period. Participants who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily experienced less than half the telomere shortening\u2014a key marker of aging\u2014compared to a placebo group. They also showed reduced inflammation and fewer autoimmune diseases. Telomeres protect chromosome ends and shorten with age, contributing to increased health risks and mortality.\n\nLead author Dr. JoAnn Manson emphasized that vitamin D helps reduce inflammation, which is linked to aging and chronic disease. The supplement was found to be safe at the studied dose, though expert recommendations vary. While the U.S. National Academy of Medicine advises 600-800 IU per day depending on age, the Endocrine Society suggests supplements may benefit older adults and other at-risk groups.\n\nDespite the promising results, researchers advocate for further trials before revising public guidance. Manson stressed that vitamin D alone isn't a substitute for a healthy lifestyle involving good nutrition, physical activity, and moderate sun exposure.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756487999.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7910980/","title":"Calcium Supplements and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease","snippet":"by SK Myung \u00b7 2021 \u00b7 Cited by 75 \u2014 Conclusions: The current meta-analysis found that calcium supplements increased a risk of CVD by about 15% in healthy postmenopausal women.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7098545/","title":"The Effect of Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on ...","snippet":"by M Blondon \u00b7 2015 \u00b7 Cited by 34 \u2014 The risk of idiopathic VTE was lower in women randomized to calcium plus vitamin D (40 vs. 65 events; HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92).","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613455/","title":"The Synergistic Interplay between Vitamins D and K for ...","snippet":"by AJ van Ballegooijen \u00b7 2017 \u00b7 Cited by 168 \u2014 Animal and human studies suggest that optimal concentrations of both vitamin D and vitamin K are beneficial for bone and cardiovascular health.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12285661/","title":"Magnesium for Prevention of New-onset Postoperative ...","snippet":"by S Ghazizadeh \u00b7 2025 \u2014 This meta-analysis article aimed to investigate the efficacy of magnesium in preventing new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF).","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC20183/","title":"Mechanism of platelet inhibition by nitric oxide: In vivo ...","snippet":"by GR Wang \u00b7 1998 \u00b7 Cited by 385 \u2014 Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet activation.

Here's What a New Study Found","snippet":"A recent study published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society suggests that vitamin D and calcium supplements may help lower blood pressure in older adults with obesity. Conducted with 221 overweight seniors in Beirut, the study found that both low (600 IU) and high (3,750 IU) doses of vitamin D, when combined with 1000 mg of calcium daily, led to slight reductions in blood pressure after one year. However, the benefits were most significant among those with obesity and hypertension. Despite these findings, experts urge caution, noting the study's limitations, such as the lack of a placebo group and its original focus on insulin resistance rather than blood pressure. Previous research on the topic has also produced mixed results, and there is no consistent evidence that vitamin D supplementation improves cardiovascular health or reduces blood pressure. Therefore, while vitamin D supplements may help those deficient, it's recommended to first seek sufficient sun exposure and dietary sources of vitamin D.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1732734000.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.sciencedirect.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15368780","title":"UVA Irradiation of Human Skin Vasodilates Arterial ...","snippet":"by D Liu \u00b7 2014 \u00b7 Cited by 339 \u2014 UVA irradiation of the skin of normotensive human volunteers lowers BP and causes arterial vasodilatation in a NO synthase (NOS)-independent manner.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.sciencedirect.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1538783622131818","title":"Unresolved roles of platelet nitric oxide synthase","snippet":"by KM NASEEM \u00b7 2008 \u00b7 Cited by 60 \u2014 Endothelial\u2010derived nitric oxide (NO) is a key regulator of platelet function, inhibiting both adhesion to the extracellular matrix and aggregation at sites ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.sciencedirect.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.e-enm.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.e-enm.org/journal/view.php?number=2371","title":"Cardiovascular Impact of Calcium and Vitamin D ...","snippet":"by F Zarzour \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 7 \u2014 This study concluded that high total calcium intake was associated with a decreased risk of atherosclerosis, specifically if this was achieved ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.e-enm.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/12/vitamin-d-supplement-deficiency-covid/","title":"I've researched vitamin D for decades.

Although vitamin D was once considered a miracle supplement effective against a range of chronic diseases, large randomized clinical trials, including the VITAL Study with nearly 26,000 participants, revealed no significant benefits for preventing cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression, or bone fractures. However, supplementation may be beneficial for specific groups, such as adults over 75, individuals with malabsorption conditions (e.g., Crohn's disease), people being treated for osteoporosis, and breastfed infants. Some research has shown that vitamin D may reduce inflammation, protect against telomere shortening, and lower the risk of autoimmune diseases and advanced cancer, but further studies are required before updating clinical guidelines. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine screening for vitamin D levels due to inconsistent evidence. For those concerned, dietary sources, fortified foods, and moderate sun exposure are usually sufficient. While it's tempting to rely on supplements, sustaining a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and physical activity is more effective in preventing chronic illnesses.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1662976823.312,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bac6e8c9148007aa5abab2c55d7633","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Fact-checking medical claims about calcium and clotting","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a55150c8eb7ae1-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"09281a5d-d840-4475-8471-f775400121ef","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"09281a5d-d840-4475-8471-f775400121ef","children":["27ddebd6-c8e9-4a77-8961-ea0df44e17c9"]},"27ddebd6-c8e9-4a77-8961-ea0df44e17c9":{"id":"27ddebd6-c8e9-4a77-8961-ea0df44e17c9","message":{"id":"27ddebd6-c8e9-4a77-8961-ea0df44e17c9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757071089.909087,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Refining sources","content":"I need to avoid using news outlets like NY Post and health.com for authoritative medical citations.

It exists in two primary forms: K1 (phylloquinone), found in green leafy vegetables, and K2 (menaquinone), produced by intestinal bacteria. Most people obtain adequate levels through diet, but newborns typically receive a vitamin K injection due to insufficient stores and absorption. Vitamin K aids in producing proteins necessary for blood clotting and is used to reverse the effects of anticoagulants during emergencies.\n\nAlthough some research suggests vitamin K may benefit bone strength and prevent vascular calcification linked to heart disease, evidence for its use in disease prevention remains inconclusive. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in adults but can occur due to conditions that impair fat absorption, such as cystic fibrosis or Crohn\u2019s disease. Deficiency symptoms include easy bruising, bleeding, and skin changes like petechiae.\n\nSupplements are usually only necessary for those at risk of deficiency or with absorption issues. Interactions with medications, especially blood thinners like warfarin, require careful monitoring of vitamin K intake. There are no known adverse effects from excessive vitamin K, and no tolerable upper limit has been established.

It is also thought to aid bone health and has been investigated for its potential role in preventing osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases, though evidence remains inconclusive. Deficiency in adults is rare but may occur in those with malabsorption disorders such as cystic fibrosis or Crohn's disease.\n\nInteractions between vitamin K and certain medications, particularly anticoagulants, necessitate monitoring intake closely.

It is derived from animal-based and fermented foods, and also produced by gut bacteria. Unlike vitamin K1, which is common in leafy greens and fruits, vitamin K2 is better absorbed and lasts longer in the blood. Newborns receive vitamin K at birth to prevent bleeding due to poor placental transfer. While there is evidence suggesting vitamin K2 may enhance bone mineral density and reduce fracture risks, findings are inconclusive. Vitamin K2's impact on heart health remains unclear, requiring further research. When considering supplements, choose third-party-tested products and consult healthcare providers. Vitamin K2 is generally safe, but consistent intake is crucial for those on anticoagulants. Vitamin K deficiency is rare, and most people meet their needs through diet.

Benefits include higher energy expenditure, reduced hunger, and lower blood sugar, triglycerides, and increased HDL (good cholesterol). However, the diet's high fat content, particularly from animal sources, may increase cardiovascular risks. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting the keto diet, especially for those on diabetes medication, to ensure balanced nutrition and monitor cholesterol levels.

Research shows that the keto diet can lead to weight loss and impact cholesterol levels variably, including increases in HDL (good) cholesterol and decreases in triglycerides, although mixed results have been observed for LDL (bad) cholesterol. \n\nStudies indicate that the type of fats consumed in the diet influences cholesterol outcomes; unsaturated fats are preferred over saturated fats to improve cholesterol levels. For those with specific genetic conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia, the keto diet may not be suitable.

The Mediterranean diet, rooted in the traditional eating patterns of Mediterranean countries, emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, healthy fats, moderate consumption of poultry, fish, dairy, and limited red meat and processed foods. It's associated with overall health benefits and is praised for its liberal and sustainable approach.\n\nConversely, the keto diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet, originally designed for epilepsy treatment. It focuses on meat, fish, cheese, eggs, oils, and low-carb vegetables while limiting high-carb foods. This diet can lead to rapid weight loss and improved blood sugar control but has drawbacks such as potential nutrient deficiencies and being difficult to maintain long-term.\n\nA recent study suggests that while both diets can lead to weight loss and better blood sugar control, the Mediterranean diet is superior for heart health, particularly in reducing LDL cholesterol. The Mediterranean diet also supports better nutrient intake and reduced inflammation.

It has been used in Japan since 1957 and is applied in various medical fields, such as dentistry and orthopedics, for reducing inflammation, pain, and post-operative swelling.\n\nResearch suggests serrapeptase may dissolve blood clots by breaking down non-living tissue and fibrin, improving circulation and reducing complications like stroke and vein inflammation. It may also enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics against biofilms, which are bacterial clusters resistant to treatment, thus aiding infection prevention. Additionally, serrapeptase helps in managing chronic respiratory diseases (such as COPD and pulmonary fibrosis) by thinning and clearing mucus.\n\nAvailable mainly in enteric-coated tablets, serrapeptase should be taken on an empty stomach, though there is no established standard dosage. While generally considered safe, it can interfere with blood clotting and interact with blood thinners and natural remedies like fish oil and turmeric. Side effects are typically mild, but its use should be discussed with a healthcare provider, especially for individuals with clotting disorders or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748509200.0,"attribution":"www.health.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bac6e8c9148007aa5abab2c55d7633","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for reviews on clot prevention supplements","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a55150c8eb7ae1-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"9249ab58-2acc-403d-9ee8-644ac9db2e8c","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9249ab58-2acc-403d-9ee8-644ac9db2e8c","children":["942453ee-36e9-48d2-99c5-57d734f9dcdd"]},"942453ee-36e9-48d2-99c5-57d734f9dcdd":{"id":"942453ee-36e9-48d2-99c5-57d734f9dcdd","message":{"id":"942453ee-36e9-48d2-99c5-57d734f9dcdd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757071168.09271,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Being cautious with supplements","content":"I see we must rely on high-quality sources, avoiding sources like case reports and relying more on reviews.

Conducted by researchers from the University of Vermont and presented at the American Heart Association's conference, the study involved over 15,000 middle-aged participants over roughly 20 years. Results revealed that those who watched TV \"very often\" had a 71% higher chance of developing blood clots compared to those who rarely watched. Among participants meeting the recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, frequent TV watchers were 80% more likely to develop blood clots. While obesity contributes partly to this risk, it accounts for only 25% of it, suggesting other factors are also responsible.

Key examples include cayenne pepper, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cranberries, aloe vera, dong quai, evening primrose oil, fish oil, ginkgo biloba, grape seed extract, melatonin, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vitamin E, nuts and seeds, and willow bark. These natural substances contain bioactive compounds like salicylates, coumarin, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols that may reduce platelet aggregation or interfere with clotting factors.\n\nThough many of these substances have shown promise in lab and animal studies, human research is limited, and their efficacy and safety are not fully established. Some can interact with prescription blood thinners such as warfarin and aspirin, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding. Therefore, natural blood thinners should not replace prescribed medications. Individuals considering their use should consult healthcare professionals to avoid adverse interactions and determine appropriate dosing. Additionally, leafy greens rich in vitamin K may counteract the effects of blood thinners and should be consumed in regulated quantities. Overall, natural blood thinners may offer health benefits beyond clot prevention but require careful and informed use.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1722030034.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.verywellhealth.com/anthocyanins-benefits-89522","title":"Do Anthocyanins Benefit Your Health?","snippet":"Anthocyanins, bioactive pigments found in numerous fruits and vegetables, are thought to offer several health benefits due to their antioxidant properties. Consuming a diet rich in anthocyanins may potentially decrease the risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and enhance cognitive function in older adults, as well as improve insulin resistance in diabetics. Despite these potential benefits, anthocyanin-rich foods' role in preventing or treating diseases is not fully established. Current studies indicate some promise in areas such as heart health, diabetes management, and cognitive function, but more comprehensive research is needed to verify these benefits conclusively. As a natural component of many foods, anthocyanins are generally considered safe, but supplements should be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Major dietary sources of anthocyanins include berries, grapes, and other deeply colored fruits and vegetables. For those considering supplements, it is essential to ensure that products are third-party tested and consult a healthcare provider prior to use.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1299683732.0,"attribution":"www.verywellhealth.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bac6e8c9148007aa5abab2c55d7633","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for reviews on polyphenols and vitamin C","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a55150c8eb7ae1-SIN","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"e6e364ed-9f9a-4b76-8faa-1037c25f34ba","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e6e364ed-9f9a-4b76-8faa-1037c25f34ba","children":["dd5271c0-0883-4075-9458-9f98b996d093"]},"dd5271c0-0883-4075-9458-9f98b996d093":{"id":"dd5271c0-0883-4075-9458-9f98b996d093","message":{"id":"dd5271c0-0883-4075-9458-9f98b996d093","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757071183.043023,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Checking vitamin D and K2 guidelines","content":"I\u2019ll avoid referring to sources like Verywell.
