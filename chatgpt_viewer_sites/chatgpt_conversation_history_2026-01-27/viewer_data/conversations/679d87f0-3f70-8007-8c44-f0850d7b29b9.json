(Remember: you must have the proper sharing permissions for the source folder. If the source isn\u2019t already in the user\u2019s Drive \u201cMy Drive,\u201d have the owner share it and \u201cAdd to My Drive\u201d before running this.) \n\nCopy the code below into a Colab notebook cell and modify the two path variables (`source_folder` and `destination_folder`) as needed:\n\n---\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Mount the user's Google Drive\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\n# ======== CONFIGURATION ==========\n# Set the absolute path to the source folder that you want to copy.\n# This should be a folder in your Google Drive (or one you have added to My Drive).\n# For example: '/content/drive/MyDrive/MySharedFolder'\nsource_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MySharedFolder'\n\n# Set the absolute path to the destination folder where you want to store the copy.\n# For example: '/content/drive/MyDrive/MyBackupFolder'\ndestination_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MyBackupFolder'\n# ===================================\n\n# Verify the source folder exists\nif not os.path.exists(source_folder):\n    raise ValueError(f\"Source folder not found: {source_folder}\")\n\n# Check if the destination folder already exists; if it does, alert the user.\nif os.path.exists(destination_folder):\n    print(f\"Destination folder already exists at {destination_folder}.\")\n    print(\"Delete or rename it if you want to run the copy again.\")\nelse:\n    # Copy the folder recursively.\n    print(f\"Copying from {source_folder} to {destination_folder} ...\")\n    shutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder)\n    print(\"Copy complete!\")\n\n# Optionally: Create a zip archive of the destination folder for local download.\n# This zip file is stored in the local Colab VM, then offered for download.\nimport subprocess\n\nzip_filename = 'BackupArchive.zip'\n# If a zip file with the same name exists, remove it.\nif os.path.exists(zip_filename):\n    os.remove(zip_filename)\n\nprint(f\"Zipping {destination_folder} into {zip_filename} ...\")\n# Using the zip command line tool available in Colab.\nsubprocess.run(['zip', '-r', zip_filename, os.path.basename(destination_folder)],\n               cwd=os.path.dirname(destination_folder),\n               check=True)\nprint(\"Zip archive created!\")\n\n# Provide a link for the user to download the zip file.\nfrom google.colab import files\nprint(\"Initiating download of the zip archive...\")\nfiles.download(zip_filename)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Mounting the Drive:**  \n   The script first mounts the user\u2019s Drive so that you can read from and write to it.\n\n2. **Copying the Folder:**  \n   Using Python\u2019s `shutil.copytree()`, the script makes a complete recursive copy of the source folder into a new folder in the user\u2019s own Drive. This copy is \u201chard\u201d in the sense that it is independent of the source. Even if the original folder is later deleted, the copy remains intact.\n\n3. **Zipping for Local Download:**  \n   The script then zips the destination folder. This zip file is created in the Colab runtime and then offered to the user for local download. (Keep in mind that if the folder is huge, zipping may take some time and you might hit runtime limits.)\n\n### A Few Brutally Honest Points\n\n- **Don\u2019t Overcomplicate:**  \n  This script does exactly what it says. There\u2019s no \u201cmagic\u201d here. If you don\u2019t have the proper access permissions or if your folder paths are wrong, you\u2019re going to get errors. Fix them first\u2014don\u2019t expect the script to forgive sloppy setup.\n\n- **Shared Folders:**  \n  If the folder you\u2019re copying was only shared with you (and not \u201cadded\u201d to your Drive), it might reside in the \u201cShared with me\u201d section. In that case, you need to right-click and select \u201cAdd shortcut to Drive\u201d or \u201cAdd to My Drive\u201d before running the script. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to specify an absolute path.\n\n- **Local Downloads are Finicky:**  \n  The download command (`files.download()`) should prompt your browser to save the file. In some cases (especially with very large archives), you may have to use alternative methods (like mounting and then copying to a local machine) or break your backup into smaller pieces.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Run the notebook cell, and your backup will be created and offered for download. No sugar-coating: set it up properly and it\u2019ll work as advertised.

The script is simply copying the files into their own drive, making a separate backup.\n- **Storage:** Make sure the recipient has enough storage space in their drive for the full copy.\n- **Script Adjustments:** The user will need to modify the script's path variables to point to their version of the folder (the shortcut location) and specify their desired destination folder.\n\nSo, in short, yes\u2014share your folder, have them add it to their drive, and then they can run a script like the one provided to back up and download your content."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"2503c999-ac66-48d7-94dc-20637d8c8c5b","request_id":"90ae903b18608210-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2503c999-ac66-48d7-94dc-20637d8c8c5b","children":["2e25dcd6-4bc9-451e-8ab3-044ab3895078"]},"2e25dcd6-4bc9-451e-8ab3-044ab3895078":{"id":"2e25dcd6-4bc9-451e-8ab3-044ab3895078","message":{"id":"2e25dcd6-4bc9-451e-8ab3-044ab3895078","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1738379771.216999,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Gotta noob question.

The command\n\n```python\nshutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder)\n```\n\nis what recursively copies the entire directory tree from the source to the destination. However, a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Destination Must Not Exist:**  \n   `shutil.copytree()` requires that `destination_folder` doesn't already exist. If it does, you'll get an error unless you handle it (or use Python 3.8+'s `dirs_exist_ok=True` option).\n\n2. **Permissions and Special Files:**  \n   It copies the files and directories, but if you have any special permissions or symbolic links, you might need to adjust parameters or handle those cases separately.\n\n3. **Large Directories:**  \n   For really large directories, be prepared for the process to take a while. The command doesn't provide progress updates, so you might want to add some logging or progress indication if needed.\n\nIn short: yes, that's the key command that does the heavy lifting. Just make sure your environment and error handling are in order, and you'll be good to go."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3-mini","default_model_slug":"o3-mini","parent_id":"9d745435-cec2-4595-b113-11340fc35c04","request_id":"90aee50229feeba2-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9d745435-cec2-4595-b113-11340fc35c04","children":[]}}}
