(You can install it via pip: `pip install yt-dlp`.)\n2. **Download the subtitles**:\n   - Use the following command to download English subtitles:\n     ```bash\n     yt-dlp --write-subs --sub-lang en --skip-download <video_url>\n     ```\n   - Replace `<video_url>` with the YouTube video URL.\n3. **Locate the subtitles**:\n   - The subtitles will be saved in the same folder as the downloaded file, typically in `.vtt` format.\n4. **Convert if necessary**:\n   - Convert `.vtt` to `.srt` or `.txt` if needed using online converters or text editors.\n\n### Method 4: Using Python Script\nIf you prefer automation:\n1. Install **`pytube`** or **`yt-dlp`** library:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytube\n   ```\n2. Use the following script:\n   ```python\n   from pytube import YouTube\n\n   # Replace with your YouTube URL\n   video_url = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example\"\n   yt = YouTube(video_url)\n\n   # Fetch English subtitles\n   captions = yt.captions.get_by_language_code('en')\n   if captions:\n       subtitles = captions.generate_srt_captions()\n       with open(\"subtitles.srt\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:\n           file.write(subtitles)\n       print(\"Subtitles saved as subtitles.srt\")\n   else:\n       print(\"No English subtitles available.\")\n   ```\nThis will download English subtitles if they exist.\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure subtitles are available and not autogenerated if you need high accuracy.\n- For personal use only: Avoid violating YouTube's terms of service."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"e4de0992-56fa-40e5-899a-234af21239c6","request_id":"8fa3d36fcd27fd14-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e4de0992-56fa-40e5-899a-234af21239c6","children":[]}}}
