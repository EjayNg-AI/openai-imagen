Courtesy Chang Hsien-yi\r\nTaipei, Taiwan\r\nCNN\r\n \u2014 \r\nIn January 1988, one of Taiwan\u2019s most senior nuclear engineers defected to the United States after passing crucial intelligence on a top-secret program that would alter the course of Taiwan\u2019s history.\r\n\r\nColonel Chang Hsien-yi was a leading figure in Taiwan\u2019s nuclear weapons project, a closely guarded secret between the 1960s and \u201880s, as Taipei raced to develop its first nuclear bomb to keep pace with China.\r\n\r\nHe was also a CIA informant.\r\n\r\nChang exposed Taiwan\u2019s secret nuclear program to the United States, its closest ally, passing intelligence that ultimately led the US to pressure Taiwan into shutting down the program \u2013 which proliferation experts say was near completion.\r\n\r\nWhile critics say he betrayed his homeland and undermined Taipei\u2019s ability to deter a possible Chinese invasion, Chang told CNN in a rare interview he still believes he made the right call.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no betrayal at all,\u201d he told CNN from his home in Idaho, where he settled with his family.\r\n\r\n\u201cI decided to provide information to the CIA because I think it was good for the people of Taiwan,\u201d said the 81-year-old. \u201cYes, there was political struggle between China and Taiwan, but developing any kind of deadly weapon was nonsense to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nChang\u2019s story bears similarities with that of Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli whistleblower who famously exposed his country\u2019s clandestine nuclear program to the world. But while Vanunu went public with his country\u2019s progress, Chang\u2019s whistle-blowing was done in secret and without any fanfare.\r\n\r\nTaiwan\u2019s nuclear ambitions\r\nIn 1964, just 15 years after the Chinese civil war ended with communist victory, leaving Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s nationalists controlling only Taiwan, Beijing successfully tested a nuclear weapon \u2013 deeply unsettling the government in Taipei which feared it could one day be used against the island.\r\n\r\nTaiwan's Kinmen islands lie just a few miles from the Chinese port city of Xiamen\r\nRelated article\r\nA China-Taiwan DMZ? Meet the Kinmen islanders who want a bridge, not a war\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Chiang launched a clandestine project to lay the technical groundwork for nuclear weapons development over the next seven years. The Chungshan Science Research Institute ran the project under the Defense Ministry, and it was there that Chang began working as an army captain a year later.\r\n\r\nHe was picked for advanced nuclear training, which would involve stints in the US. After studying physics and nuclear science in Taiwan, he attended Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nDespite Taipei\u2019s official statements that its nuclear research was only for peaceful purposes, Chang said students sent to the US were all aware of their true mission: learning skills for weapons development.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe know precisely \u2013 even though it\u2019s not in the written statement \u2013 we know what we are going to do, what kind of area we should concentrate on,\u201d Chang said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were kind of excited and trying to get the job done,\u201d he added. \u201cAll we did was focusing on the area they assigned us, we put all our efforts to do it, to learn as much as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile he was at Oak Ridge, Chang recalled, the CIA already had an interest in him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn 1969 or 1970, I remembered receiving a phone call,\u201d he said. The caller said he was \u201cwith a company and they are interested in the nuclear power business\u2026 they offered to take me out for lunch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt that time, I said I had no interest because I had a mission-oriented assignment. But I was not aware he was from the CIA; I only knew that after quite a few years.\u201d\r\n\r\nChiang Kai-shek first launched a project to lay the groundwork for nuclear weapons development in the 1960s.\r\nChiang Kai-shek first launched a project to lay the groundwork for nuclear weapons development in the 1960s. Archive Photos/Getty Images\r\nAmerican suspicions\r\nIn 1977, a year after attaining a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Chang returned to Taiwan. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and spearheaded the development of computer codes for simulating nuclear explosions at the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER), a national laboratory that covertly advanced weapons development under civilian pretenses.\r\n\r\nTaiwanese leaders faced a delicate balancing act: the United States strongly opposed new nuclear weapons programs anywhere in the world, and Taipei could not afford to alienate its most crucial ally. The US has long relied on nuclear deterrence as part of its broader strategy to counter China\u2019s stockpiling of nuclear warheads. But, under a policy of nonproliferation, it opposes any country newly developing nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nThe flags of Taiwan and Honduras flutter in the wind outside the Taiwan Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras March 15, 2023. REUTERS/Fredy Rodriguez\r\nRelated article\r\nChina thinks it\u2019s diplomatically isolating Taiwan. It isn\u2019t\r\n\r\nBack then, Taiwan was not the wealthy and vibrant democracy it is today. It was a developing economy under the autocratic rule of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. That regime continued to hold a seat at the United Nations until 1971, and maintained formal diplomatic relations with the United States until 1979.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the risk of its nuclear ambitions being exposed, the island only sought to secretly establish the capability to produce nukes quickly at any time, but not build a stockpile.\r\n\r\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s cover stories were unbelievably good,\u201d said David Albright, a nuclear proliferation expert and author of \u201cTaiwan\u2019s Former Nuclear Weapons Program: Nuclear Weapons On-Demand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey always emphasized that the research was only for civil purposes\u2026 (US) officials didn\u2019t know how to breach this cover story.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the risk of a cross-strait nuclear conflagration weighed on Chang. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who assumed power in 1978, warned that if Taiwan acquired nuclear weapons, China would respond with force.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think they\u2019re quite serious,\u201d Chang added. \u201cI believed in that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have any conflict in any way with mainland China,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing any kind of deadly chemical or nuclear weapons\u2026 it\u2019s nonsense to me. I believe we are all Chinese and that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo when CIA agents approached Chang again during a trip to the United States in 1980, he agreed to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We know you, and we\u2019re interested in you,\u2019 and we had a conversation,\u201d Chang said, adding that the Americans put him through a \u201cvery thorough\u201d lie-detector test to ensure he was not a double agent. He assisted the CIA with some ad hoc tasks before becoming an informant in 1984.\r\n\r\nChang at his former home in Taiwan in 1979 with his daughter, Ann.\r\nChang at his former home in Taiwan in 1979 with his daughter, Ann. Courtesy Chang Hsien-yi\r\nFor the next four years a CIA case officer, identified only as \u201cMark,\u201d met with Chang every few months at safehouses around Taipei, including a condo near Shilin Night Market \u2013 one of the island\u2019s most famous street food destinations.\r\n\r\nIn those meetings, the CIA asked him to corroborate intelligence, share information about recent projects at INER, and take photos of sensitive documents.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll those conversations were quite professional. He would take a pencil and notebook to write down my answers,\u201d Chang said. \u201cHe kept saying that they will try their best to keep me and my family safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl disaster in 1986, a catastrophic nuclear accident in Ukraine that exposed hundreds of thousands of people to harmful radiation, solidified Chang\u2019s conviction that halting Taiwan\u2019s nuclear weapons program was imperative.\r\n\r\nThat same year, Vanunu publicly exposed details of Israel\u2019s clandestine nuclear program, handing what he new to the British media and causing an international sensation. He was later kidnapped by Mossad agents, returned to Israel and prosecuted, spending years in prison.\r\n\r\nA new chapter of life\r\nChang\u2019s life \u2013 and those of his wife and three children \u2013 took a dramatic turn in January 1988, when the CIA exfiltrated them to the US.\r\n\r\nBy then, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration had amassed sufficient evidence and seized the opportunity created by the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo \u2013 Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s son \u2013 to pressure his reformist successor Lee Teng-hui into cooperation.\r\n\r\nDirector Lo Ging-zim working on a scene in Taiwanese TV series \"Zero Day.\"\r\nRelated article\r\nTaiwan is making a TV show about a Chinese invasion. And it\u2019s hitting close to home\r\n\r\nAlbright, the expert and author, said Chang was the most crucial informant in arming Washington to shut down the Taiwanese program.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe United States had been in a cat-and-mouse game with Taiwan over its nuclear program for years,\u201d he said. \u201cChang really made sure the US had heavy evidence that Taiwan couldn\u2019t deny\u2026 and directly confront the Taiwanese.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the months after Chang\u2019s departure, the US sent specialists to dismantle a plutonium separation plant \u2013 a facility designed to extract nuclear materials for weapons production. The team also oversaw the removal of heavy water, a substance used as a coolant in nuclear reactors, and irradiated fuel, nuclear fuel that can be reprocessed to extract materials for nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nChang was declared a wanted person in Taiwan. The arrest warrant expired in 2000, but he has never returned to the island, telling CNN he was unsure how he would be received. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office and defense ministry declined to comment when approached by CNN.\r\n\r\nHero or traitor?\r\nTo date, Chang\u2019s decision to work with the CIA has remained controversial in Taiwan, which in the intervening years has continued its massive industrial and economic expansion, becoming a full democracy in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nBut cross-strait hostilities persist. Taipei has come under growing military pressure from China, which now has the world\u2019s largest military and is becoming more assertive in its territorial claims over Taiwan. The Chinese communist Party has vowed to take Taiwan by force if needed, despite having never controlled it.\r\n\r\nBeijing dwarves Taiwan\u2019s military, spending about 13 times more on defense. Some have argued that if Taiwan had successfully acquired nuclear weapons it could have served as an ultimate deterrent \u2013 paralleling Ukraine, where Russia might not have invaded if Kyiv had retained its Soviet era nuclear arsenal instead of giving it up.\r\n\r\nChang shopping with his wife in Washington DC after his defection from Taiwan.\r\nChang shopping with his wife in Washington DC after his defection from Taiwan. Courtesy Chang Hsien-yi\r\nSome Taiwanese have criticized Chang, saying he overstepped by deciding unilaterally that the island is better off without a nuclear deterrent.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe he is a traitor,\u201d said Alexander Huang, an associate professor in strategic studies at Tamkang University, because the weapons \u201cwould be seen as a useful tool in bargaining for a better diplomatic result\u201d with Beijing.\r\n\r\nBut Su Tzu-yun, a director of Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said the lack of a nuclear option has not overly affected Taiwan\u2019s modern defense capabilities, because precision ammunition can be used to achieve similar objectives to those of tactical nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Taiwanese government back then thought that if China landed in Taiwan, it could use tactical nuclear weapons to eliminate the landing troops,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in their absence, we can also employ precision weapons like missiles to replace them.\u201d\r\n\r\nNUEVA ECIJA, PHILIPPINES - APRIL 13: US and Philippine troops fire a Javelin anti-tank weapon system during the 'Balikatan' or 'shoulder-to-shoulder' US-Philippines joint military exercises in Fort Magsaysay on April 13, 2023 in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. More than 17,000 Philippine and US soldiers started their largest joint military exercise yet, known as 'Balikatan' or 'shoulder-to-shoulder,' which includes live-fire drills at sea, as the two nations strengthen defence ties amid shared concerns about China's assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. The joint military exercises took place as China completed three days of war games around Taiwan, coinciding with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's visit to the United States. \r\nRelated article\r\nA weapons stockpile and asymmetric warfare: how Taiwan could thwart an invasion by China \u2013 with America\u2019s help\r\n\r\nTaiwan buys these weapons from the US, which \u2013 despite shutting down the nuclear program \u2013 remains its key military partner, supplying ammunition, training, and defense systems.\r\n\r\nBesides weaponry, the island has what some consider a more effective deterrent than nuclear bombs. In 1987 \u2013 just one year before the nuclear program was shut down \u2013 tech entrepreneur Morris Chang founded the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which now produces an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced semiconductor chips for tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia.\r\n\r\nThe island\u2019s integral role in the global semiconductor supply chain, some observers say, would be enough to deter China from launching an invasion, forming what is dubbed its \u201cSilicon Shield.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbright, who conducted extensive research into the Taiwanese program, also said its success would not have been beneficial to Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think [it] would have raised the military risk of a Chinese attack,\u201d he said, while Washington could have also responded by \u201creducing its security commitment or limiting military aid\u201d once Taiwan\u2019s capabilities were known.\r\n\r\nAs for Chang Hsien-yi, who became a Christian and enjoyed playing golf outside a part-time role at a nuclear safety consultancy firm, the decision he made four decades ago was correct.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s good for the Taiwanese people. At least [we] didn\u2019t provoke mainland China in a such way to start an aggressive war against Taiwan,\u201d Chang said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did it with my conscience clear, there is no betrayal \u2013 at least not to myself.\u201d\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"dictation":false,"request_id":"91a201f13b0a9f95-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ccf860ff-7d2e-4076-b8dd-f9daa8db1ae5","children":["134321fe-4367-4c0c-858a-285ecb20ff55"]},"134321fe-4367-4c0c-858a-285ecb20ff55":{"id":"134321fe-4367-4c0c-858a-285ecb20ff55","message":{"id":"134321fe-4367-4c0c-858a-285ecb20ff55","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740930196.424258,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"8d1cc2ef-277b-469a-9de7-9ebf5419017c","request_id":"91a201f13b0a9f95-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8d1cc2ef-277b-469a-9de7-9ebf5419017c","children":["1634f049-298d-465a-8ed8-6d4365109c57"]},"1634f049-298d-465a-8ed8-6d4365109c57":{"id":"1634f049-298d-465a-8ed8-6d4365109c57","message":{"id":"1634f049-298d-465a-8ed8-6d4365109c57","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740930184.478267,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here are the key points from the article and a comprehensive analysis of the geopolitical ramifications, past, present, and future:\n\n---\n\n## Key Points from the Article:\n\n- **Chang Hsien-yi**, a senior Taiwanese nuclear engineer, was a CIA informant who defected to the U.S. in 1988 after revealing details of Taiwan\u2019s secret nuclear weapons program.\n- **Taiwan's Nuclear Ambitions**: Initiated covertly in the 1960s by Chiang Kai-shek, Taiwan aimed to develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent against China following China\u2019s successful nuclear test in 1964.\n- **CIA Intervention**: Chang, deeply involved in nuclear weapons research, began secretly informing the CIA in 1984. His intelligence enabled the U.S. to pressure Taiwan into dismantling its nuclear weapons program, just as it was nearing completion.\n- **US-Taiwan Dynamics**: The U.S., enforcing global nonproliferation policies, successfully leveraged diplomatic pressure to end Taiwan\u2019s nuclear ambitions, using Chang\u2019s revelations as critical leverage.\n- **Controversial Legacy**: In Taiwan, Chang remains controversial. Some see him as a traitor who undermined national security, while others consider his actions a pragmatic choice that averted severe conflict with China.\n- **Alternative Deterrents**: The article highlights Taiwan's transition to a strategy based on advanced conventional weapons (such as precision-guided missiles) and economic deterrence (the so-called \"Silicon Shield\" via Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\u2019s critical global role).\n\n---\n\n## Geopolitical Ramifications:\n\n### Past Ramifications:\n\n1. **Stability vs. National Pride**:\n   - Chang\u2019s defection significantly shaped Taiwan\u2019s national security strategy by removing the nuclear option, leading Taiwan to rely heavily on the U.S. security umbrella rather than an independent nuclear deterrent.\n\n2. **US-Taiwan-China Triangular Relationship**:\n   - By curtailing Taiwan\u2019s nuclear ambitions, the U.S. maintained its broader non-proliferation goals and avoided antagonizing China unnecessarily at a sensitive geopolitical moment (late Cold War period and the post-normalization of US-China relations in 1979).\n   - It reinforced Taiwan\u2019s dependence on U.S. military aid and diplomatic protection, enhancing American influence over Taiwan\u2019s strategic decisions.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Direct Conflict**:\n   - Chang\u2019s disclosure likely prevented a potential military escalation or even preemptive strikes by China, who openly threatened force if Taiwan became nuclear-armed.\n\n---\n\n### Present Ramifications:\n\n1. **Heightened Vulnerability**:\n   - Without nuclear weapons, Taiwan faces greater perceived vulnerability amid escalating Chinese military aggression and threats of forceful reunification. The military gap continues to widen, with China significantly outspending Taiwan militarily.\n\n2. **U.S.-Taiwan Strategic Ambiguity**:\n   - Taiwan continues to depend heavily on U.S. strategic ambiguity and military support. The lack of nuclear weapons means Taiwan's security largely hinges on U.S. assurances, leading to constant uncertainty regarding the reliability and extent of American support, especially during diplomatic tensions.\n\n3. **Taiwan\u2019s \u201cSilicon Shield\u201d**:\n   - Economic and technological capabilities, specifically Taiwan's dominance in semiconductor manufacturing (TSMC), currently serve as a non-military deterrent against Chinese invasion, given global economic interdependence on Taiwan\u2019s technological output.\n\n4. **Ongoing Domestic Debate**:\n   - The narrative around Chang\u2019s decision reflects broader ideological divides within Taiwan over autonomy, national defense, and relations with China. The tension between nationalist perspectives favoring stronger deterrents and pragmatic approaches focusing on diplomacy and economic integration continues to influence Taiwanese politics.\n\n---\n\n### Future Ramifications:\n\n1. **Emergence of New Strategic Calculus**:\n   - The strategic balance across the Taiwan Strait will likely continue to shift toward China's favor, potentially increasing pressure within Taiwan to reconsider nuclear or advanced asymmetric capabilities despite historical precedents.\n\n2. **Potential U.S. Recalibration**:\n   - Given growing U.S.-China rivalry, Taiwan\u2019s future security posture could significantly change if U.S. policy moves towards clearer commitments. The nuclear nonproliferation stance remains firm, but increasing Chinese threats might force reconsideration or increased conventional arms sales, altering the geopolitical status quo.\n\n3. **Technological Deterrence as Geopolitical Leverage**:\n   - Taiwan\u2019s global economic importance, specifically in semiconductors, may continue to act as a major geopolitical lever. However, it could also become a flashpoint if China perceives capturing or controlling these assets outweighs the global economic fallout.\n\n4. **Increased Regional Arms Race**:\n   - As China\u2019s military capabilities expand, Taiwan and regional powers (Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines) may pursue stronger military build-ups or regional alliances to counterbalance China\u2019s dominance, increasing the potential for geopolitical instability in East Asia.\n\n5. **Impact of Historical Precedent**:\n   - Chang\u2019s legacy might reinforce skepticism toward nuclear development, but the opposite could also occur\u2014future Taiwanese leaders, fearing abandonment by international allies, might reconsider nuclear options, especially if deterrence through conventional weapons or economic ties weakens.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nChang Hsien-yi\u2019s revelation was historically pivotal, shaping Taiwan\u2019s contemporary security framework and influencing geopolitical dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region. His actions reinforced U.S. regional influence, temporarily reduced cross-strait conflict potential, and ushered Taiwan into a dependency-based defense model primarily reliant on economic and technological deterrence.\n\nLooking forward, Taiwan\u2019s position remains precarious. Continued geopolitical shifts, particularly the rise of China and changing U.S. foreign policy priorities, mean Taiwan\u2019s strategic decisions made decades ago will profoundly shape the trajectory of East Asian geopolitical stability in the coming decades."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"134321fe-4367-4c0c-858a-285ecb20ff55","request_id":"91a201f13b0a9f95-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"134321fe-4367-4c0c-858a-285ecb20ff55","children":[]}}}
