The panelists discussed how they plan to replace humans at all levels in the scientific process. So I stood up and protested that what they are doing is evil. Look around you, I said. The room is filled with researchers of various kinds, most of them young. They are here because they love research and want to contribute to advancing human knowledge. If you take the human out of the loop, meaning that humans no longer have any role in scientific research, you're depriving them of the activity they love and a key source of meaning in their lives. And we all want to do something meaningful. Why, I asked, do you want to take the opportunity to contribute to science away from us?\r\n\r\nMy question changed the course of the panel, and set the tone for the rest of the discussion. Afterwards, a number of attendees came up to me, either to thank me for putting what they felt into words, or to ask if I really meant what I said. So I thought I would return to the question here.\r\n\r\nOne of the panelists asked whether I would really prefer the joy of doing science to finding a cure for cancer and enabling immortality. I answered that we will eventually cure cancer and at some point probably be able to choose immortality. Science is already making great progress with humans at the helm. We'll get fusion power and space travel some day as well. Maybe cutting humans out of the loop could speed up this process, but I don't think it would be worth it. I think it is of crucial importance that we humans are in charge of our own progress. Expanding humanity's collective knowledge is, I think, the most meaningful thing we can do. If humans could not usefully contribute to science anymore, this would be a disaster. So, no. I do not think it worth it to find a cure for cancer faster if that means we can never do science again.\r\n\r\nMany of those who came up to talk to me last night, those who asked me whether I was being serious or just trolling, thought that the premise was absurd. Of course there would always be room for humans in science. There will always be tasks only humans can do, insight only humans have, and so on. Therefore, we should welcome AI. Research is hard, and we need all the help we can get. I responded that I hoped they were right. That is, I truly hope there will always be parts of the research process which humans will be essential for. But what I was arguing against was not what we might call \"weak science automation\", where humans stay in the loop in important roles, but \"strong science automation\", where humans are redundant.\r\n\r\nOthers thought it was immature to argue about this, because full science automation is not on the horizon. Again, I hope they are right. But I see no harm in discussing it now. And I certainly don't think we need research on science automation to go any further.\r\n\r\nYet others remarked that this was a pointless argument. Science automation is coming whether we want it or not, and we'd better get used to it. The train is coming, and we can get on it or stand in its way. I think that is a remarkably cowardly argument. It is up to us as a society to decide how we use the technology we develop. It's not a train, it's a truck, and we'd better grab the steering wheel.\r\n\r\nOne of the panelists made a chess analogy, arguing that lots of people play chess even though computers are now much better than humans at chess. So we might engage in science as a kind of hobby, even though the real science is done by computers. We would be playing around far from the frontier, perhaps filling in the blanks that AI systems don't care about. That was, to put it mildly, not a satisfying answer. While I love games, I certainly do not consider game-playing as meaningful as advancing human knowledge. Thanks, but no thanks. \r\n\r\nOverall, though, it was striking that most of those I talked to thanked me for raising the point, as I articulated worries that they already had. One of them remarked that if you work on automating science and are not even a little bit worried about the end goal, you are a psychopath. I would add that another possibility is that you don't really believe in what you are doing.\r\n\r\nSome might ask why I make this argument about science and not, for example, about visual art, music, or game design. That's because yesterday's event was about AI for science. But I think the same argument applies to all domains of human creative and intellectual expression. Making human intellectual or creative work redundant is something we should avoid when we can, and we should absolutely avoid it if there are no equally meaningful new roles for humans to transition into.\r\n\r\nYou could further argue that working on cutting humans out of meaningful creative work such as scientific research is incredibly egoistic. You get the intellectual satisfaction of inventing new AI methods, but the next generation don't get a chance to contribute. Why do you want to rob your children (academic and biological) of the chance to engage in the most meaningful activity in the world?\r\n\r\nSo what do I believe in, given that I am an AI researcher who actively works on the kind of AI methods used for automating science? I believe that AI tools that help us be more productive and creative are great, but that AI tools that replace us are bad. I love science, and I am afraid of a future where we are pushed back into the dark ages because we can no longer contribute to science. Human agency, including in creative processes, is vital and must be safeguarded at almost any cost.\r\n\r\nI don't exactly know how to steer AI development and AI usage so that we get new tools but are not replaced. But I know that it is of paramount importance."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"1ee4611f-9248-4617-bcd6-bc85c6811e4f","message_source":null,"turn_exchange_id":"75eeedc4-a08d-4f4f-afd4-a0c32d42acc9"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"097724ad-d0eb-453f-9f64-e91c31e41711","children":["761427dc-c759-4c8e-87c3-75185b768fb2"]},"761427dc-c759-4c8e-87c3-75185b768fb2":{"id":"761427dc-c759-4c8e-87c3-75185b768fb2","message":{"id":"761427dc-c759-4c8e-87c3-75185b768fb2","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765418025.424298,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"rebase_developer_message":true,"request_id":"1ee4611f-9248-4617-bcd6-bc85c6811e4f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"dd426330-d4cf-4091-a20d-487709a3d28f","turn_exchange_id":"75eeedc4-a08d-4f4f-afd4-a0c32d42acc9","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dd426330-d4cf-4091-a20d-487709a3d28f","children":["8d85823f-a51e-4c43-ac09-19e25bdd3fda"]},"8d85823f-a51e-4c43-ac09-19e25bdd3fda":{"id":"8d85823f-a51e-4c43-ac09-19e25bdd3fda","message":{"id":"8d85823f-a51e-4c43-ac09-19e25bdd3fda","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765418025.4302156,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"is_contextual_answers_system_message":true,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","contextual_answers_message_type":"sources_and_filters_prompt","request_id":"1ee4611f-9248-4617-bcd6-bc85c6811e4f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"761427dc-c759-4c8e-87c3-75185b768fb2","turn_exchange_id":"75eeedc4-a08d-4f4f-afd4-a0c32d42acc9"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"761427dc-c759-4c8e-87c3-75185b768fb2","children":["1acc0da1-31be-4cd6-a56e-0568ab768f69"]},"1acc0da1-31be-4cd6-a56e-0568ab768f69":{"id":"1acc0da1-31be-4cd6-a56e-0568ab768f69","message":{"id":"1acc0da1-31be-4cd6-a56e-0568ab768f69","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1765418026.192946,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Analyzing post on automation in science","content":"The user seeks an in-depth analysis of Julian Togelius\u2019 post on automation in science.

What he\u2019s actually arguing\n\nStrip away the rhetoric and we get a few core claims:\n\n1. **Meaning from doing vs meaning from outcomes**  \n   - Human beings (especially researchers) derive deep meaning from *doing* science: struggling with questions, forming hypotheses, designing experiments, proving theorems, etc.  \n   - A future where AI systems handle the entire scientific pipeline, and humans are essentially spectators, is a future where this meaning disappears for many people.\n\n2. **\u201cStrong science automation\u201d is the target**  \n   He explicitly distinguishes:\n   - **Weak science automation**: AI as tool / copilot, humans still essential for key parts of the research process.\n   - **Strong science automation**: humans are no longer *needed* anywhere in the scientific loop; the frontier is run entirely by machines. Humans may do \u201chobby science\u201d far from the frontier, like amateurs playing chess while Stockfish is miles ahead.\n\n   His claim: **strong science automation is evil** and should not be pursued.\n\n3. **He rejects the \u201cbut cures!\u201d tradeoff**  \n   One panelist offers a classic utilitarian move:  \n   > Would you really prefer the joy of doing science to curing cancer or enabling immortality?\n\n   His answer:\n   - We\u2019re already making progress with humans at the helm; we\u2019ll get cancer cures, fusion, space travel eventually.\n   - Speeding that up by removing humans from the loop is not worth the cost of losing our ability to *meaningfully* contribute to science.\n   - In his words: *\u201cI do not think it worth it to find a cure for cancer faster if that means we can never do science again.\u201d*\n\n   That is a **strong deontological** stance: there are things we must not sacrifice, even for huge gains.\n\n4. **He refuses techno-determinism (\u201cthe train is coming anyway\u201d)**  \n   He calls \u201cit\u2019s coming whether we want it or not\u201d a cowardly argument.  \n   - Technology is not a runaway train; it is a truck and we can grab the steering wheel.  \n   - Society can choose which lines of research to fund, encourage, or outright ban.\n\n5. **He rejects the chess analogy**  \n   - Panelist: computers surpassed humans in chess, yet people still play.\n   - Togelius: doing science as a \u201chobby\u201d while AI does the \u201creal science\u201d is not acceptable; **advancing human knowledge is not comparable to a game**.  \n   - The key: he\u2019s not content with humans playing in sandbox science while the actual frontier belongs to AI.\n\n6. **He universalises the concern beyond science**  \n   He says the same logic applies to art, music, game design, any domain of creative/intellectual work:  \n   - **We should avoid making human creative and intellectual activity redundant** unless we can offer genuinely equally meaningful new roles.\n\n7. **His own stance as an AI scientist**  \n   - He works on AI methods used for automating science.\n   - He draws a line: **AI that augments human creativity = good; AI that replaces humans = bad.**\n   - And he pushes the urgency: *\u201cHuman agency\u2026 must be safeguarded at almost any cost.\u201d*  \n   - He admits he doesn\u2019t know exactly how to steer development, but insists that steering is morally necessary.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What is emotionally going on here?\n\nThis is not a dry policy memo; it\u2019s a grief-speech in rational clothes.\n\nYou can feel:\n\n- **Existential anxiety**: \u201cWill there be a meaningful role for humans at the frontier of knowledge in 30\u201350 years?\u201d\n- **Professional generational fear**: Not just \u201cwill my job be automated?\u201d but \u201cwill the next generation have this vocation at all?\u201d\n- **Moral disgust at certain research goals**: He literally calls it \u201cevil\u201d to aim at cutting humans out of science.\n\nThat\u2019s why people came up to him afterwards saying \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cwere you serious?\u201d He\u2019s articulating a submerged fear that many people have but are not willing to say out loud at NeurIPS.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Strengths of his position\n\n### 3.1. He correctly foregrounds *meaning*, not just capability\n\nMost public debates about AI in science are:\n\n- \u201cCan it beat us at X?\u201d\n- \u201cWill it cure cancer faster?\u201d\n- \u201cHow much GDP will it add?\u201d\n\nHe brings in a different axis:\n\n> \u201cWhat does it do to human lives if one of the most profound kinds of meaningful activity is no longer needed?\u201d\n\nThis is not trivial. Hannah Arendt, Karl Marx, and modern philosophers of work would all recognise this as a central question: **how does technology transform the space of meaningful human activity?**\n\n### 3.2. He is right to attack naive techno-determinism\n\nThe \u201ctrain is coming anyway\u201d line is intellectually lazy:\n\n- Research directions are chosen.\n- Funding is allocated.\n- Norms are written.\n- If we treat everything as inevitable, it becomes a self-fulfilling abdication of responsibility.\n\nHis \u201cit\u2019s not a train, it\u2019s a truck\u201d metaphor is on point: the fact that something is technically possible does not mean it is morally mandatory.\n\n### 3.3. He is right that *full* automation would be a qualitatively different world\n\nIf you take the strong scenario seriously:\n\n- Autonomous AI systems generate hypotheses, run experiments (in silico or via robotic labs), design follow-up experiments, formulate new theory, refine it, publish to each other, and iterate.\n- Humans *cannot* significantly improve anything at that frontier; at best we read simplified explanations and implement downstream engineering.\n\nThat world **really is qualitatively different** from: \u201cI have Python, Mathematica, and ChatGPT as powerful tools, but ultimately I\u2019m still the one doing the work.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re someone whose primary identity is \u201cscientist\u201d or \u201cmathematician\u201d, that difference is not abstract. It\u2019s existential.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Where his argument is weak or at least contestable\n\nNow the more critical part.\n\n### 4.1. He bakes in a false binary\n\nHe implicitly frames the choice as:\n\n- Either: humans remain necessary at the frontier of science forever.\n- Or: AI replaces us entirely, we never again \u201cdo real science\u201d.\n\nIn reality, there are many intermediate regimes:\n\n- AI does 90% of the detailed search and simulation; humans mostly set goals, define constraints, interpret consequences, and decide what is worth exploring.\n- Different fields bifurcate: some become mostly machine-run (e.g. search in large chemical spaces), others remain deeply human (e.g. conceptual frameworks, mathematics with heavy human aesthetic and conceptual choice).\n- The frontier becomes **sociotechnical**: humans + AI systems form joint epistemic communities, with non-trivial human contribution even if machines handle most micro-steps.\n\nHe *does* mention \u201cweak science automation\u201d, but he treats strong automation as a coherent, reachable endpoint, and then argues as if we must choose whether to aim for that endpoint or not.\n\nIn practice, the frontier will likely be messy, patchy, and value-laden: even if full automation is technically possible, we can shape institutional norms so that **some key functions must remain human-led**.\n\n### 4.2. The \u201ccure cancer vs joy of science\u201d framing oversimplifies the ethical trade\n\nHe says:\n\n> It is not worth curing cancer faster if it means we can never do science again.\n\nThat can be unpacked in several ways:\n\n- If \u201cfaster\u201d means 5\u201310 years vs 50\u2013100 years, and the cost is truly the permanent loss of human scientific agency, you can argue his way.  \n- But if \u201cfaster\u201d means \u201cmillions fewer people die young\u201d, the moral calculus is not trivial.\n\nThis is **a conflict between**:\n\n- A *deontological* constraint: \u201cDo not destroy human agency in core domains of meaning.\u201d\n- A *consequentialist* imperative: \u201cPrevent enormous suffering and death if you can.\u201d\n\nHe declares, basically, that the first trumps the second. That is a defensible moral view, but far from obviously correct. A lot of people (especially outside elite research communities) might disagree:\n\n> \u201cI do not care whether a small subset of humans can still experience the joy of frontier science, if the alternative is my child dying of cancer.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t really engage this counter-intuition; he just asserts his own.\n\n### 4.3. He assumes \u201cdoing frontier science\u201d is *the* most meaningful activity\n\nHe explicitly says:\n\n> \u201cExpanding humanity\u2019s collective knowledge is\u2026 the most meaningful thing we can do.\u201d\n\nFor many researchers, that feels true. For humanity as a whole, that\u2019s a value judgement, not a fact.\n\n- Some people find deepest meaning in parenting, care work, activism, art, community building, or spiritual pursuits.\n- A world where frontier science is mostly automated but human lives are longer, healthier, and freer might *increase* the available space for other forms of meaning.\n\nHe does briefly mention \u201cequally meaningful new roles\u201d, but there is an implicit hierarchy: for him, science obviously sits at the top. That is not universal.\n\n### 4.4. He underplays transformation vs extinction of roles\n\nHistory of technology is full of:\n\n- **De-skilling**: typesetters, slide rule calculators, many manual crafts.\n- **Re-skilling**: new roles that did not exist before (software engineer, data scientist, bioinformatician, climate modeler).\n\nStrong science automation might:\n\n- Eliminate the \u201chand-to-hand\u201d experimental or computational labour at the frontier.\n- But increase the salience of:\n  - Framing questions.\n  - Choosing which problems matter.\n  - Interpreting and integrating machine-produced findings into human values and institutions.\n  - Designing *constraints* and *objectives* for scientific AI agents.\n\nHe seems to assume that once machines can in principle do everything, they will in practice do everything **and** we will cede all meaningful agency. That\u2019s not a logical inevitability; it is a socio-political choice.\n\n### 4.5. His rhetoric risks alienating allies\n\nWords like \u201cevil\u201d, \u201cpsychopath\u201d, \u201ccowardly\u201d are emotionally understandable, but strategically risky:\n\n- They can push pragmatic researchers (who might otherwise agree on many concerns) into defensive mode.\n- They also make his position sound more absolutist than it is in substance.  \n\nThe core concern \u2014 **\u201chow do we preserve human agency and meaning in a world of extremely capable AI?\u201d** \u2014 is important and widely shareable. Framing some researchers as \u201cpsychopaths\u201d for not being worried enough hardens the lines unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The chess analogy deserves a subtler treatment\n\nHe dismisses \u201cwe\u2019ll play hobby science like chess\u201d as unsatisfying. That\u2019s visceral and I get it.\n\nBut there are two deeper questions hidden here:\n\n1. **Do we require being at the absolute frontier to find meaning?**  \n   Most chess players are nowhere near grandmaster level. They still find immense satisfaction.  \n   By analogy: even if AI systems establish the ultimate state-of-the-art in some fields, human-level exploration of \u201clower frontiers\u201d could still be rich and meaningful.\n\n2. **Is \u201cscience as game\u201d necessarily trivial?**  \n   You can imagine human \u201cscience gameplay\u201d worlds:\n   - Interactive theorem proving where humans explore ideas with powerful AI, not caring whether the AI \u201calready knows\u201d them.\n   - Science-as-art: constructing elegant but non-frontier theories, proofs, or models, prized for aesthetic and conceptual beauty more than novelty.\n\nIt might *feel* insulting from a current research-identity point of view, but from a post-scarcity, post-AGI (artificial general intelligence) viewpoint, \u201cscience as collaborative creative play\u201d might be a perfectly legitimate form of meaning.\n\nHe is really defending the **status of professional frontier scientist**, not just the activity of doing anything \u201cscience-like\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 6. What to do with his core intuition\n\nDespite all the critiques, I think his central intuition is extremely important:\n\n> \u201cHuman agency in creative and intellectual domains must be safeguarded, and that constraint should shape technical and policy choices around AI.\u201d\n\nHow could that translate into concrete directions?\n\n- **Institutional norms**:  \n  - Require that key steps in high-stakes scientific decision-making (e.g. which lines to pursue, which interventions to deploy) are human-deliberated, even if AI proposed them.\n  - Preserve human-led evaluation committees for major scientific directions.\n- **Technical design**:  \n  - Build AI scientific systems to be *assistants* by default: explanation-first, suggestion-first, queryable, configurable.\n  - Resist fully closed-loop research agents that self-direct without meaningful human oversight.\n- **Educational and career design**:  \n  - Train future scientists to be *epistemic pilots* in AI-rich environments: skilled in guiding, interrogating, auditing AI systems, not merely competing with them on brute-force reasoning.\n\nThese paths acknowledge that automation is coming, but aim for **co-evolution** rather than **replacement**.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Where I think a sharper version of his view lands\n\nA more defensible, less absolutist reading of his position could be:\n\n1. We should **treat human agency and meaningful work as protected values**, not just side-effects.\n2. We should **avoid architectures and institutions whose *purpose* is to make humans epistemically redundant** in core domains like science.\n3. We should **deliberately steer toward AI-augmented, human-led science**, even if that means rejecting some technically possible acceleration paths.\n4. We should **start this steering now**, not after \u201cfull automation\u201d appears on the horizon.\n\nUnder that formulation, he\u2019s not saying:\n\n> \u201cNever use AI for science if it\u2019s too strong.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s saying:\n\n> \u201cNever build or normalise systems whose justification is that humans no longer matter at the frontier.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you want, we can next:\n\n- Stress-test his position specifically in *mathematics*:  \n  e.g. suppose an automated theorem prover plus model-builder really can do deep new work without human help \u2014 what norms would preserve a meaningful human mathematical practice?\n- Or flip it and ask: *If you were on that NeurIPS panel, how would you argue for powerful science automation while still respecting his concerns?*"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"1ee4611f-9248-4617-bcd6-bc85c6811e4f","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","thinking_effort":"max","parent_id":"1131e602-cb90-4b82-a30f-9196d431b94e","turn_exchange_id":"75eeedc4-a08d-4f4f-afd4-a0c32d42acc9"},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"1131e602-cb90-4b82-a30f-9196d431b94e","children":[]}}}
