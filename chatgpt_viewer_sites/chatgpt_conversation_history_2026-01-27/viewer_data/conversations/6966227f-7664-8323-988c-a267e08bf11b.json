This speed is converted to wind speed by means of an equation \r\nobtained from calibrating the instrument in a wind tunnel. In this calibration \r\nprocess, the wind speed is fixed precisely and the resulting anemometer speed \r\nnoted.

Hence, there can be many possible \u201cbest-fit\u201d lines for the same set of \r\n[L4] bivariate data.\r\n[L5] In the following sub-section, we discuss how to work out the equation of a \r\n[L6] regression line mathematically.\r\n[L7] 2.1 The Method of Least Squares\r\n[L8] Consider the scatter diagram in Example 1.1. To find a regression line \r\n[L9] mathematically, consider the vertical distances e1, e2, e3, e4 and e5 drawn from \r\n[L10] each point to a \u201cbest-fit\u201d line which we have drawn for the data, as shown below. \r\n[L11] Note that the values of e1, e2, e3, e4 and e5 represent the \u201cy-errors\u201d, i.e. the errors \r\n[L12] in using the chosen line to estimate the values of y for the values of x given in the \r\n[L13] data set.\r\n[L14] Logically speaking, the values of the errors should be as small as possible if the \r\n[L15] line chosen is indeed the best-fit line. Hence we aim to minimise the values of the \r\n[L16] errors when calculating the equation of the regression line. \r\n[L17] However, since these errors will be positive or negative according to whether the \r\n[L18] points are above or below the line, we work with the squares of these values \r\n[L19] instead and consider their sum, \r\n[L20] 222222 \u2211 k =++++ 12345 e eeeee\r\n[L21] By minimising the sum 2\r\n[L22] \u2211 , k e one will obtain the least squares regression line of \r\n[L23] y on x. \r\n[L24] Contrastingly, if we were to instead consider the horizontal distances d1, d2, d3, d4\r\n[L25] and d5 drawn from each point to a best-fit line, as shown below: <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 27><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 27>and minimise the values of the \u201cx-errors\u201d by minimising the sum of squares\r\n[L26] 222222\r\n[L27] 12345 \u2211 =++++ , k d ddddd\r\n[L28] we would obtain the least squares regression line of x on y. \r\n[L29] For the purpose of the H2 Maths syllabus, you are not required to find the \r\n[L30] equations of the regression lines analytically.

Hence it is risky to use the regression line to \r\n[L70] estimate the value of x (or y) given a value of y (or x) that lies outside the range of\r\n[L71] values of y (or x) in the data set.\r\n[L72] Therefore, to determine if an estimate (or predicted value) obtained from a \r\n[L73] regression line is reliable, we consider the following. \r\n[L74] The process of carrying out estimation from within the given data range is known \r\n[L75] as interpolation, while the process of carrying out estimation from beyond the \r\n[L76] data range is known as extrapolation. \r\n[L77] Example 4.1. \r\n[L78] An instrument is used to measure the amount of Vitamin C in a given volume of \r\n[L79] liquid. It is standardised by using it on seven specimen solutions containing \r\n[L80] known amounts of Vitamin C, x, in micrograms/ml. The reading on the instrument \r\n[L81] is denoted by y.

Hence we aim to minimise the values of the \r\n[L155] errors when calculating the equation of the regression line. \r\n[L156] However, since these errors will be positive or negative according to whether the \r\n[L157] points are above or below the line, we work with the squares of these values \r\n[L158] instead and consider their sum, \r\n[L159] 222222 \u2211 k =++++ 12345 e eeeee\r\n[L160] By minimising the sum 2\r\n[L161] \u2211 , k e one will obtain the least squares regression line of \r\n[L162] y on x. \r\n[L163] Contrastingly, if we were to instead consider the horizontal distances d1, d2, d3, d4\r\n[L164] and d5 drawn from each point to a best-fit line, as shown below: ","[L165] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 6 / 27>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://1f954597194ab66#file_000000001ed87206bde6d2db47dd6f40#p_5.jpg","size_bytes":63111,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L166] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 7 / 27>","[L167] and minimise the values of the \u201cx-errors\u201d by minimising the sum of squares\r\n[L168] 222222\r\n[L169] 12345 \u2211 =++++ , k d ddddd\r\n[L170] we would obtain the least squares regression line of x on y. \r\n[L171] For the purpose of the H2 Maths syllabus, you are not required to find the \r\n[L172] equations of the regression lines analytically.

It is standardised by using it on seven specimen solutions containing \r\n[L686] known amounts of Vitamin C, x, in micrograms/ml. The reading on the instrument \r\n[L687] is denoted by y. Corresponding values of x and y are given in the table: \r\n[L688] x 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\r\n[L689] y 6.26 5.47 4.67 3.91 3.29 2.28 1.44\r\n[L690] (i) Find r, the product moment correlation coefficient between x and y.\r\n[L691] (ii) Using a suitable regression line, estimate the value of x when y = 3.5.\r\n[L692] (iii) Comment on the reliability of this estimate that you have obtained in part\r\n[L693] (ii).\r\n[L694] 1.

This speed is converted to wind speed by means of an equation \r\n[L731] obtained from calibrating the instrument in a wind tunnel. In this calibration \r\n[L732] process, the wind speed is fixed precisely and the resulting anemometer speed \r\n[L733] noted. For a particular anemometer, this process produced the following set of \r\n[L734] data:\r\n[L735] Actual wind speed, s\r\n[L736] (m/s) 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 \r\n[L737] Anemometer speed, r \r\n[L738] (revs/min) 30 38 48 58 68 80 92 106 120 134 \r\n[L739] (a) Obtain the equation of the estimated least squares regression line of r on\r\n[L740] s and the line of s on r.\r\n[L741] (b) If the actual wind speed is 1.65m/s, use an appropriate regression line to\r\n[L742] estimate the rotational speed of the anemometer.\r\n[L743] (c) Demonstrate, using the above regression line as an example, that it is\r\n[L744] unwise to extrapolate beyond the range of the data.\r\n[L745] Solution \r\n[L746] (a) By GC, r ss =\u2212 + = + 90.8 116 and 0.78772 0.0085566 .r\r\n[L747] (b) Since the wind speed is fixed precisely, it is the independent variable.\r\n[L748] Hence we use the line of r on s.\r\n[L749] Therefore, r =\u2212 + = 90.8 116(1.65) 100.6 revs/ min.\r\n[L750] (c) Using the r on s line: When s = 0, r = \u201390.8 revs/min. That is, the\r\n[L751] anemometer speed is negative! Thus, it is unwise to extrapolate beyond\r\n[L752] the data range.","[L753] <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 20 / 27>",{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"sediment://58d3490e7f42aec#file_000000001ed87206bde6d2db47dd6f40#p_19.jpg","size_bytes":64577,"width":512,"height":512,"fovea":null,"metadata":null},"[L754] <PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 21 / 27>","[L755] \u00a75 Linearisation of Data \r\n[L756] Suppose a strong but non-linear relationship can be observed from the data, say \r\n[L757] one of the form y = a\r\n[L758] x\r\n[L759] + b .

For a particular anemometer, this process produced the following set of \r\n[L38] data:\r\n[L39] Actual wind speed, s\r\n[L40] (m/s) 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 \r\n[L41] Anemometer speed, r \r\n[L42] (revs/min) 30 38 48 58 68 80 92 106 120 134 \r\n[L43] (a) Obtain the equation of the estimated least squares regression line of r on\r\n[L44] s and the line of s on r.\r\n[L45] (b) If the actual wind speed is 1.65m/s, use an appropriate regression line to\r\n[L46] estimate the rotational speed of the anemometer.\r\n[L47] (c) Demonstrate, using the above regression line as an example, that it is\r\n[L48] unwise to extrapolate beyond the range of the data.\r\n[L49] Solution \r\n[L50] (a) By GC, r ss =\u2212 + = + 90.8 116 and 0.78772 0.0085566 .r\r\n[L51] (b) Since the wind speed is fixed precisely, it is the independent variable.\r\n[L52] Hence we use the line of r on s.\r\n[L53] Therefore, r =\u2212 + = 90.8 116(1.65) 100.6 revs/ min.\r\n[L54] (c) Using the r on s line: When s = 0, r = \u201390.8 revs/min.

Use the x on y line.\r\n[L16] 2. If the sample mean of both variables are given to be x and y, then the point\r\n[L17] ( ) x y, lies on both the regression lines of y on x and x on y, i.e. the two lines\r\n[L18] must intersect at ( ) x y, . (For the proof, refer to the appendix on the\r\n[L19] derivation of the working formulae to find the equations of the y on x and x\r\n[L20] on y lines.)\r\n[L21] \u00a73 The Product Moment Correlation Coefficient\r\n[L22] In the previous section, we have discussed how to use regression lines to carry out \r\n[L23] estimation/prediction of values for a variable given a set of bivariate data. \r\n[L24] However, the validity of performing this procedure to carry out estimation \r\n[L25] depends on the assumption that a linear model is a good fit for the data we are \r\n[L26] given, which is not always true. For example, the following scatter diagrams \r\n[L27] illustrate how different sets of bivariate data may demonstrate different possible \r\n[L28] relationships (or equivalently types of correlation) between the two variables.\r\n[L29] Note: Premature \r\n[L30] rounding off in the \r\n[L31] equation of line \r\n[L32] will lead to \r\n[L33] inaccuracy in \r\n[L34] estimation e.g.\r\n[L35] \u201cEstimated value of \r\n[L36] Y = 120 \u2013 1.07(70) \r\n[L37] = 45.1 (to 3 s.f.s)\u201d <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 27><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 27>Positive correlation Negative correlation\r\n[L38] Quadratic relation No observable relation\r\n[L39] While the scatter diagram can show clearly if a linear model is a good fit for the \r\n[L40] data, this may not always be a practical approach to determine the degree of linear \r\n[L41] correlation between the two variables, especially when we are dealing with a large \r\n[L42] set of data. In this case, a possible alternative to using the scatter diagram would \r\n[L43] be to use a certain measure called the product moment correlation coefficient \r\n[L44] (conventionally denoted by r), which is calculated based on the following \r\n[L45] formula:\r\n[L46] r = = \r\n[L47] ( ) ( ) 2 2\r\n[L48] 2 2\r\n[L49] x y\r\n[L50] xy\r\n[L51] n\r\n[L52] x y\r\n[L53] x y\r\n[L54] n n\r\n[L55] \u2212\r\n[L56] \uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8ec \u2212 \u2212 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\r\n[L57] \u2211 \u2211 \u2211\r\n[L58] \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211\r\n[L59] (in MF26)\r\n[L60] The value of r gives us an indication of the following: \r\n[L61] Direction of correlation\r\n[L62] If r is positive (negative), then the two \r\n[L63] variables are positively (negatively) correlated \r\n[L64] i.e. one generally increases (decreases) in value\r\n[L65] as the other increases.\r\n[L66] Strength of linear\r\n[L67] correlation\r\n[L68] The closer the absolute value of r, |r|, is to 1, \r\n[L69] the stronger the strength of linear correlation \r\n[L70] i.e. the better a linear model fits the set of\r\n[L71] bivariate data\r\n[L72] Notes:\r\n[L73] (1) For any set of data, \u20131 \u2264 r \u2264 1.\n# \u30104\u20202016_-_2017_H2_Maths_C_R_Lect_Notes_final_-_(LMS)-edited2.pdf\u2020file_000000001ed87206bde6d2db47dd6f40\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: 2016_-_2017_H2_Maths_C_R_Lect_Notes_final_-_(LMS)-edited2.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn3file4\ue201\nMclick Target: \"3:4\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] The table below shows four sets of bivariate data.\r\n[L2] (i) Find the values of the product moment correlation coefficient for each set of\r\n[L3] data.\r\n[L4] (ii) Sketch the scatter diagrams for each of the sets of the bivariate data.\r\n[L5] (iii) Using your sketches in part (ii), comment on the strengths of the linear\r\n[L6] relationships between the two variables for each set of data, and compare\r\n[L7] between the effectiveness of using the r-values and that of using the scatter\r\n[L8] diagrams to determine the strength of the linear relationship of a set of\r\n[L9] bivariate data.\r\n[L10] Solution: \r\n[L11] (i) One can verify that the correlation coefficients for the four sets of data are\r\n[L12] all equal to 0.816.\r\n[L13] (ii) The following scatter diagrams are drawn based on the above data.\r\n[L14] For x1 and y1 For x2 and y2\r\n[L15] 0\r\n[L16] 2\r\n[L17] 4\r\n[L18] 6\r\n[L19] 8\r\n[L20] 10\r\n[L21] 12\r\n[L22] 0 5 10 15\r\n[L23] x1\r\n[L24] y1\r\n[L25] 0\r\n[L26] 1\r\n[L27] 2\r\n[L28] 3\r\n[L29] 4\r\n[L30] 5\r\n[L31] 6\r\n[L32] 7\r\n[L33] 8\r\n[L34] 9\r\n[L35] 10\r\n[L36] 0 5 10 15\r\n[L37] x2\r\n[L38] y2\r\n[L39] x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4\r\n[L40] 10 8.04 10 9.14 10 7.46 8 6.58\r\n[L41] 8 6.95 8 8.14 8 6.77 8 5.76\r\n[L42] 13 7.58 13 8.74 13 12.74 8 7.71\r\n[L43] 9 8.81 9 8.77 9 7.11 8 8.84\r\n[L44] 11 8.33 11 9.26 11 7.81 8 8.47\r\n[L45] 14 9.96 14 8.10 14 8.84 8 7.04\r\n[L46] 6 7.24 6 6.13 6 6.08 8 5.25\r\n[L47] 4 4.26 4 3.10 4 5.39 19 12.50\r\n[L48] 12 10.84 12 9.13 12 8.15 8 5.56\r\n[L49] 7 4.82 7 7.26 7 6.42 8 7.91\r\n[L50] 5 5.68 5 4.74 5 5.73 8 6.89<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 17 / 27><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 18 / 27>For x3 and y3 For x4 and y4\r\n[L51] (iii) Based on the sketches in part (ii), the 3rd set of data demonstrates the\r\n[L52] strongest linear relationship between the two variables, albeit with the\r\n[L53] presence of an outlier.\r\n[L54] Since all the r-values are the same, we cannot tell which data set has the\r\n[L55] strongest linear relationship based on the r-value alone.

For example, the following scatter diagrams \r\n[L27] illustrate how different sets of bivariate data may demonstrate different possible \r\n[L28] relationships (or equivalently types of correlation) between the two variables.\r\n[L29] Note: Premature \r\n[L30] rounding off in the \r\n[L31] equation of line \r\n[L32] will lead to \r\n[L33] inaccuracy in \r\n[L34] estimation e.g.\r\n[L35] \u201cEstimated value of \r\n[L36] Y = 120 \u2013 1.07(70) \r\n[L37] = 45.1 (to 3 s.f.s)\u201d <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 27><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 27>Positive correlation Negative correlation\r\n[L38] Quadratic relation No observable relation\r\n[L39] While the scatter diagram can show clearly if a linear model is a good fit for the \r\n[L40] data, this may not always be a practical approach to determine the degree of linear \r\n[L41] correlation between the two variables, especially when we are dealing with a large \r\n[L42] set of data. In this case, a possible alternative to using the scatter diagram would \r\n[L43] be to use a certain measure called the product moment correlation coefficient \r\n[L44] (conventionally denoted by r),

For example, the following scatter diagrams \r\n[L27] illustrate how different sets of bivariate data may demonstrate different possible \r\n[L28] relationships (or equivalently types of correlation) between the two variables.\r\n[L29] Note: Premature \r\n[L30] rounding off in the \r\n[L31] equation of line \r\n[L32] will lead to \r\n[L33] inaccuracy in \r\n[L34] estimation e.g.\r\n[L35] \u201cEstimated value of \r\n[L36] Y = 120 \u2013 1.07(70) \r\n[L37] = 45.1 (to 3 s.f.s)\u201d <IMAGE FOR PAGE: 11 / 27><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 12 / 27>Positive correlation Negative correlation\r\n[L38] Quadratic relation No observable relation\r\n[L39] While the scatter diagram can show clearly if a linear model is a good fit for the \r\n[L40] data, this may not always be a practical approach to determine the degree of linear \r\n[L41] correlation between the two variables, especially when we are dealing with a large \r\n[L42] set of data. In this case, a possible alternative to using the scatter diagram would \r\n[L43] be to use a certain measure called the product moment correlation coefficient \r\n[L44] (conventionally denoted by r), which is calculated based on the following \r\n[L45] formula:\r\n[L46] r = = \r\n[L47] ( ) ( ) 2 2\r\n[L48] 2 2\r\n[L49] x y\r\n[L50] xy\r\n[L51] n\r\n[L52] x y\r\n[L53] x y\r\n[L54] n n\r\n[L55] \u2212\r\n[L56] \uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8ec \u2212 \u2212 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\r\n[L57] \u2211 \u2211 \u2211\r\n[L58] \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211\r\n[L59] (in MF26)\r\n[L60] The value of r gives us an indication of the following: \r\n[L61] Direction of correlation\r\n[L62] If r is positive (negative), then the two \r\n[L63] variables are positively (negatively) correlated \r\n[L64] i.e. one generally increases (decreases) in value\r\n[L65] as the other increases.\r\n[L66] Strength of linear\r\n[L67] correlation\r\n[L68] The closer the absolute value of r, |r|, is to 1, \r\n[L69] the stronger the strength of linear correlation \r\n[L70] i.e. the better a linear model fits the set of\r\n[L71] bivariate data\r\n[L72] Notes:\r\n[L73] (1) For any set of data, \u20131 \u2264 r \u2264 1.\n# \u30103\u20202016_-_2017_H2_Maths_C_R_Lect_Notes_final_-_(LMS)-edited2.pdf\u2020file_000000001ed87206bde6d2db47dd6f40\u3011\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: 2016_-_2017_H2_Maths_C_R_Lect_Notes_final_-_(LMS)-edited2.pdf\nCitation Marker: \ue200filecite\ue202turn5file3\ue201\nMclick Target: \"5:3\"\nContent Snippet:\n[L1] (2) If r = 1, then the set of bivariate data demonstrates a perfect positive linear\r\n[L2] correlation between the two variables.\r\n[L3] 0\r\n[L4] 10\r\n[L5] 20\r\n[L6] 30\r\n[L7] 40\r\n[L8] 50\r\n[L9] 60\r\n[L10] 70\r\n[L11] 80\r\n[L12] 90\r\n[L13] 100\r\n[L14] 0 20 40 60 80 100\r\n[L15] Maths Marks (X)\r\n[L16] Physics Marks (Y)\r\n[L17] 15\r\n[L18] 17\r\n[L19] 19\r\n[L20] 21\r\n[L21] 23\r\n[L22] 25\r\n[L23] 27\r\n[L24] 29\r\n[L25] 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500\r\n[L26] Altitude (X m)\r\n[L27] Temperature (Y \u00b0C)\r\n[L28] 0\r\n[L29] 500\r\n[L30] 1000\r\n[L31] 1500\r\n[L32] 2000\r\n[L33] 2500\r\n[L34] 3000\r\n[L35] 3500\r\n[L36] 4000\r\n[L37] 4500\r\n[L38] 0 20 40 60 80\r\n[L39] Age (X yrs)\r\n[L40] Monthly Salary ($Y)\r\n[L41] 0\r\n[L42] 1000\r\n[L43] 2000\r\n[L44] 3000\r\n[L45] 4000\r\n[L46] 5000\r\n[L47] 6000\r\n[L48] 45 55 65 75 85\r\n[L49] Weight (X kg)\r\n[L50] Monthly Salary ($Y)\r\n[L51] ( )( )\r\n[L52] ( ) ( )\r\n[L53] x x y y\r\n[L54] x x y y\r\n[L55] \u2212 \u2212\r\n[L56] \u2212 \u2212\r\n[L57] \u2211\r\n[L58] \u2211\u2211\r\n[L59] 2 2<IMAGE FOR PAGE: 12 / 27><PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 13 / 27>If r = \u20131, then the set of bivariate data demonstrates a perfect negative \r\n[L60] linear correlation between the two variables.\r\n[L61] If a set of bivariate data demonstrates a perfect linear correlation, then ALL \r\n[L62] the points in the scatter diagram are collinear.
