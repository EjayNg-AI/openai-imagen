This is a request from my colleague Bernadette to me, Shaun and Lydia. Hi Shaun, E-Jay and Lydia, I had a trial Science class with S2ny Xavier yesterday (Sun Kovan 9.30am group). Xavier was transferred from RX (Thurs Farrer 5-7pm group), and now does Math with me (Thurs Farrer 4-6pm for holidays, need to switch to 5-7pm when school reopens)\n\nHe wanted to try Science so we just had a trial class. He would like to continue after Christmas, but at Farrer (Math is also at Farrer, Thurs). His mom asked for my Farrer slots but he can't do Tues (CCA) and asked about Wed after 4.30pm\n\nI recall Shaun saying there was interest in starting a Wed 5-7pm Farrer group for me, but I currently have P4ny Andrew 1-1 (5.15-6.45pm, 1.5h). I asked Andrew's mom if he is open to switching to a group class yesterday morning but she hasn't replied (and sometimes doesn't reply until she wants to ask me something)\n\nI know you all are currently doing scheduling stuff, so just wanted to let you know that there is a S2ny Xavier who is interested in Wed 5-7pm Farrer group for Sci, on top of any other enquiries for this slot that Shaun might have had when he asked me on Sat. Xavier's mom would like to know if he can get a suitable slot before she withdraws him from his current Sci tuition \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8d97d822bfb39d1a-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"36f1f518-fed6-408b-8a70-f551522f8aba","children":["41087c46-c68f-4036-9e31-1a8c013fe8b2"]},"41087c46-c68f-4036-9e31-1a8c013fe8b2":{"id":"41087c46-c68f-4036-9e31-1a8c013fe8b2","message":{"id":"41087c46-c68f-4036-9e31-1a8c013fe8b2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1730086199.097419,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa2d348-7508-43a6-9ed4-e40133e26cb8","request_id":"8d97d822bfb39d1a-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2d348-7508-43a6-9ed4-e40133e26cb8","children":["abfba3af-3b03-4756-b8db-be8b03ca539a"]},"abfba3af-3b03-4756-b8db-be8b03ca539a":{"id":"abfba3af-3b03-4756-b8db-be8b03ca539a","message":{"id":"abfba3af-3b03-4756-b8db-be8b03ca539a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1730086199.097727,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's a concise paraphrase:\n\n\"Hi Shaun, E-Jay, and Lydia, I trialed a Science class with S2ny Xavier, who\u2019s now keen to continue Science at Farrer on Wednesdays after 4:30 pm (since Math is also at Farrer on Thursdays).
