The survey results come ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington D.C. to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. The discussion between the leaders is expected to cover the future of the West Bank and normalization of ties with Arab nations. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has indicated that a Palestinian state is necessary for normalization with Israel, but over half of the Israeli respondents in the poll would not support a Palestinian state even with a Saudi peace deal. A significant portion of Israelis (80%) also supported the idea of Arab nations taking in more Palestinians from Gaza.

He believes the land of Israel belongs solely to the Jews and has a firm stance against the establishment of a Palestinian state. Known for his strong military background, Bennett's political ascent reflects the growing strength of the radical right in Israel, attempting to solidify the settlement project and shift the country's ideological core.

This marks the first time that Israel-related incidents\u2014such as anti-Israel signs, chants, and speeches at protests\u2014have constituted the majority of antisemitic activity. The ADL emphasized the need to distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israel and antisemitism but flagged certain narratives, like equating Zionism to Nazism or glorifying violence, as crossing the line. University campuses were identified as hotspots for antisemitic incidents, affecting Jewish student safety. The Trump administration faces criticism for leveraging antisemitism concerns to target pro-Palestinian activists and institutions, such as in the controversial case of detained student Mahmoud Khalil. The ADL itself has drawn criticism from progressive Jewish leaders and academics for its approach. Other findings include a 344% increase in incidents over five years, with 196 assaults reported, 2,606 acts of vandalism (37% involving swastikas), and 647 bomb threats, mainly against synagogues. White supremacist groups were linked to 962 propaganda incidents.

This theme parallels Hannah Arendt's examination of the \"banality of evil\" in her work on Adolf Eichmann. Arendt argued that heinous acts can be executed by seemingly normal people through mechanistic cruelty devoid of systematic ideology. Her observations have permeated political thought and remain controversial, as they suggest a troubling normality to malevolent actions. Additionally, Arendt's own life, her intellectual relationship with Martin Heidegger, and her contentious positions on Jewish identity and Zionism reveal the complex interplay between her personal experiences and her philosophical positions. Her legacy, while influential, is marked by intense debates over her views on identity, politics, and the human condition. Despite these controversies, Arendt is acknowledged for her profound insights into political evil and the necessary conditions for human dignity and political engagement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1231128000.0,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/02/the-heretic","title":"The Heretic","snippet":"In February 1917, Gerhard Scholem, a young Zionist with a passion for Jewish mysticism, faced a crisis with his nationalist father, Arthur Scholem, in their Berlin home amidst the entrenched war and family tensions.

Gerhard, later known as Gershom Scholem, pursued his academic interests in Judaica, philology, and Kabbalah, becoming a pivotal scholar in these fields. Despite the tumultuous political landscape, including the rise of Nazism and the founding of Israel, Scholem's dedication to Jewish history and mysticism persisted.

The core halakhic argument invokes the **\u201cThree Oaths\u201d** (Talmud, Ketubot 111a): Jews must not \u201cascend like a wall\u201d or \u201crebel against the nations,\u201d so founding a state by force is religiously forbidden. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn2search7\ue201  \n- **Satmar Hasidim** (R. Yoel Teitelbaum) and allied sects: systematized the above in *VaYoel Moshe* (1961), arguing Zionism conflicts with Torah and hastens redemption \u201cby human hands.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201  \n- **Agudath Israel / Haredi mainstream pre-1948:** originally opposed political Zionism on religious grounds; after 1948 adopted a **non-Zionist** but pragmatic stance, participating in Israeli politics without embracing Zionist ideology. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search4\ue201  \n\n**Why:**  \nReligious doctrine (Three Oaths), fear that secular nationalism redefines Jewish peoplehood away from Torah, and concern that a pre-Messianic state would profane the divine order. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search7\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 2) Reform Judaism\u2019s early anti-Zionism (late-19th\u2013mid-20th c.)  \n- **Pittsburgh Platform (1885):** envisioned Judaism as a **religion** (not a nation) with a universal mission; therefore no return to a political state. (Later Reform statements softened this.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search9\ue201  \n- **American Council for Judaism (ACJ, 1942\u2013):** organized opposition to political Zionism; favored Jews\u2019 full civic integration where they lived, and (pre-1948) alternatives like a unitary Jewish-Arab democracy in Palestine. After 1948 many members recognized Israel de facto, but ACJ continued to oppose Zionist ideology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201  \n\n**Why:**  \nUniversalist theology, civic assimilationism, and anxiety about \u201cdual loyalty\u201d if Jews were defined as a political nation tied to a foreign state. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 3) Jewish socialist/left anti-Zionists (diasporist)  \n- **General Jewish Labour Bund** (founded 1897): championed **doikayt** (\u201chereness\u201d)\u2014building Jewish cultural and political life **in the Diaspora**, not emigrating to Palestine; advocated minority rights/socialism and (by the 1940s) bi-national or non-ethno-national solutions in Palestine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search16\ue201  \n- **Israeli Socialist Organization (Matzpen, 1962\u20131980s):** critiqued Zionism as a settler-colonial/national project; proposed a regional socialist federation and a non-Zionist Israel integrated with its Arab neighbors. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n\n**Why:**  \nClass-first internationalism, commitment to minority rights where Jews already lived, and rejection of ethnonational statehood as the solution to antisemitism. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search10\ue201\n\n---\n\n### 4) Individual Jewish intellectuals who opposed a nation-state solution  \n- **Hannah Arendt** (1940s): warned a Jewish nation-state established without Arab consent would entrench conflict; advocated binational/cantonal frameworks instead. (Her views evolved, but she remained critical of ethnonational sovereignty as the end-point.) \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue202turn3search15\ue201  \n\n**Why:**  \nPolitical-philosophical skepticism of ethnonationalism and concern for Arab\u2013Jewish parity and long-term security. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\n---\n\n## How these positions shifted after 1948\n- Many Jewish opponents either **accepted Israel de facto** or moved to **non-Zionism** (cooperating with the state without granting it messianic or ideological legitimacy). Agudath Israel\u2019s post-1948 political participation is emblematic. A smaller minority (e.g., Neturei Karta, Satmar; some socialist groups) **continued principled anti-Zionism**. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Quick summary of motives\n1) **Religious-halakhic:** Pre-Messianic sovereignty violates the Talmudic \u201cThree Oaths\u201d; secular nationalism distorts Jewish peoplehood. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2search3\ue201  \n2) **Theological-universalist (Reform/ACJ):** Judaism is a faith, not a nationality; Jews should be citizens of their countries, not a separate nation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201  \n3) **Socialist-diasporist (Bund/Matzpen):** Fight for rights \u201chere,\u201d not emigration; prefer binational/regional arrangements over a Jewish nation-state. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search10\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n4) **Liberal-political (Arendt):** Fear of permanent conflict and illiberalism in an ethnonational state; prefer shared sovereignty. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search5\ue201\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can expand any strand (e.g., Satmar\u2019s *VaYoel Moshe* arguments verse-by-verse, or the Bund\u2019s doikayt program and its postwar legacy)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn2search7\ue201","start_idx":473,"end_idx":505,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.britannica.com/topic/Neturei-Karta?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Neturei-Karta?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Neturei Karta | Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, Zionism, & Palestine","url":"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Neturei-Karta?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1721779200.0,"snippet":"Founded by Rabbi Amram Blau in the 1930s, Neturei Karta believes a Jewish state should not exist until the messiah returns.

Here\u2019s how the main camps that *oppose* political Zionism would answer it\u2014and how the *pro-Zionist/defensive-necessity* side replies. I\u2019ll keep this tight but precise.\n\n# What anti-Zionists say in response\n\n### 1) \u201cDefensive \u2260 permitted if the act itself violates the Oaths\u201d\n(Haredi anti-Zionists: Satmar/Neturei Karta)\n- **Claim:** The \u201cThree Oaths\u201d (Ketubot 111a) prohibit *collective* return \u201cas a wall\u201d and *rebellion against the nations* before the messianic era. Whether the motive is defense or uplift is irrelevant; the prohibition is on *taking sovereignty by human force*.  \n- **Why \u201cdefensive\u201d doesn\u2019t help:** They argue halakhic categories like **pikuach nefesh** (saving life) cannot be applied to abrogate a **meta-historical decree** that defines the terms of exile and redemption. In fact, they often say violating the Oaths **increases danger** (spiritual and physical), so it is *anti-defensive* in the long run.\n- **UN/Balfour as \u201cconsent\u201d?** Satmar holds that \u201cpermission\u201d from some powers does not satisfy the Oaths\u2019 bar: (i) it\u2019s not consent of *all* nations; (ii) the Oaths address **Jews\u2019 initiative**, not Gentile permission; (iii) consent given and withdrawn (e.g., 1947\u201348\u20131967 wars) proves the enterprise is maintained by force.\n- **Empirical pushback:** They point to wars, terror, conscription, and global spillovers as evidence that the state hasn\u2019t reduced Jewish vulnerability\u2014only **relocated** and sometimes **amplified** it.\n\n### 2) \u201cSelf-organization can be diasporic, not statist\u201d\n(Bundist/diasporist left)\n- **Claim:** The safer route is **minority rights, federal protections, and socialism** where Jews live (**doikayt**, \u201chereness\u201d). A Jewish nation-state in a contested land structurally produces conflict; it doesn\u2019t eliminate antisemitism, it **reframes** it geopolitically.\n- **On \u2018defense\u2019:** They argue state power is a **two-edged sword**\u2014it can defend, but also embroil Jews in regional war, militarize society, and fuel reciprocal nationalisms.\n\n### 3) \u201cA state endangers Judaism\u2019s moral core\u201d\n(Early Reform; some liberal critics)\n- **Claim:** Judaism is primarily a **religion**; a nation-state risks subordinating Torah\u2019s universal ethics to raison d\u2019\u00e9tat. The Holocaust is a warning about fascist nationalism, not a brief for **our own** nationalism.\n\n# How the pro-state side answers (your view, steel-manned)\n\n### A) The Oaths are aggadic and not binding halakhah\n- Many religious Zionist authorities (e.g., Rav Kook\u2019s school; R. Herzog; R. Soloveitchik) hold the Oaths are **non-legal homily**, superseded by later halakhic obligations.\n\n### B) Even if the Oaths matter, there was *no rebellion against the nations*\n- **International consent:** Balfour (1917), the League Mandate, and the **UN Partition Plan (1947)** constitute **international authorization**, not rebellion. The 1948 war was **defensive** against invading armies. Subsequent wars (1967, 1973) were also defensive or pre-emptive in self-defense terms.\n- **Pragmatics:** Sovereignty is maintained through **recognized international law** (statehood, UN membership, treaties). That is the opposite of \u201crebellion.\u201d\n\n### C) Pikuach nefesh + mitzvat yishuv ha\u2019aretz\n- Preventing another Holocaust is the paradigmatic case of **saving life**; building capacity for **self-defense** is a halakhic imperative. Some add the enduring command to **settle the land** (Ramban\u2019s reading), now feasible without miraculous intervention.\n\n### D) Empirical ledger\n- Israel provided **refuge and extraction** for endangered communities (post-Holocaust DP camps; Mizrahi exoduses; Operation Solomon for Ethiopian Jews; Soviet aliyah).  \n- It created **deterrent power**; while risks remain, Jews are no longer **rightless** before hostile states or mobs.\n\n# Where the arguments actually bite (and where they\u2019re weak)\n\n- **Textual/Halakhic axis:**  \n  - *Anti-Zionist strength:* a consistent, literalist reading of the Oaths + fear of \u201chumanly hastened redemption.\u201d  \n  - *Weakness:* many poskim relegate the Oaths to **aggadah**; others say **international sanction** and defensive posture satisfy the \u201cdon\u2019t rebel\u201d clause.\n- **Moral-political axis:**  \n  - *Anti-Zionist/Reform strength:* clear articulation of dangers of nationalism and of permanent minority disenfranchisement for Palestinians.  \n  - *Pro-state strength:* a sober reading of 20th-century history shows **statelessness** was catastrophic; **self-organization with force** capacity is a rational hedge against extreme tail risks.  \n- **Empirical/security axis:**  \n  - *For the state:* demonstrable rescue operations, demographic consolidation, and credible deterrence.  \n  - *Against:* persistent conflict shows statehood didn\u2019t \u201cend\u201d Jewish danger; it **transformed** its profile and externalities.\n\n# Directly answering your point\nYour claim\u2014\u201cIsrael\u2019s formation is defensive self-organization, not rebellion\u201d\u2014is **coherent** on three grounds:\n1) **Legal-international:** UN authorization + defensive wars undermine the \u201crebellion\u201d characterization.  \n2) **Halakhic-prudential:** many authorities either *don\u2019t* treat the Oaths as binding or view **pikuach nefesh** and **yishuv ha\u2019aretz** as overriding.  \n3) **Strategic:** absent sovereignty, Jews historically lacked last-resort guarantees; a state provides **agency** and **deterrence**.\n\nThe best anti-Zionist rejoinders are:\n- **Category error:** calling it \u201cdefensive\u201d doesn\u2019t matter if the very act (pre-Messianic sovereignty) is what\u2019s forbidden.  \n- **Consent insufficiency:** partial or reversible consent isn\u2019t \u201cthe nations\u201d in the Talmudic sense; the project is sustained by arms, hence *de facto* rebellion.  \n- **Outcome critique:** if defensive, why did danger intensify regionally, and why are Jews elsewhere sometimes *less* safe due to blowback?\n\n# My assessment (objective, forward-looking)\n- On *strict halakhic* grounds, the dispute is **intractable** because it turns on first-order commitments (aggadah vs halakhah; scope of pikuach nefesh; meaning of \u201cnations\u2019 consent\u201d).  \n- On *political and empirical* grounds, your framing is **strong**: a people facing repeat extermination attempts is justified in **self-organization with coercive capacity**, particularly when obtained through **international procedures** and exercised primarily for **self-defense**.  \n- The enduring challenge is not the initial \u201crebellion\u201d question but the **ongoing constitutional ethic**: can Israel entrench long-term security **while meeting universal moral constraints** (equal civic status, constraints on force, durable arrangements with Palestinians and neighbors)? The defensibility of the founding claim increasingly hinges on **what follows from it**.\n\nIf you want, I can map specific halakhic sources side-by-side (Satmar\u2019s *VaYoel Moshe* vs. Herzogaic/Relig.-Zionist responsa) with the exact inferential steps where the logics diverge."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"

The movement, opposing Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-wing government's judicial reforms, has persisted since its peak in March. Critics argue the changes threaten democracy and benefit Netanyahu amidst his corruption charges. The protests follow failed compromise talks and recent resignations within the police force, hinting at potential escalation. Netanyahu defends the bill, asserting it bolsters democracy without harming judicial independence, as the bill heads for further discussions before final votes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":77},"pub_date":1689088906.0,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/ad834288883034b4d8bc5c60614484f6","title":"The Latest | US and Israel strongly condemn ICC prosecutor's request to arrest Israeli officials","snippet":"Israel and the U.S. have reacted strongly against the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor's request to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Hamas leaders, attributing the request to accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the recent conflict in Gaza. Netanyahu condemned the move as an \"attack on Israeli military\" while U.S. President Joe Biden expressed unequivocal support for Israel, rejecting any equivalency between Israel and Hamas. Concurrently, Hamas also criticized the ICC's actions, claiming a right to resist Israeli occupation through \"armed resistance.\"\n\nIn related news, Iran's president and foreign minister died in a helicopter crash, adding to the region\u2019s tensions. Additionally, Israel has accused the U.N. of employing Hamas members in its refugee agency, urging further investigation. Amidst intensified military operations in Rafah, Israeli forces are focusing on dismantling Hamas, causing significant displacement of Gazans. Protests in support of Palestinians continue on U.S. campuses, complicating the security and academic environment. Lastly, suspected Israeli airstrikes in Syria resulted in several casualties, further accentuating the geopolitical complexities.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":78},"pub_date":1716202263.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fee49d5e8c8327ba369d8f64dc0e78","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing Israel-Palestine Conflict and Global Impact","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8a614e1f-892e-4b2b-aaa0-a6467be3921e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"5ff3318e-39e1-4be6-be0e-4ace81ec21ee","turn_exchange_id":"8dd9ecd3-7f36-43aa-a84b-885b628cbeea","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5ff3318e-39e1-4be6-be0e-4ace81ec21ee","children":["c559a480-6a3f-4f57-958c-e5ab09950cde"]},"c559a480-6a3f-4f57-958c-e5ab09950cde":{"id":"c559a480-6a3f-4f57-958c-e5ab09950cde","message":{"id":"c559a480-6a3f-4f57-958c-e5ab09950cde","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761535137.412763,"update_time":1761535137.413687,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"ADL antisemitic incidents 2023 2024 record high report\"}, {\"q\": \"Israel Haredi draft exemption controversy 2024 Supreme Court ruling conscription ultra-Orthodox\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"ADL antisemitic incidents 2023 2024 record high report"},{"type":"search","q":"Israel Haredi draft exemption controversy 2024 Supreme Court ruling conscription ultra-Orthodox"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Searching for ADL antisemitism statistics and related news","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8a614e1f-892e-4b2b-aaa0-a6467be3921e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"3749e5b0-c205-48f3-8380-118c46783ef4","turn_exchange_id":"8dd9ecd3-7f36-43aa-a84b-885b628cbeea","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"3749e5b0-c205-48f3-8380-118c46783ef4","children":["c85f2fa7-8602-4a95-b15b-c713aefef720"]},"c85f2fa7-8602-4a95-b15b-c713aefef720":{"id":"c85f2fa7-8602-4a95-b15b-c713aefef720","message":{"id":"c85f2fa7-8602-4a95-b15b-c713aefef720","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1761535137.4677308,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_model_queries":{"type":"search_model_queries","queries":["ADL antisemitic incidents 2023 2024 record high report","Israel Haredi draft exemption controversy 2024 Supreme Court ruling conscription ultra-Orthodox"]},"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for ADL antisemitism statistics and related news","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8a614e1f-892e-4b2b-aaa0-a6467be3921e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"c559a480-6a3f-4f57-958c-e5ab09950cde","turn_exchange_id":"8dd9ecd3-7f36-43aa-a84b-885b628cbeea","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c559a480-6a3f-4f57-958c-e5ab09950cde","children":["06921ea2-da5c-4b0d-92f2-e0b28b4f2d9b"]},"06921ea2-da5c-4b0d-92f2-e0b28b4f2d9b":{"id":"06921ea2-da5c-4b0d-92f2-e0b28b4f2d9b","message":{"id":"06921ea2-da5c-4b0d-92f2-e0b28b4f2d9b","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1761535137.4655843,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"jstreet.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://jstreet.org/israels-conscription-crisis-the-debate-over-the-ultra-orthodox-draft-law/","title":"Israel's Conscription Crisis \u2013 The Debate Over the Ultra- ...","snippet":"Jul 25, 2025 \u2014 As of July 1, 2024 all draft-age men, including Haredim, became legally subject to conscription.

The ADL emphasized that while critique of Israeli policy is not inherently antisemitic, many protests crossed the line into hate speech and incitement.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19},"pub_date":1745370558.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"apnews.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://apnews.com/article/2c2db56fd4d994cbabfde037cb107af8","title":"Anti-Defamation League says anger at Israel is now the driving force behind antisemitism in the US","snippet":"The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported a record-high 9,354 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in 2024, with 58% tied to criticism of Israel, particularly arising from opposition to Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. This marks the first time that Israel-related incidents\u2014such as anti-Israel signs, chants, and speeches at protests\u2014have constituted the majority of antisemitic activity. The ADL emphasized the need to distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israel and antisemitism but flagged certain narratives, like equating Zionism to Nazism or glorifying violence, as crossing the line. University campuses were identified as hotspots for antisemitic incidents, affecting Jewish student safety. The Trump administration faces criticism for leveraging antisemitism concerns to target pro-Palestinian activists and institutions, such as in the controversial case of detained student Mahmoud Khalil. The ADL itself has drawn criticism from progressive Jewish leaders and academics for its approach. Other findings include a 344% increase in incidents over five years, with 196 assaults reported, 2,606 acts of vandalism (37% involving swastikas), and 647 bomb threats, mainly against synagogues. White supremacist groups were linked to 962 propaganda incidents. The report underscores rising antisemitic threats amid deepening societal and political divides.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},"pub_date":1745316280.0,"attribution":"apnews.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Melbourne_synagogue_attack","title":"2024 Melbourne synagogue attack","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1761489897.0,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68fee49d5e8c8327ba369d8f64dc0e78","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for ADL antisemitism statistics and related news","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"8a614e1f-892e-4b2b-aaa0-a6467be3921e","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"c85f2fa7-8602-4a95-b15b-c713aefef720","turn_exchange_id":"8dd9ecd3-7f36-43aa-a84b-885b628cbeea","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c85f2fa7-8602-4a95-b15b-c713aefef720","children":["1eb4c36f-1a05-4909-afd7-948857ef1b70"]},"1eb4c36f-1a05-4909-afd7-948857ef1b70":{"id":"1eb4c36f-1a05-4909-afd7-948857ef1b70","message":{"id":"1eb4c36f-1a05-4909-afd7-948857ef1b70","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1761535141.946056,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering normalization topics","content":"I should mention the Abraham Accords from 2020 and how the later Saudi talks stalled.

Even amid censure and legal scrutiny, that is not the same as \u201crebelling against the nations\u201d in the halakhic sense advanced by anti-Zionists.\n\n- **Regional normalization isn\u2019t dead.** The Abraham Accords remain intact (UAE, Bahrain, Morocco; Sudan stalled), though Saudi normalization is explicitly conditioned on credible movement toward Palestinian statehood\u2014so progress is contingent, not impossible. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2news20\ue201\n\n## Bottom line (clear-eyed)\n\n1) **Yes**\u2014key anti-state fears have materialized: entrenched conflict, moral/legal exposure, domestic constitutional strain, social cleavages, and diaspora blowback. Those are not hypothetical anymore; they\u2019re observable. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search15\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search7\ue201\n\n2) **But** they don\u2019t by themselves settle the original prudential argument for sovereignty. The \u201cdefensive self-organization\u201d thesis was never that a state would eliminate risk\u2014only that it would **change the distribution of risk** by restoring Jewish agency and deterrence. On that metric, Israel still achieves something statelessness never could.\n\n3) **Forward-looking implication:** The decisive question isn\u2019t \u201cstate or no state\u201d anymore; it\u2019s **what constitutional-strategic settlement reduces the long-run tail risks** (for Israelis and Palestinians) while preserving Jewish self-defense capacity. That points to three hard requirements: (i) a credible political horizon for Palestinians (or the conflict metastasizes regionally), (ii) internal constitutional guardrails in Israel (so emergency politics doesn\u2019t corrode liberal institutions), and (iii) a sustainable burden-sharing formula on conscription and economy (or the social contract frays).

incidents in the U.S. in 2024, with 58% tied to criticism of Israel, particularly arising from opposition to Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. This marks the first time that Israel-related incidents\u2014such as anti-Israel signs, chants, and speeches at protests\u2014have constituted the majority of antisemitic activity. The ADL emphasized the need to distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israel and antisemitism but flagged certain narratives, like equating Zionism to Nazism or glorifying violence, as crossing the line. University campuses were identified as hotspots for antisemitic incidents, affecting Jewish student safety. The Trump administration faces criticism for leveraging antisemitism concerns to target pro-Palestinian activists and institutions, such as in the controversial case of detained student Mahmoud Khalil. The ADL itself has drawn criticism from progressive Jewish leaders and academics for its approach. Other findings include a 344% increase in incidents over five years, with 196 assaults reported, 2,606 acts of vandalism (37% involving swastikas), and 647 bomb threats, mainly against synagogues. White supremacist groups were linked to 962 propaganda incidents.
