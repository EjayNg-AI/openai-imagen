Montgomery \u2014 *Design and Analysis of Experiments***  \nProbably the most commonly used full-course text in engineering/science DOE (Design of Experiments). Clear coverage of: completely randomized designs, randomized blocks, factorial and fractional factorial designs, response surface ideas, and analysis workflows. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n2) **Box, Hunter & Hunter \u2014 *Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery***  \nMore *conceptual* and \u201chow to think like an experimenter,\u201d with lots of practical framing (iterative learning, screening vs modeling, etc.). Excellent if the student already has basic stats and wants the *mindset* of experimental design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search15\ue201\n\n3) **Cochran & Cox \u2014 *Experimental Designs***  \nA classic that\u2019s very \u201cdesign catalog + when to use what.\u201d Great for building design intuition and breadth (randomized blocks, Latin squares, etc.), though it can feel more old-school in style. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\n\n## Free, high-quality online notes (great for self-study)\n\n4) **Penn State STAT 503 (open course notes): Design of Experiments**  \nThese notes are unusually readable and structured, with lots of examples across standard DOE topics (randomization principles \u2192 blocks/Latin squares \u2192 factorials \u2192 fractional factorials). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search2\ue201\n\n5) **NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods (DOE sections)**  \nA very practical reference-style resource written for scientists/engineers doing real experiments; good for \u201cwhat should I do next?\u201d and \u201cwhat does this term mean?\u201d style questions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search9\ue201\n\n## Strong pre-college / early undergrad entry points\n\n6) **OpenIntro Statistics (free textbook)**  \nNot a DOE book per se, but one of the best gentle-yet-rigorous introductions to: study design, sampling vs experiments, confounding, random assignment, and causal claims\u2014i.e., the foundations you *must* get right before DOE becomes meaningful. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search27\ue201\n\n7) **OpenIntro: *Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation***  \nIf you want students to *feel* inference and randomization early (rather than treat it as magic formulas), this is a strong modern path. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search15\ue201\n\n## Video support (to make the algebra/ANOVA side click)\n\n8) **StatQuest (Josh Starmer) \u2014 video index / channel**  \nVery good for demystifying ANOVA, linear-model thinking, and the \u201cwhat are we actually testing?\u201d part that makes DOE analysis less opaque. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search4\ue201\n\n## A simple learning path that works\n\n- **Step A (1\u20132 weeks):** OpenIntro chapters on study design + experiments + confounding + random assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search27\ue202turn1search11\ue201  \n- **Step B (2\u20134 weeks):** Penn State STAT 503 Lessons 1\u20134 (principles, one-way ANOVA context, blocks/Latin squares). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search6\ue201  \n- **Step C (4\u20138 weeks):** Move into Montgomery *or* Box/Hunter depending on whether you want a more \u201cstandard curriculum\u201d (Montgomery) or \u201cexperimenter mindset\u201d (Box/Hunter). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201\n\nIf you tell me your target domain (biology/psych vs engineering/manufacturing vs \u201cgeneral math enrichment\u201d) and whether you want **calculus/light linear algebra** assumed, I can rank these into a tight \u201cprimary + companion + exercises\u201d bundle."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201","start_idx":589,"end_idx":608,"safe_urls":["https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design%2Band%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BExperiments%2C%2B10th%2BEdition-p-9781119492443","https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design%2Band%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BExperiments%2C%2B10th%2BEdition-p-9781119492443?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design%2Band%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BExperiments%2C%2B10th%2BEdition-p-9781119492443?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Design and Analysis of Experiments, 10th Edition","url":"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design%2Band%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BExperiments%2C%2B10th%2BEdition-p-9781119492443?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Design and Analysis of Experiments provides a rigorous introduction to product and process design improvement through quality and performance optimization.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Wiley"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search15\ue201","start_idx":946,"end_idx":979,"safe_urls":["https://hwbdocs.env.nm.gov/Los%20Alamos%20National%20Labs/TA%2054/11528.pdf","https://hwbdocs.env.nm.gov/Los%20Alamos%20National%20Labs/TA%2054/11528.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistics%2Bfor%2BExperimenters%3A%2BDesign%2C%2BInnovation%2C%2Band%2BDiscovery%2C%2B2nd%2BEdition-p-9780471718130","https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistics%2Bfor%2BExperimenters%3A%2BDesign%2C%2BInnovation%2C%2Band%2BDiscovery%2C%2B2nd%2BEdition-p-9780471718130?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistics%2Bfor%2BExperimenters%3A%2BDesign%2C%2BInnovation%2C%2Band%2BDiscovery%2C%2B2nd%2BEdition-p-9780471718130?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Design, Innovation, and Discovery, 2nd Edition","url":"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistics%2Bfor%2BExperimenters%3A%2BDesign%2C%2BInnovation%2C%2Band%2BDiscovery%2C%2B2nd%2BEdition-p-9780471718130?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery, 2nd Edition.
