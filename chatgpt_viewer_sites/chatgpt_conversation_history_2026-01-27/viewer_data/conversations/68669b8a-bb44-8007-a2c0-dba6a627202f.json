The refrigerator hummed a taunting lullaby, a siren song of leftovers and broken dreams.

She grabbed a slice of cheese, the sad kind that comes individually wrapped like it has secrets. She peeled it with the reverence of a monk unrolling sacred scrolls, then folded it like an apology and ate it in two unenthusiastic bites.\n\nStill hollow. Still gnawed.\n\nShe checked the pantry next. It was less a pantry and more a shrine to impulse purchases: six cans of coconut milk, expired quinoa, a lone Pop-Tart in a torn foil wrapper, and a bag of rice that had clearly been opened with either panic or rage. She stared at it like maybe, just maybe, rice could become dinner without involving her in any way.\n\nThe hunger yawned deeper now \u2014 not just for food, but for something warm, comforting, and ideally made by someone else. Maybe she\u2019d call in. Maybe she\u2019d cook. Or maybe she\u2019d just sit there, dramatically lit by fridge-glow, communing with the void in her stomach like it was an old friend.\n\nShould I keep going, or are you emotionally full now?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-67edaaa3d3a081918205d0c470f00a32","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"7bb9ebc0-3c8b-468c-95f8-a82f81fdce2b","request_id":"959749854c14fd02-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7bb9ebc0-3c8b-468c-95f8-a82f81fdce2b","children":[]}}}
