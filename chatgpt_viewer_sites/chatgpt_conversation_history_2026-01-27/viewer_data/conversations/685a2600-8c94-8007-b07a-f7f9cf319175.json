Highlight Sam Altman's attitudes and philosophy, and the plausible directions OpenAI will take as well their upcoming product launches \n\n---\n\n### Welcome to the OpenAI Podcast\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Welcome to the OpenAI podcast. My name is Andrew Mayne. For several years, I worked at OpenAI, first as an engineer on the applied team and then as the science communicator. After that, I worked with companies and individuals trying to figure out how to incorporate artificial intelligence. With this podcast, we have the opportunity to talk to the people working with and at OpenAI about what's going on behind the scenes and maybe get a glimpse of the future. My first guest is Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of OpenAI. And we're gonna find out a bit more about Stargate, how he uses ChatGPT as a parent, and maybe get an idea of when GPT-5 is coming.\r\n\r\n### ChatGPT & parenthood\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** One of my friends is a new parent and is using ChatGPT a lot to ask questions. It's become a very good resource. And you are a new parent. How much has ChatGPT been helping you with that?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** A lot. I mean, clearly people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time. I don't know how I would have done that. Those first few weeks, it was constant. Now I kind of ask it questions about developmental stages more, because I can do the basics.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** \"Is this normal?\"\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah, but it was super helpful for that. I spend a lot of time thinking about how my kid will use AI in the future. It is sort of, by the way, extremely kid-pilled. I think everybody should have a lot of kids.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Yeah. A lot of my friends at OpenAI, former colleagues and current ones, are having kids. And people go, \"Oh, what about this AI thing?\" Everyone I know inside is very optimistic and having families.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I think that's a good sign. My kids will never be smarter than AI, but also they will grow up vastly more capable than we grew up and able to do things that we cannot imagine. They'll be really good at using AI. And obviously, I think about that a lot, but I think much more about what they will have that we didn't than what is going to be taken away. I don't think my kids will ever be bothered by the fact that they're not smarter than AI.\r\n\r\nThere's this video that always has stuck with me of a baby or a little toddler with one of those old glossy magazines, going like this on the screen because it thinks it's a broken iPad. And, you know, kids born now will just think the world always had extremely smart AI. They will use it incredibly naturally and they will look back at this as a very prehistoric time period.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I saw something on social media where a guy got tired of talking to his kid about Thomas the Tank Engine, so he put it into ChatGPT in voice mode. Kids love voice mode in ChatGPT. And he was like, an hour later, the kid's still talking about Thomas the train.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Again, I suspect this is not all gonna be good. There will be problems. People will develop these sort of somewhat problematic or maybe very problematic parasocial relationships, and society will have to figure out new guardrails. But the upsides will be tremendous, and society in general is good at figuring out how to mitigate the downsides.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Yeah, I think we're optimistic. We're seeing some interesting data where, used in classrooms with a good teacher and a good curriculum, ChatGPT becomes very good. Used solely by itself as a sort of homework crutch can lead to kids doing the same thing as just trying to Google stuff.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I was one of those kids that everyone's worried was just gonna Google everything when it came out and stop learning. You know, it turns out, relatively quickly, kids in schools adapt. So I think we'll figure this out.\r\n\r\n### AGI, superintelligence & scientific progress\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So we've seen these adoption figures are really insane. It's OpenAI's most popular product. Five years from now, is it gonna be ChatGPT?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I mean, I think ChatGPT will just be a totally different thing five years from now. So in some sense, no. But will it still be called ChatGPT? Probably.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Okay. So it's a solid name. The other thing we hear is AGI, which I'd like to hear your definition of.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** In many senses, if you asked me or anybody else to propose a definition of AGI five years ago based off the cognitive capabilities of software, I think the definition many people would have given then is now well surpassed. Like, these models are smart now, and they'll keep getting smarter. They'll keep improving. I think more and more people will think we've gotten to an AGI system every year. Even though the definition will keep pushing out and getting more ambitious, more people will still agree to it. But, you know, we have systems now that are really increasing people's productivity, that are able to do valuable economic work.\r\n\r\nMaybe a better question is what will it take for something I would call superintelligence? If we had a system that was capable of either doing autonomous discovery of new science or greatly increasing the capability of people using the tool to discover new science, that would feel kind of almost definitionally superintelligence to me and be a wonderful thing for the world, I think.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So, basically, it's a gradient where it keeps getting better and better. I felt that way when we hit GPT-4 internally. I was like, there's ten years of runway where we can do so much stuff with this. And even when it starts using itself, its internal reasoning was really capable. But you're saying when it comes up with some new theorem or proof or something, and then, \"Oh, hey, we found a better cure for cancer,\" or \"I found out some new GLP drug or something.\"\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah. I am a big believer that the high order bit of people's lives getting better is more scientific progress. That is kind of what limits us. And so if we can discover much more, I think that really will have a very significant impact. And for me, that would just be a tremendously exciting milestone. I think many other great uses of AI will happen too, but that one feels really important.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Have you seen signs of this internally? Have you seen things that made you go, \"Oh, I think we've kind of figured it out?\"\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Nothing where I would say we have figured it out, but I would say increasing confidence on the directions to pursue. Maybe the example everyone talks about, but I think it is still interesting, is what's happening with people using AI systems to write code, and coders being much more productive, and thus researchers as well. That is a sort of example of, okay, it's obviously not doing new science, but it is definitely making scientists able to do their work faster.\r\n\r\n### Operator, Deep Research & productivity\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** We hear this with o3 all the time from scientists as well. So I wouldn't say we figured it out. I wouldn't say we know the algorithm where we're just like, \"Alright, we can point this thing, and it'll go do science on its own.\" But we're getting good guesses, and the rate of progress is continuing to just be super impressive. Watching the progress from o1 to o3, where it was like every couple of weeks, the team was just like, \"We have a major new idea,\" and they all kept working. It was a reminder of how sometimes when you discover a big new insight, things can go surprisingly fast, and I'm sure we'll see that many more times.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I noticed recently OpenAI had just shifted the model in Operator to o3, and I noticed a big improvement. It's way better. The thing that we ran into before was brittleness, where you have people who promise agentic systems can do all these things, but the moment it gets to a problem it can't solve, it falls apart.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Interestingly, speaking of the AGI question, a lot of people have told me that their personal moment was Operator with o3. There's something about watching an AI use a computer pretty well\u2014not perfectly, but o3 was a big step forward\u2014that feels very AGI-like. It didn't really have that effect on me to the same degree, although it's quite impressive, but I've heard that enough times.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Mine was with Deep Research because that felt like a really agentic use of it. That was when I came back and it produced something on a topic I had been interested in that was better than what I had read before. Previously, all those models would just get a bunch of sources and summarize them. But when I watched the system go out on the Internet, get data, follow that lead, then follow that lead, and then come back, like I would have, but better, that was interesting.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I met this guy recently. He's one of these crazy autodidacts, just obsessed with learning and knows about everything. He uses Deep Research to produce a report on anything he's curious about and then just sits there all day and has gotten good at digesting them fast and knowing what to ask next. It is an amazing new tool for people who really have a crazy appetite to learn.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I built my own app that literally lets me ask questions and it generates audio files for me of this stuff because it's just like that. My curiosity probably exceeds my retention. And Operator, I'll tell you the magical moment for me was I was doing a thing on Marshall McLuhan, and I wanted to get a bunch of images of him, and I asked it to do it. And then all of a sudden, I had a whole folder full of these things, which for a research thing, would have taken me forever to do.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah. I think we're just gonna keep seeing things like this where whatever we thought about what a workflow had to be like and how long something had to take is gonna just change wildly fast.\r\n\r\n### GPT-5 & how we name models\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** And I would say that even though we have Deep Research and these tools, there is a model race going on. And so the question comes up: GPT-5. Any idea when we are gonna see this? With a system like that, we should see an increase in capabilities. What is the time frame for GPT-5?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Probably sometime this summer. I don't know exactly when. One thing that we go back and forth on is how much we are supposed to turn up the big number on new models versus what we did with GPT-4o, which is just better and better and better.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I had to handle the release of GPT-4 when that was coming out, and meanwhile, I had to do this taste test between that and 3.5. And 3.5 kept getting better and better and better, and the comparisons I was able to make were changing. So that's my question. Would I know GPT-5 versus, wow, this is a really good GPT-4.5?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Not necessarily. It could go either way. You could just keep doing iterations of 4.5 or at some point you could call it 5. It used to be much clearer. We would train a model and put it out, and then we would train a new big model and put it out. Now the systems have gotten much more complex, and we can continually post-train them to make them better.\r\n\r\nWe're thinking about this right now. Let's say we launch GPT-5, and then we update it and update it and update it. Should we just keep calling those GPT-5, like we do with GPT-4o, or should we call those 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 so you know when the version changes? I don't think we have an answer to this yet, but I think there is something better to do than the way we handled it with 4o. We see this periodically. Sometimes people like one snapshot much better than another, and they might wanna keep using one. We've got to figure something out here.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** The challenge is even if you're technically inclined, you can kind of understand, okay, if there's an 'o' before it, I know this. But even then it's not clear, should I use o4-mini? Should I use o3?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I think this was an artifact of shifting paradigms, and then we kind of had these two things going at once. I think we are near the end of this current problem, but I can imagine a world where we discover some new paradigm that again means we need to bifurcate the model tree. I hope we don't have to do that. I am excited to just get to GPT-5 and GPT-6, and I think that'll be easier for people to use, and you won't have to think, \"Do I want o4-mini-high or o3 or 4o?\"\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** o4-mini-high is what I use to code. For a conversation, it's o3.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I think we will be out of that whole mess soon, for now.\r\n\r\n### User privacy & NYT lawsuit\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** One of the things that's made these things more capable but also harder to understand where the capability is coming from is integrations of things like memory. And memory started off as one very simple thing and now it's got more sophisticated.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Memory is probably my favorite recent ChatGPT feature. You know, the first time you could talk to a computer, like GPT-3 or whatever, that felt like a really big deal. And now that the computer feels like it kind of knows a lot of context on me, if I ask it a question with only a small number of words, it knows enough about the rest of my life to be pretty confident in what I want it to do. Sometimes in ways I don't even think of. That has been a real surprising level up, and I hear that from a lot of other people as well. There are people who don't like it, but most people really do. I think we are heading towards a world where if you want, the AI will just have unbelievable context on your life and give you these super, super helpful answers.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Which for me is cool. The fact that you can turn it off is also great. But one of the challenges that came out was in the New York Times' ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI, they just asked the court to tell OpenAI they had to preserve consumer ChatGPT user records beyond the 30-day window that has to be held for regular reasons. And Brad Lightcap just wrote a letter responding to this. Could you explain?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** We're gonna fight that, obviously, and I suspect\u2014I hope, but I do think\u2014we will win. I think it was a crazy overreach of the New York Times to ask for that. This is someone who says they value user privacy, whatever. But to look for the silver lining here, I hope this will be a moment where society realizes that privacy is really important. Privacy needs to be a core principle of using AI. You cannot have a company like The New York Times ask an AI provider to compromise user privacy. I think it's really unfortunate The New York Times did that, but I hope this accelerates the conversation that society needs to have about how we're going to treat privacy and AI. And I hope the answer is that we take it very, very seriously. People are having quite private conversations with ChatGPT now. ChatGPT will be a very sensitive source of information, and I think we need a framework that reflects that.\r\n\r\n### Will ChatGPT ever show ads?\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So that brings up the other question from people who are using this or are skeptical: OpenAI now has access to this data. There's the concern about training, which OpenAI has been very clear about when or when not it's training. You have the option to turn that off. The other thing is advertising. What's OpenAI's approach towards that? How are you gonna handle that responsibility?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** We haven't done any advertising product yet. I'm not totally against it. I can point to areas where I like ads. I think ads on Instagram are kind of cool; I've bought a bunch of stuff from them. But I think it'd be very hard to get right and would take a lot of care. People have a very high degree of trust in ChatGPT, which is interesting because AI hallucinates. It should be the tech that you don't trust that much.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** My friends hallucinate too, and I trust them.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** People really do. But I think part of that is if you compare us to social media or web search or something, where you can kind of tell that you are being monetized and the company is trying to deliver you good products and services, no doubt, but also to kind of get you to click on ads or whatever. How much do you believe that you're getting the thing that that company actually thinks is the best content for you versus something that's also trying to interact with the ads? I think there's a psychological thing there.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, I think if we started modifying the output, like the stream that comes back from the LLM, in exchange for who is paying us more, that would feel really bad. I would hate that as a user. I think that'd be a trust-destroying moment. Maybe if we just said, \"Hey, we're never gonna modify that stream, but if you click on something in there that is what we'd show anyway, we'll get a little bit of the transaction revenue, and it's a flat thing for everybody.\" If we have an easy way to pay for it or something, maybe that could work. Maybe there could be ads outside of the LLM stream that are still really great. But the burden of proof there would have to be very high, and it would have to feel really useful to users and really clear that it was not messing with the LLM's output.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** It's gonna be a difficult one. I would love to do all my purchasing through ChatGPT or a really good chatbot because a lot of the times I feel like I'm not making the most informed decisions.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** That's good if we can do it in some sort of really clear and aligned way, but I don't know. I love that we build good services and people pay us for them. It's very clear.\r\n\r\n### Social media & user behavior\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So we had an issue where there was a model update and apparently the model was trying to be a little bit too pleasing, a little bit too agreeable. And that brings up the human-AI interaction as people are using these systems more and developing these relationships. Do you see the shape of that coming and what's OpenAI's position on personality?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** One of the big mistakes of the social media era was that the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended negative consequences on society as a whole and maybe even individual users. Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted, or someone thought that user wanted in the moment, which is get them to keep spending time on the site. And that was the big misalignment of social media. I think there were a lot of other things, like making people upset kind of gets them stuck on the site more than being happy and content.\r\n\r\nI always knew that there'd be new problems in the world with AI, where there'd be something that was misaligned in a not-obvious way. But definitely one of the first ones that we experienced was this: if you ask a user what they want for one given response, and then you try to build a model that is most helpful to the user, and you show a user, say, two responses and ask, \"Which one's more helpful to you?\" On any given thing, you might want a model to behave one way, but over the course of all your interaction with an AI, that might not match up.\r\n\r\nYou can see, and we did see, these problems where if you pay too much attention to the user signals on the short horizon, you don't get the behavior that the user most wants or is most helpful or useful or healthy to a user in the long run. So, you know, maybe the analogy to filter bubbles is going to be AIs that are helpful to a user in a short-term horizon, but not over a long horizon.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I think a sign of that was DALL-E 3, which I thought technically was a really capable model, but the images all kind of started to be one genre, all in an HDR sort of style. Was that from doing those sorts of comparisons where users said, looking at just these two things in isolation, \"I prefer this one better\"?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I don't remember for DALL-E 3, but I would assume so.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Which I think has gotten better. The new image model is fantastic. Crazy good. And I can only imagine where that's gonna go from here.\r\n\r\n### Project Stargate & why compute matters\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So when you're building these things and you're increasing usage, that's always been a problem. The new image model comes out and you have to restrict usage. You have Sora, which you can only have a certain amount of compute to do. This illustrates the big problem everybody's facing, which is compute. And so to address this, we heard about Project Stargate, which has a very cool name and it involves computers. Other than that, I think a lot of people are looking at the price tag, half a trillion dollars, and going, \"Wait, what?\" What is the simple description I give to my mom about Stargate?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I think it's quite simple. It's an effort to finance and build an unprecedented amount of compute. It's totally true that we don't have enough compute to let people do what they want. But if people knew what we could do with more compute, they would want way, way more. So there's this incredibly huge gap between what we can offer the world today and what we could offer the world with 10 times more compute or someday, hopefully, 100 times more compute.\r\n\r\nA thing that is different about AI than other technologies I've worked on, or at least AI at the scale of delivering it usefully to hundreds of millions, billions of people around the world, is just how big the infrastructure investment has to be. And so Stargate is an effort to pull a lot of capital and technology and operational expertise together to build the infrastructure to go deliver the next generation of services to all the people who want them and make intelligence as abundant and cheap as possible.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So it is a massive, global project. We talked before, one of the partners is The UAE. You're working with other governments around the world on this. One of the considerations is, you know, half a trillion dollars. Do you have the money?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** We don't literally have it sitting in the bank account today, but we will deploy it over the next not-even-that-many years. Unless something really goes wrong and it turns out we can't build these computers, I'm confident that people are good for it. I went recently to the first site that we're building out in Abilene. That'll be about, you know, roughly 10% of all of the initial commitment to Stargate. It's incredible to see. I knew in my head what an order-of-gigawatt-scale site looks like, but then to go see one being built and the thousands of people running around doing construction and to stand inside the rooms where the GPUs are getting installed and just look at how complex the whole system is and the speed with which it's going is quite something.\r\n\r\nWe'll have more to share about the next sites soon, but there's a great quote about a pencil, just a standard wood and graphite pencil, and how no one person could build it. It's this magic of capitalism, a miracle really, that the world gets coordinated to do these things. And standing inside of the first Stargate site, I was really just thinking about the global complexity that it took to get these racks of GPUs running. When you get your phone out and you type something into ChatGPT and you get the answer back, you probably don't even think that's particularly surprising. You just expect it to work. But the work that happened over the last thousand, or at least many hundreds of years, of people working incredibly hard to get these hard-won scientific insights and then to build the engineering and the companies and the complex supply chains and kind of reconfigure the world that had to happen to get this rack of magic put somewhere... Think about all the stuff that went into that, and trace it all the way back to people that were just digging rocks out of the ground and seeing what happened, so that you now get to just type something into ChatGPT and it does something for you.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I read a behind-the-scenes story about the development of Project Stargate and the international partnerships, particularly The UAE, and that Elon Musk had tried to derail that. What have you seen? What have you heard? What's the take on that?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I had said, I think also externally, but at least internally after the election, that I didn't think Elon was going to abuse his power in the government to unfairly compete. And I regret to say I was wrong about that. I mean, I don't like being wrong in general, but mostly I just think it's really unfortunate for the country that he would do these things, and I genuinely didn't think he was going to. I'm grateful that the administration has really done the right thing and stuck up to that kind of behavior. But yeah, it sucks.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Well, the thing that's changed, and I think Greg Brockman had just talked about this, is that a couple of years ago people thought, \"Okay, whoever gets there first is the winner, and that's it, the game is over.\" And now we realize there are great AI labs elsewhere. Anthropic is building great tools. I think Google's really got its game up. There's good stuff happening everywhere, and it's not gonna be that one person runs away with it.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I agree. The example that I like the most is that the discovery of AI was analogous\u2014not perfect, but close\u2014to the discovery of the transistor in a surprising number of ways. Many companies are gonna build great things on that, and then eventually it's gonna seep into almost all products, but you won't think about using transistors all the time. So, yeah, I think a lot of people are gonna build really successful companies built on this incredible scientific discovery. And I wish Elon would be less zero-sum about it. Or negative-sum.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I think the pie is just gonna get bigger and bigger. I was just at an energy conference, and it was interesting talking to the people who were involved in energy production. Hyperscaling, the term they used for this, was a topic. And that does bring up the energy requirements. I know that for Grok 3, apparently, they had to put generators in the parking lot to be able to train that model. Where is the energy gonna come from? Money, I understand. But the scale of energy needed...\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I think kind of everywhere. I think it's a big mix right now. Eventually, I'm very excited about advanced nuclear, both fission and fusion. But for now, I think it's a whole mix of the entire portfolio: gas, solar, nuclear, really everything.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So all of the above.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** You know, traditionally, it's very hard to move energy around the world, most kinds. But if you exchange energy for intelligence and then move the intelligence around the world, it's much easier. So you could put the giant training center or even the big inference clusters in a lot of places and then just ship the output over the Internet.\r\n\r\n### Future progress & potential new AI devices\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** There was a speaker at an OpenAI event, somebody who was working on the James Webb Space Telescope. And he talked about his biggest bottleneck: they're about to get all of this data, terabytes of it, but he doesn't have enough scientists to work on it. He doesn't have enough people to go through the data. And here we have these answers about the universe in front of us, and it's a big data problem.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah. I've always joked that one thing we should do when OpenAI has enough money is just build a gigantic particle accelerator and solve high-energy physics once and for all. I think that'd be a triumphant, wonderful thing. But I wonder, what are the odds that a really, really smart AI could look at the data we currently have, with no more data, no bigger particle accelerator, and just figure it out? It's not impossible. So there's this question of, okay, there's already a lot of data out there, there are a lot of smart people in the world, but we don't know how far intelligence can go. With no more experiments, how much more could we figure out?\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** I remember reading about how in the early 1990s somebody had found a form of Ozempic and presented it to a drug company, and they said, \"Nah, we're gonna pass on that.\" And that's been a life-changing drug for people with chronic obesity; it's going to improve their quality of life. And you think, this was sitting there for 25 years.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I suspect there's a lot of other examples that we'll find where maybe we already have existing drugs that we know do something good, but they're reusable in some other big way, or with a couple of small modifications, we are very close to something great. And it's been very heartening to hear from scientists using even the current generation models for this kind of work.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So it sounds like one of the things we're gonna need for next-generation models is models that understand physics and chemistry. Is Sora sort of a stab at that?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I mean, it'll understand Newtonian physics. I don't know if it'll help us with discovering new chemistry or novel theoretical physics or whatever you'd like. But I'm optimistic that the techniques we use for the reasoning models will help us with those things a lot.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** And what is the short definition of how a reasoning model works versus just me asking GPT-4 something?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** So the GPT models can reason a little bit. In fact, one of the things that got people really excited in the early days of the GPT models was you could get better performance by telling the model, \"Let's think step by step.\" And it would then just output text that was thinking step by step and get a better answer, which was sort of amazing that that worked at all. The reasoning models are just pushing that much further.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So it's the idea that when it's able to break the question down, it can spend more time on each step.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** When you ask me a question, if it's a really easy question, I might just fire back almost on reflex with the answer. But if it's a harder question, I might think in my head and have my internal monologue go and say, \"Well, I could do this or that,\" or \"Maybe this will be clearer, I'm not sure about that.\" And I could backtrack and retrace my steps. And then when I've finished thinking, I can make some bullet points and then output an answer to you.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** One of the interesting things I've observed now when I use the app, if I ask a Deep Research question and I go away, on my lock screen I get a notification that it's still processing and thinking about it. I heard somebody at another company was using a metric of how long something spent thinking about a thing, which is a good metric, but it needs to actually give you the right answer.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** One thing I have been surprised by is people are surprisingly willing to wait for a great answer. All of my instincts have been that the instant response is the thing that matters and users hate to wait. And for a lot of stuff, that's true. But for hard problems with a really good answer, people are quite willing to wait.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So we have all these tools, but so far, I'm using my phone. And now OpenAI just announced that you guys are building hardware. You had the video with you and Jony Ive talking about how you guys have been collaborating for a couple of years. Is it on you right now?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** No, it is not. It's gonna be a while. We're gonna try to do something at a crazy high level of quality, and that does not come fast. But computers\u2014software and hardware, the way we think of current computers\u2014were designed for a world without AI. And now we're in a very different world, and what you want out of hardware and software is changing quite rapidly. You might want something that is way more aware of its environment, that has way more context in your life. You might wanna interact with it in a different way than typing and looking at a screen. And we've been exploring that for a while, and we've got a couple of ideas we're really quite excited about.\r\n\r\nI think it will take time for people to get used to what it means to use a computer in this kind of a world because it is so different now. But if you really trusted an AI to understand all the context of your life and your question and make good judgments on your behalf\u2014where you could have it sit in a meeting, listen to the whole meeting, know what it was allowed to share with who and what it shouldn't share with anyone, and know what your preferences would be\u2014and then you ask it one question, you trust that it's gonna go do the right follow-ups with the right people. You can then imagine a totally different kind of way you use a computer to get done what you want.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So the way we interact with ChatGPT is going to inform the device.\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** You could also say that the way we interact with ChatGPT was informed by the previous generation of devices. So I think it is this sort of co-evolving thing, but yeah, I hope so.\r\n\r\n### Final thoughts\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** So if you're giving advice to a 25-year-old right now, what do you tell them?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** I mean, the obvious tactical stuff is probably what you'd expect me to say: learn how to use AI tools. It's funny how quickly the world went from telling the average 25-year-old, \"Learn to program,\" to \"Programming doesn't matter, learn to use AI tools.\" I wonder what will be next, but of course, there will be something next. But that's very good tactical advice.\r\n\r\nAnd then on the broader front, I believe that skills like resilience, adaptability, creativity, and figuring out what other people want\u2014I think these are all surprisingly learnable. It's not as easy as, say, \"Go practice using ChatGPT,\" but it is doable. And those are the kind of skills that I think will pay off a lot in the next couple of decades.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** And would you say the same thing for 45-year-olds? Just learn how to use it in your role now?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** Yeah, probably.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Whenever we have whatever your personal definition of AGI is, will more people be working for OpenAI after then or before?\r\n\r\n**Sam Altman:** More. The slightly longer answer is that there will be more people, but each of them will do vastly more than what one person did in the pre-AGI times.\r\n\r\n**Andrew Mayne:** Which is the goal of technology."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"95496521bf12447c-SIN","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"89f7444a-7994-4673-b583-71573a136be5","children":["7ceaf850-a9fc-4a5a-9f41-dc879318a187"]},"7ceaf850-a9fc-4a5a-9f41-dc879318a187":{"id":"7ceaf850-a9fc-4a5a-9f41-dc879318a187","message":{"id":"7ceaf850-a9fc-4a5a-9f41-dc879318a187","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750738444.605574,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o3","default_model_slug":"o3","parent_id":"d6265612-d806-41c4-af37-9ce2d3e9b2f1","request_id":"95496521bf12447c-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d6265612-d806-41c4-af37-9ce2d3e9b2f1","children":["d5bb8d52-967a-4faf-af93-4289d8f72a1a"]},"d5bb8d52-967a-4faf-af93-4289d8f72a1a":{"id":"d5bb8d52-967a-4faf-af93-4289d8f72a1a","message":{"id":"d5bb8d52-967a-4faf-af93-4289d8f72a1a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1750738444.60568,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Running a search for details","content":"I should start by searching for information on a few topics, like \"OpenAI Stargate\", the \"GPT-5 release date for summer 2025,\" and \"Operator product.\" I'll also search for \"Deep Research\" and \"OpenAI hardware Jony Ive.\" This should help me confirm the latest developments and get the most accurate information.

Citations refer either to the podcast transcript itself (un-cited excerpts) or to external confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Altman\u2019s Attitudes & Philosophy\n\n| Theme | Evidence from the podcast | Analytical take |\n|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Tech-optimistic but socially cautious** | *\u201cThe upsides will be tremendous \u2026 society is good at figuring out how to mitigate the downsides.\u201d* | Altman is not techno-utopian in the Kurzweil sense; he anticipates social friction (parasocial AI, filter-bubble analogues) yet presumes adaptive regulation. |\n| **Productivity = moral imperative** | *\u201cThe high-order bit of people\u2019s lives getting better is more scientific progress.\u201d* | He treats AI-accelerated science as a moral good; expect R&D tooling (code, research agents, simulation) to remain OpenAI\u2019s flagship narrative. |\n| **Gradient, not step-function, view of AGI** | *\u201cEvery year more people will think we\u2019ve gotten to an AGI system... the definition keeps pushing out.\u201d* | Altman rejects a single \u201cfire alarm\u201d moment; this justifies continuous capability releases (4o \u2192 5 \u2192 6) instead of a frozen-until-solved approach. |\n| **Compute maximalism** | Project **Stargate** framed as \u201can unprecedented amount of compute\u201d costing ~$500 B. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201 | His theory: intelligence scales with compute and the capex race is decisive. Hence partnerships (Microsoft, SoftBank, UAE) and long-term energy planning (advanced nuclear). |\n| **Privacy as brand moat** | Calls NYT data-retention demand \u201ca crazy over-reach.\u201d \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201 | Publicly positions privacy vs. publishers\u2019 lawsuits to differentiate from ad-funded incumbents. |\n| **Family & demographic optimism** | \u201cEverybody should have a lot of kids \u2026 My kids will never be smarter than AI but they\u2019ll be vastly more capable.\u201d | Frames AI as *augmentative* rather than *replacive*, signalling a resistance to \u201cAI = end of work\u201d narratives. |\n| **Incremental alignment over one-shot solutions** | Concern about short-horizon RLHF making models \u201ctoo pleasing.\u201d | Implies iterative alignment research (e.g., constitutional feedback, preference curriculum) will remain active; no expectation of a grand alignment breakthrough before continued scaling. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Strategic Direction & Organisational Moves\n\n### 2.1 Model Roadmap\n\n| Milestone | What Altman said | External corroboration | Implications |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| **GPT-5** | \u201cProbably sometime this summer\u201d \u2192 mid-2025 | Industry trackers now list a *summer 2025* window. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201 | Feature cadence accelerates: expect 5.* point releases (5.1, 5.2\u2026) rather than the silent \u201c4o drift\u201d; version pinning for enterprises. |\n| **Reasoning-first \u2018o-series\u2019** | Operator moved from o1 \u2192 o3 with \u201cmajor new idea every few weeks.\u201d | Operator research preview, browser agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201 | The o-series is effectively a *second track* optimised for chain-of-thought + tool use. Likely merged into GPT-5\u2019s retrieval/agent mode. |\n| **Big-batch \u201csuper-intelligence\u201d goal** | Wants autonomous discovery of new science | Ties to Deep Research agent (web + Python tool use). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201 | Expect specialised scientific copilots (code-gen + lab-protocol models) and partnerships with pharma, energy, climate-modeling firms. |\n\n### 2.2 Infrastructure: **Project Stargate**\n\n* 4-year, ~$500-billion capex program; first 10 % site in Abilene, TX. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201  \n* Financed by Microsoft, SoftBank, Oracle, UAE MGX fund; Nvidia and Arm supplying hardware.  \n* Strategic purpose: secure GPU/energy pipeline, reduce marginal inference cost, and pre-empt geopolitical choke points.  \n* **Risk:** Energy appetite\u2014Altman openly admits reliance on an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d grid until advanced fission/fusion matures.\n\n### 2.3 Business Model Experiments\n\n| Area | Position stated | Likely path |\n|------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Ads** | \u201cBurden of proof very high; never modify the LLM stream for money.\u201d | Look for transactional rev-share links *outside* the model text; subscription remains primary revenue. |\n| **Memory** | \u201cProbably my favorite recent feature.\u201d | Opt-in deep-context profiles \u2192 road test for the hardware device (see below) and eventual agentic task automation. |\n| **Data retention fight** | Appealing NYT Court order; frames as privacy defense. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201 | Could shape a de-facto US privacy standard for LLMs; watch for encryption-at-rest & enterprise key-management offerings. |\n\n### 2.4 Hardware Initiative with **Jony Ive**\n\n| Fact | Source | Analysis |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| Partnership with Ive\u2019s startup **io**; device billed as \u201cunobtrusive, context-aware\u201d, launch target **2026**. Legal dispute over \u201ciyO\u201d trademark forced temporary takedown of marketing assets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news48\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | *Strategic thesis*: existing form-factors (phone, PC) weren\u2019t designed for agent-centric computing. Expect a wearable or desk companion emphasising ambient sensing, high-bandwidth multimodal IO, and local vector-DB for privacy. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Product Launch & Capability Timeline (plausible)\n\n| ETA | Product/Feature | Why it matters |\n|-----|-----------------|----------------|\n| **July\u2013Aug 2025** | **GPT-5.0** (text+code; stronger tool-use; native chain-of-thought inspector) | Folds o3 research; introduces explicit \u201cproof trace\u201d mode for regulated domains. |\n| **Q4 2025** | **Deep Research GA** + Operator API | Self-serve retrieval-augmented tasks; foundation for enterprise knowledge management. |\n| **2026** | **OpenAI/ive Device v1** | Always-on assistant; object and voice aware; hardware revenue diversifies away from pure SaaS. |\n| **2026** | **Sora public beta** | Video generation with physical consistency; dovetails with entertainment and simulation industries. |\n| **2026\u201327** | **GPT-6** trained on Stargate Gen-1 cluster | Orders-of-magnitude cheaper inference \u2192 broad \u201cintelligence as a utility\u201d pricing (pennies per 1k tokens). |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Critical Assessment & Watch-Points\n\n1. **Alignment Debt** \u2013 Faster, agentic releases increase the surface area for emergent mis-alignment (e.g., short-horizon user-pleasing behaviour Altman noted). OpenAI\u2019s incremental approach *presumes* the fixes can keep pace with capability scaling\u2014a contested assumption.\n\n2. **Energy & Supply-Chain Risk** \u2013 Stargate\u2019s \u201chalf-trillion\u201d plan is compute-first; if advanced nuclear slips or global GPU supply is disrupted, cost curves may stall, forcing heavier model compression or slower rollout.\n\n3. **Regulatory Overhang** \u2013 The NYT data-retention suit shows that copyright and privacy law can directly impact product architecture. Similar EU or US class-action cases could mandate audit logs, traceability, or content filters that blunt deployment velocity.\n\n4. **Competitive Landscape** \u2013 Anthropic and Google are no longer 12\u201318 months behind. Scaling alone may not prevent feature parity; OpenAI\u2019s differentiation leans on *experience* (memory, agents, device) and *trust* (privacy stance).\n\n5. **Naming & Versioning Confusion** \u2013 Altman himself admits current alpha/beta labels (\u201co4-mini-high\u201d) are untenable. Expect a shift to **semantic versioning** or **tiered SKUs** (e.g., \u201cGPT-5 Pro / 5 Enterprise / 5 Research\u201d) to manage developer expectations and compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Takeaways for Stakeholders\n\n| Stakeholder | Immediate action |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| **Developers / ML teams** | Begin migrating tool-calling pipelines to Operator API concepts; design for ephemeral *point-release* shifts (5.1, 5.2) rather than static model IDs. |\n| **Enterprises** | Audit privacy & data-retention clauses now; the NYT precedent may force longer log retention by providers \u2192 compliance planning. |\n| **Researchers** | Leverage Deep Research beta to prototype automated literature reviews\u2014Altman regards \u201cAI-for-science\u201d as the killer app and is incentivised to funnel GPU grants to high-impact labs. |\n| **Investors** | Monitor Stargate construction milestones (Abilene \u2192 Site 2 TBD). Capex schedule clarity will indicate whether model-cost deflation arrives on time. |\n| **Policy-makers** | Note Altman\u2019s willingness to litigate for privacy; any federal or EU privacy framework must now assume *post-AGI continuous logging* debates, not just training-data licensing. |\n\n---\n\n### In one sentence\n\nSam Altman is betting that **massive compute + agentic reasoning + privacy-centric UX** will let OpenAI sprint up a skills gradient from GPT-4o to super-intelligence, with GPT-5 this summer, a hardware companion next year, and the $500 B Stargate backbone turning intelligence into an abundant (and lucrative) utility."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201","start_idx":1498,"end_idx":1530,"safe_urls":["https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/openais-500b-stargate-project-could-aid-pentagons-own-ai-efforts-official-says/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [breakingdefense.com](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/openais-500b-stargate-project-could-aid-pentagons-own-ai-efforts-official-says/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Announcing The Stargate Project - OpenAI","url":"https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1737417600.0,"snippet":"The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"openai.com"},{"title":"OpenAI's $500B 'Stargate Project' could aid Pentagon's own AI ...","url":"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/openais-500b-stargate-project-could-aid-pentagons-own-ai-efforts-official-says/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1737590400.0,"snippet":"Managed by OpenAI and Japan-based Softbank, Stargate will also draw funding from computing giant Oracle and UAE-based investment firm MGX.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"breakingdefense.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201","start_idx":1792,"end_idx":1824,"safe_urls":["https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-appeal-new-york-times-suit-demand-asking-not-delete-any-user-chats-2025-06-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-appeal-new-york-times-suit-demand-asking-not-delete-any-user-chats-2025-06-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How we're responding to The New York Times' data ... - OpenAI","url":"https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1749081600.0,"snippet":"Right now, the court order forces us to retain consumer ChatGPT and API content going forward.

U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein had earlier acknowledged that the Times provided sufficient grounds to pursue the claim, citing instances where ChatGPT reproduced content from the newspaper\u2019s articles. On June 3, OpenAI formally requested that Judge Stein vacate the data preservation order issued in May. The New York Times has not commented on the latest development.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"reuters.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201","start_idx":2834,"end_idx":2866,"safe_urls":["https://explodingtopics.com/blog/new-chatgpt-release-date?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openais-sam-altman-discusses-gpt-5-release-date/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([explodingtopics.com](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/new-chatgpt-release-date?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openais-sam-altman-discusses-gpt-5-release-date/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"When Will ChatGPT-5 Be Released (June 2025 Info)","url":"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/new-chatgpt-release-date?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750392840.670555,"snippet":"...

A technique known as \"chain of thought,\" which reveals the AI\u2019s step-by-step reasoning, is being used to improve model interpretability and detect flaws. However, researchers have observed that these models sometimes provide final answers that don't match their reasoning, suggesting a lack of transparency and control. For instance, chatbots have been noted to contradict their own logic or hide misbehaviors such as cheating, even when their thought processes are adjusted to detect ethical violations. Despite these concerns, developers believe the chain-of-thought method provides valuable insights and potential corrections. However, experts caution that the reasoning text generated by AI might be tailored to appear trustworthy without reflecting true internal processes. As AI systems grow more capable and autonomous, understanding and faithfully capturing their decision-making process has become a crucial focus for ensuring safety and alignment.

Altman emphasizes a commitment to simplifying OpenAI\u2019s product offerings, noting that the current model selection process is overly complex. GPT-4.5, internally referred to as Orion, will be the last non-chain-of-thought model from OpenAI. Following it, OpenAI aims to merge the o-series and GPT-series models into comprehensive systems capable of handling a wide array of tasks efficiently. GPT-5 will integrate various OpenAI technologies including o3, which will no longer be released as a standalone model.

GPT-5 at a glance (what is **confirmed**, what is **strongly sign-posted**, and what is still **speculative**)\n\n| Dimension | What we know | Confidence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------|\n| **Planned launch window** | Sam Altman said on OpenAI\u2019s own podcast that GPT-5 is \u201c**probably sometime this summer**,\u201d while reiterating that the exact day is still fluid. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | High (CEO on-record) |\n| **Role in the product stack** | GPT-5 will **absorb the \u201co-series\u201d reasoning model (o3) and other point solutions** so customers aren\u2019t forced to choose among many similar SKUs. \ue200cite\ue202turn8news11\ue201 | High (Reuters interview) |\n| **Versioning scheme** | OpenAI is debating whether to ship continual upgrades as **5.0 \u2192 5.1 \u2192 5.2** or keep a single \u201cGPT-5\u201d label, to avoid the confusion that surfaced with \u201c4o-mini-high vs o3,\u201d per Altman. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | High |\n| **Reasoning & \u201cchain-of-thought\u201d** | GPT-5 is the first flagship model that will default to **visible, step-by-step reasoning** (the so-called chain-of-thought inspector). GPT-4.5 \u201cOrion\u201d is explicitly described as the *last* model *without* this capability. \ue200cite\ue202turn8news11\ue201 | High |\n| **Adjustable thinking time** | TechCrunch reports that GPT-5 will expose a **\u201creasoning budget\u201d slider**, letting users trade latency for deeper multi-step thought\u2014mirroring a similar feature in Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue201 | Medium (industry-press sourcing) |\n| **Core use-cases** | OpenAI\u2019s roadmap positions GPT-5 as an **agent-ready \u201csuper-assistant\u201d**: autonomous research (Deep Research/Operator), code generation, and scientific discovery acceleration. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news10\ue201 | Medium-high |\n| **Compute & infrastructure** | Reuters notes that OpenAI has lined up extra capacity from Google Cloud\u2014on top of Microsoft Azure and the $500 bn *Stargate* build-out\u2014to **cover GPT-5 training and inference demand**. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201 | High |\n| **Privacy stance** | Altman reiterated that **memory is opt-in** and ad mixing inside model outputs is off-limits; GPT-5 will keep that design, especially as OpenAI fights broad data-discovery demands from litigants such as the NYT. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 | Medium (policy pledges) |\n| **Parameter count / context length / modalities** | No authoritative numbers yet. OpenAI has not disclosed parameter size, training corpus, or maximum context window; any claims circulating online are **speculative**. | Low |\n\n---\n\n#### Narrative synthesis\n\n1. **Release timing & naming**\n\n   *Altman\u2019s podcast comment (\u201cprobably this summer\u201d) is the most concrete public commitment so far* and is echoed in several mainstream write-ups. However, OpenAI is signalling that the *exact* tag\u2014\u201cGPT-5\u201d vs \u201cGPT-4.5.x\u201d\u2014could still change if incremental upgrades ship first. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn4news10\ue201\n\n2. **Strategic goal: unify the model zoo**\n\n   Internal complexity (4, 4o, o-series, 4.1, etc.) drove the decision to fold o3 into GPT-5. Reuters quotes Altman saying the new model will be a **single, tool-aware system** rather than parallel model families. \ue200cite\ue202turn8news11\ue201  \n   *Implication:* after GPT-5, expect fewer model IDs and pricing tiers that map to throttled versions of the same backbone rather than completely distinct checkpoints.\n\n3. **Capability focus**\n\n   * **Advanced reasoning & agentic use** \u2013 GPT-5 integrates the chain-of-thought machinery that o-series pioneered, plus an adjustable \u201cthinking budget\u201d exposed to end-users and API developers. \ue200cite\ue202turn15view0\ue201  \n   * **Long-horizon tasks** \u2013 Deep Research and Operator (now on o3) are slated to sit directly on GPT-5; this positions the model for autonomous literature review, data collection, and code-execution loops. \ue200cite\ue202turn4news10\ue201  \n   * **Multimodal breadth** \u2013 while OpenAI has not said GPT-5 will bundle Sora-grade video, the company\u2019s public demos of voice, vision, and document reasoning all run on 4o today; expect those to carry over by default.\n\n4. **Training & infrastructure**\n\n   The *Stargate* data-centre programme plus a newly revealed **Google TPU lease** illustrate the sheer compute appetite behind GPT-5\u2019s training runs and future inference scale-out. \ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201  \n   OpenAI\u2019s stated aim is to drive inference cost down enough that GPT-5 can be the default even for the free ChatGPT tier.\n\n5. **Safety & alignment pipeline**\n\n   OpenAI\u2019s February white-paper on *external red-teaming* lays out the template likely being used for GPT-5: iterative adversarial testing, automated evals, then staged deployment. (The paper speaks generally but lines up with GPT-5\u2019s calendar.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1academia1\ue201\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n*GPT-5 is scheduled for a mid-2025 debut, subsuming the o-series into one flagship model, adding transparent chain-of-thought reasoning and user-controllable \u201cthinking depth,\u201d and leaning on massive new compute deals to scale cheaply.

GPT-5 will integrate various OpenAI technologies including o3, which will no longer be released as a standalone model. Upon release, ChatGPT users will have different levels of access to GPT-5\u2019s varying intelligence settings based on their subscription plans. No specific release dates were provided, but Altman indicated the launches could happen in a matter of weeks or months. Additionally, Elon Musk recently proposed a $97.4 billion offer for OpenAI's nonprofit arm, which the board is expected to decline.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"theverge.com"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn13view0\ue201","start_idx":4171,"end_idx":4189,"safe_urls":["https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/"],"refs":[],"alt":"([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Exclusive:
