Vietnam has notably increased its export share to the US and attracted significant foreign direct investment (FDI), making it a key beneficiary. Likewise, Malaysia and Singapore have diversified investments, particularly in high-tech sectors and financial services, respectively. They have also collaborated to create a Special Economic Zone for strategic investments. India has seen some gains in export market share and is working on improving infrastructure and reducing regulatory barriers to maximize these opportunities.

ASEAN has formed a task force to coordinate a common response, while some members pursue bilateral talks.\n\nAdditionally, ASEAN is set to enhance its economic and social integration through a new 20-year vision and engage in broader cooperation with China and the Gulf Cooperation Council. While China remains ASEAN\u2019s top trading partner, maritime disputes in the South China Sea continue to strain relations.\n\nRegarding Myanmar, Anwar highlighted Malaysia\u2019s informal engagement initiatives, including discussions with both military leaders and opposition figures. Despite this, Myanmar\u2019s military remains noncompliant with ASEAN\u2019s peace plan, and prospects for meaningful dialogue remain bleak due to ongoing conflict and limited leverage.

Other nations, including Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos, and Malaysia, also received significant tariffs. These measures threaten to slow economic growth across the region, hinder poverty reduction efforts, and disrupt global supply chains. Countries such as Vietnam, which had benefited from U.S.-China trade tensions by becoming a manufacturing hub, now face severe economic strain, potentially affecting U.S. consumers due to reliance on Vietnamese products by major brands like Nike and Hasbro. ASEAN countries, mostly export-dependent with limited bargaining power, are especially vulnerable and shocked by the magnitude of the tariffs. The move has prompted criticism from allies, including Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who labeled the tariffs \"unwarranted\" and harmful to global partnerships. China and India received relatively milder tariffs, sparking speculation over behind-the-scenes negotiations. Analysts warn that further U.S. demands to sever trade ties with China could deeply destabilize ASEAN's neutral position and economic outlook.

While this eases wage pressure and plugs demographic gaps, it also raises:\n\n*   **Political risk** \u2013 sudden policy shifts (e.g., Indonesia\u2019s moratoriums on labour export) can disrupt manpower pipelines.  \n*   **Domestic social tension** around job competition and integration.\n\n**2.5\u202fCritical assessment of vulnerabilities**  \n1. **Concentration risk.**  A regional shock \u2013 say, political instability in major neighbours or a severe haze episode \u2013 quickly reverberates through trade, tourism and supply chains.  \n2. **Regulatory fragmentation.**  Non\u2011tariff barriers and uneven digital\u2011data rules still raise transaction costs; DEFA may mitigate but not eliminate them.  \n3. **Competitive leap\u2011frogging.**  As ASEAN markets upgrade industrial policy (e.g., Malaysia\u2019s incentives for EVs, Indonesia\u2019s nickel downstreaming), Singapore must continuously move up\u2011value to avoid being out\u2011competed on cost.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fCultural and People\u2011to\u2011People Linkages  \n\n**3.1\u202fTourism and everyday contact**  \nASEAN citizens accounted for roughly 40\u202f% of Singapore\u2019s 16.5\u202fmillion visitor arrivals in 2024; Indonesia alone generated **2.49\u202fmillion visitors and S\u202f$2.13\u202fbillion in spending**, making it the top ASEAN source.\ue200cite\ue202turn26view0\ue201  The scale of short\u2011haul leisure and business travel sustains airlines, retail and the F&B sector, while frequent crossings reinforce mutual familiarity.\n\n**3.2\u202fEducation and youth networks**  \n*   The **MOE ASEAN Scholarships** bring secondary\u2011 and JC\u2011level students from all ten member states to Singapore each year, explicitly to \u201cpromote goodwill and understanding\u201d.\ue200cite\ue202turn21search0\ue201  \n*   Flagship leadership pipelines such as the **ASEAN Youth Fellowship (AYF)** convene 80\u2011100 emerging leaders annually for dual\u2011host programmes (2024: Singapore\u202f+\u202fLaos) that mix policy dialogue with network\u2011building.\ue200cite\ue202turn21search5\ue201  \nThese initiatives seed long\u2011run soft\u2011power dividends: alumni often rise to senior roles in government or business and retain professional ties to Singapore.\n\n**3.3\u202fShared cultural capital**  \nMultilingual media, food culture and diasporic family links mean that ASEAN popular culture (from Malay pop to Thai cinema and Vietnamese street\u2010food franchises) circulates easily through Singapore.  Government\u2011backed festivals \u2013 e.g., the Singapore\u2011Indonesia cultural showcase during RISING50 or the Southeast Asian Film Festival \u2013 further institutionalise exchange.\n\n**3.4\u202fRisks to cultural goodwill**  \n*   **Nationalist undercurrents** \u2013 maritime boundary disputes, haze blame games, or labour frictions \u2013 can quickly sour public sentiment despite strong official ties.  \n*   **Asymmetry in mobility.**  Singaporeans travel visa\u2011free in most of ASEAN, but not all ASEAN citizens enjoy equivalent ease of stay or work in Singapore, breeding perceptions of inequality.  \n*   **Cultural commodification.**  Heavy tourism marketing risks flattening diverse cultures into consumer experiences, diluting authenticity.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u202f\u202fForward\u2011looking Assessment  \n\n1. **Digital and green integration** \u2013 If DEFA and the nascent ASEAN Green Economy framework succeed, Singapore could emerge as the region\u2019s trusted data\u2011, carbon\u2011 and finance\u2011hub, capturing high\u2011margin orchestration roles while enabling partners to scale.  \n2. **Competence\u2011led clustering** \u2013 Projects like the Johor\u2011Singapore SEZ aim to pair Singapore\u2019s capital and R&D with neighbouring land and labour, creating \u2018hub\u2011and\u2011spoke\u2019 regional production nodes; success would lock in mutual dependency but also expose Singapore to partner policy cycles.  \n3. **Soft\u2011power amplification through talent circulatory systems** \u2013 Expanding scholarship and exchange quotas, and leveraging digital cultural platforms, will be pivotal for sustaining goodwill among ASEAN\u2019s burgeoning middle class.  \n4. **Resilience agenda** \u2013 Singapore must diversify logistics routes, energy supplies and data cables across multiple ASEAN partners to hedge against single\u2011point failures, while pushing for common crisis\u2011response mechanisms (e.g., joint pandemic stockpiles).\n\n---\n\n### 5\u202f\u202fConclusion  \n\nThe ASEAN region is *not merely important* to Singapore \u2013 it is foundational to the republic\u2019s economic model and cultural identity.  The numbers are compelling: nearly **S\u202f$300\u202fbillion in goods trade, a quarter\u2011trillion in outward investment stock, record visitor flows**, and ever\u2011denser educational and youth networks.  Yet sheer proximity and scale do not guarantee stability; success will depend on Singapore\u2019s ability to **shape \u2013 and adapt to \u2013 ASEAN\u2019s evolving rules, growth trajectories and social currents**.  A clear strategic task for the coming decade is therefore to deepen high\u2011value linkages (digital, green, talent) while building buffers against shocks and perceptions of dominance.  Done well, Singapore can continue to thrive as the *integrator, catalyst and cultural crossroads* of Southeast Asia."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn20view0\ue201","start_idx":898,"end_idx":916,"safe_urls":["https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Parliamentary-Replies/2024/05/Written-reply-to-PQ-on-Singapore-Companies-in-ASEAN"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Ministry
