It has manifested across millennia and continents, evolving through religious, social, economic, and political forms. From ancient prejudices to medieval blood libels, from the racial pseudoscience that fed the Nazi Holocaust to modern conspiracy theories, antisemitism has proven brutally persistent. Even after the world\u2019s horror at the Holocaust, anti-Jewish sentiment never disappeared; in recent decades it has resurged in new guises. This report traces the origins and evolution of antisemitism from antiquity to the present, with emphasis on the 20th and 21st centuries. It examines how religious doctrine, social dynamics, economic myths, and geopolitical events have all fueled this hatred. We analyze why antisemitism endures across eras and geographies, and why it is again on the rise worldwide. Understanding the mechanisms behind its resilience \u2013 from theological antagonism and scapegoating to nationalist and ideological conspiracies \u2013 is crucial to confronting this perennial menace to pluralistic society.\n\n## Ancient and Religious Origins of Antisemitism  \nAntisemitic attitudes **date back to ancient times**, nearly as far as Jewish history itself\u301039\u2020L258-L266\u3011. In the pre-Christian Greco-Roman world, Jews were often seen as alien because they maintained a distinct **monotheistic religion and culture**. Hellenistic Greeks and Romans resented Jews\u2019 refusal to worship local gods or emperors, viewing it as separatism or disloyalty\u301018\u2020L307-L315\u3011\u301018\u2020L331-L340\u3011. For example, in 1st century Alexandria and elsewhere, tensions flared into anti-Jewish riots. This **pagan-era Judeophobia** was largely driven by religious difference: unlike polytheistic societies willing to incorporate many gods, Jews\u2019 insistence on one God and their **social segregation** set them apart\u301018\u2020L307-L314\u3011. Ancient stereotypes painted Jews as clannish and aloof for keeping their own customs under foreign rule\u301039\u2020L272-L280\u3011.\n\nThe rise of **Christianity** transformed and deepened antisemitism. Christianity emerged from Judaism, but as the new faith spread, it defined itself in opposition to Judaism. After the crucifixion of Jesus \u2013 himself a Jew \u2013 early Church leaders interpreted the Gospels as **blaming Jews collectively for the death of Christ**, a deicide charge that would justify centuries of persecution\u30101\u2020L197-L205\u3011\u30101\u2020L207-L215\u3011. By the 4th century CE, the Christian church was ascendant in the Roman Empire and **Church Fathers** like St. Augustine and John Chrysostom promoted a \u201cteaching of contempt\u201d toward Jews\u301018\u2020L369-L377\u3011. They castigated Jews as *\u201crebels against God\u201d*, *\u201cmurderers of the Lord\u201d*, even companions of the Devil\u301018\u2020L369-L377\u3011. Jews\u2019 continued refusal to accept Jesus as Messiah was portrayed as stubborn malevolence. According to some theologians, Jews had forfeited God\u2019s favor and were condemned to wander in perpetual exile \u2013 a notion encapsulated by the legend of the \u201cWandering Jew\u201d\u301018\u2020L339-L348\u3011\u301018\u2020L349-L358\u3011. By this logic, the mere **survival of Judaism** was an affront, and the misery of the scattered Jews was seen as divine punishment.\n\nThis **early Christian antisemitism** had concrete outcomes. As Christianity became dominant, Church councils and Christianized imperial laws imposed civil disabilities on Jews\u301018\u2020L349-L358\u3011. By late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, Jews were barred from many professions and from marrying Christians; they were pressured to convert, and their rights to worship or build synagogues were curtailed. Importantly, the Church demonization of Jews (as *\u201cchildren of Satan\u201d*) laid the groundwork for later myths and violence. The accusation that Jews were collectively guilty of *\u201cmurdering God\u201d* would persist in popular Christian imagination for almost two millennia \u2013 it was officially repudiated by the Catholic Church only in 1965, when Vatican Council II finally **renounced the charge of deicide** and revised its teachings about Jews\u301018\u2020L373-L380\u3011.\n\n## Medieval Europe: Persecution, Myths, and Social Scapegoating  \nThroughout the medieval period, antisemitism was **entrenched in Christian Europe\u2019s laws, economy, and folklore**. Jews lived as marginalized minorities under Christian rule, often by law. **Church and state restrictions** kept Jews on the fringes of society \u2013 for example, **medieval laws banned Jews from owning land or joining craft guilds**, effectively shutting them out of farming and most trades\u30101\u2020L213-L220\u3011. In many cities, Jews were forced into segregated quarters later known as **ghettos**, and required to wear distinguishing marks such as a special hat or a yellow badge on their clothing\u301039\u2020L293-L302\u3011. These measures both reinforced the notion of Jews as alien and made Jewish communities more conspicuous targets in times of trouble.\n\nExcluded from most occupations, many Jews survived through commerce, tax collecting, and particularly **moneylending**, since the Church forbade Christians to lend money at interest. This role fed toxic stereotypes: while Jewish lenders provided a necessary service in Christian economies, they were despised as **\u201cusurers\u201d** profiteering off Christians\u30101\u2020L223-L231\u3011\u301039\u2020L299-L307\u3011. Chronic debtors and rulers who owed money to Jews found it convenient to stoke hatred against them instead. Economic resentment, stoked by religious bias, frequently turned violent. **Medieval Christian folklore teemed with anti-Jewish myths** that painted Jews as almost demonic. Jews were falsely accused of horrific crimes, most infamously the **\u201cblood libel\u201d** \u2013 a paranoid fantasy that Jews kidnapped and murdered Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals\u301039\u2020L278-L284\u3011. Although absurd, such tales were widely believed. Jews were also blamed for poisoning wells and **causing the Black Plague** in the 14th century, an allegation that led to mass slaughters of Jewish communities during the plague years\u30101\u2020L223-L231\u3011. Church art and popular illustrations even depicted Jews with horns or in league with Satan\u30101\u2020L223-L231\u3011. These grotesque falsehoods, repeated over generations, **scapegoated Jews for society\u2019s worst fears** and disasters, from epidemics to droughts. They also justified recurrent violence.\n\nPeriodic eruptions of **anti-Jewish violence** scarred medieval Europe. The **Crusades** exemplified this: when Pope Urban II called the First Crusade in 1095, mobs of crusaders on their way to the Holy Land diverted to attack Jewish communities in the Rhineland, massacring thousands of Jews\u30101\u2020L219-L227\u3011. Such pogroms (anti-Jewish riots) were not isolated \u2013 Europe saw many local massacres, especially during times of crisis. Rulers and church leaders sometimes condemned these killings, but at other times authorities actively or passively supported violence to vent popular anger. When natural or economic calamity struck, Jews often served as the **convenient scapegoat**. The pattern of **scapegoating a visible minority** for society\u2019s ills became a key mechanism in the persistence of antisemitism\u301015\u2020L396-L401\u3011.\n\nWaves of **expulsions** also marked this era. If not killed, Jews were often expelled en masse from kingdoms or cities, usually after years of being squeezed financially. England expelled its Jewish population in 1290, France did so multiple times in the 14th century, Spain in 1492, Portugal in 1497, and many German and Italian cities followed suit\u30101\u2020L231-L239\u3011. Each expulsion was typically preceded by rising anti-Jewish fervor and rumors. Often, monarchs expelled Jews to cancel debts owed to them and to gain favor with their Christian subjects. These expulsions shifted Europe\u2019s Jewish population eastward: many Jews fled to Poland, Lithuania, and the Ottoman Empire, where at times they were offered relative tolerance. (Notably, **Poland under Prince Boles\u0142aw in 1264 granted Jews unprecedented civic and religious freedoms**\u301039\u2020L307-L315\u3011, making it a haven for Jews for centuries.) But even in places of refuge, Jews remained a vulnerable minority. In the Islamic world of the Middle Ages, Jews (and Christians) were considered \u201cPeople of the Book\u201d and often allowed to practice their faith as **dhimmis** (protected but second-class subjects). They had to pay special taxes and were periodically subjected to discrimination or violence. While **medieval antisemitism in Muslim lands** was generally less systemic than in Christian Europe, there were still instances of persecution, forced conversions, and occasional massacres in places like Fez, Morocco (1465) or Granada, Spain (1066) under Muslim rule. Thus, by the close of the Middle Ages, the **religious dimension of antisemitism** \u2013 rooted in the belief that Jews were accursed for rejecting Christianity (or, in some cases, Islam) \u2013 had become deeply embedded in both Europe and the Middle East, reinforced by social segregation and economic envy.\n\n## Early Modern Transformations: From Religion to \u201cRace\u201d  \nThe **early modern period** (16th\u201318th centuries) saw shifts in antisemitism even as old patterns persisted. The Protestant Reformation, for example, initially raised Jewish hopes \u2013 *Martin Luther* at first preached a more tolerant approach, hoping Jews would convert to his purified form of Christianity. However, when Jews did not convert, Luther turned viciously against them. In 1543 he penned a treatise urging Christians *\u201cto set [Jewish] synagogues on fire\u201d* and destroy Jewish homes and books\u30102\u2020L238-L247\u3011. Such words from the Reformation\u2019s leader **perpetuated anti-Jewish hatred** among Protestants as well as Catholics\u30102\u2020L238-L247\u3011. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation continued to enforce ghettoization in Italy and to require Jews to attend degrading sermons. Anti-Jewish restrictions and **theology-fueled contempt** thus remained strong.\n\nHowever, the Enlightenment of the 18th century introduced new currents. Enlightenment thinkers challenged the authority of Church tradition \u2013 some called for **emancipating Jews** and extending to them the equal rights of man. Revolutionary France was the first to grant full citizenship to Jews in 1791. Yet even advocates of Jewish emancipation often did so **conditionally**, expecting Jews to shed their traditions. Many Enlightenment figures were still hostile to Judaism as a religion: for instance, Voltaire blamed Judaism for fostering what he saw as superstition and separatism\u30102\u2020L253-L261\u3011. Thus, the **idea of Jewish \u201cassimilation\u201d** emerged: Jews could be accepted if they ceased to be visibly Jewish. Even as legal walls began to lift in parts of Western Europe, social prejudice persisted beneath the surface\u30102\u2020L253-L262\u3011\u30102\u2020L258-L266\u3011. \n\nThe 19th century then brought modern nationalist ideologies and pseudo-science, which reshaped antisemitism in secular terms. In many European societies, Jews by the mid-1800s were gaining civic equality and integrating into public life \u2013 yet this very success provoked backlash. **Nationalism** often defined the nation on ethnic or religious lines that excluded Jews. In places like Germany and Austria, populist politicians claimed that Jewish converts or descendants of converts could never truly be part of the Volk (the people). In 1879 the term **\u201canti-Semitism\u201d** itself was popularized by a German agitator, Wilhelm Marr, who argued that Jews were not a religious group but an alien race antagonistic to German identity\u301039\u2020L268-L275\u3011. Pseudoscientific racial theories classified Jews as biologically different (as \u201cSemites\u201d), imputing inheritable negative traits. Unlike older religious antisemitism, this new **racial antisemitism** insisted that no degree of conversion or assimilation could change the allegedly degenerate Jewish \u201cblood\u201d\u30102\u2020L289-L297\u3011. By the late 1800s, **Jews were stigmatized as a racial threat** within, accused of secretly dominating finance, corrupting culture, or diluting national purity \u2013 a modern update to the age-old \u201coutsider\u201d depiction.\n\nDuring this era, a flood of **conspiracy theories** and political antisemitic movements emerged. The most notorious fabrication, *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, was concocted in Czarist Russia around 1900 and disseminated worldwide\u30102\u2020L276-L284\u3011. This forged document purported to be minutes of a meeting of Jewish leaders plotting world domination. Though **proven to be a hoax**, the *Protocols* gained traction across Europe and beyond, convincing many that \u201cthe Jews\u201d were behind wars, revolutions, and economic disasters\u30102\u2020L278-L286\u3011. Its wild claims of a Jewish cabal manipulating global events resonated with people looking for scapegoats during tumultuous times \u2013 and **it circulates even today** in various corners of the world despite indisputable proof of its falsehood\u30102\u2020L278-L286\u3011.\n\nMeanwhile in the Russian Empire, poor economic conditions and political unrest were deflected by vicious **pogroms** \u2013 mob attacks on Jewish communities often tacitly encouraged by authorities. After the 1881 assassination of Czar Alexander II (wrongly blamed on Jewish conspirators), riots erupted and **Jews were massacred or their homes destroyed across dozens of towns**\u30102\u2020L283-L292\u3011. Further pogroms swept through the early 20th century, especially amid the chaos of the 1917 Russian Revolution and civil war. Between 1918 and 1921, over 1,300 pogroms in Ukraine killed an estimated 30,000\u201370,000 Jews\u301039\u2020L319-L327\u3011. These waves of violence drove mass Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe. They also **reinforced the image of Jews as perennial scapegoats**: Russian officials and demagogues stoked Jew-hatred to channel popular anger away from the government\u2019s failings\u30102\u2020L283-L291\u3011.\n\nBy the dawn of the 20th century, **antisemitism had taken multiple overlapping forms** \u2013 religious animus, ethnic nationalism, economic envy, and conspiratorial fantasy. In France, the **Dreyfus Affair** of 1894\u20131906 laid these currents bare. A Jewish French army captain, Alfred Dreyfus, was falsely convicted of treason amid a frenzy of nationalist antisemitism; crowds in Paris shouted \u201cDeath to the Jews!\u201d during his trial\u30102\u2020L261-L270\u3011. Although Dreyfus was eventually exonerated, the episode showed that even in post-Enlightenment Europe \u2013 a century after legal emancipation \u2013 **anti-Jewish hatred could erupt with ferocity**, uniting reactionaries, nationalist mobs, and segments of the press. The stage was set for the most extreme antisemitic campaign yet to come, under the Nazis, which would draw on all these historical threads.\n\n## The 20th Century: Nazism, Holocaust, and Aftermath  \nAntisemitism reached its horrific apex with the **Nazi rise to power in Germany and the Holocaust**. The Nazis synthesized centuries of Judeophobia into an eliminationist ideology. Adolf **Hitler** and other Nazi theorists portrayed world history as a racial struggle, with an alleged Jewish conspiracy at the center of all Germany\u2019s woes\u30102\u2020L303-L311\u3011. They blamed Jews for Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I and for the ensuing economic crises (hyperinflation and Depression), painting Jews as war profiteers and manipulators of the Versailles Treaty\u30102\u2020L300-L308\u3011. In Nazi rhetoric, Jews somehow embodied both capitalism and communism \u2013 Hitler absurdly claimed that **Jews were behind both international finance and Bolshevism**\u30102\u2020L303-L311\u3011. This mirrored older conspiracy tropes but on a global, all-encompassing scale. To the Nazis, Jews were an **\u201calien race\u201d** poisoning German society from within, responsible for every ill from moral decay to military defeat\u30102\u2020L303-L311\u3011. Nazi ideologues weaponized pseudoscience, asserting that Jews had immutable biological traits making them dangerous parasites on the \u201cAryan\u201d race\u30102\u2020L289-L297\u3011. In short, **antisemitism became the core ideology of the Third Reich**, not just another prejudice\u30102\u2020L305-L313\u3011. \n\nOnce in power in 1933, the Nazi regime moved swiftly from hateful words to persecutory deeds. **State-sponsored antisemitism** unfolded step by step: Jewish civil servants, lawyers, and professors were purged; Jewish-owned businesses were boycotted and later seized\u30102\u2020L315-L323\u3011. The **Nuremberg Laws of 1935** stripped German Jews of citizenship and forbade intermarriage with non-Jews, defining Jewishness by racial criteria (having Jewish grandparents)\u301039\u2020L344-L352\u3011. Through propaganda, the Nazis revived medieval-style imagery (e.g. portraying Jews as contaminating vermin) to dehumanize Jews in the eyes of the public. Violent intimidation escalated; on **Kristallnacht** (the \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d November 1938), Nazi-organized mobs burned over 250 synagogues and vandalized thousands of Jewish businesses across Germany and Austria\u301039\u2020L355-L364\u3011. Dozens of Jews were killed and 30,000 arrested into concentration camps\u301039\u2020L356-L364\u3011. This pogrom marked a turning point from legal discrimination to open terror. Yet even then, few imagined the full genocide to come\u30102\u2020L320-L327\u3011.\n\nDuring World War II, under cover of the conflict, the Nazis implemented the **\u201cFinal Solution\u201d \u2013 the systematic extermination of Europe\u2019s Jewish population**. Nazi armies and collaborators rounded up Jews from all over occupied Europe, herding them into ghettos and forced-labor camps, then to killing centers. By war\u2019s end, **approximately six million Jews had been murdered in the Holocaust**, an unparalleled act of genocide\u30102\u2020L323-L331\u3011\u301039\u2020L373-L381\u3011. This industrial-scale killing was driven explicitly by antisemitic ideology: the Nazis diverted crucial wartime resources to hunt and kill Jews even when it offered no military benefit, underscoring that for Hitler destroying the Jews was as important as winning the war. The Holocaust also drew on the passivity or complicity of many local populations indoctrinated by centuries of antisemitism. In Eastern Europe, for instance, Nazi killers sometimes found willing auxiliaries among locals already steeped in anti-Jewish attitudes. \n\nWhen the magnitude of the Holocaust was revealed after 1945, it **shocked the conscience of the world**. The genocide forced a reckoning (at least temporarily) with antisemitism. In Europe, remnants of Jewish communities were so devastated that open antisemitism became socially unacceptable in mainstream discourse \u2013 though it persisted in fringe and underground circles. Some Christian churches undertook self-examination: notably, the Roman Catholic Church in 1965 issued *Nostra Aetate*, repudiating the deicide charge against Jews and affirming Judaism\u2019s shared spiritual heritage\u301018\u2020L373-L380\u3011. Many Protestant denominations likewise **renounced centuries of anti-Jewish teachings**\u30102\u2020L329-L337\u3011. These theological reforms were attempts to **come to terms with Christianity\u2019s role** in enabling the Holocaust. On a geopolitical level, horror at the Holocaust contributed to broad support for the creation of a Jewish homeland, leading to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. It was hoped by some that a Jewish state might finally provide a safe refuge from antisemitism.\n\nDespite these changes, **antisemitism did not vanish after World War II**. In some ways it merely went dormant or mutated into new forms. Immediately after the war, sporadic anti-Jewish violence still flared in Europe \u2013 for example, **pogroms in Poland in 1946** (like the Kielce pogrom) saw Holocaust survivors attacked by locals. More enduring was the antisemitism that took root in new ideological soil: the **geopolitical and ideological conflicts of the Cold War and Middle East**. \n\n## Antisemitism in the Middle East and the Impact of Israel  \nThe creation of **Israel in 1948** introduced a major geopolitical dimension to post-Holocaust antisemitism. The establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine \u2013 and the first Arab-Israeli war that accompanied it \u2013 led to the displacement of around 700,000 Palestinian Arabs and was viewed with humiliation and anger across the Arab and Muslim world\u30109\u2020L455-L463\u3011. Anti-Zionism (opposition to Israel) soon merged with traditional anti-Jewish themes, especially as **most Arab nations went to war with Israel** or rejected its legitimacy. In the wake of Israel\u2019s victory in 1948, many Arab governments and populations turned their frustration against local Jewish minorities. Over the 1950s and 1960s, **Jews fled or were expelled from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and other Middle Eastern countries**, largely as a result of state-fueled antisemitism and popular attacks\u30109\u2020L459-L466\u3011. Ancient Jewish communities in these lands \u2013 predating Islam by centuries \u2013 virtually vanished, with the majority of those Jews emigrating to Israel or the West\u30109\u2020L463-L468\u3011. Today countries like Egypt, Iraq, and Syria have only a few dozen or hundred Jews, where once they had tens of thousands. The Middle East became more **polarized along religious-national lines**, and hostility toward Israel often generalized into hostility toward Jews as a whole.\n\nAntisemitic propaganda, including European imports like *The Protocols of Zion*, found new life in the Middle East. For instance, **state media in countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia at times promoted vicious anti-Jewish tropes**, portraying Jews (not just Israelis) as evil schemers. Traditional Islamic anti-Jewish references \u2013 such as certain Quranic stories of conflicts between Muhammad and Arabian Jewish tribes \u2013 were revived and amplified by Islamists to give religious cover to modern political antisemitism. In Islam\u2019s classical era, while Jews had inferior status, outright hatred was not a theological pillar as it had been in medieval Christianity. But by the late 20th century, groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and later **Hamas** incorporated explicit antisemitism into their ideology (for example, the Hamas charter at one time cited the *Protocols* and blamed Jews for both world wars). The **Israeli-Palestinian conflict** thus became a flashpoint not only for anti-Israel sentiment worldwide but often for antisemitism, especially in the Muslim world. Criticism of Israeli policies sometimes crossed the line into antisemitic generalizations (such as attributing Israeli actions to the innate character of Jews) or Holocaust inversion (claiming Israel was doing to Palestinians what the Nazis did to Jews). This period also saw alliances of convenience, such as the Soviet Union supporting Arab states and disseminating anti-Zionist propaganda that often veered into blatant antisemitism (for example, the falsehood that Zionism = Nazism or racism, which was enshrined in a 1975 UN resolution). \n\nInside the Soviet bloc, **state-sponsored antisemitism re-emerged** after World War II under the guise of anti-Zionism. Joseph Stalin in his final years (late 1940s\u2013early 1950s) purged many Jews from positions of influence, and orchestrated the \u201c**Doctors\u2019 Plot**\u201d affair in which predominantly Jewish doctors were falsely accused of a conspiracy to poison Soviet leaders. This campaign was accompanied by crude propaganda against \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d (code for Jews). Although Stalin\u2019s death halted an openly planned anti-Jewish purge, the USSR continued to discriminate against its Jewish citizens (e.g. limiting their education and cultural expression) and to fuel anti-Israel sentiment. Throughout the Cold War, Soviet and Arab propaganda jointly painted Israel and Jews as agents of imperialism. \n\nIn sum, the mid-20th-century world saw **antisemitism persist but shift**: in the West, overt Jew-hatred had been discredited by association with the defeated Nazis, whereas in the Communist and Arab spheres, antisemitism found new validation through the language of anti-imperialism, nationalism, and religion. By the late 20th century, **two opposing ideological extremes \u2013 the far-right and far-left \u2013 would both keep antisemitic ideas alive**, though in different ways, as discussed next.\n\n## Late 20th-Century to 21st-Century Resurgence  \nIn the decades after the Holocaust, explicit antisemitism in mainstream politics was relatively subdued in Western democracies, but it never vanished from society. On the **far-right**, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups kept Hitler\u2019s ideas alive, engaging in Holocaust denial and hate crimes. On the **far-left**, some radical factions saw Jews as symbols of capitalism or colonialism. By the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, multiple factors caused antisemitic incidents and attitudes to spike again in many places, **bringing antisemitism back into public view**.\n\n**Europe** experienced a surge of antisemitism in the early 21st century, often tied to both Islamic extremism and the rise of nationalist populism. In France \u2013 home to Europe\u2019s third-largest Jewish community \u2013 a series of brutal attacks targeted Jews: in 2012, a jihadist gunman killed a rabbi and three children at a Jewish school in Toulouse\u30109\u2020L470-L478\u3011; in 2015, an Islamist terrorist murdered four Jews in a kosher supermarket during the Charlie Hebdo terror spree\u30109\u2020L473-L480\u3011. These attacks were ideological, perpetrated by Islamists who cast Jews as enemies (often conflating local Jewish people with Israel). Concurrently, the *National Front* and other far-right anti-immigrant parties gained ground in Europe, and although their public focus was often anti-Muslim or anti-EU, they **revived traditional antisemitic themes** in subtler forms \u2013 for instance, talk of \u201cglobalist elites\u201d undermining the nation (a euphemism that frequently nods to old Jewish-conspiracy ideas)\u301013\u2020L259-L268\u3011\u301013\u2020L278-L286\u3011. The UK saw an anti-Semitism controversy within the left-wing Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership (2015\u20132019), as some party activists\u2019 strident anti-Israel rhetoric crossed into antisemitic tropes about Jewish dual loyalty and global Jewish power\u301011\u2020L147-L155\u3011\u301011\u2020L175-L182\u3011. In Eastern Europe, nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary overtly celebrate their Christian heritage and have sometimes flirted with antisemitic tropes or historical revisionism (e.g. Hungarian leaders attacking the philanthropist George Soros with imagery reminiscent of caricatures of \u201cthe scheming Jew\u201d\u301013\u2020L278-L286\u3011). By the 2010s, **hate crime data in Europe showed a rising trend**: for example, the UK recorded a *record 1,382 anti-Jewish hate incidents in 2017, a 34% jump*\u30109\u2020L479-L487\u3011. France, Germany, and other countries likewise saw spikes in harassment, vandalism, and assaults targeting Jews. Many incidents were linked either to far-right xenophobes or to anger over Middle East conflicts (e.g. anti-Israel protests in Europe sometimes turned violent, with synagogues firebombed or Jewish neighborhoods attacked). This **convergence of far-right and radical Islamist antisemitism**, plus elements of far-left anti-Zionism, has made 21st-century Europe a complex and worrying environment for Jews.\n\nIn the **United States**, where Jews have generally been well-integrated, antisemitism has also intensified in recent years. The **FBI and Anti-Defamation League (ADL) data** show that American antisemitic incidents hit record highs in the 2020s. After a long post-war lull, the dam seemed to break around 2016\u20132018: the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 prominently featured chants of *\u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d* invoking a conspiracy theory that Jews orchestrate mass immigration to \u201creplace\u201d white Americans. The following year, 2018, saw the deadliest act of antisemitic violence in U.S. history \u2013 the **Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue massacre**, where an avowed white nationalist murdered 11 Jewish worshippers. The attacker had circulated conspiracies about a Jewish refugee aid society flooding the country with immigrants. Indeed, modern **white supremacist ideology is deeply intertwined with antisemitism**: as expert Eric Ward observes, it posits Jews as the invisible hand fomenting racial diversity and social liberalism to undermine the white race\u301013\u2020L253-L262\u3011. Hence far-right extremists often blame Jews for movements they hate (be it Black civil rights, multicultural policies, or LGBTQ rights), claiming these are all part of a Jewish plot\u301013\u2020L301-L309\u3011. For example, the **QAnon conspiracy** that gained traction in recent years recycles the medieval blood libel in coded form \u2013 portraying a secret cabal (not explicitly labeled Jewish, but borrowing age-old antisemitic themes) that allegedly abducts and abuses children. This shows how antisemitic motifs adapt: **modern conspiracists substitute new terminologies (\u201cglobalists,\u201d \u201cdeep state\u201d) for \u201cJews,\u201d but the narrative of a shadowy group controlling world events remains aimed at Jews**\u301013\u2020L278-L286\u3011\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011. Social media has supercharged the dissemination of these ideas. On platforms like X/Twitter, antisemitic memes and coded slogans (such as the \u201c(((triple parentheses)))\u201d used to identify Jews) spread rapidly, often amplified by algorithmic echo chambers.\n\nAnother 21st-century development is the **mainstreaming of antisemitism in some parts of the political left**, typically under the banner of anti-Israel activism. While criticism of Israeli government policies is absolutely legitimate, a subset of the far-left has adopted positions that **demonize Zionism to the point of demonizing Jews**. In some European countries like Spain and France, reports have noted that **far-left parties normalized antisemitic rhetoric**, for instance by treating local Jewish communities as extensions of Israel and holding them collectively responsible for Israel\u2019s actions\u301011\u2020L129-L137\u3011\u301011\u2020L142-L150\u3011. The Spanish leftist party *Podemos*, when it entered government, openly indulged anti-Israel antisemitism \u2013 one party official even declared Jews should answer for Israel\u2019s policies\u301011\u2020L142-L150\u3011. In France, left-wing leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has been accused of using antisemitic tropes and excusing violent attacks on synagogues as political protests\u301011\u2020L162-L170\u3011. The **ADL\u2019s 2023 report on left-wing antisemitism in Europe** warned that what was once fringe is becoming normalized on that side of the spectrum, and that similar rhetoric is creeping into the American left as well\u301011\u2020L175-L182\u3011. This includes slogans like \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\u201d which some Jewish communities hear as an implicit call to dismantle Israel altogether, and incidents where anti-Israel protests on campuses intimidate or exclude Jewish students regardless of their personal politics. The line between passionate criticism of Israel and age-old antisemitic accusations (such as global Jewish conspiracies or blood libels recast with Palestinians as victims) can get very thin in heated discourse. Thus, antisemitism today truly spans the **far-right (white nationalists, neo-Nazis), far-left (extreme anti-Zionists), and Islamist extremists**, each for their own ideological reasons but often echoing the *same underlying myths*.\n\n\u301020\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Figure: Demonstrators in Paris march against antisemitism in 2018 after the murder of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor. Such rallies highlight public revulsion to anti-Jewish hate, yet the need for them shows the persistence of antisemitism even today.*\u30109\u2020L469-L478\u3011\u30109\u2020L479-L487\u3011\n\n### Contemporary Rising Trends and Data  \nIn the 2020s, many indicators suggest **antisemitism is on the rise globally**, even reaching levels unseen in decades. Jewish communities and monitoring groups report alarming increases in hate crimes, harassment, and openly antisemitic discourse. According to the ADL, the *year 2023 saw 8,873 antisemitic incidents in the United States \u2013 a **140% increase** over the prior year and the highest number ever recorded since tracking began in 1979*\u30104\u2020L225-L233\u3011. This unprecedented spike was largely driven by a surge of incidents in late 2023, coinciding with the Israel\u2013Hamas war that began in October of that year. The conflict ignited not only legitimate protests but also **outright attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions worldwide**: synagogues were firebombed in Germany and Tunisia, Jewish students were assaulted on campuses, and propaganda spreading conspiracy theories about Jews and Israel flooded social media\u30104\u2020L171-L179\u3011\u30104\u2020L187-L194\u3011. The trend continued into 2024. A global report by the World Zionist Organization found that *2024 was a \u201cpeak year\u201d for antisemitism, with a **340% worldwide increase** in incidents compared to just two years earlier*\u30105\u2020L123-L131\u3011. In fact, from 2023 to 2024 the number of incidents **nearly doubled**, as antisemitic hate accelerated during and after the Gaza war\u30105\u2020L123-L131\u3011. \n\nAcross regions, the figures are striking. **France** recorded 1,676 antisemitic acts in 2023 (up from 436 in 2022) and continued at a high level in 2024\u30104\u2020L233-L241\u3011. **The United Kingdom** saw a 450% increase, with almost 2,000 incidents in just the first half of 2024\u30105\u2020L167-L175\u3011. **Australia** reported a 316% jump in antisemitic incidents in the year ending Sept 2024\u30104\u2020L237-L240\u3011. Even countries with very small Jewish populations felt the ripple: in China, antisemitic content and Holocaust denial proliferated on social media in late 2023\u30105\u2020L173-L177\u3011; Japan saw an unprecedented anti-Israel protest where some displayed Nazi swastikas\u30105\u2020L173-L177\u3011. In the Middle East, the conflict stoked public expressions of antisemitism, such as crowds in the streets of **South Africa** chanting slogans targeting Jews and calls for boycotts of Jewish businesses, contributing to a 185% increase in incidents there\u30105\u2020L179-L187\u3011. **Canada** witnessed a shocking 562% increase in antisemitic incidents in 2024, with a significant portion involving violence\u30105\u2020L151-L159\u3011. These data illustrate that **antisemitism is not confined to one corner of the globe; it is a transnational phenomenon** exacerbated by global events and interconnected media.\n\nThe United States has mirrored these trends. The ADL\u2019s Audit reported *9,354 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in 2024*, a further increase on 2023\u2019s record number\u30104\u2020L227-L234\u3011. While the year-on-year rise was smaller (5%), the nature of incidents grew more violent, with assaults spiking in late 2023\u30104\u2020L227-L234\u3011. American Jews today face threats from multiple directions: white supremacist groups continue to plot attacks (the FBI has foiled several, such as a planned mass shooting at a Florida synagogue in 2024), and at the same time, **Jewish students on college campuses report harassment related to anti-Israel activism**. A 2024 survey by the American Jewish Committee found over one in four American Jews felt unsafe attending Jewish institutions or events, reflecting the climate of fear\u301013\u2020L202-L211\u3011. \n\nAnalysts warn that this current wave is being fueled by **social media radicalization and political polarization**. The CEO of the ADL noted that nearly half of adults globally now harbor at least some antisemitic beliefs\u30105\u2020L138-L141\u3011 \u2013 a sobering statistic showing how widespread anti-Jewish tropes remain. Extremist networks, from neo-Nazi groups in the U.S. to Islamist militants in Europe, feed off each other\u2019s propaganda. For instance, the **neo-Nazi narrative of a Jewish \u201cNew World Order\u201d controlling governments** has been adopted and repackaged by conspiracy influencers online, reaching audiences that might not consider themselves antisemitic but who buy into \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cglobalist\u201d theories (which often trace back to antisemitic origins)\u301013\u2020L278-L286\u3011\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011. Similarly, anti-Israel fervor on the left has in some cases slid into age-old anti-Jewish accusations, such as claims of secret Jewish influence over media or finance (only now couched in terms like \u201cZionist lobby\u201d). This **cross-pollination of antisemitic ideas** across ideological divides has made the climate especially volatile.\n\nIn summary, by the mid-2020s the world is witnessing a **resurgence of antisemitism** that spans from violent hate crimes to insidious online rhetoric. It is propelled by current events (war in the Middle East, domestic political turmoil) but rooted in very old prejudices. The rise in incidents is a bellwether for broader social ills: where antisemitism surges, it often portends growing extremism and the erosion of liberal democratic norms. Indeed, scholars note that antisemitism tends to flourish in times of uncertainty, when people seek easy explanations for complex problems and demagogues find scapegoats to unite followers. As we will discuss, the durability of antisemitism owes much to its adaptive ability to attach itself to various grievances \u2013 religious, social, economic, and political \u2013 across different eras.\n\n## Why Antisemitism Persists: Interwoven Dimensions of an Enduring Hatred  \nAntisemitism\u2019s uncanny persistence through history can be traced to several **interwoven factors**. It is not a single stereotype or conspiracy theory, but rather a flexible repertoire of myths and attitudes that have proven adaptable to many contexts. Here we examine the key dimensions \u2013 religious, social, economic, and geopolitical \u2013 that have sustained antisemitism\u2019s longevity, and how they continue to foster its resurgence today.\n\n- **Religious and Cultural Narratives:** The foundation of antisemitism was laid in religious rivalry. Centuries of Christian teaching that Jews were spiritually blind at best or satanic at worst imprinted a deep cultural bias that Jews were a malevolent \u201cother.\u201d This created an archetype of the Jew as godless, stubborn, even evil \u2013 a narrative that could easily be secularized later (e.g. the Nazi idea of Jews as a biological evil was essentially a racial rewrite of the old religious idea of Jews as a cosmic evil). Similarly, in the Islamic world, while theological antisemitism was less central historically, certain Quranic or hadith stories (like portraying some Jews as treacherous or cursed) could be dusted off in modern times to serve political ends. Because these religiously rooted images of Jews were woven into folklore, art, and collective memory, they give **antisemitism a long cultural inertia**. Even when overt religious belief waned, the stereotypes remained embedded in social attitudes, ready to be activated by demagogues. The **sheer longevity** of these myths \u2013 such as the blood libel or the greedy Judas trope \u2013 means they have been handed down across generations (sometimes unconsciously). This persistence is reinforced by the fact that **Jewish distinctiveness (as a minority maintaining its identity) was visible in many societies**, allowing prejudices to continually find a target. \n\n- **Social Dynamics of Scapegoating and Otherness:** A crucial reason antisemitism endures is that it serves a **social-psychological function: scapegoating**. In good times, Jewish neighbors might be tolerated or even respected; but in bad times \u2013 plague, war, economic collapse \u2013 societies have often looked for someone to blame. As a small, often successful minority, Jews were a ready scapegoat for majority populations. They were \u201cinside enough\u201d to be familiar yet \u201coutside enough\u201d to be seen as not truly loyal or aligned with the rest. Thus, when crises hit, rulers and populaces alike found it convenient to blame the Jews for misfortunes (be it the Black Death, a military defeat, or unemployment). Scapegoating Jews had the effect of **redirecting public anger away from authorities** onto a minority, and of reinforcing social solidarity among the majority at the expense of the outcast group\u301015\u2020L396-L401\u3011. This dynamic has replayed endlessly. Moreover, antisemitism confers on its believers a sense of **simplified understanding of complex problems**: it is easier to imagine a cabal of Jews causing an economic recession than to grapple with abstract fiscal factors. Such simplification through conspiracy gives psychological comfort (someone *must* be responsible for our suffering, and identifying an enemy feels empowering). Jews, with their historical image as secretive plotters (from the Protocols to QAnon\u2019s \u201cglobalists\u201d), fit that role in the public imagination. Another social aspect is pure **prejudice against otherness**: Jews in the diaspora often maintained different religious practices, languages, or customs, making them stand out. In times of rising ethnonationalism, this difference became intolerable to majorities seeking homogeneity. Whether in 15th-century Spain or 20th-century ultranationalist movements, the Jew as \u201cthe eternal outsider\u201d has been a convenient target to exclude in order to define the \u201ctrue\u201d national self. Even in today\u2019s polarized societies, where identity politics run strong, some view Jews as not quite fitting into neat categories \u2013 casting them again as suspect \u201cothers\u201d who can be accused of dual loyalty or elitism.\n\n- **Economic Myths and Envy:** Economic antisemitism has been a durable strand, evolving with the times. In medieval Europe, the association of Jews with moneylending and trade \u2013 roles forced on them by exclusion from agrarian life \u2013 generated envy and resentment. Debtors found it easier to hate their Jewish creditor than to repay the debt. Over time, this solidified into the stereotype of \u201cJewish greed\u201d and the myth that Jews collectively control wealth. In the modern era, as Jews became prominent in certain industries (banking, media, sciences), these achievements were twisted into evidence of a nefarious **Jewish financial cabal**. Classic examples include the fixation on the Rothschild banking family in 19th-century Europe, or on George Soros in the 21st century \u2013 conspiracy theories allege they puppet-master economies and governments\u301013\u2020L278-L286\u3011. During economic depressions or dislocations, these myths gain extra traction: populist leaders from **Hitler (in the Great Depression) to modern far-right politicians** in Europe have blamed Jewish \u201cglobal financiers\u201d for hardship, rather than complex systemic issues\u30102\u2020L300-L308\u3011. There is also a **paradoxical dual stereotype**: Jews have been vilified both as filthy paupers and as fabulously rich power-brokers, depending on what suited the prevailing prejudice. For instance, Nazis simultaneously depicted Jews as ugly, disease-ridden ghetto dwellers *and* as secret rich bankers \u2013 in both cases, an *undeserving* group usurping resources of the majority. This flexibility means whatever a society\u2019s economic anxiety, the narrative can adjust: too much capitalism? Blame Jewish bankers. Too much socialism? Blame Jewish Bolsheviks. Indeed, Jews have been accused of being behind both communism and capitalism\u30102\u2020L303-L311\u3011, a logical absurdity that underscores how antisemitism is **\u201cfree-floating\u201d blame** attachable to any economic grievance. In modern populist discourse we see echoes: the far-left might say \u201ccapitalist bankers in Wall Street\u201d (with an undertone pointing to Jews), while the far-right says \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d (often another code implying Jewish intellectuals) \u2013 both converging on the idea of Jews sabotaging the \u201chonest\u201d economy of the people. Thus, economic antisemitism persists because it feeds on perpetual resentments of inequality and modernization, offering an emotionally satisfying but false explanation: *some hidden Jewish hand is rigging the system*. This myth is **highly resilient** because it can never be conclusively disproven to those predisposed to believe \u2013 any prominent Jewish figure can be cited as \u201cevidence,\u201d while counter-evidence is dismissed as part of the cover-up. \n\n- **Geopolitical and Ideological Uses:** Antisemitism has repeatedly been **weaponized by political movements and leaders** to advance agendas. It\u2019s a kind of ideological \u201cglue\u201d that can bind together disparate discontents into a single sinister enemy. For the far-right, as noted, antisemitism is often a core tenet: white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and ultranationalists use it to rationalize a worldview where their nations or race are pure and noble but undermined by a cosmopolitan, globalist Jewish plot\u301013\u2020L253-L262\u3011\u301013\u2020L259-L268\u3011. Eric K. Ward argues that antisemitism is actually central to modern white nationalism \u2013 it provides the overarching theory that \u201cexplains\u201d why progressive social changes (civil rights, diversity) are happening: because Jews are supposedly behind it all\u301013\u2020L253-L262\u3011. This makes antisemitism a **unifying conspiracy theory** that can tie together various hatreds. We saw this when the American far-right rallying cry \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d explicitly became \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d \u2013 revealing the fear of white nationalists that Jews are engineering demographic change via immigration. Likewise, antisemitism often surfaces in **anti-government or anti-globalization movements** in the form of \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cNew World Order\u201d conspiracies\u301013\u2020L278-L286\u3011\u301013\u2020L288-L296\u3011. Such ideas originated in the notorious Protocols forgery but are now spread as memes about shadowy elites. Not only the far-right but also some anti-establishment movements on the left or libertarian spectrum end up borrowing this framework (e.g. the notion of a secret group controlling vaccine campaigns or banks often implicitly means Jews). On the **far-left and in certain Muslim political circles**, antisemitism is harnessed via anti-Zionism. Opposition to Israeli policies or Western imperialism sometimes bleeds into portraying Israel or Zionists (often read as *all* Jews) as the ultimate villains behind wars and oppression. For instance, Iran\u2019s theocratic regime uses Holocaust denial and anti-Zionist antisemitism to position itself as a leader of global resistance, deflecting criticism of its own failures by obsessively blaming Israel and \u201cworld Zionism\u201d for regional conflicts. Similarly, some Arab nationalist regimes historically pushed antisemitic propaganda to channel domestic frustrations outward \u2013 blaming internal issues on Zionist interference. These geopolitical uses **keep antisemitism alive as a political tool** because it\u2019s a catch-all theory that can energize populaces: it provides a grand enemy responsible for people\u2019s hardships, whether that\u2019s Western sanctions (blamed on Jewish influence) or local corruption (blamed on cosmopolitan elites). Antisemitism\u2019s adaptability to *both* far-right and far-left ideologies, as well as religious extremism, is arguably unique \u2013 few other prejudices have that cross-appeal. This adaptability means whenever a society (or faction) needs a scapegoat or an explanatory villain, **the Jew is available as the tried-and-true answer**, no matter if the rationale is theological, racial, economic, or anti-imperialist.\n\n- **Conspiracy Theory Culture:** Underlying many of the above is the appeal of conspiracy thinking. Antisemitism has survived because it essentially operates as a grand conspiracy theory that can **absorb new \u201cevidence\u201d and morph**. It has a self-sealing quality: if a Jew is successful, it\u2019s proof of the conspiracy; if a Jew is impoverished, it\u2019s also somehow part of the conspiracy (playing the victim, etc.). As the Southern Poverty Law Center observes, *\u201cthe persistence of antisemitism is due in part to its adaptability,\u201d* letting conspiracists redirect it toward various targets and movements\u301015\u2020L373-L381\u3011. For example, in recent years some anti-LGBTQ extremists have bizarrely started blaming Jews for promoting gay rights or gender equality \u2013 an entirely new twist claiming a Jewish plot to undermine societal norms\u301015\u2020L373-L381\u3011. Signs at certain protests have read \u201cJews run the pedo agenda\u201d or \u201cJudaism allows child rape,\u201d absurdly attempting to link Jewish people to unrelated culture-war issues\u301015\u2020L373-L381\u3011\u301015\u2020L375-L383\u3011. This highlights how antisemitism can latch onto whatever moral panic or conspiracy is in vogue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were instances of online forums accusing Jewish elites of inventing or spreading the virus for profit. No matter the crisis, the template of \u201chidden Jewish malice\u201d can be reapplied. This conspiratorial elasticity makes antisemitism frighteningly resilient \u2013 it **thrives on irrationality and emotional narratives**, which are hard to dislodge with reason. Moreover, in the internet era, such content spreads at lightning speed and often without context, reaching individuals who might not encounter overt antisemitism in daily life but get drawn in through other conspiracy communities. As a result, one can find antisemitism popping up in unlikely places: New Age wellness influencers blaming \u201cRothschilds\u201d for 5G towers, or hip-hop artists spewing borrowed antisemitic tropes about Jews and the slave trade (as happened with some public figures influenced by Nation of Islam\u2019s propaganda)\u301015\u2020L381-L389\u3011. \n\nIn essence, **antisemitism endures because it is protean \u2013 constantly able to reinvent itself** to fit new situations. It is best understood not as a single prejudice but as a *framework for channeling a society\u2019s anxieties and hatreds toward Jews*. Each era has supplied a different excuse: religious heresy, racial impurity, economic exploitation, political subversion. Yet the portrayal of Jews as dangerously powerful, alien, and malign has remained remarkably constant beneath those surface excuses. This continuity explains why antisemitism can **resurface even in societies that have few or no Jews** (for instance, anti-Jewish conspiracy theories in Japan or Malaysia, which have negligible Jewish populations but still import the narratives). It exists independently of real Jewish people \u2013 an imagined Jew, an archetype onto which fears are projected. \n\nFinally, antisemitism\u2019s persistence is also self-fueling: it has endured so long that it has a vast library of literature and iconography that new generations of haters can draw upon. Holocaust deniers, for example, piggyback on decades of prior anti-Jewish writings. Extremist groups find that **antisemitic propaganda effectively galvanizes recruits** by offering a simple \u201cenemy\u201d to fight. Even when hate is driven by other factors (racism against other minorities, for example), antisemitism often tags along, because it is the \u201cglue\u201d that ties various prejudices into a worldview\u301013\u2020L301-L309\u3011. White supremacists link antisemitism to anti-Black and anti-immigrant hatred by arguing Jews are behind civil rights and immigration; Islamist extremists link antisemitism to anti-Western resentment by arguing Jews control Western policy. In each case, attacking Jews rhetorically becomes a way to attack a broader set of opponents. \n\nIn summary, **antisemitism has proven so persistent because it is adaptable, useful to powerful interests, and deeply rooted in cultural narratives**. It provides scapegoats in crisis, conspiracy in chaos, and an enemy \u201cother\u201d in times of growing nationalism or populism. These factors have ensured that across eras \u2013 whether in medieval Europe, Nazi Germany, or the digital 21st century \u2013 antisemitism finds fertile soil. The recent rise of antisemitism is a stark reminder that these old mechanisms are still at work and can intensify rapidly under the right conditions.\n\n## Conclusion  \nAntisemitism\u2019s tragic journey from ancient prejudices to modern extremist ideologies demonstrates how tenacious and mutable this hatred is. We have seen that antisemitism is **not a relic consigned to the past**, but a living phenomenon that has merely changed costumes over time. In the 20th century, humanity witnessed the devastating culmination of unchecked antisemitism in the Holocaust \u2013 an event that led many to vow \u201cNever Again.\u201d Yet in the 21st century, antisemitism is resurging in worrying ways, from street attacks and synagogue shootings to the wildfire spread of conspiracy theories accusing Jews of today\u2019s troubles. This **global uptick in antisemitism** comes at a time of rising polarization, economic uncertainty, and rapid social change \u2013 conditions under which history warns that minority groups like Jews become targets. Indeed, the persistence of antisemitism serves as a barometer of broader social ill-health: it signals the spread of irrational fears, the erosion of pluralistic values, and the willingness of people to abandon truth in favor of myth.\n\nUnderstanding *why* antisemitism persists is the first step in combating it. As this analysis has shown, antisemitism persists because it is useful \u2013 to demagogues seeking power, to mobs seeking someone to blame, to ideologues weaving grand theories. It persists because it is **adaptive** \u2013 recycling old tropes in new formats and exploiting each era\u2019s anxieties. And it persists because it has been **normalized over centuries** \u2013 baked into religious lore, national myths, and now Internet subcultures, making it perilously easy for new adherents to pick up the torch of hate. \n\nChallenging antisemitism, therefore, requires a multi-dimensional effort. It means education to undo age-old canards and teach historical truth (for example, debunking the *Protocols* lie and raising awareness that anti-Jewish riots and libels have *real* victims). It means interfaith and intercultural dialogue to erode the religious and social barriers that cast Jews as \u201cother\u201d. It means leaders and institutions **unequivocally condemning antisemitism** whether it comes from the far-right, far-left or elsewhere, instead of indulging it for political gain. Encouragingly, after recent spikes in antisemitic incidents, many communities have rallied in solidarity with their Jewish neighbors \u2013 such as the 2018 Paris march commemorating Mireille Knoll\u2019s murder, or interfaith gatherings after the Pittsburgh shooting. These responses show that while antisemitism is persistent, so too is the resolve of many to oppose it.\n\nUltimately, antisemitism is often called *\u201cthe longest hatred\u201d* not only because of its age but because it represents a fundamental challenge: the ability of human societies to reject baseless hatred and embrace empathy and facts. Its current resurgence is a warning sign. If antisemitism is left unchecked, it endangers not only Jews but the **health of democracy and civility** itself, as history has repeatedly demonstrated\u30105\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Conversely, fighting antisemitism strengthens the bulwarks against all forms of bigotry. In the words of an old teaching: \u201cWhat starts with the Jews does not end with the Jews.\u201d Antisemitism may begin by targeting Jews, but it eventually poisons the wider society with division and violence\u30102\u2020L341-L347\u3011. Therefore, confronting antisemitism in all its forms \u2013 religious, social, economic, and political \u2013 remains an urgent task. By shining a light on its origins and mechanisms, as we have done in this report, we equip ourselves with knowledge to debunk and defuse it. History shows what can happen when antisemitism goes unchallenged; our collective responsibility is to ensure that history does not repeat itself. Only through vigilance, education, and solidarity can we hope to finally relegate this \u201coldest hatred\u201d to the past. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- United States Holocaust Memorial Museum \u2013 *\u201cWhy the Jews?
