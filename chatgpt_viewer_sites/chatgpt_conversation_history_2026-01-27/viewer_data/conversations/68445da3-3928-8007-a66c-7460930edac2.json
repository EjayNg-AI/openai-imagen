Can you decipher and explain what he did in detail?\n\n---\n\nThis was also by far the most promising method, and it seemed like it was my only real option, so I decided to give it a try. I just went ahead and jumped right into it. The first thing I did was go over to my solvent cabinet and pull out my DMSO. I started pouring about 200 mL of this solvent into a large flask, and when it was all loaded in, I turned on the stirring. After that, I lowered in a little tube that was attached to my argon tank and started shooting in argon to push out all the air. I don\u2019t think this was absolutely necessary, but at the same time, this reaction was going to produce a lot of hydrogen gas, and I was kind of paranoid that it could mix with the air in the flask and potentially explode.\n\nWith that being said, the flask was now full of argon, and what I had to do next was add the first main ingredient, which was a bunch of white powder. This was something called sodium borohydride, which is a strong reducing agent, and very soon, this was the stuff that would be releasing the hydrogen. Right now, though, it was still relatively tame, and when it was eventually all added, I let it stir for about ten minutes just to give it some time to dissolve. When I eventually felt that it was looking good, I went and got the second main ingredient, which was 9.66 grams of my beautiful acetic acid, and I started to slowly add it.\n\nThis almost immediately caused there to be a bunch of bubbling, along with a pretty clear fizzing sound, and this was because the acetic acid was reacting with the sodium borohydride and releasing some of that hydrogen gas that I mentioned earlier. More importantly, though, it was supposed to be forming an intermediate known as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, which right now might not look like anything useful, but it would be very important in a bit. Also, I should mention that the 9.66 grams I was using here was only around 10% of the acetic acid that I had, and this is because at this point I still had absolutely no idea if this reaction actually worked, and I was too scared to risk more than this.\n\nBut anyway, once I had added everything, I again had to let it stir for several minutes to make sure it all fully reacted. While this was happening, I had to prepare the next major ingredient. To do this, I started by adding an addition funnel above the flask. With this in place, I then went and got another chemical called methanesulfonic acid, and I added 53.88 grams of this syrupy liquid into the funnel. On top of this, I also added another 200 mL of DMSO, which easily mixed with it\u2014except, in theory, I probably shouldn\u2019t have been adding a solvent to an acid. I mean, in this case, I knew it would be fine, but that can\u2019t always be assumed, and for example, if I had done this with sulfuric acid and water, it probably would have boiled and potentially sprayed out of the funnel.\n\nEither way, once it was all mixed, I sealed the top with a stopper, and now I was ready to make some ethanol. I just went over to the valve on the addition funnel, and I very carefully opened it to dropwise add the methanesulfonic acid. Almost immediately, I could see that it was reacting. This was because there were a bunch of very small bubbles that quickly appeared, which was all hydrogen gas that was forming as the acid attacked the sodium borohydride. As far as I know, though, this was mostly just a side reaction, and what I actually wanted the acid to do was catalyze a reaction between the sodium borohydride and the sodium triacetoxyborohydride that I made earlier.\n\nThe paper itself, unfortunately, didn\u2019t give any details about this reaction, but what I think is likely is that the sodium borohydride was splitting apart the sodium triacetoxyborohydride and turning it into something called acetaldehyde. This was then probably getting attacked again by the sodium borohydride, which would be reducing it even further and hopefully turning it into some amazing ethanol.\n\nOverall, I thought that this was all pretty exciting, except what did concern me was that the paper also didn\u2019t give any real details about the reaction process itself, and unfortunately, even though it was still very early on, it was looking like it was going to be a temperamental one. This is because, after barely adding any acid, it was already warming up, and at this point, it was getting up to around 40\u00b0C. It was also looking like it was slowly getting foamier and foamier, which would only get worse as it heated up, and I was definitely going to have to cool it down. So I just quickly added a large dish under the flask and filled it with a bunch of water, and this very quickly brought the temperature down to around 15\u00b0C, which I was very happy to see. This is because the crisis seemed to be over, and even though it was still bubbling, it appeared to be much more controlled.\n\nNow I figured that I just had to add the rest of the acid, so that was exactly what I did. What I thought was really interesting was that as I added it, the reaction seemed to go through a few different phases. For example, for some reason, despite the cooling, it all started getting frothier and frothier again\u2014except right when I started getting concerned that it might eventually foam out of the flask, it all suddenly thinned out. This then made me think that I was basically in the clear and that I was past the worst of it, but then it suddenly started thickening way worse than before, and it actually ended up completely freezing. At the same time, it was also slowly puffing up, which was very concerning\u2014except it again just suddenly started thinning out, and it wasn\u2019t long before it completely liquefied.\n\nThis constant back and forth, though, made it so that I absolutely didn\u2019t trust it anymore, and I became constantly worried that at some point it could just start foaming uncontrollably\u2014except that thankfully never happened. This is because it actually ended up being super tame, and when I eventually added the last bit of acid, I was left with a nice and slightly gray solution.\n\nAt this point, though, the reaction wasn\u2019t quite done yet, and I was going to have to let it stir like this for a bit longer. So while I was waiting, I went and got a beaker and added about 180 mL of water. After that, I dumped in 20 grams of sodium hydroxide drain cleaner, turned on the stirring, and waited for it to fully dissolve. When this eventually happened, I had a nice and clear solution, and at this point it had been about 15 minutes, so I went back to my reaction, which now should have been done, and I started pouring all of this into it. This strongly basic solution was then quenching the reaction and destroying any sodium borohydride or acid that remained. For whatever reason, it also caused the whole thing to clear up quite a bit, and I started noticing little drops of something oily appearing on the side of the flask.\n\nBut moving on, what I had to do next was get all of the ethanol that I hopefully made out of this mixture of chemicals. According to the paper, this was also relatively easy, and apparently, all I had to do was some more distillations. So I just immediately got started with that by getting rid of the water dish, and then I quickly added a stopper, a fractional column, and another stopper, and I put together pretty much the same setup that I just did for the acetic acid.\n\nI then cranked up the heating, and it wasn\u2019t long before the first stuff started coming over at around 35\u00b0C, which I assumed was that oily junk that I saw before. More specifically, though, I was pretty sure that this was all something called dimethyl sulfide, which was supposed to be a major side product in this reaction. The only unfortunate part was that it was also supposed to smell absolutely horrible, but at such a low boiling point, I figured that it would be removed pretty easily. With that being said, I then just kept collecting it until the temperature suddenly started spiking, and when it eventually got to about 80\u00b0C, I swapped the flask for a fresh one. This was because at this point, if there were any ethanol in there, this was when it would start coming over.\n\nThe only tricky part was that it wasn\u2019t going to be coming over as pure ethanol, and it would instead be a combination of ethanol and water. This in turn meant that to get all of the ethanol, I was also going to have to collect all of the water that was in there, which was around 200 mL, and over the next couple hours, the volume in the flask slowly rose. At the same time, the amount in the main flask slowly went down, and with less and less water, a bunch of solid stuff started forming. This was all just junk from the reaction that was being left behind.\n\nGoing back to the other flask, though, it did eventually get to the point that it was around 200 mL, and right when this happened, I turned off the heating. I then quickly popped off the flask, and what I had now was, at least in theory, around 5% ethanol, which I thought was pretty exciting. However, just by looking at it and seeing all of the little oil drops that were still somehow floating around, it was obvious that I was going to have to clean it a bit more, so I decided to do another distillation\u2014except this time, I would use a much more efficient fractional column, which would hopefully give me a better separation of ethanol and water.\n\nI then just went ahead and cranked up the heating, and I basically did the same thing as before, where I rejected everything that came over below 80\u00b0C. The major difference this time, though, was that I wasn\u2019t going to be collecting all the water, and I was actually going to try to leave behind as much as possible by pulling off the flask the moment the temperature got to 100\u00b0C. So that was exactly what I did, and then I very carefully transferred everything that I got to a little vial, and at this point, I was pretty happy with how things were going. This was because, assuming that the reaction had worked, what I had now should have been relatively clean ethanol.\n\nTo fully confirm this, though, I was going to have to run it through my NMR, so that was what I did. Well, it told me that it wasn\u2019t super pure, but it was for sure ethanol. To get its concentration, I then did another test by putting a few drops of the ethanol onto something known as a refractometer, and when I looked into it, it told me that it was at least 80%, which was actually better than I expected. The only unfortunate part was that when I went to do the very necessary smell test, I was not very impressed. This is because instead of getting a nice and clean ethanol smell, it was almost unbearably sulfury, with a horrible rotten cabbage stench.

Reaction strategy in one sentence  \nGenerate **borane-dimethyl-sulfide (BH\u2083\u00b7DMS, \u201cBMS\u201d) in situ** from NaBH\u2084 + methanesulfonic acid in DMSO, then let that borane reagent reduce acetic (ethanoic) acid all the way to ethanol.  \n\n*Why this works:* NaBH\u2084 itself is far too mild to touch a carboxylic acid \u2014 it stops at aldehydes/ketones \u2014 but borane smoothly hydroborates the \u2013COOH group and, after hydrolysis, gives the primary alcohol.\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  Step-by-step breakdown\n\n| Step & observations | What\u2019s really happening chemically |\n|----|----|\n| **A. Charge 200 mL anhydrous DMSO, purge with Ar.**<br>Argon blanket + large headspace because he expects H\u2082 evolution. | DMSO is an aprotic solvent that keeps NaBH\u2084 \u201calive\u201d long enough to react with the added acid. Ar removes O\u2082/H\u2082O that would destroy borane and reduces explosion risk from H\u2082. |\n| **B. Add \u201ca bunch\u201d of NaBH\u2084; stir to dissolve.** | NaBH\u2084 partially dissociates to BH\u2084\u207b/Na\u207a in DMSO, ready to act as both hydride source and borane precursor. |\n| **C. Add 9.66 g HOAc (\u22480.16 mol, <10 % of total substrate he owns).** Immediate fizz. | 3  HOAc + NaBH\u2084 \u2192 NaB(OAc)\u2083H (sodium triacetoxyborohydride, STAB) + 3 H\u2082\u2191.  STAB is stable in the medium and \u201cstores\u201d the acid, preventing runaway acidity for now. |\n| **D. Prepare *separately* 53.9 g methanesulfonic acid (MSA, 0.56 mol) + 200 mL DMSO in addition funnel.** | MSA is a strong, non-oxidising Br\u00f8nsted acid.  When it contacts NaBH\u2084 it protonolyzes it, releasing BH\u2083 and H\u2082.  The large DMSO dilution moderates the exotherm. |\n| **E. Add MSA/DMSO slowly at \u2264 40 \u00b0C, cool aggressively when foaming.**<br>Solution alternates between thin / frothy / thick / thin again. | Competing reactions:<br>1.  **NaBH\u2084 + MSA \u2192 BH\u2083 + NaMSO\u2083 + H\u2082** (exothermic).<br>2.  **BH\u2083 ligates DMS** (produced later) \u2192 BH\u2083\u00b7DMS.<br>3.  Minor: BH\u2084\u207b reduces DMSO \u2192 (CH\u2083)\u2082S (dimethyl sulfide, bp 37 \u00b0C), giving the cabbage odour and extra foaming.<br>4.  BH\u2083 begins reducing free AcOH or STAB \u2192 acetaldehyde \u2192 ethanol.  Viscosity swings reflect borate-gel intermediates and gas evolution. |\n| **F. After MSA addition complete, stir 10\u201315 min.** | Gives borane time to finish reducing AcOH.  Stoichiometry: one BH\u2083 equivalent can reduce one \u2013COOH (needs 3 H-). Nile Red probably used \u223c4\u20136 equiv BH\u2084\u207b overall (excess). |\n| **G. Quench with 20 g NaOH in 180 mL H\u2082O.** <br>Mixture clears; tiny oil droplets appear. | The base destroys leftover borane/borohydride and neutralises acids: **BH\u2083 + 3 OH\u207b \u2192 BO\u2083\u00b3\u207b + 3 H\u2082\u2191**.  Hydrolysis of any \u201cRCH\u2082OBH\u2082\u201d intermediates releases **ethanol** into the aqueous DMSO layer. |\n| **H. First distillation. 35 \u00b0C fraction (bad smell) \u2192 discard; 80 \u2013 100 \u00b0C heads/tails collected (~200 mL).** | 35 \u00b0C cut is (CH\u2083)\u2082S.  80 \u2013 100 \u00b0C cut is the **azeotrope of EtOH\u2013H\u2082O (\u224895 \u00b0C)**.  Solids left behind are borates, NaMSO\u2083, residual NaOAc, etc. |\n| **I. Second (fractionating-column) distillation; take 78\u201380 \u00b0C fraction until 100 \u00b0C.** | Removes more water, concentrates ethanol.  He stops before dragging much water across. |\n| **J. Analytical checks. \u00b9H-NMR = ethanol + small impurities; refractometer gives \u2248 80 % v/v EtOH; strong DMS odour persists.** | EtOH confirmed, but smell shows trace (CH\u2083)\u2082S and maybe DMSO.  80 % purity matches partial azeotrope break-up. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Key chemistry points & mechanisms\n\n1. **Borane generation**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{NaBH}_4 + \\text{CH}_3\\text{SO}_3\\text{H} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\text{BH}_3 + \\text{NaCH}_3\\text{SO}_3 + 2\\,\\text{H}_2\\uparrow\n   \\]\n\n   BH\u2083 instantly coordinates the available dimethyl-sulfide (formed by reduction of DMSO) to give the well-known **borane\u2013dimethyl-sulfide complex (BH\u2083\u00b7DMS)**, a commercial reagent for reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols.\ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201  \n\n2. **Reduction of acetic acid** (simplified):  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   &\\text{BH}_3\\cdot\\text{DMS} + \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} \\xrightarrow[]{\\,\\;}\\; \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2OBH_2 + \\text{DMS}\\\\\n   &\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2OBH_2 + 3\\,\\mathrm{H_2O/NaOH} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} + \\text{B(OH)}_3 + 2\\,\\text{H}_2\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n   The initial hydroboration forms a borate ester; alkaline hydrolysis in the quench step liberates ethanol.\n\n3. **Why STAB appears at the start**  \n   Making a small amount of sodium triacetoxyborohydride **buffers the medium**: STAB is tolerant of mild acids, so it prevents an immediate pH crash that would otherwise decompose all NaBH\u2084 before borane can form controllably.\n\n4. **Side-product formation**  \n   * **Dimethyl sulfide (DMS)**: NaBH\u2084/BH\u2083 reduces DMSO \u2192 DMS; volatile, flammable, stinks.  \n   * **Hydrogen gas**: large volumes; hence argon purge & no ignition sources.  \n   * **Borate salts/NaMSO\u2083**: non-volatile solids left in the pot.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Safety & practical assessment\n\n| Issue | Comment |\n|---|---|\n| **H\u2082 evolution** | Continuous; needs inert sweep or good ventilation to avoid explosive mixtures. |\n| **Dimethyl sulfide** | Low flash point (-38 \u00b0C), highly malodorous; labs stink for days if venting is poor. |\n| **Heat control** | BH\u2083 generation is strongly exothermic.  Cooling bath + slow acid addition are mandatory. |\n| **Work-up** | Large alkaline quenches generate more H\u2082; must be done cold and behind a shield. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Did he *really* \u201creduce acetic acid with NaBH\u2084\u201d?  \n\n*Technically, no.*  \nThe *reducing species* is **borane**, not sodium borohydride.  NaBH\u2084 is simply the precursor that, in the presence of a strong acid, *sacrifices itself* to release BH\u2083.  Once borane is present, the reaction is analogous to using commercial BH\u2083\u00b7THF or BH\u2083\u00b7DMS, reagents long known to reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols.  Under ordinary, neutral/basic conditions NaBH\u2084 alone still refuses to touch a \u2013COOH group.\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\nNile Red\u2019s procedure is a clever, scaled-down way to make and use borane without buying or shipping the pyrophoric commercial reagent.  For a hobbyist setup it worked impressively well: he obtained ~80 % ethanol in two distillations, at the price of a difficult odour and significant safety overhead.  In a professional lab one would normally:\n\n* Buy commercial **BH\u2083\u00b7DMS** (safer handling, predictable stoichiometry).  \n* Use an anhydrous ether/THF solvent to minimise DMSO reduction issues.  \n* Run at lower temperature (0\u201310 \u00b0C) and add the acid substrate **after** borane formation to improve yield and purity.\n\nStill, the experiment nicely demonstrates how in-situ borane generation turns \u201cweak\u201d NaBH\u2084 into a far more potent carboxylic-acid-to-alcohol reducer."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue202turn9view0\ue201","start_idx":592,"end_idx":621,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Sodium borohydride - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"title":"Borane dimethylsulfide - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn9view0\ue201","start_idx":3908,"end_idx":3925,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Borane dimethylsulfide - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":9,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"\ue200cite\ue202turn11view0\ue201","start_idx":5937,"end_idx":5955,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride"],"refs":[],"alt":"([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Sodium borohydride - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":6748,"end_idx":6748,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Sodium borohydride - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride","attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borane_dimethylsulfide","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_borohydride"],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"harvard.edu","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://myers.faculty.chemistry.harvard.edu/file_url/128?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"[PDF] Chem 115 - Andrew G Myers Research Group","snippet":"Borane is commonly used for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters, lactones, amides, halides and other functional groups.

Let\u2019s analyze the likely causes in detail:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Strongly Exothermic Reactions**\n- **NaBH\u2084 + Methanesulfonic Acid (MSA) \u2192 BH\u2083 + H\u2082**\n  - This acidolysis liberates *large quantities of hydrogen gas* rapidly and is **strongly exothermic**.\n- **Borane Reduction of Acetic Acid**\n  - The hydroboration (borane addition to the carboxylic acid) is itself exothermic.\n- **NaBH\u2084 Reducing DMSO \u2192 (CH\u2083)\u2082S (Dimethyl sulfide)**\n  - Side-reaction with DMSO also releases heat.\n\n**Whenever a new portion of acid or acetic acid is added, a burst of heat is generated, causing the temperature to spike.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Gas Evolution and Viscosity Changes**\n- **Hydrogen gas bubbles** form as acid is added.\n- **Foaming/frothing**: Rapid gas evolution, combined with changing viscosity due to borate salt formation, creates uneven mixing and poor heat distribution.\n- **Viscosity swings**: Formation/dissolution of borate \u201cgels\u201d can temporarily trap heat or insulate layers, then suddenly liquefy as intermediates are consumed\u2014releasing trapped heat and appearing as a sudden drop or jump in temperature.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Poor Heat Dissipation and Mixing**\n- **Localized hot spots**: If stirring/mixing is insufficient, exothermic reactions in one region of the flask are not rapidly dispersed, causing local overheating that \u201cspills\u201d into the rest of the solution as mixing catches up.\n- **Surface cooling**: Addition of cold reagents, or rapid heat loss to the cooling bath, can momentarily drop the temperature, only for it to spike again as the reaction resumes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Phase Changes/Emulsion Formation**\n- **Gelation and thickening**: Formation of borate-polymer gels (borate \u201csludge\u201d) can trap gas and heat. When the gel suddenly breaks down or liquefies, gas and heat are released rapidly, swinging temperature down or up.\n- **Emulsification**: Tiny droplets (e.g., oily DMS) can form and destabilize, causing sudden shifts in how heat is distributed and released.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Incremental Addition vs. Reaction Rate**\n- If methanesulfonic acid is added faster than the system can dissipate heat, you see sudden, uncontrollable temperature rises (runaway exotherm).\n- When addition is paused or the cooling bath is effective, temperature can swing back down.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Cause                        | Temperature Up   | Temperature Down     |\n|------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Acid addition (exotherm)     | \u2191\u2191               |                     |\n| Hydrogen gas evolution       | \u2191                |                     |\n| DMSO reduction to DMS        | \u2191                |                     |\n| Gelation (insulates, traps heat) | \u2191 (local)      | (then \u2193 when released) |\n| Sudden liquefaction/phase break |                 | \u2193                   |\n| Cooling bath applied         |                  | \u2193\u2193                  |\n| Pause in acid addition       |                  | \u2193                   |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\nThe wild swings are **not just from one cause**, but from *the sum of rapid exotherms (acid+hydride, reduction steps), vigorous gas release (foaming), phase and viscosity changes (gelation/liqefaction), and the balance between heat generation and dissipation.*  \nIn practical terms: this is exactly why such reactions require *very slow addition rates*, *effective stirring*, *external cooling*, and *a large headspace* for gases.\n\n---\n\n**Critique**:  \nThis sort of erratic thermal behavior is typical of in-situ borane generation in polar solvents, especially with strong acid and high hydride load. In a process chemistry context, this is considered hazardous and would be engineered for precise temperature control, staged addition, and possible in-line quenching to avoid \u201crunaway\u201d or flash-foaming events.\n\nIf you want to discuss specific thermal profiles or mitigation, I can outline best practices for lab/scale-up."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-1","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-1","parent_id":"3194ce8a-b11e-4cee-9848-f6e07782661d","request_id":"94d9f1bf3d63f918-SIN","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3194ce8a-b11e-4cee-9848-f6e07782661d","children":[]}}}
