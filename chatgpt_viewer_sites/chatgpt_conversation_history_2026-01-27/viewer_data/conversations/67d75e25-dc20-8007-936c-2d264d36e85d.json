History shows exactly how this will shake out. I do have some good news, though.\r\nDavid Shapiro\r\nMar 16, 2025\r\nDuring the height of Russian imperial power, there was a cohort of people referred to as \u201csuperfluous men\u201d (\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a or lishniy chelovek). Russian aristocracy was structured in such a way that only the firstborn males of a family really had any purpose or function. They owned the property, enjoyed the privileges of the peerage, and had political functions. Second and third sons? Not so much.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Russia\u2019s political climate was quite dysfunctional, meaning that nobility and aristocrats had very little to do unless they were in the good graces of the imperial court. That meant that a lot of the landed gentry had little beyond their title and family wealth, but not much else to do.\r\n\r\nImagine that? Russia couldn\u2019t find anything useful for otherwise bored, educated men to do. Shocker, I know.\r\n\r\nBut what makes this interesting is that we can get a glimpse at what it\u2019s going to be like to be economically, socially, and politically irrelevant in the future by peering into the past.\r\n\r\nNow, before you think \u201cdamn Dave, you\u2019ve really drank the Doomer Kool-Aid\u201d I want to point out it that it\u2019s not all bad. Russian imperial life was actually a lot of fun, so long as you didn\u2019t cross the wrong people and get poisoned or stabbed. They had some the best parties in Europe, with the most booze, drugs, and beautiful women you could imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least the Russians knew how to party!\r\nChief among these debauched extraneous men was Prince Felix Yusupov, who was famously responsible for the assassination of Rasputin. Felix got up to all sorts of nonsense, and was famously extravagant, or \u201cextra\u201d as the kids say these days.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a bunch of rich, bored, scheming Russians sit around with nothing better to do?\r\n\r\nThey cause trouble.\r\n\r\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that all of society will devolve into pure hedonism and social jockeying\u2014not that this would be the worst thing in the world\u2014but there\u2019s a deeper current here, a soul-crushing problem of purposelessness.\r\n\r\nWhen you live in a society that has no use for, when you\u2019re trapped between your family title and meaningful participation, you just have to find ways to entertain yourself.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of my wife\u2019s friend, who spends a lot of time volunteering in prisons: \u201cPrison life is difficult precisely because you have a bunch of highly intelligent men with nothing better to do than make life hard for each other.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor some people, trolling really just is a way of life.\r\n\r\nWe already see this with internet culture, don\u2019t we? Terminally online people drowning in anxiety and directionlessness, lacking connection and support. What will all these people do with even more time on their hands?\r\n\r\nNot a pretty picture, right?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a crisis of meaning, purpose, mission, and most importantly, of connection.\r\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve got your attention with all this catastrophizing, here\u2019s the good news: this is actually a very easy problem to solve, in theory. Easier said than done, though.\r\n\r\nWhat does it take to make a human happy?\r\n\r\nThis is not a rhetorical question, or a trick question. If you ask a philosopher, like Nick Bostrom, you get a 600 page ramble called Deep Utopia. However, if you ask a psychologist, you might get a few different frameworks, like the famous (but useless) Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs.\r\n\r\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Needs Pyramid\r\nThis is famous only because of marketing. It is neither useful nor accurate.\r\nI\u2019m not saying that these are not \u201ctrue needs\u201d but what I am saying is that this \u201cstack\u201d is not particularly accurate empirically speaking, and as far as frameworks go, it\u2019s pretty useless because it does not offer prescriptions of how to actually be happy.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way: Russia\u2019s \u201csuperfluous men\u201d had the bottom four layers solved for them. Nobility, social status, family wealth, position in society. All the food and shelter they could need.\r\n\r\nWere they happy?\r\n\r\nWell, they certainly had their dopamine fix. But you don\u2019t create an entire literary trope called \u201csuperfluous men\u201d about a gaggle of happy, satisfied people. To be fair, are there any happy Russians? Maybe that\u2019s just an oxymoron\u2026\r\n\r\nDiagnosis? Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy is not helpful.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a far more useful framework that I\u2019ve used for a long time that is both scientifically validated AND prescriptive (i.e. \u201cjust follow these steps and you will be happier\u201d)\r\n\r\nThat framework is Roger Walsh\u2019s TLC (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes).\r\n\r\nTherapeutic Lifestyle Changes \u2013 Integral Health Resources\r\nThe TLC framework actually works.\r\nI\u2019m not going to bore you to death with the TLC framework. If you want to learn more, here\u2019s a Deep Research into it: https://chatgpt.com/share/67d6a185-ed24-800b-988a-43267bacb8ca (this is a thoroughly well researched, cited, and supported research paper, concocted entirely by OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research tool)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at some modern day \u201csuperfluous\u201d people: the internet celebrities like Bryan Johnson who \u201cmade it\u201d as entrepreneurs and can live as socialites. What do they do? They invent a new purpose. A new mission.\r\n\r\nBryan, of \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d fame, could have just rested on his laurels. He made mad bank as a tech founder and could have just lived out the rest of his days optimizing his health and dancing awkwardly at Burning Man.\r\n\r\nThe world has no prescribed place for someone like Bryan. No life path, no niche carved out for him saying \u201cAh, yes, this is now your station in life.\u201d\r\n\r\nWho is Bryan Johnson? 'Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever' Doc  Chronicles His Anti-Aging Routine - Netflix Tudum\r\nBryan Johnson found something that he could become psychotically obsessive about. This is your ikigai.\r\nHe faced the \u201cproblem of choice.\u201d The TLDR of this is that human brains don\u2019t do well with a blank page. Too many options results in analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nSo what did he do instead? He found something to give a shit about.\r\n\r\nThe paradox of freedom is that you can do anything, be anything, say anything, and think anything. But there\u2019s also no roadmap. There\u2019s no one book or coach or life plan that would work for you. You must be a trailblazer and forge your own path.\r\n\r\nRight now you might be thinking \u201cGee Dave, thanks, this clears it right up. Very helpful.\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve gone through the crucible of facing my own irrelevance. I saw the rise of AI and said \u201cI am going to get left behind.\u201d So I pivoted hard. I built a YouTube channel, and now a writing platform, sometimes working 16 hours a day to the point I had the weirdest neuralgia (my entire back went numb during one of my book writing sprints). I don\u2019t necessarily recommend this, but I found something I cared about obsessively.\r\n\r\nThe key is simple: go all in.\r\n\r\nThere is no substitute for passion, and unlike the Russian Imperial court, our Western society will not put shackles on you, saying \u201cstay in your lane, know your place, and just be happy there.\u201d China is doing that, and that is why China will never fully overtake the West.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I still get that comment, \u201cstay in your lane.\u201d It kind of amuses me. If I\u2019d \u201cstayed in my lane\u201d my entire life, I\u2019d still be in IT infrastructure automation, miserable, angry, depressed, and sick. Never allow other people to project their limitations onto you.\r\n\r\nJudd Apatow, Michael Bonfiglio Dissect Legend George Carlin's Career\r\nThe older I get, the more I understand George Carlin. As much as he said \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit\u201d he actually cared a lot. He just found a wry, sardonic delivery vehicle.\r\nMy boy George once said \u201cI don\u2019t have pet peeves, I have psychotic fuckin\u2019 hatreds!\u201d This is the kind of full-tilt passion I\u2019m talking about.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve started seeing more and more questions and comments out there in my audience along these lines. They go something like this, \u201cI\u2019m bored, listless, and I have no idea what to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nWelcome to the problem of choice, friend. Welcome to staring down the barrel of the existential shotgun known as \u201cyou are irrelevant!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut guess what? You always were irrelevant. You just woke up to the fact because you\u2019re no longer scrambling to make ends meet. Even if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re barely treading water, you probably understand, deep in your soul, that the entire world is going to change, and that scares the ever-living shit out of you. You recognize that your current way of life is unraveling and it will come to an end. But how? When? And what exactly will change?\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Void!\r\n\r\nThis is what I call Postnihilism. The revelation that you were always irrelevant, the world never needed you, and you never actually had any responsibility except that which you accepted and wore because society told you to.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world is broken. It will be for a long time. Probably forever. Go fix something. You\u2019ll never be bored, you\u2019ll make friends and enemies, and most importantly, you will have purpose.\r\nI differentiate Nihilism (which says that it\u2019s all meaningless and always will be) from Postnihilism by asserting that the Nihilistic Crisis is actually a short-term thing, and that people like Nietzsche actually failed to get through the crisis. Many people get bogged down in the hopelessness, despair, and end up focusing on things like money, wealth, and power. The fact that Nietzsche saw power as its own end, as the only thing worth striving for, is proof positive that he never figured it out.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll close out with an evisceration of Nietzsche and the optimistic nihilist outlook:\r\n\r\nNietzsche mistook the mechanism for the meaning, trapped in the very nihilistic crisis he so eloquently diagnosed. His personal suffering\u2014the migraines, the isolation, the unrequited loves\u2014colored his philosophical vision until power became not just his answer but his entire framework. The will to power seemed to him both the means and the end, the Alpha and Omega of human existence. Yet power itself is merely a tool, a mechanism through which meaning might be expressed, not the meaning itself.\r\n\r\nWhat Nietzsche failed to see while squinting through his pain-clouded vision was that matriculating through nihilism requires more than merely identifying its presence. He recognized the abyss but never truly crossed it. Instead, he built his philosophical home on its edge, peering down and declaring that the only response was to seize power in a meaningless cosmos. This stance bears the mark of someone who remained trapped in crisis rather than transcending it.\r\n\r\nThe \u201coptimistic nihilists\u201d who followed made a different but equally incomplete journey. They saw the void of inherent meaning and celebrated their freedom to assign arbitrary significance to anything. They declared themselves gods of their own mini-universes, creating meaning through sheer force of will. This approach contains a kernel of truth but misses the deeper reality that meaning cannot simply be manufactured in isolation.\r\n\r\nWhat both Nietzsche and his optimistic successors missed is that meaning emerges primarily through connection. We find purpose not merely in what we decide to care about individually, but in the web of mutual vulnerability we share with others. The most profound meaning comes from mattering deeply to your tribe\u2014those six to twenty close friends and family who know you, see you, and need you. These mutualist relationships create a context where your existence is necessary to others in tangible, daily ways.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that Nietzsche, who wrote so much about masks and social performances, never fully grasped that meaning lives in the space between people. Perhaps his isolation prevented him from experiencing the simple truth that when someone truly needs you to show up\u2014and you need them in return\u2014nihilism loses its sting. Caring about something might begin the journey out of nihilism, but mattering to someone completes it.\r\n\r\nThe more I gave a shit about AI and humanity, the more a tribe formed around me.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Have the moral courage and energetic conviction to give a shit. Build a tribe. You\u2019ll be fine.\r\n\r\nPS. If you \u201cdon\u2019t care about anything\u201d then focus on what you\u2019re afraid of. What are you too afraid to care about because it feels too big or out of reach? Start there.

Central Thesis and Argument Structure:**\nDavid Shapiro\u2019s article presents a thought-provoking argument that explores the concept of irrelevance in the face of rapid technological (particularly AI-driven) changes. The author draws a historical parallel with the Russian \"superfluous men\" of the imperial era, individuals who had resources and education but lacked meaningful roles within society, leading to boredom, decadence, and destructive behaviors. He argues modern individuals may similarly face irrelevance due to AI-driven automation. However, he suggests a constructive solution rooted in building meaningful connections (\"tribes\") and purpose-driven communities.\n\n---\n\n## Strengths of the Article:\n1. **Engaging Metaphorical Framework:**  \n   Shapiro uses historical analogy effectively. By invoking the idea of Russian aristocrats as an example of educated yet idle individuals, he connects historical irrelevance to the contemporary condition of existential purposelessness amplified by AI automation.\n\n2. **Insightful Criticism of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy:**  \n   The article compellingly critiques Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy as empirically weak and non-prescriptive. This insight is valuable as it challenges popular psychology frameworks and pushes the reader to reconsider common perceptions about human happiness and self-actualization.\n\n3. **Proposition of Postnihilism:**  \n   The author introduces the innovative philosophical concept \"Postnihilism,\" defined as recognizing one\u2019s inherent irrelevance yet finding meaning through deliberate choice and interpersonal connections. This is insightful, fresh, and effectively contrasted against Nietzsche\u2019s perspective, which Shapiro convincingly argues is incomplete and crisis-bound.\n\n4. **Engaging and Personal Tone:**  \n   The article is written in an engaging, conversational style, employing humor, cultural references, and self-awareness (e.g., references to George Carlin, personal anecdotes about the author\u2019s pivot in response to AI developments). This makes complex philosophical and psychological discussions accessible and engaging.\n\n5. **Practical Prescriptions:**  \n   Unlike purely philosophical or abstract critiques, Shapiro offers clear prescriptions\u2014find something meaningful to care about, cultivate genuine human connections, build community (tribe), and proactively seek a sense of purpose and relevance in one\u2019s life.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Superficial Treatment of Historical Context:**  \n   While the Russian analogy is intriguing, Shapiro\u2019s use of historical examples (such as Prince Felix Yusupov) is brief and shallow. The analogy would be stronger with deeper historical context or clearer parallels, preventing the impression that the author cherry-picked entertaining historical anecdotes without sufficient depth.\n\n2. **Limited Examination of Technological Impact:**  \n   Although the central premise involves AI-driven disruption, the article lacks rigorous exploration of how AI specifically generates irrelevance. Clearer examples of which sectors or roles will be rendered irrelevant by AI would solidify the urgency and relevance of his warnings.\n\n3. **Insufficient Engagement with Alternative Views:**  \n   Shapiro dismisses alternative frameworks (Maslow, Nietzsche, \"optimistic nihilists\") somewhat cursorily, without extensive engagement or counterarguments. While the critique is strong rhetorically, a more balanced approach exploring their insights could enrich the analysis.\n\n4. **Simplified Psychological Prescriptions:**  \n   While the recommendation to embrace Roger Walsh's Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) is valuable, it is mentioned but inadequately explored. Readers unfamiliar with TLC would benefit from at least a brief overview of its components directly within the article, rather than relying solely on an external resource.\n\n5. **Overly Generalized Conclusion (Finding a Tribe):**  \n   The conclusion, encouraging readers to \"build a tribe\" and passionately engage with meaningful pursuits, risks oversimplification. Building meaningful connections and finding purpose in reality can be much more challenging, particularly in economically unstable or politically uncertain contexts\u2014factors the author largely overlooks.\n\n---\n\n### **Forward-thinking Considerations:**\n\n1. **Potential Societal Impact:**  \n   Shapiro's hypothesis about growing societal irrelevance due to AI has significant merit. As AI increasingly displaces knowledge-based jobs (not just manual labor), the crisis of purpose he describes may become a widespread social issue requiring serious policy, economic, and educational responses.\n\n2. **Need for Socio-economic and Policy-Level Solutions:**  \n   The analysis remains largely individualistic. A forward-thinking response would integrate policy-level discussions such as universal basic income, job retraining programs, or systematic efforts at community building and social engagement to mitigate the impacts described.\n\n3. **Broader Ethical Concerns:**  \n   The discussion hints at broader ethical questions concerning human dignity, identity, and social structure in an AI-driven society. Addressing these explicitly would add valuable depth.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\nDavid Shapiro's article is compelling and provocative, effectively diagnosing existential malaise tied to technological displacement. His proposal of Postnihilism as a solution is intriguing and potentially transformative on an individual scale. However, it lacks depth in historical, technological, and psychological dimensions, and its overly simplistic recommendations may not be sufficient for real-world implementation without additional support structures. Nonetheless, it is a valuable contribution to discussions on existential threats posed by technological disruption and a meaningful step toward a holistic, humane response to the challenges of AI-driven social irrelevance."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-4-5","parent_id":"a251fcb4-17dd-4b71-8e53-cb02c049f443","request_id":"9218056ffda1481c-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a251fcb4-17dd-4b71-8e53-cb02c049f443","children":[]}}}
